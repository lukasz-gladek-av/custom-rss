			<p>Launching nearly seven years after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/">launch of the original</a> title in a new Soulslike franchise, <strong>Code Vein II</strong> elevates the narrative to a time-traveling open world narrative still rife with vampires and the Revenant Hunters who aim to put them in their place. We recently sat down to see all that Magmell Island and beyond have to offer in Code Vein II from <strong>Bandai Namco Studios</strong> and former God Eater development alumni.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Lavinia-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As mentioned in our earlier preview for Code Vein II, despite being a numbered entry, this story is by and large standalone from the first game. It’s still a post-apocalyptic world filled with vampires, the same sort of weapons and gear, and progression linked to modifying one’s potential through equipping <strong>Blood Codes</strong> (Blood Veils in the first title), despite being the type of hunter that’s tasked with slaying vampires. The world has already fallen into disrepair from a variety of maladies and blights, the most recent of which is a calamity known as the <strong>Resurgeance</strong>. During this event, living beings around the world were twisted and disfigured into beings known as Horrors. To seal this plague away, five great Revenants sacrificed themselves to seal away the Resurgence and lock themselves away in Cocoons while history remembers their sacrifices as heroes of the world. Now, as the seals begin to weaken, the player Revenant Hunter has to break open these Cocoons and slay the Heroes who have since been misshapen by the same calamities they aimed to lock away for good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where Code Vein II’s unique hook comes into play. By utilizing the power of the player’s eternal partner, Lou, of whom they each share half a heart, they can journey back into the past one hundred years and ally themselves with the Heroes before the Resurgence even has a chance to go off. While the destruction itself may be set in stone, players can choose whether to ally themselves with the Heroes and complete a personal quest for each, thus securing them as a lifelong partner. Of Code Vein II’s three different endings, it comes down to just how many of these partners the player is willing to change history for.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Fifth-Hero-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Code Vein II’s challenge lies not with persevering against smart and intelligent horrors in the world, but with how punishing they can be against the misstep of the player. There are three ways to mitigate or prevent damage in Code Vein II on top of specific weapon skills that can also nullify damage: blocking, parrying (which mistiming the parry still results in a block if done in time), and evading with a quick dash. The issue with blocking in Code Vein II is due to the massive stamina consumption needed to withstand a hit. Perfectly timing the block reduces the impact, yes, but at that point, wouldn’t you be better off parrying instead? Enemies tend to have long attack strings, especially with the militaristic types with weapons matching the player’s arsenal, which can overwhelm even the heartiest of builds.</p>



<p>Combat in Code Vein II is all about using those precious <strong>Gifts</strong>, using <strong>Ichor</strong> extracted from enemies for your main source of damage, while basic attacks are more about being supplementary once you get the hang of combat. To refill your Ichor to power your abilities, it’s all about draining that resource from enemies (while one blood code in particular does give you back Ichor for regular attacks) by using aptly named Drain Attacks. These utilize a special wearable bit of gear called a <strong>Jail </strong>to harvest that resource from enemies with a variety of special attacks, ranging from simple gauntlet grabs to laying down spike traps to my personal favorite: sending out a swarm of bats to passively suck Ichor out of enemies and return it to the player. Only one Jail can be equipped at a time and set to the R2 button, but whichever you choose will be a core part of combat.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Holly-Combat-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Players only have access to four Gifts equipped at a time, and this includes a combination of temporary passive boosts as well as attacking Gifts, limiting the potential of some builds. I found myself opting for one evasive/defensive maneuver, one attacking Gift (namely a jumping slash that could also evade enemy attacks), and two passive Gifts: one to increase damage done and the other to reduce damage taken. Depending on which Blood Code you equip, you may be limited in the amount of Gifts you can equip at a time, as well as the Ichor available to cast those Gifts (in addition to actual defensive stats). Another perk to sticking with a Blood Code for a while is that with enough mastery, players can speak with a particular NPC once proficiency is maxed out with that Blood Code and unlock a new passive boost to bring along on the adventure. Think of these like accessories that provide stat boosts or passive effects. Players can don up to four at a time, although there might be a secret way to unlock a fifth slot if players are truly dedicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stats are divided up across six core attributes based on the player’s current Blood Code and passive Boosters. Each equipped weapon and Gift takes stock of the player’s attributes, and this is where the Burden system comes into play in Code Vein II. Rather than assigning a weight to your rolls based on how much encumbrance the character is undergoing, it’s about the total cost of abilities equipped versus the attributes of a given Blood Code. If players can keep all of their burden costs under half of each particular stat, that unlocks what would typically be the Light rolls in a Soulslike. Going over half in a given attribute reduces the player to a Normal roll, and going over a particular stat burdens the player with the Slow roll. On top of that, each Blood Code has unique Trait perks depending on the Margin (unused amount) or Overburden (going over the cap) of a particular Attribute. Take Josèe’s various Blood Codes: on one, having a Margin of 8 in both Strength and Mind lets players gain Ichor from regular weapon attacks, while one of her other Blood Codes gives players an attack boost for pulling off a Perfect Dodge, but only if at least one of their stats is Overburdened. The mixture of available Attributes and Traits is something I found to be far more interesting as a system when it came to building a character than just looking at the defense stats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much like the first Code Vein, players can jump into New Game Plus once they finish the main campaign by way of a special green portal located back at Magmell Island. This is a one-way trip and puts players right at the beginning of the game, following where the character creator would typically be. This means every cutscene, every choice, and every collectible are left in the world to explore and acquire once more. The main differences this time around are in the amount of damage the enemies both endure and dish out to the player. During my second playthrough, I was at least level 170 and still dying in roughly three or four hits from everyday fodder enemies. By skipping cutscenes and rushing through the story with character levels intact and only aiming for the main objectives, Code Vein II can be finished in six-seven hours if you really push yourself and take advantage of fast travel and the motorcycle to get around.</p>



<p>My first playthrough was a bit less than forty hours to complete every quest I could find (opting *NOT* to restore bonds of the four heroes to get the bad and normal endings), followed by another ten hours of grinding to max out every Blood Code and pick up every health collectible around the world. There’s at least one that’s locked behind a quest that takes players into a specific dungeon as one of those bond quests, so don’t expect to get everything in one run unless you’re trying to aim for the best ending. That being said, since players carry everything over, including those precious health upgrades, players can just as easily pick up a few early health upgrades and use those to max out their recovery items.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Zenon.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Where Code Vein II fails to achieve its lofty ambitions is in the open world. There are some clear inspirations to Elden Ring in how players approach the open world, with only clear major points of interest being marked on the map and side diversions littered throughout. And yes, there are a great number of abandoned buildings and secret tunnels scattered throughout Magmell, so if players take the time to go off the beaten path once in a while, they’re sure to find some new dungeon or collectible scattered throughout. The issue is that in the downtime between these small dungeons, there’s an endless amount of repeated content with small enemies littered throughout, or gathering items that players will have piles and piles of if they stop to pick up every little shiny object on the ground. There’s a growing trend of Soulslikes hopping onto the Open-World train (Rise of the Ronin and Nioh 3 are recent examples) and while it doesn’t suffer from the lack of interesting dungeons of the former, Code Vein II bloats what would otherwise be some solid world design with a large map that doesn’t really justify the scope and scale with meaningful and interesting content.</p>



<p>By and large, Code Vein II is certainly an improvement from the original game in all but level design (only in part due to the open world focus here versus only tightly designed corridors and interconnected maps of the first game). The lack of co-op is also a sore spot here, but your AI companions can hold their own in a fight, so I don’t really lament the loss of summoning another player just for a single boss fight. If you have a masochistic streak and don’t mind facing off against fodder enemies that can slay you in a couple of hits, Code Vein II is the bloody hardcore action RPG worth starting your 2026 off.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Season 2 Is Finally Fixing Its Dumb Midnight Release Times]]></title>

            <guid>1416979</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve mostly enjoyed the second season of Amazon and Bethesda’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> TV show. One thing I hated about this new season, however, was that each new episode premiered at midnight. Thankfully, Amazon is changing this release schedule for the rest of the season.</p> <p>On January 26, Amazon Prime Video announced its plans to release the next (and final) two episodes of <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><em>Fallout</em></a> season two at 6 p.m. PT instead of midnight. Season two episode seven will now arrive on Tuesday, January 27, and episode eight will be available on Tuesday, February 3.</p>

 <p>“Good morning, Vault Dwellers!” posted Amazon on Twitter. “Due to strong participation and interest, we have amended the start times for the remaining Season Two presentations.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning, Vault Dwellers! Due to strong participation and interest, we have amended the start times for the remaining Season Two presentations. Episode Seven will now begin Tuesday, Jan. 27 at 6 p.m. PT, and Episode Eight will now begin Tuesday, Feb. 3 at 6 p.m. PT. Your… <a href="https://t.co/x1LhnwEsRL">pic.twitter.com/x1LhnwEsRL</a></p> <p>— FALLOUT⚡️ (@falloutonprime) <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime/status/2015832890433552799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While I’ve been a fan of the weekly rollout of <em>Fallout</em> season two, as it allows my friend group time to watch and then later chat about each episode at the same time as the internet, I really, really hated the midnight release time. It made it harder for sites to cover, made it more annoying for people to avoid spoilers the following morning, and didn’t really seem to have any benefit other than that some night owls got to watch the latest episode a bit earlier than everyone else. So I’m very happy with this change!</p>

 <p>In fact, it should work this way when <em>Fallout</em> season three arrives in the future. <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/fallout-season-2-season-3-prime-video">Amazon already confirmed a third season is on the way</a>, and I’ll be madder than a Deathclaw with a dart in its leg if the streaming giant decides to go back to midnight releases for that next round of episodes.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, if you haven’t been keeping up with <em>Fallout</em> season two but you are a big fan of the games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-brings-back-two-classic-pieces-of-the-franchise-2000661833">you should at least check out who showed up in a recent episode, as it’s a very cool surprise for longtime players.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Over the weekend my daughter came to me with a problem: One of her airpods wasn't as loud as the other. After asking her if she'd done some obvious first steps--had she disconnected and reconnected them, had she rebooted her phone, both of which got me a groan that said "<em>of course</em>"--I sat down with her to try to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>First stop was a Google search, which in 2026 brought up an AI-generated summary of some helpful advice, which read:</p><blockquote>If one AirPod is quieter, first&nbsp;check and adjust the&nbsp;<strong>Audio Balance slider</strong>&nbsp;in your iPhone's Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Audio/Visual to the center, then perform a deep clean of the speaker mesh on both AirPods, and if issues persist, try a full reset of the AirPods and restart your device.&nbsp;1. Check Audio Balance (Most Common Fix)&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Audio/Visual</strong>.</blockquote><blockquote>Find the&nbsp;<strong>Balance</strong>&nbsp;slider and ensure it's centered (at 0.00).</blockquote><blockquote>If it's off-center, move the slider towards the quieter AirPod to even out the volume.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>2. Clean Your AirPods</blockquote><blockquote>Remove the ear tips (for AirPods Pro).</blockquote><blockquote>Carefully inspect the speaker and microphone mesh on both AirPods for debris, earwax, or lint.</blockquote><blockquote>Gently clean them with a dry, soft-bristled brush or a cotton swab to remove blockages.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Not wanting to trust a predictive text system with delusions of grandeur, I checked the links those results were pointing towards, and because they were all Apple Support pages I went directly there for help. They...said the same thing, that's why Google had pulled those answers for the AI result.&nbsp; We tried all of them, right down to the cleaning, and none of them worked.</p><p>So I decided to ask the same question but point the search towards Reddit, and was given a post called "My left AirPod is much quieter than my right. How do I fix it?". That was <em>exactly</em> our problem, so I clicked the link, checked the top reply and it was someone saying..."Suck on the one with low sound".</p><p>User MarbledCats didn't say <em>where </em>to suck on it, but it looked like the bit with the speaker mesh that goes inside the ear was the only place that made sense, so I wiped the outside of it, closed my eyes, shut out the sound of my daughter saying "oh my God what are you <em>doing</em>" and sucked. Then I sucked again, just to be sure. To paint the picture of a grown man sucking on a tiny white plastic earbud, it wasn't a huge toke, just a couple of puffs. I had no idea why exactly I was doing this, what this was supposed to achieve or how it was all working, but MarbledCats had been upvoted for this advice, so it was worth a shot.</p><p>Wiping down the earbuds again--I felt bad for them, they were never designed for this kind of bodily fluid exchange--I handed them to my daughter,<a href="https://aftermath.site/cancel-spotify-wrapped-ai-ceo-apple-music/"> <u>she hit PLAY on Spotify</u></a> and hey. Problem solved. The volume was back, they were working perfectly, and she went away happy.</p><p>I'm still not sure what I actually <em>did</em>. Comments under MarbledCats' post suggested that the shock of a suck hitting those confined spaces would separate any wax or dirt that were sitting on the earbud's drivers--and which would have been covering them, muffling the sound–knocking them loose. Maybe that's the case, I don't know, all I know is that I followed the advice and it worked.</p><p>Perhaps the more pressing question you've got beyond how it worked is why did I follow that advice in the first place? Sucking on an earpod sounds like prank advice, gross shit, something a kid on Reddit would post just to fuck with me. But when I followed the link and saw responses like this, I just had to try it.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Add me to the list of people saying "wow I thought this was joke and it worked wtf". </span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It felt good to have fixed my kid's problem, sure, but it felt even better to have had yet another moment to cherish that despite tech's best efforts to cram AI into every facet of our lives against our will, in ways that make daily tasks pointlessly more difficult and in cases like this actively worse, a bunch of people had got together to try some weird shit and it worked, and were sharing that information for the benefit others, in a way the plagiarism lake boiling machine's best efforts could never.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Highguard</em>, the PvP “raid shooter” with phantom horses from former <em>Titanfall </em>devs, is out today. The road to this point has been long and winding, albeit only in terms of how it’s <em>felt </em>to traverse: Revealed as The Game Awards’ “one more thing” final trailer in December, <em>Highguard </em>proceeded to disappear into a month-long cloud of speculation and derision.&nbsp;</p><p>What was this generic-looking multiplayer game that dared to occupy a slot reserved, in viewers’ minds, for <em>Half-Life 3</em> or <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>? Details were scant bordering on nonexistent. Ragebaiters and clip farmers on X and YouTube feasted. <em>Highguard</em>, the narrative went, had doomed itself to being the next <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation/"><em><u>Concord</u></em></a>. As of today, we finally have an answer to the question of how <em>Highguard </em>actually plays – <a href="https://www.avclub.com/highguard-game-hands-on-preview?ref=aftermath.site"><u>decently enough, apparently</u></a> – as well as a greater understanding of how we ended up here in the first place. It didn’t have to be this way! But it also sort of did.</p><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Speaking with Kotaku</u></a>, Wildlight Entertainment co-founder Chad Grenier explained that the plan since “day one” had been to shadow drop the fantastical FPS, as it had worked out well for his previous project, <em>Apex Legends</em>. But then Geoff Keighley, an old friend, stepped in.</p><p>“We’ve known Geoff for a long time, and he said, ‘let me do something,’ that’s maybe a little risky in hindsight – but different, [to] take a free to play PvP Raid Shooter and do something with it,” Grenier said. “So we rushed a trailer together. I wish the reception had been better, but in hindsight we made a trailer to entertain really quickly, and didn’t show the gameplay loop, and what’s different and unique.”</p><p>Releasing your first game as an independent – although clearly well-funded – studio, who’d turn down that kind of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/hero-shooter-highguard-reportedly-didnt-even-pay-for-the-game-awards-slot-thats-earned-it-so-much-preemptive-hate-the-showrunners-thought-it-deserved-the-spotlight/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>free marketing</u></a>? Especially when your game is cannon-balling into a crowded genre rife with high-profile failures? In a previous era, it would have been a no-brainer, a gift horse you wouldn’t even think about looking in the mouth. But a confluence of modern and age-old factors quickly turned the tide against <em>Highguard</em>.</p><p>Much of the ensuing ugliness stemmed from the fact that Wildlight went radio silent following the initial Game Awards reveal. Those who expected a more traditional marketing campaign – a drip feed of character and map reveals, or even just a more elaborate trailer – got nothing, so they used their imaginations to fill in the blanks. In response, Wildlight decided to maintain course.</p><p>“We stayed silent because we knew that the first time, the next time that we say anything to the audience, it better be the game and let the game speak for itself,” Grenier told Kotaku.</p><p>Depending on how you measure it, this ended up being a mistake. I totally understand the allure of a splashy, <em>Apex Legends</em>-style shadow drop, but after doubling back and deciding to reveal the game shortly before release, you can’t really have it both ways. Moreover, the internet of now is very different from the internet of 2019. Covid transformed social media into an endless, awful conversation; once you pop, the horrors never stop. Debuting and then disengaging isn’t really an option – at least, not if you want to keep the vultures away. Recent years have only worsened this dynamic, with short-form video content taking over as the predominant mode of expression and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers/"><u>giving rise to a generation of caustic clip farmers</u></a> who yank at the udder of any perceived drama of the week until it’s chafed and bone dry. Then they move onto the next thing and deploy the same playbook again.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Highguard </em>got hit even harder than it otherwise might’ve due to the fact that, at least in games, December constitutes the dead of winter, and there wasn’t really a “next thing” for cynical, opportunistic content creators to monkey-bar over to. So one video became two, and then three, and four, and so on. With each passing week, continued silence from Wildlight functioned as additional evidence that something was amiss. The <em>Highguard </em>mystery, unfortunately, lent itself perfectly to sloptubers’ regular stream-of-videos approach.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>One example among many</span></figcaption></figure><p>And then there was the <em>Concord </em>of it all. While comparisons were clumsy at best – <em>Highguard </em>does not have major publisher backing, for one – the facts of a situation do not matter in the modern social media landscape. Feelings dictate people’s response, and they are easily and algorithmically manipulated. The rough outline of a situation similar to <em>Concord</em>’s was there, and that’s all content creators needed to whip portions of the internet into a frenzy: The Game Awards, in this case, functioned like Sony, an institution propping up a safe-looking hero shooter no one asked for.&nbsp;</p><p>Rage at the industry, misdirected or not, did the rest. Certainly, there is warranted fatigue around live service games emerging from the triple-A (or in Wildlight’s case, triple-A-adjacent) sector. Big, more traditional video game companies want a ladle full of the perpetual stew <em>Fortnite</em>,<em> League of Legends</em>, and a small handful of others have transformed into an infinite food supply, and in pursuit of that, they’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea/"><u>misused and abused</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea/"><u>once great</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny/"><u>studios</u></a> and released a series of duds like the aforementioned <em>Concord </em>– by no means a terrible game, but something so aggressively Fine that it failed to really grab anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>But right-wing sloptubers have repeatedly harnessed this energy to feed their endless culture wars, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service/"><u>claiming that diversity is the reason these games fail</u></a>. More than that, they <em>want </em>them to fail; they approach the prospect with a sort of knives-out glee. All of it fits their narrative that even with hundreds of thousands or millions of followers, they are the brave little guy(s) speaking truth to power amid an industry of shill-happy journalists and agenda-pushing developers. Within this framework, there is room to advance <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2015906199527686220?ref=aftermath.site"><u>conspiracies</u></a>, to present the industry as a series of shadowy cabals working against The Common Gamer (rather than a series of <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump/"><u>out-in-the-open cabals working against everyone except themselves</u></a>). Again, <em>Highguard</em>’s prolonged period of silence – after a push from Geoff Keighley, gaming’s self-appointed kingmaker – provided a perfect seed bed for those kinds of tall tales to take hold.&nbsp;</p><p>Facing down a truly nightmarish minefield, it’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/highguard-game-awards-marketing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>hard to fault</u></a> <em>Highguard</em>’s developers for opting to disengage from all the engagement bait. Arguably, there was no correct way to play this. Turn down an opportunity to get millions of eyes on your game during the biggest event of the year? No shot. Spin up a whole marketing campaign when your trailer was already a last-second effort? Basically impossible. Play whack-a-mole with conspiratorial nonsense ginned up by the usual sloptuber suspects? Would’ve almost certainly been used as additional fuel for the fire. Maybe a little good faith communication directly from the developers would’ve helped put faces to names and engender trust, but there’s no way to know – and the risk was obviously very high.</p><p>Regardless, <em>Highguard </em>now finds itself positioned awkwardly at the starting line, albeit well ahead of where many others begin. On one hand, you can’t deny that all of this free publicity bolstered the game’s player count, with its launch day numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>peaking at nearly 100,000 concurrents</u></a> (and hundreds of thousands more watching on Twitch and YouTube). That is… uncommon, for an indie shooter, to say the least. On the other, public sentiment is not great. <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Technical issues and performance problems</u></a> are being received even worse than they otherwise would be, and every design decision has been met with intense doom-and-gloom scrutiny – despite the fact that this is day one of a game meant to have a long tail. The game’s Steam reviews have cratered to “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/?ref=aftermath.site#app_reviews_hash"><u>mostly negative</u></a>.” Geoff is <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2015164852743065967?ref=aftermath.site"><u>running a weird sort of victory lap</u></a>, which probably isn’t helping matters. </p><p>Lending more credence to my assertion that the internet has decayed past the point of usefulness, meanwhile, is the fact that Guy "DrDisrespect" Beahm – a sad middle-aged man who dresses up like an even sadder middle-aged man and who in 2024 confessed to inappropriate DMs with a minor – <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-lies-about-being-invited-to-highguard-preview-event-2000663184?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">lied about attending a <em>Highguard </em>event last week</a>, going so far as to post an image of a fake badge. This led to outrage and controversy, followed by debunkings that, per <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0181821&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">how these things tend to work</a>, almost certainly didn't spread as far as the initial misinformation.  </p><p>Where things go next from here is anybody’s guess, but I imagine many will be watching with great interest – and not necessarily for the right reasons.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers/"><div><p>Beefed Up TwitchCon Security Couldn’t Stop The Internet’s Issues From Spilling Over Into Real Life - Aftermath</p><p>Despite all the sights and sounds, one scene defined TwitchCon 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Code Vein II is so much more than I expected. As much as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/code-vein-review/">I loved the first game</a>, it was pretty plainly “anime Dark Souls” at a time when soulslike competitors were still relatively few in number. It was successful enough to earn a sequel, and so I naturally expected to find something immediately familiar in Code Vein II. By the end of my time with it, though, I was blown away by how original, engaging, and uncompromised the vision for this game is – and how much I loved playing it.</p>
<p><iframe title="CODE VEIN II - Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8MFT2Jo7CN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In my first couple hours with the game, I thought I had my answer locked in. “Oh my gods,” I thought as an expansive open world and motorcycle were revealed to me, “this is anime Elden Ring!” You’ve got statues you activate to rest, level up, and respawn enemies. When you die, you drop your earned currency and can recover it if you return to that spot before dying again. If this was the height of the game’s ambition, I wouldn’t have been offended at all. Code Vein II is set in a gorgeously haunting post-apocalypse world, full of abandoned cities and toppled towers and cold, lifeless beaches that said so much with so little. It’s a massive map, that slowly expands as you progress through the game, and right out of the starting moments I was in love with simply wandering away from my specified destination to explore and poke at corners and fight hidden enemies.</p>



<p>There’s more to this, though, and while some of it snuck up on me over time, one of the immediately noticeable elements that makes Code Vein II so unique and ambitious is its story. Code Vein II is, when you boil it down, a post-apocalypse vampire time-travel doomsday adventure. It throws all of that at you at once, and some of it doesn’t immediately stick. My quest to travel 100 years into the past with my time-traveling companion Lou – who sacrificed half of her glowing golden heart to revive me, by the way – makes total sense to me. As does the goal to learn some secret from the past to bring back the powers of legendary heroes and then to defeat corrupted versions of them and prevent a doomsday event from triggering in the present. Some of the finer points are muddy, but it’s an interesting muddiness where some things feel a bit underexplained, while others feel purposefully brushed aside to hide the true intentions behind my quest.</p>

<p>It’s honestly fascinating to be tossed into a world like this that has lived, died, and lived again for hundreds of years. The game expects you to know a few things that I definitely had to visit the in-game glossary to understand, but the meat of the narrative experience lies in the untraditional use of time travel – it’s shockingly simple compared to many Japanese time travel games. It acts far more as an emotional ignition, if anything. You spend hours in the world of a century ago, bonding with these heroes and learning so much about them. To return to the present and fight those familiar friends as corrupted bosses genuinely carries weight to it. When you’re then given the choice of going back to save those new friends at the risk of altering or destroying your current timeline, the weight of those choices felt so real.</p>
<p>So, narratively, there’s a lot more going on with Code Vein II than just vague item descriptions and implied lore. Combat and gameplay, similarly, add on a lot of interesting layers here that go beyond what might be familiar. Surprisingly, almost none of the systems or finer mechanics from the original remain in the sequel. Blood Veil armor from the first game is gone entirely, for example, and you now have access to all clothing options within the character customisation, which is easily the most in-depth character creator I’ve seen in a while.</p>

<p>I’ve never played a game that let me pick custom nail designs and colours for my character, curl my characters hair at specific angles and lengths, or let me enable, disable and combine layers and pieces from different outfits together to create my own fit. It’s a thrill, and I might have spent about as much time creating my character as I did playing through the entire first section of the game. I can’t wait to create more characters as soon as I’m done writing this and go deep on a Photo Mode session with all the poses and dances they provide.</p>
<p>But once you’ve finally settled on your look, then the real character building begins.&nbsp; You’ve got a wide variety of gear types to think about in this game, but instead of creating a build with levelling up certain stats and choosing gear to match, it’s your gear combos that dictate your stats, speed and gameplay style.&nbsp;There are primary weapons, special Bequeathed Formae weapons, Formae abilities for your main weapon, defensive Formae shields, Blood Codes, Jails, and Boosters. Blood Codes and Boosters establish your base stats, and the rest of your gear have specific stat requirements – if you overload on certain stats, you’ll trigger negative results like stamina loss or health drain. If you balance it carefully, though, you can also trigger positive effects that can outweigh those debuffs. I usually stayed within the means of my stats and never played with the risk/reward of these stat boons, though.</p>

<p>Weapons range from short and swift to large and heavy to interesting ranged hybrids, like bayonet-equipped rifles and floating energy blades. They can be equipped with up to four unique Formae abilities, and those abilities use up Ichor to activate – as do your Bequeathed Formae weapons and some Formae shields. Primary weapons and the Formae abilities you give them are what dictate your playstyle the most, and I loved experimenting with their properties to find a certain attack loop or Formae ability that really clicked. The Bequeathed Formae, though, never really stood out for me. Early on, they either do very little damage, or have far too much windup and wind-down time, and just aren’t worth the resource-drain or risk. Formae shields are great, though. Some are standard shields for blocking, some can only be used to parry, and one in particular that I fell in love with gives you an invincible spirit-dash that uses up Ichor but is so, so satisfying.</p>
<p>To build that Ichor back up, you’ll use your Jails. Each of these is a very different sort of special attack, but they all do two important things. First, landing a Jail attack will restore some Ichor, and second, the more damage you do with your primary weapon leads to higher damage from a follow-up Jail attack. I actually found the Jails to be the most transformative part of my builds, because being able to reliably build up Ichor can drastically change how you play the game.</p>

<p>For a while, I was running with a build where my Jail was a medium-range scorpion stinger that knocked back fodder enemies. I ran into a massive boss that moved too fast and too far to reliably hit with that Jail, forcing me to swap to an entirely ranged Jail that summons a hoard of golden bats who peck at your foe and periodically feed you Ichor. With that new ranged Ichor resource, my Formae abilities and dodge were constantly available, and I beat the boss on my next try. That loop of experimentation and build-altering happened a lot for me, and it was always satisfying having a reason to try out so many new things.</p>
<p>Another big part of your arsenal are your partners – the NPCs who follow you everywhere. You can pick one at a time to join you, and each one brings a different combat style and different buffs to your own stats. Interestingly, you can also “Assimilate” your partner, absorbing them into your own body so they’re no longer helping you on the field, but lend you additional buffs and stat bonuses as a result.</p>
<p>Code Vein II is getting some flack for removing the co-op feature the original game had, and I thought this partner system might be designed in a way where that lack of multiplayer made sense, but I’m not so sure. The feeling of isolation playing by yourself is engrossing, and it’s fun to have my partner be an NPC I bonded with through the story and not, like, my buddy Alex. But the first game also had that energy to it, and still had co-op support. I get the feeling that technical limitations were at play here more than anything else – this is a big, gorgeous game, but it also struggles with the frame rate on PS5 at times, whether I’m playing on quality or performance mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvel has revealed a new expansion for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/marvel-to-launch-official-ttrpg-marvel-multiverse-next-year" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Multiverse RPG</em></a>. The <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion introduces new rules for the more cosmic parts of the comic book universe, including how to deal with entities of near-infinite power.</p><h2>The <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> Expansion Announcement</h2><p>The announcement of the <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion happened via an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1302969366?" rel="nofollow">Amazon store</a> listing. The store listing is sparse, but it does contain some pertinent information.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-secret-wars-god-emperor-doom-cover-artwork.jpg?itok=WQ55TqTv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="500" height="530">

  </picture><p>The new expansion is 256 pages and lists the authors as Matt Forbeck, Alex Irvine, and Marty Forbeck. Both Forbecks have also written the&nbsp;<em> Marvel Multiverse RPG</em> Core Rulebook and the <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Spider-Verse</em> expansions, and all three have worked together on the game's Avengers expansion.</p><p>As the name implies, the <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion focuses on the cosmic, interdimensional antics of the Secret Wars comic event. This 2015 comic event saw the collapse of the Marvel multiverse into a single pocket universe called Battleworld, all presided over by God Emperor Doom.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the Marvel comic event that, among other things, introduced fan-favorite Spider-Man Miles Morales into the main Marvel universe.</p><p>This highlights two selling points in the book's store listing. The book will include an adventuring framework for players to fight their way through Battleworld and save the Marvel Multiverse. In addition, it will include rules on how to "handle Rank X characters of unbelievable might." The latter can easily refer to God Emperor Doom as well as other cosmic-level threats like Galactus.</p><p>Notably, the store listing for the <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion will contain material for other parts of cosmic Marvel lore. This includes material on the Fantastic Four, the Negative Zone, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and more.</p><p>The book is currently available for pre-order at an MSRP of $49.99 and is set to release on August 18, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

Sega have gotten just a little bit too good at making Sonic games. Not good as in 10/10 masterpieces, good as in competent, as in mostly jank free, and where there is jank it's the annoying, not very funny kind. I like it when the blue hedgehog is impossible to control in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure 2</a> actually! But look, when I go on to tell you about a game that captures that same unruly spirit of Sega's early 3D games, please ignore that Christmas was a month ago because SantaCorps 4 is a 3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> that really does have the messy, gloopy sauce.
</p>
<p>
First order of business: no, to my knowledge there are not three other SantaCorps games you've never heard of, though there is another one called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398700/SantaCorps_Snow_Patrol/">SantaCorps: Snow Patrol</a> that's very much a Bombermanish, arcadey type situation that may also be worth checking out. SantaCorps 4 sees you playing as a member of the titular SantaCorps, all because Kris Kringle himself ain't doing so hot, and it's up to you/them to save Christmas. Standard!

Essentially what you're trying to do from level to level is rack up a whole bunch of points. To do this, you can dash about the place at ridiculous speeds, zipping through stars to collect points a la Sonic doing a ring dash, climbing down chimneys to deliver presents, lighting up Christmas trees, all while trying to maintain your ridiculously fast pace to keep your combo going. It's maybe even too fast! And you can't control the camera! But it's also just a lighthearted bit of fun, there's nothing pressuring you to do good, just an encouraging hand pushing you towards mach five.
</p><p>
It is also cheap as chips, or at least as much as a bougie coffee, so if you're in the mood for some silly, speedy fun, even if it is seasonally inappropriate, you can pick it up on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398530/SantaCorps_4/">here</a>. Oh, and there's co-op too! What more could you want?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135"><em>Highguard</em> is out on PS5, Xbox, and PC</a> and it’s been a weird day for the unique new hero shooter. There were <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-lies-about-being-invited-to-highguard-preview-event-2000663184">false claims</a> it had worked with disgraced streamer DrDisrespect and a myriad of technical issues plaguing its first hours on Steam. Now, as the dust settles, <em>Highguard</em> has racked up over 9,000 reviews on Valve’s storefront, but the vast majority are negative.</p> <p>On January 26, after a period of radio silence <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">following its reveal at the 2025 Game Awards</a>, <em>Highguard</em> launched for free, offering players a 3v3 PVP “raid shooter” experience complete with destructible environments and cool mounts to ride into battle on. However, shortly after the game’s launch, players began reporting problems. One of the first was that many, myself included, couldn’t even play <em>Highguard</em> due to the overwhelmed servers. Far from the worst issue to have on launch day.</p>

 <p>Once players got in, many reported performance issues on PC, with rigs equipped with high-end hardware still struggling to play <em>Highguard</em> at a steady framerate. And after getting through all that, some players have found matches in <em>Highguard</em> boring and slow, complaining that the 3v3 format and large map don’t mix well. Sprinkle in some bad-faith users attacking the game for looking “woke,” whatever the hell that means, and you end up with a horrible Steam review rating.</p> <h2>What is <em>Highguard’s</em> Steam review rating?</h2> <p>As of 5:10 p.m. EST, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/#app_reviews_hash"><em>Highguard</em> has 9,442 user reviews on Steam</a> across all languages. Of those nearly 10,000 reviews, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#:~:text=19.8%25%20positive%20reviews-,7%2C230,-80.2%25%20negative%20reviews">SteamDB data shows 7,230 of them are negative</a>. This adds up to a “Mostly Negative” status on Steam with fewer than 2,000 positive reviews. Ouch. <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012011">Over on the PlayStation Store,</a> things are better, with <em>Highguard</em> sitting at nearly 2,000 reviews and a 3.34 out of 5-star rating.</p>

 <p>It might be easy to assume this is some nefarious review bombing, and I do think <em>some</em> of this can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=highguard+woke">blamed on bad actors and annoying chuds</a>. But scrolling through the reviews does show a lot of players just don’t seem to like the slow pace of the game and the 3v3 format.</p>

 <p>“The maps in this game are way too big for 3v3; the size would fit better for 5v5 or 6v6,” posted one Steam reviewer. “In the looting stage, the map is too big and empty considering it’s only 3v3, and the only things in it are red and blue chests (and the crystals i guess),” shared another user. “The 3v3 format on such a huge map just doesn’t click for me, and the overall experience becomes chaotic without bringing anything new to the table,” said someone else.</p> <p>Of course, it should be noted that not even 12 hours have passed since <em>Highguard’s</em> launch. So all of these reviews are based on a dozen or so matches or less. The real question will be what happens in the next few days, weeks, and months–assuming <em>Highguard</em> sticks around that long–and if the devs can turn the ship around.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You are not immune to AI psychosis. Much like cult indoctrination, it can happen to anyone given the right circumstances. Take Matthew Gault, games and tech writer at </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span>. After failing to convince his friends to play </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> with him, Gault thought it would be funny to </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/i-replaced-my-friends-with-ai-because-they-wont-play-tarkov-with-me/"><span>replace his buddies with an AI chatbot</span></a><span>. It ended up not being very funny at all.</span></p> <p><span>Gault is a self-described “certified AI hater,” though he concedes that LLM technology is useful in certain instances (I agree to disagree with Gault’s assertion that offloading transcription to an environmentally catastrophic machine built on stolen labor saves valuable time and energy). Gault’s friends were turned off by the difficulty of </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span>, an extraction shooter which came out of early access last November. He described playing by himself as lonely. “Then I saw comic artist Zach Weinersmith making fun of a service, Questie.AI, that sells AI avatars that’ll hang out with you while you play video games,” he writes.</span></p>

 <p><span>What started as a joke quickly became more sincere. Gault found he genuinely enjoyed playing </span><i><span>Tarkov</span></i><span> with his Quest.AI companion, Wolf. “It was, I thought, not unlike playing with a friend who has more than 1,000 hours in the game and knows more than you. Wolf bantered, referenced community in-jokes, and it made me laugh.”</span></p> <p><span>Gault was surprised and concerned by his own enjoyment of the chatbot, his previous confusion over how people could fall victim to AI psychosis replaced by understanding. He states he will not continue using Quest.AI: “I never thought anything like [AI psychosis] could happen to me. Now I’m not so sure. I didn’t understand how easy it might be to lose yourself to AI delusion until I’d messed around with Wolf. Even with its shitty auto-tuned sounding voice, Wolf was good enough to hang out with.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Gault’s experiment ended with his real friends making fun of him for using Quest.AI by ironically using another LLM, ChatGPT, to send messages to him. Gault’s account is another entry in the emerging genre of seemingly normal people jokingly using AI chatbots and discovering things can get weird very quickly. YouTuber Eddy Burback popularized the phenomenon with his chilling </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRjgNgJms3Q"><span>documentary</span></a><span> “ChatGPT made me delusional,” which has garnered over 4 million views in the past two months. As Silicon Valley continues to shove LLM technology down our collective throats, it feels like only a matter of time until even more strains of AI psychosis—both simulated and sincere—begin to emerge. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Game Devs Call Exploit Allegations ‘Clickbait Exaggeration’ And ‘Malicious Defamation’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/screeps-world-steam-game-exploit-pc-hack-2000663214</link>
            <guid>1416898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The developers behind a popular “open source MMO RTS sandbox game for programming enthusiasts” on Steam, named </span><i><span>Screeps: World,</span></i><span> have been forced to update their game “in order to protect both players” and their “own reputation,” following the discovery of an alleged “remote code execution vulnerability” that would enable players to take control of other players’ computers. Even worse, the person who helped discover the vulnerability in question alleges that Valve “ignored” their reported findings.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re noticing an overabundance of quotes in the previous paragraph, there’s a good reason for that, as this story spawned out of a rather nasty back-and-forth </span><a href="https://x.com/IsaacKing314/status/2015195819251736630?s=20"><span>on X</span></a><span> between </span><i><span>Screeps: World’s</span></i><span> developers Screeps, LLC and an “information security” aficionado by the name of Isaac King.</span></p>

 <p><span>As King explained in his initial post, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> apparently allowed “any other player in the game world to gain remote access to your computer” through the use of a programming exploit. For context, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> is a programming game that lets players write their own code in JavaScript, which is then used to craft their own custom-made AI units.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663224"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663224">©Screeps, LLC</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As of this writing, the game is currently sitting at a “Very Positive” review score on Steam, having amassed roughly 1,876 reviews and, according to </span><a href="https://app.sensortower.com/vgi/game/screeps-world"><span>VG Insights</span></a><span>, over 113,000 individual purchases.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you want the exact explanation of the reputed vulnerability, I highly suggest reading King’s highly detailed write-up of the exploit </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/"><span>on his blog</span></a><span>. I will, however, warn you in advance that it requires (at least) a base understanding of JavaScript to fully understand.</span></p>

 <p><span>Thankfully, King includes an analogy for “non-programmers” in the conclusion: “imagine if there were one particular kind of unit in </span><i><span>Starcraft</span></i><span> that, if you trained it, let people hack your computer. And when pointed out, the game designers said ‘well this is self-inflicted, the players all chose to train that unit’.”</span></p> <p><span>King also explains that the developers have been aware of the issue since July 2024, as one of Screeps, LLC’s two developers replied to a report </span><a href="https://github.com/screeps/screeps/issues/162#issuecomment-2223049479"><span>on GitHub</span></a><span> detailing the vulnerability. The dev in question replied, stating that they “do not see this as a serious security threat.” However, a user from the Screeps Discord </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/usage.png"><span>noted</span></a><span> that the vulnerability had been successfully abused in the past.</span></p>

 <p><span>Once the initial post on X began to gain traction, the official Screeps X account replied stating that the accusation was “at the very least, a clickbait exaggeration, and at worst, malicious defamation intended to cause reputational damage.” Nevertheless, they also stated that the alleged vulnerability has, as of January 25, been removed from </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The potentially more worrying side of this is that King noted in his blog post that he’d reported the issue to Steam directly, but didn’t receive a reply: “I reported the game to Steam, which of course they ignored. Their terms of service make them not liable for any hacks caused by malware on the platform, so if it’s getting sales from which they can take a cut, why do anything about it?”</span></p> <p><span>We’ve reached out to Valve to corroborate this, and will update the piece if they reply.</span></p>

            <p>
It is inevitable that when a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> rocks up, is really good, and makes a gazillion dollars, that there will be the odd imitator here and there. Sincerity, flattery, yada, yada, yada, point is, it's all fine as long as you at least put enough of a twist in there to make it more of an "influenced by" over a "wholesale ripoff" kind of thing. I think Gambonanza, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilding chess game, fits into the former quite nicely.
</p>
<p>
Now, I'm not going to explain chess to you, you already know how that works. How Gambonanza works is that instead of the usual 8x8 grid, it has a much smaller 5x5 one. When you start a run, you have just three lowly pawns to work with. Your goal is to capture all of the enemy pieces, which are randomised per run, and if a pawn manages to reach the other end of the board it gets a promotion, i.e. you can turn it into a rook, knight, queen or other pieces. But the Balatro of it all are perks you can acquire called Gambits.
</p>
<p>
These are essentially the equivalent of Balatro's Joker cards, modifiers that can aid you in your quest to chess. For example, one Gambit allows you to skip your opponent's turn if you manage to capture an opposing piece with a pawn. Another Gambit earns you a king piece upon earning a promotion, which, as a point, you can also have a team full of kings, if you can get that many - as long as you have no more than three per round.
</p>
<p>
Beating a round earns you money, money lets you buy gambits or more pieces, you can continue to see the Balatro comparison in its meta strategic elements, but ultimately you're still playing Chess. Well, chess where there are boss battles, and pieces that have extraneous effects like tiles disappearing when your opponent captures one of your pieces, so not exactly chess, but you get what I mean.
</p><p>
It's all quite neat and satisfying, there isn't the overwhelming sensation of stress that comes from playing actual chess, the Gambits feel useful, and you can only have five of them so no overpowered runs for you. It's chess Balatro! And there's nothing wrong with that. If you'd like to have a go yourself, then you can head to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509230/Gambonanza/">Steam page</a> to try out its current playtest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, and Capcom is letting players know what they can expect if they have Sony’s best PlayStation console.</p>



<p>In a post on the Japanese PlayStation Blog, game director Akishi Nakanishi discussed how Resident Evil Requiem will play on the PlayStation 5 Pro (PS5 Pro).</p>







<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-gets-an-optimized-experience">PS5 Pro Gets An Optimized Experience</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2026/01/27/20260127-requiem-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nakanishi revealed that</a> PS5 Pro users will be able to turn ray tracing on and off. With ray tracing turned on, players will be able to play Resident Evil Requiem at 4K resolution at 60 frames per second (FPS). </p>



<p>Should you be on a monitor that supports higher frames, you’ll be able to take advantage of rates up to 120 FPS. Nakanishi said that there will be an average of 90 FPS on the system.</p>







<h2>What Is Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the long running horror franchise. The new game follows FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she’s tasked with investigating a number of strange deaths at the Wrenwood Hotel in Racoon City. It’s the same location where her mother, Alyssa Ashcroft, was killed eight years prior. </p>



<p>It also seems the return of Leon Kennedy who has to look into incidents that have been linked to scientist Victor Gideon. The game’s events are set roughly 30 years after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.</p>



<p>The game releases on February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Once-ubiquitous online game streamer Herschel “Dr Disrespect” Beahm, who was banned from Twitch after <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-sexting-minor-response-1851559888">sending “inappropriate” messages to a minor in 2017</a>, posted a photo of a media badge on January 26 and said he had been invited to a pre-release hands-on event for the newly released, free-to-play raid shooter <em>Highguard</em>. However, multiple people who attended the event denied seeing him there, and some Reddit users believe his photo was faked with gen AI or Photoshop. And <em>Highguard’s</em> creator manager says he wasn’t invited and didn’t attend.</p> <p>On Monday, ahead of the launch of <em>Highguard</em>, DrDisrespect posted an image of a keyboard, a can of energy drink, a personalized controller, and a <em>Highguard</em> media badge with his name on it to his X account. He claimed to have played <em>Highguard</em> at a recent media event in Los Angeles. “Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out #Highguard,” he wrote. “Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension! Yayayaya.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Highguard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Highguard</a>.</p> <p>Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension!</p> <p>Yayayaya <a href="https://t.co/kQ56GEfonB">pic.twitter.com/kQ56GEfonB</a></p> <p>— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015156898040049967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Immediately, people online began sharing the post and claiming the PR team behind <em>Highguard</em> had made a huge mistake inviting someone like DrDisrespect to the event. The streamer was suddenly banned from <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">Twitch in June 2020</a> and then later lost sponsorships and other business deals after confirming he’d once sent messages that were “inappropriate” but not “illegal” to someone else on the platform who was under the age of 18. He now streams exclusively on Rumble and YouTube, which allowed his channel to be monetized again after <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">a multi-month review of the allegations</a>.</p> <p>“Choosing to work with a self-admitted pedophile to market your game is certainly…A choice,” <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/2015836937865634276">posted a game dev and writer.</a>&nbsp; “Never heard of <em>Highguard</em>. Is it good marketing to have the first news about your game that some people hear be that you invited a pedophile to your preview event?”<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3mddtienlps2x/quotes"> posted someone else on BlueSky.</a></p>

 <p>But, not long after the post started going viral online, creators came out to deny that DrDisrespect was ever at the event, claiming he was lying about being invited.</p>   <p>“Dr. Disrespect was not invited to the early access event,” <a href="https://x.com/TheMacroShow/status/2015875906271904060?s=20">posted creator Macro on Twitter</a>. “I know this because I WAS THERE, and I promise you, everyone would’ve noticed that pedo a mile away. There’s so many valid things you can criticize <em>Highguard</em> for, but this isn’t one of them.” Kate Sánchez, the EIC of<em> ButWhyTho</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3mddwfcpcf22h">also denied he was there, adding</a>: “I literally did not see him there – unless creators had a different day.” Another content creator, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blessingjr.bsky.social/post/3mddxvxapqs2q"><em>Kinda Funny</em>‘s Blessing Adeoye Jr</a>., also believed DrDisrespect was not at the LA event, but said there was a second day for creators only. Sánchez and Adeoye Jr. didn’t attend the creator day.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinpua?originalSubdomain=ca"><em>Highguard</em> creator manager Chin Pua</a> replied to a viral tweet about DrDisrespect and <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060">confirmed that he</a> “was not invited to any <em>Highguard</em> event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.”&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to <em>Highguard</em> PR but has yet to hear back.&nbsp; A freelancer <em>Kotaku</em> sent to the event didn’t see DrDisrespect at the press day either.</p> <p>Over on the <em>Highguard</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1qnd1vl/is_dr_disrespects_badge_fake/">some players are theorizing that DrDisrespect faked the image</a> using AI tools or Photoshop. The evidence involves how the media badge looks compared to other real, confirmed badges from the event. It does seem like, if he were there, he was given a somewhat unusual badge with a different layout than other attendees. If DrDisrespect didn’t attend, he has yet to publicly confirm that on social media or elsewhere. He also streamed the game on <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015815750825730082">Rumble and YouTube</a> on launch day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The internet’s social corners are ablaze following a recent claim from Dr Disrespect that he was invited to play Highguard alongside Wildlight Entertainment in Los Angeles. The ‘Two Time’ posted an image on social media of an ID card from the recent event and directly stated he’d taken ‘the Lambo to LA’ to play Highguard.</p>



<p>Even though it took literal seconds to figure out Dr Disrespect’s image was a fake, likely manufactured by the same folks who make his streamer art, some have <strong>boycotted Highguard </strong>because of this impossible collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-dr-disrespect-fakes-highguard-invite">Dr Disrespect Fakes Highguard Invite</h2>



<p>On January 24, Dr Disrespect posted an image on social media of his desk, some streaming and gaming equipment, and an ID card that marked him as an attendee to the recent Highguard event in Los Angeles. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was a staging ground for Wildlight to showcase the all-new shooter in full to a wide audience of streamers, creators, pro gamers, and influencers, and some folks believed that Dr Disrespect also went.</p>



<p>When the image cropped up on social media, it took some who <strong>were </strong>in attendance mere seconds to debunk the image, simply by showing their own, legitimate passes, and pointing out the inaccuracies. But that wasn’t enough for the detritus of those social circles that avoid using logic and reasoning to solve something cryptic.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many took to those same social circles to slam Wildlight for associating with a creator with Dr Disrespect’s reputation. Anyone even remotely interested in the creator space knows about the recent controversies that the scandalous streamer found himself embroiled in over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Now, the Creator Manager for Highguard at Wildlight Entertainment, Chin, has <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a definitive comment</a> on social media, further debunking the image:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey there! I’m Chin, the Creator Manager for Highguard / Wildlight and I can confirm DDR was not invited to any Highguard event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, no, Dr Disrespect did not jet off to Los Angeles to play Highguard with everyone else. He is <strong>streaming </strong>the game as this article is being written, but that’s the closest to it he’ll ever be.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Battle Pass, Explained—How To Get Free War Chest]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-battle-pass-free-war-chest/</link>
            <guid>1416853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t have a new live-service game without a Battle Pass, and Highguard doesn’t advertise a properly labeled Battle Pass, to an extent. This guide covers how to get a free War Chest and how it relates to Highguard. </p>



<p>Everyone gets the ick at the mention of a Battle Pass due to the negative connotations. However, if something is free to play, it’s going to have a Battle Pass, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-file-sizes-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> complicates things with its War Chest system.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-a-battle-pass">Does Highguard Have A Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get playing. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard has a fully fledged Battle Pass system under the guise of a War Chest.</strong></p>



<p>Same thing, different name. A War Chest is the name for the game’s Battle System. It has the Pages system that Fortnite and others have adopted in recent years, allowing you to have more freedom in how you accumulate Highguard rewards.</p>



<p>Each reward requires so much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-currencies-how-many-are-there-how-to-earn-how-they-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard currency</a>, and they include the usual slew of live-service cosmetics: Skins, weapons makeovers, customizable player profile items, and more. Subsequent War Chests will presumably require real money or acquired in-game currency, but not the first one.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-free-war-chest-in-highguard">How To Claim Free War Chest In Highguard</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Generous. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to go into the Highguard Store, click on War Chest, and claim your free Battle Pass.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick step-by-step guide on what to do:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up Highuard.</li>



<li>Go to the main menu.</li>



<li>Make sure you’re on the tabs at the top.</li>



<li>Cycle across to <strong>Store</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>Inspect War Chest</strong> in the corner.</li>



<li>Claim the War Chest.</li>



<li>You now have a free Battle Pass for Highguard Episode 1.</li>
</ol>



<p>The first War Chest has a total of 44 items to claim. Goodies vary in terms of rarity, and they’re spread across ‘4 Chapters.’ You need to play matches and rack up a serious amount of Vigil Tokens—which are used in exchange for the rewards found in the War Chest.</p>



<p>It’s expected that future War Chests will follow a similar format, unless there’s stern opposition from the Highguard community.</p>



<p>Will you endeavour to complete the first-ever Highguard War Chest, AKA Battle Pass? Or do you think the rewards are a complete waste of time and not worth the effort?

<p>The marketing train is in full swing for WWE 2K26.

		<p>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered, or DW3CER as no one is calling it, was set to be released on March 19th 2026, but that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>A message from producer Tomohiko Sho reads as follows:</p>


<p><em>“The release of Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered has been postponed from the previously announced March 19th, 2026.&nbsp; As the first remaster of the Dynasty Warriors series,&nbsp; in order to satisfy our fans, we have made the decision to further improve the quality of the game. The new release date will be announced at a later date. We appreciate your patience as we take a little more time before the game releases”&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered looks to retain the gameplay of the original game, but has been completely remade using Unreal Engine 5. The team has also reconsidered some of the gameplay and UI elements to refine the experience.</p>

<p>The remake includes the original game plus the Xtreme Legends expansion which includes more scenarios, officers such as Lu Bu, Meng Huo and Yuan Shao, four challenge modes and more weapons. That will boost the roster to over 40 officers who will be battling thousands of enemies all at once.&nbsp; Dynasty Warriors 3 was the first game in the series to feature mechanics that would become a mainstay for the series, such as True Musou Attacks, two-player simultaneous play, and the officer development system.</p>
<p>When it does eventually get released the game will be launching on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2, and PC.</p>
