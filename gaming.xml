		<p>Tougher bosses are starting to appear in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> from today, as new variant Nightlords known as the Everdark Sovereigns emerge in FromSoftware’s multiplayer spin-off to the hit Soulslike.</p>
<p>A new Everdark Sovereign will be added to Limveld each week, a time-limited challenge for players who have defeated the boss in their original form to test themselves against. The reward for defeating them will be Sovereign Sigils that can be exchanged for special Relics, with additional Sigils awarded for the first time you defeat a particular Sovereign.</p>


<p>The First Everdark Sovereign is an enhanced version of Adel, Baron of the Night known as Gaping Jaw, and is now available to play. You have until June 26 9:59 JST / 1:59 BST / 2:59 CEST / 5:59 PM PDT to take him on.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight will emerge, while others –&nbsp;Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog – will be added to the rotation at a later date.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Everdark Sovereigns are only available to battle if you’re playing in online mode.</p>

<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign has not gathered the universal acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic.&nbsp;</a> We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jim saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45f84f9f16719/yakuza-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new report from Chris Dring's <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=4150086&amp;post_id=166316380&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=357pt4&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">The Game Business</a> highlights a few sales stats for launch games on the recently-released Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to the article, "most third-party Switch 2 games posted very low numbers" at launch, with the vast majority of players understandably gravitating towards <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. As per data from NielsenIQ, 86% of physical Switch 2 game sales were first-party, including the MK World bundle. If we exclude the bundle, the result would be 48%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the US, Circana states that 68% of sales were for first-party, excluding the bundle. By comparison, launch sales for the Switch 1 were 89% first-party in the UK and 81% in the US. So yes, while these numbers have dropped, it's important to note that there are far more physical Switch 2 launch games than there were Switch 1 launch games.</p>
<p>The best-selling third-party game was, as most would probably expect, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>. Meanwhile, Sega is the third biggest third-party publisher for the Switch 2 with launch titles including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a>.</p>
<p>However, one unnamed publisher described initial sales as "below our lowest estimates", despite remarkably strong hardware sales.</p>
<p>It's thought that there could be a few potential reasons behind this. The first is that, as mentioned earlier, most people buy Nintendo consoles to play Nintendo games, first and foremost. The second is that the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, with many Switch 1 titles performing better on the new hardware, thus eliminating the immediate need to buy more new games.</p>
<p>The third is that most third-party games are indeed ports of older games that a lot of folks may have already played. Fourth, the vast majority of third-party titles are Game-Key Cards, which passionate fans have been against from the word go. This may have also contributed to Cyberpunk's higher sales, which notably includes the full game on the cartridge.</p>
<p>And finally, Nintendo's decision to hold back review units of the Switch 2 until the very last moment meant that consumers had no way to gauge just how viable the third-party games would be. Take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination</a>, for example: a strong game to showcase the Switch 2 on paper, sure, but one that falls short with some pretty dismal frame rate issues.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on how sales shake out over the coming months, but with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> coming out this year from Nintendo, we suspect third-parties may continue to feel the sting for a little while longer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer-shows-new-features-cute-cat.1223130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FuturLab has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer, and it shows off some of the game's new features, as well as the little cat you can presumably pet to your heart's content.</p>

<p>Naturally, if you're expecting&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>to serve as a significant reinvention of the wheel, you might be disappointed. If, however, you're after more refined and more satisfying cleaning gameplay, it looks like FuturLab has you covered.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rLMus-sx1I" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new trailer</a> kicks off with the player spraying some filthy structures with the titular power washer, including a teapot-shaped building, a still-operational fairground (surely a safety hazard?), and a car that looks like it desperately needs the TLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-spraying.jpg?itok=brerRuib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-spraying.jpg?itok=kwVJKTgC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will bring more of the satisfying cleaning gameplay you know and love.</figcaption></figure><p>While much of the gameplay looks similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow">the first game</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will boast some innovations as well.</p>

<p>We get to see the player sitting in a chair on wires to reach harder spots (sorry, cleaning aficionados, but I'm not sure what this contraption is called), and we also get to see a window-cleaning platform extending to help with trickier places.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the trailer, we get to see the player customizing their base by hosing down a piano (which I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing in real life) before rotating it and placing it in their ideal spot. The trailer also shows off&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>'s new co-op mode, which will let you take on tough cleaning jobs with a friend.</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most excitingly,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will let you pet Ulysses the cat. Ulysses made an appearance in the original game, but you couldn't pet them, which I think is an actual breach of the law. Thankfully, that egregious oversight has been rectified in the sequel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-co-op.jpg?itok=CRoi9XSm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-co-op.jpg?itok=ZYOfuM6D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will feature co-op play, as well as a cat you can pet (not pictured).</figcaption></figure><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in March</a>. It'll serve as a sequel to the original game, which has attracted a cult following thanks to its soothing gameplay and breadth of jobs to complete.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>yet, but when it launches, it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator-2/9p45ggdtfnsm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> (no word of a Switch 2 port yet).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-spotlight-announced-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced a new Spotlight showcase for next week, and you can expect to see new info about some of the company's biggest upcoming releases during the presentation.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/showcase/spotlight/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the new show will air on June 26th (that's next Thursday at time of writing) at 3pm Pacific/6pm Eastern. If you're in Europe, it's going to be a late one for you, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The show will apparently revolve around four Capcom pillars, two of which have yet to be released. You'll be getting new info about&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Pragmata</i>, both of which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">announced</a> during one of this year's Summer Game Fest-adjacent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">shows</a>, and new info about&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>will also be coming.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-capcom-showcase.jpg?itok=jZnO8gLD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-capcom-showcase.jpg?itok=0lIQXwtu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>info is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get some gameplay footage of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which is currently due to arrive in February next year. As for&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, I wouldn't be surprised if Capcom revealed a release date for the game, which recently got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pragmata-preview" rel="nofollow">shot in the arm in the form of a revival</a> after several years of silence.</p>

<p>When it comes to the two already-released games, we'll probably get some more info about upcoming&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>DLC fighters, and again, I'd be surprised if we didn't learn what's coming as part of the next&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update, which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">follow on from the first in March</a>.</p>

<p>Just in case you missed it, the world of the former recently invaded the latter when demon fighter Akuma <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-crossover" rel="nofollow">joined the ranks of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-crossover" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;</em>hunters, complete with unique moves and visual effects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/689333/fbc-firebreak-review-xbox-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, Remedy Entertainment has entered the world of the first-person co-op shooter. Set in its <em>Control</em> universe — specifically the site of the first game, the brutalist nightmare office called the Oldest House — players control a member of the titular three-person team of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), tasked with addressing various containment breaches. Unfortunately, all the aspects that make Remedy’s worlds so intriguing are completely absent in this bare-bones co-op shooter, which offers nothing for either longtime fans or those invested in existing shooters. </p><p>Players in <em>Firebreak </em>are like firefighters or disaster responders, with each member occupying a different role: mechanic, water carrier, electrician. Across five recurring levels, teams must work to stop the spread of corruption, called the Hiss (a mysterious red entity that turns people into raging zombies and other types of creatures). Objectives vary from destroying Post-it notes to fixing fans, all while being assailed by swarms of various nightmare monsters.</p><p><em>Control</em>, the central foundation of Remedy’s wider connected universe that also includes <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Alan Wake</a></em>, is at its core weird. It’s how Remedy developers have described it — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control">to me</a> and others — allowing for fluctuations between the terrifying, the quirky, the odd, and the hilarious. The Bureau itself is a government agency tasked with containing bizarre items and reacting to huge and strange world events: for example, a traffic light that, when it flashes red, sends people to different locations, or a fridge that eats people if you stop looking at it.</p><p>In Remedy’s universe, FBC workers document, monitor, and research these sorts of items with the gray-faced enthusiasm of every bored researcher. The number of times the toy duck teleports needs to be logged as much as how many coffee filters need to be replaced in the break room.</p><p>That stone-faced reaction to the weird is only mildly present in <em>Firebreak</em>, with brief interactions with mission provider Hank Wilder, the security chief, detailing bizarre tasks in a slight monotone. Even player character barks demonstrate this. One of the player voice options is called “Pencil Pusher,” who, when receiving friendly fire, screams that such actions “violate office policy.” Health restoration involves characters huddling in a shower together; you can fix equipment by hitting it with a wrench.</p><p>As someone obsessed with <em>Control</em>, I was eagerly anticipating a return — particularly in the shoes of ordinary personnel, rather than the almost godlike head of the agency, Jesse Faden (who you play in <em>Control</em>). But that sense of unease that plays off the quirkiness is not here. The Oldest House and its enemies feel like little more than an aesthetic, or even a kind of mod, for a generic co-op shooter. There is no sense of progression, no overarching goal to which you are working. Levels and tasks repeat. There aren’t even creepy big-level bosses, like the terrors in <em>Control</em>, except in one area. </p><p>You will have seen all the game has to offer within a few hours, since each level has only three or four stages (with each successive stage in the same level taking you further in), and some stages can be completed within three to four minutes. As an example, one stage involves destroying replicating Post-it notes. Once you have destroyed a sufficient number, you rush back to the elevator as a horde descends. The second stage requires the same objective, only this time you gain access to a second area to destroy more notes. The third stage repeats this, only you go further in and face a boss. All end with rushing back. </p><p>While the game offers modifiers — such as harder enemies and corrupting anomalies that can slightly keep you on your toes — the core aspect wears out quickly. I do not feel I am making any headway in clearing out an entire level, since once cleared, there’s no indicator our team made any difference. The only incentive is to obtain better gear. At least the game doesn’t push microtransactions and is quite generous in its rewards, especially on harder difficulties. </p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>You also level up various roles independently: playing mainly as the mechanic, you will have to start from scratch if you switch to, for example, the electrician role. These roles do feel distinct, as you are given different gear and abilities. The mechanic can almost instantly repair broken equipment, a very useful skill given how many broken machines there are. But the game is filled with various hazards, such as fire and gunk, which the water soaker character — with their water cannon — can negate. </p><p>Shooting feels good, but guns are standard: shotguns, machine guns, pistols. Don’t expect weird weapons like the Service Weapon from <em>Control</em>. This is meat-and-potatoes destruction.</p><p>That’s precisely what disappointed me: ordinary workers in a world where fridges eat people is what made me love <em>Control</em>, and the idea of being able to play one of the lowly workers was exciting. Yet that charm is largely absent. I barely felt part of the FBC and it didn’t seem like I was containing anything.</p><p>In <em>Control</em>, you would clear rooms and see the game world change permanently. Obviously a co-op shooter can’t do things in the exact same way. But why not tie something like this to the host player? If I have to see the same level three times, progressing further each level, why not show some permanent change from a previous run? There’s no indication the world is reacting to the Firebreak team’s efforts.</p><p>In reality, <em>Firebreak</em> feels like one of the multiplayer modes that used to be tacked on to big-budget single-player games (think <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, for example). If players don’t feel like they’re making a difference as part of a team trying to stop an outbreak, why should we bother? The levels are akin to hero-shooter arenas, devoid of the deep lore of a Remedy game. At least with hero shooters, playing against other people keeps play constantly fresh. This felt like it was stale within a few hours, an avocado of a game.</p><p>I genuinely don’t know who <em>Firebreak</em> is for. Longtime fans of <em>Control</em> won’t find collectibles, environmental storytelling, or anything to even read. And those looking for meaningful multiplayer shooters have plenty of options already. This is a strange dim light for a studio that usually produces brilliance.</p><p><sub>FBC: Firebreak <em>is available now on the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S. It’s also available for Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscribers.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Many moons ago, Danish developers Playdead released bleak platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-limbo">proved beyond reasonable doubt</a> that Gamez R Art, while also giving a bunch of witless scriveners massive arachnophobia. Today, we learn that one of the studio's co-founders, Arnt Jensen, is suing the other, Dino Patti, amid competing claims about the scale of his contribution to Limbo. Because of course all great things must end in calamity.</p><!--more-->
<p>Our source of this story is Patti himself, who left Playdead in 2017 after the release of the wonderfully awful/awfully wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inside">Inside</a>, and is currently boss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/somerville">Somerville</a> developer Jumpship. He and Jensen have famously not been on great terms for years, but things <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdead-co-founder-dino-patti-claims-fellow-co-founder-keeps-legally-threatening-him">came to a boil in late 2024</a>, when Patti published an account of Limbo's development on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Back in March this year, Jensen argued that the LinkedIn post exaggerates Patti's contribution to Limbo, insisting that "by providing recipients with core insights to the process of developing Limbo, you are falsely giving the impression that you played a significant role, including a creative role, in the development of the game." He also claimed that the post includes an "unauthorised" photo.</p>
<p>For this alleged infringement, Playdead asked for 500,000 Danish kroner or $72,630 as "suitable compensation and reimbursement." Now, Patti has revealed that Playdead's lawyers are taking him to court in a podcast interview this week with Danish site <a href="https://arkaden.dk/nyheder/dino-patti-der-kommer-en-retsag/">Arkaden</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/limbo-and-inside-studios-new-game-is-a-3rd-person-open-world-sci-fi-adventure/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>For his part, Patti contends that Jensen is trying to delete him from the game's origin story. "Arnt, please stop the bullying. I will not stop being who I am," he declared back in March. "I will never erase my own history. You can't rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup." In the Arkaden podcast, Patti is upbeat about the situation, commenting that it's an opportunity to set the record straight, but with all due respect to the guy, that's the kind of thing you say when you're being sued.</p>
<p>None of this interferes with my eagerness to hear about Playdead's next game, "a third person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe", which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playdead-reveal-art-for-their-secretive-inside-follow-up">revealed in 2017</a>. At the risk of sounding like I'm picking my favourite dad, I've yet to play Somerville, which Malindy Hetfield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somerville-review">described</a> as an "interesting, if not particularly deep" spin on the Playdead school of apocalyptic minimalism.</p>
<p>I will ask Playdead and Jumpship for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A fumbled launch can paint a system as the “loser” of a generation, while a strong one can write its name in the stars. Sometimes you don’t even need an incredible launch line-up; you just need one standout game that gets people to show up in droves to buy your box. Nintendo’s launches have run a wider gamut than those of any other contemporary console maker, from underwhelming to spectacular. Some of its launches have set the stage for those consoles to go on and revolutionize the industry, while others are widely regarded as some of the weakest console launches in the history of video games. With the Switch 2 out this month, we decided to look back at all of Nintendo’s console releases and see what were the company’s best and worst launches. Where does the latest system land on the list? Read on to find out.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-recommend-id="image://2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-format="jpg" data-width="1540" data-height="1001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii U system." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A white Wii U system." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-recommend-id="image://2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-format="jpg" data-width="1540" data-height="1001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii U system." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Few console launches have become cautionary tales the way the Wii U’s has. Fresh off the incomprehensibly successful Wii, Nintendo had quite the act to follow in 2012. However, the system itself didn’t have much to offer at the outset that you couldn’t find on consoles you probably already had. <em>New Super Mario Bros. U </em>and <em>Nintendo Land </em>were decent exclusives, but the majority of the launch line-up was third-party games that had been out for months or years on the PS3 and 360. The system also launched at the worst possible time. The PS4 and Xbox One were looming, the Wii U was only about as powerful as systems people had been playing since 2005, and unlike the Wii or the Switch, the system’s gimmick was hardly a system-seller. The gamepad was a novel way to try and bring the “second screen” experience to home consoles after the surge of tablets and other mobile devices in the early 2010s, but it didn’t have the immediate appeal of the systems that came before and after.</p><p>I remember when my brother was picking up our Wii U on launch night, and the Walmart cashier (bless her heart) said it was a touchscreen accessory for the original Wii, rather than a new console. There’s nothing quite as damning as the person selling your product not knowing what it is, and that came down to a branding problem above all else. Perhaps that’s why Nintendo went with the numerical naming convention for the Switch 2, rather than something that could have seen it misconstrued as a peripheral. The Wii U never really gained any momentum after it stumbled onto store shelves, even with some excellent games. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-recommend-id="image://raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3760" data-height="2110" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple GameCube." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple GameCube." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-recommend-id="image://raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3760" data-height="2110" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple GameCube." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of Nintendo’s consoles had sparse launch line-ups but were carried by heavy hitters. While <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee </em>loomed just a few weeks post-launch, the GameCube’s actual day-and-date catalog was a bit underwhelming. The lunchbox-shaped console was novel with its quirky design and ugly-as-sin controllers that many people still swear by 24 years later, but its first wave of games was pretty weak. <em>Luigi’s Mansion </em>led the pack alongside <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> and <em>Wave Race: Blue Storm</em>, but most of the history books will remember <em>Melee</em>’s fashionably late arrival as the moment the console’s “real” killer app arrived. Sure, I could count it as one of the most culturally significant games in Nintendo history (even if the company doesn’t want you to view it as such), but to keep things clear and manageable here, I’m only considering actual launch games, not games released throughout a console’s ambiguous “launch window.” The GameCube had some real bona fide classics by the time the Wii launched in 2006, but that first month wasn’t so promising. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-recommend-id="image://85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1373" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 in its dock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 in its dock." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-recommend-id="image://85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1373" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 in its dock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’re still kind of in the Switch 2’s launch period, given Nintendo’s second console/handheld hybrid is just about two weeks old, but despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">record-breaking sales</a></span> right out of the gate, the Switch 2’s arrival has hardly felt like a red carpet affair. Part of this is because Nintendo has managed to provide a solid supply for the demand, meaning it feels like a nice thing to have, rather than a hot commodity people are still scrambling for, and I’m not complaining about that. Another is that the Switch 2 is just…the original Switch, but bigger and better. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417">That’s also a good thing</a></span>, to be clear, but it’s not quite as electrifying as the original Switch, with all of its novelty, felt in 2017. All that being said, the launch line-up is rock solid and showcases the device’s power. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is the headliner and is one of the finest kart-racing experiences Nintendo has put to cartridge, and impressive third-party ports like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>show the system has legs. It’s been a bit underwhelming, but it’s also a smooth, pain-free console launch at a time when most things are bad, actually. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-recommend-id="image://3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1391" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Entertainment System." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Entertainment System." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-recommend-id="image://3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1391" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Entertainment System." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The years between the collapse of the market for Atari video games in the early 1980s and the arrival of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986 were long and harrowing for me, as a child whose earliest memories saw me developing a love for video games only for them to largely evaporate from the marketplace, their future uncertain. When they returned, it wasn’t with all the hype and fanfare we associate with console launches today. It was, for a bit, tentative and awkward, a case of the culture feeling out this new contender in the space. Nintendo, despite being the makers of beloved games like <em>Donkey Kong </em>and <em>Mario Bros</em>., both of which I’d played in arcades and on Atari 2600, wasn’t a name Americans were familiar with (my mom, god bless her, always pronounced it “Intendo”), and the initial arrival of the NES leaned heavily on R.O.B., a robot who looked cool and futuristic in advertisements but was somewhat frustrating to actually use. (In retrospect, however, I’ve come to appreciate R.O.B. as a wonderful novelty who may have been essential to securing Nintendo a foothold in the American market, letting the NES take up shelf space as a “toy” at a time when “game consoles” felt like poison to retailers.)</p><p>The moment I knew I wanted one—and first believed that video games were about to be back in a big way—was when I saw a big display kiosk touting the console at the Sears department store (RIP) in the Northridge Fashion Center. All the games looked colorful and amazing, leaps and bounds beyond what Atari had been able to deliver, but the one that looked like pure magic was <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. I’d already seen it in an arcade cabinet at my local 7-Eleven, this extraordinary game in which the little mustachioed hero of <em>Donkey Kong </em>now ran to the right into a whole world of mystery and adventure, and here was the promise of that same incredible experience at home. Before too long, Nintendo went from being largely unknown in the States to being a household name (even if my mom never learned to pronounce it correctly), and soon we were all reading issues of <em>Nintendo Power</em> and getting hyped for upcoming releases. It may not have been the most knock-your-socks-off launch in Nintendo’s history, but I think it was probably their most tactical, and it may always be their most historically significant. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-recommend-id="image://82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1329" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A SNES." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A SNES." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-recommend-id="image://82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1329" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A SNES." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>By the time the SNES rolled around, Nintendo had millions of loyal young American fans, and it could do a proper build-up and launch in the States for the first time. Our hype was fueled by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xYhGL5y4DPQ?si=0Ms8Rj9-bDZ-FRz-&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xYhGL5y4DPQ?si=0Ms8Rj9-bDZ-FRz-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that commercial starring Paul Rudd</a></span>—we didn’t know he was Paul Rudd at the time, of course, but he looked awesome playing and enjoying those games, and we, too, wanted a taste of this “Super Power” the new console promised. For many parents, meanwhile, the SNES seemed like a scam, an effort to extort even more money from their Nintendo-addled kids. (For an incredible, time-capsule glimpse of what the period surrounding the SNES launch was like as many parents lamented the hold that video games had developed over their children, you simply must watch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/MTzyz2TgGls?si=HRouMNxLHZNasr_Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/MTzyz2TgGls?si=HRouMNxLHZNasr_Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video of a local news report</a></span> from 1991.)</p><p>But for those of us who were firmly in Nintendo’s grasp, the arrival of the SNES was cause for excitement, not concern. Today, game console launches often feel incremental; the PS5 felt like an important technological step up from the PS4, for instance, but not an awe-inspiring one. In the SNES era, however, new hardware could still inspire genuine awe. Oh my god, look at that 3D effect on those tracks in <em>F-Zero</em>! Look at all that color in <em>Super Mario World</em>! Sega’s Genesis had arrived two years prior, stepping up the technology that powered the games we played. Here, with the release of the SNES, Nintendo was firing its own salvo in the 16-bit wars, and once again, Mario was leading the way. The launch bundle included <em>Super Mario World</em>, maybe the best console pack-in of all time, giving players hours and hours of wonderful SNES gameplay right out of the box in a game that remains an enduring classic to this day. Now <em>that’s </em>how you make people feel good about their new console purchase, and eager to seek out the many wonderful new experiences that will be arriving for it in the months to come. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-recommend-id="image://b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An orange Nintendo 64." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An orange Nintendo 64." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-recommend-id="image://b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An orange Nintendo 64." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Nintendo 64 is one of the best examples of a launch immediately giving new players all they’ll really need by offering an incredible, generation-defining game right out the gate. Most consoles can’t claim to have the kind of system seller that <em>Super Mario 64 </em>was back in 1996. It didn’t matter that the Nintendo 64’s controller is the kind of sin that god will judge humanity for when we reach the pearly gates; Mario’s first leap into 3D felt like a true generational leap of the kind that’s become increasingly rare in recent decades. One game made such a succinct case for the console that some reasonably argue the N64 never surpassed it. In reality, as they arrived in the years that followed, games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>GoldenEye </em>similarly demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the N64, but most companies don’t have this kind of paradigm shift on store shelves the same day their new console lands. Nintendo had done it twice before, though, with the NES having <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>right out of the gate and the SNES launching with the one-two punch of <em>Super Mario World </em>and <em>F-Zero</em>. And the company would go on to pull off this feat at least twice more, too… — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-recommend-id="image://12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1486" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch with blue and red joy-cons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch with blue and red joy-cons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-recommend-id="image://12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1486" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch with blue and red joy-cons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When the Switch was unveiled, it sounded like some fanfiction futuristic device you’d made up as a kid. You’d whine to your friends that you wished you could play your Nintendo 64 games on long drives to grandma’s house, and then you’d draw up some impractical machinery that would allow you to pull your games off the TV and onto a handheld contraption. It seemed like science fiction growing up, and then Nintendo released a system that did just that. It wasn’t as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox One, but the portability gave it some actual utility that separated it from the competition and prevented it from falling into the same awkward catch-up phase the Wii U had. On top of it being such an incredible new device, it launched alongside <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, which, in addition to being a fulcrum point for open-world design as we know it, showed that the Switch also had the juice to host console-quality experiences on the go. It’s a double-edged sword that the Switch has become such an important pillar of the console market that Nintendo can’t really pivot away from it to make something new and experimental with the Switch 2, but the company pulled off something that felt like magic in 2017. As soon as it hit store shelves and people got a taste of a brand-new <em>Zelda </em>game in the palm of their hands, it was over. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-recommend-id="image://2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-format="jpg" data-width="851" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii with a Wii-mote leaning on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A white Wii with a Wii-mote leaning on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-recommend-id="image://2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-format="jpg" data-width="851" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii with a Wii-mote leaning on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All that being said, I don’t think we’ll ever have a launch quite like the Wii’s again. One of the smartest business decisions anyone at Nintendo ever made was to package <em>Wii Sports</em> with every Wii. One of the biggest hurdles video games must overcome is teaching someone how to play. The more complicated a game is, the more likely you are to lose someone in all the minutiae. Some of the best marketing Nintendo ever did was the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p7uJp25BlE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p7uJp25BlE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Wii Would Like To Play”</a></span> commercials that showed Nintendo employees bringing the system and its motion-controlled remotes into different families’ homes and showing them playing <em>Wii Sports</em>. As moms, dads, kids, and grandparents all swing the Wii-motes around and their movements are reflected on screen, everyone instantly understands what the system is about. Somehow, this pack-in collection of motion-controlled, sports-based games was a bigger system-seller than the new <em>Zelda </em>that launched alongside the console, and the possibilities seemed so endless. Eventually, the Wii became a dumping ground for shovelware, and Nintendo’s decision to stick with the device’s name for brand recognition with the Wii U ended up biting it in the ass. Still, unless Nintendo or another company comes up with something so intuitive that even your grandmother is hopping on to play, no one is catching lightning in a bottle this way ever again. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can also still buy songs and music packs that were released on or before June 18 — just nothing added to the catalog from today (June 19) onwards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're grateful for the incredible support you've shown us over the years, and we're excited to share what the future holds for Beat Saber," the update concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For many players, this feels very much like the final nail in the coffin for PlayStation's VR aspirations, as Beat Saber is still one of PlayStation's biggest VR titles.

"Even so, it’s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console. The downside is that, like any new platform, its thin launch lineup makes its lack of backward compatibility with original PSVR games a significant problem, but one that will only improve as Sony and other developers roll out new games that take advantage of the PSVR2’s unique features."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <p>Embracer Group has reduced its workforce by over 1800 people in the past year.</p>
<p>The Swedish conglomerate today released its <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/dd9f3025-a71d-4aa7-9ddf-ecc688af29f4/embracer-group-annual-report-2024-25.pdf">annual report</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-group-reduced-its-headcount-almost-2-000-employees-last-year">Game Developer</a>), detailing the internal headcount of each of its departments. By comparing with the previous annual report, we can estimate the workforce reduction over the past financial year.</p>
<p>The company's PC and console games segment has seen the biggest drop, from 6,404 employees to 4,918. That's a reduction of 1,486 people, or just over a quarter. The mobile segment has been reduced from 1,081 to 743 employees, while the entertainment and services segment has been reduced from 771 to 738 employees. That totals a loss of 1,857 people in the past year.</p>

<p>This loss does not account for the company's previous tabletop segment, as Asmodee has now split into a separate entity as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">plans to split the company into three</a>: Coffee Stain Group, Fellowship Entertainment, and Asmodee.</p>
<p>Of course, part of this workforce change will be natural turnover. Embracer lists its turnover rate at 20 percent in total, with 560 people leaving voluntarily and 517 leaving due to dismissal (as opposed to seven by retirement and zero due to death in service).</p>
<p>Much of this will be as a result of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">Embracer's restructuring programme</a>, which began back in June 2023 in the wake of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">proposed $2bn partnership collapse</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">reportedly with Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games fund</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has laid off thousands of employees and closed numerous studios. In May 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">Eurogamer reported the human cost of this restructuring</a>: a headcount reduction of 4,532 people, as well as 80 in-development projects being dropped.</p>
<p>In the months following that report, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alone-in-the-dark-reboot-developer-closed-by-embracer">developer of the Alone in the Dark reboot was closed</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-owned-studio-lost-boys-interactive-impacted-by-another-round-of-layoffs">Lost Boys studio suffered another round of layoffs</a>, and in March this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Eidos-Montréal confirmed more layoffs</a> affecting up to 75 people.</p>
<p>As part of this year's annual report, Embracer has focused on its publicly available Sustainability Policy, stating its "commitments towards the people, environment and governance" and highlighting how it addresses working conditions, corporate culture, human rights and labour rights.</p>
<p>"At Embracer Group, we aim to maintain a safe and inclusive workplace where all employees can grow professionally," the annual report reads. "We focus on developing employee skills and competences and monitor their well-being through performance dialogues at the individual level and other measures. Diversity and inclusion in skillsets and perspectives are key components of the approach taken to create a dynamic and inclusive workplace."</p>
<p>It adds: "We understand the challenges posed by divestment, transformations and organisational change. Yet, we strive to maintain an environment where talents are nurtured and empowered."</p>
<p>The report also lists an increased gender imbalance, with a reduction of the female workforce from 30 percent to 27 percent. Embracer states this decrease "is primarily linked to organisational changes, mostly related to the Asmodee spin-off", though the drop in female managers is larger than the drop in "young female talent".</p>
<p>The company describes the "diverse skills and perspectives" of its workforce as "a source of pride". According to GDC's State of the Games Industry report 2025, women represent 25 percent of the game industry workforce.</p>
<p>Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors has written the opening remarks in the report, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-overseeing-thousands-of-layoffs-and-numerous-studio-closures-embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-is-stepping-down">he is stepping down from his role at the company</a>. Instead, he will become its executive chair of the board.</p>
<p>"While the road has not always been straight, I am incredibly proud of the achievements made possible by our talented teams, which have created some incredible experiences for gamers," said Wingefors.</p>
<p>Despite owning 464 IP rights, Embracer's biggest success story this year so far has been the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>
<p>Embracer boasts it has 108 game development projects. So what's coming next?</p>
<p>In its latest financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-plans-to-release-76-different-games-in-the-next-year-despite-previous-layoffs-and-studio-closures">Embracer stated it would release 76 different games over the next financial year</a>, 2025/2026. This will be a mix of new IPs, sequels, and remasters.</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest release will be Amy Hennig's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, which was delayed back in May into early 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, the game about kicking it in the goal from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/absolver">Absolver</a> devs Sloclap, have launched today, June 19th. The folks behind it have rung in that occasion by outlining a bunch of their future plans, as well as saying they're very sorry you can't currently show off your mouse and keyboard skills by nutmegging some fool who owns one of those ex-boxers.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though, crossplay and a bunch of other stuff are in the works for future updates to the foot-to-ball thing Nic and James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-and-nic-kick-a-thing-sloclaps-rematch-edition">dug the beta of</a>, and that currently sits fourth in Steam's top sellers list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Kicking off a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch message</a> (sorry, had to), Sloclap explained that crossplay didn't end up happening in time for Rematch's release because of "unforeseen technical complexities", continuing: "We should have communicated as soon as it became apparent that crossplay wouldn’t be available at launch, and we’re sorry for the inconvenience and frustration it caused to some of our players."</p>
<p>The devs said they have got a "basic working version from a technical standpoint", and getting that over the line is their "absolute highest priority" right now. So, you should be able to unleash your inner Roy Keane on some unsuspecting fool who bought a different video game box soonish.</p>
<p>Aside from that, SloClap are aiming to show a bunch of technical gremlins that folks reported throughout Early Access the red card (sorry again, I once took a football to the face as a small child and have never really recovered). Lag, stuttering, frame drops, and "player characters and the ball seemingly moving across the pitch unpredictably" are on the hit list.</p>
<p>The devs also have their eyes on a host of improvements and additions for future updates, including tournaments, the ability to create your own club, and bots you can train against. The likes of spectating your squad’s game when you join one and a way to let players team up and rematch with teammates they've liked having a kickabout with are also on the list in terms of social stuff, to go alongside that crossplay. </p>
<p>As for when all of this'll arrive, SloClap made clear not to expect everything by the end of this year, so you may well have to be patient if you've got your eye on one of those non-crossplay additions.</p>
<p>If it helps, imagine the devs dribbling through a circuit of well-placed cones that each represent a development thing equal in threat to a six foot four centre back called big Terry whose mum they've just insulted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo">Patrick Recommends: Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</h3><figure></figure><p>If you told me this was a "lost" game from the 16-bit era, I'd believe you. To the point that I'm actually a little upset I've put enough hours into this game that I can't rationalize starting over on my shiny new Switch 2, instead. Steam Deck it is.</p><p>I do not remember how <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo, </em>what I can only describe as a fun mashup of <em>Mega Man </em>and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, came onto my radar, but it wasn't because a PR person told me. I've been doing this long enough that, at times, people will yell "hey, you should play this!" And they are often right, and in this case were very right, because <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo </em>absolutely rips.</p><p>In fact, people have now understood my own weaknesses enough that they use them against me. No, <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</em> does not have a traditional grappling hook, but you use the yoyo in question much like one, whipping objects and enemies around. A grappling hook, at the end of the day, is just about manipulation of the world, and I'm always looking for games that play with that.</p><p>Some of the tiny details are my favorite parts too. </p><p>For example, the game has a familiar skill tree, but rather than acquiring new skills or stat upgrades by slowly acquiring experience points, you are burdened with debt and weakness. Let's say you want more points to equip additional trinkets that boost your character in different ways. Well, in exchange for +1 in that department, you are now going to sacrifice half the money you pick up from enemies towards paying off your debt <em>and</em> your attack power is reduced by one. I am very much into video games that force you to play a little differently over time.<em> Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</em> does that a lot, making exploration of the world feel meaningfully different over time.</p><hr><h3 id="chia-recommends-rebel-princess">Chia Recommends: Rebel Princess</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Bézier Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>There've been a myriad of trick takers in the last few years that aim to take this basic mechanic and warp it to new ends (see: my (board)game of the year from 2024, <em>Arcs</em>),&nbsp;but one in particular kept passing in front of me. <em>Rebel Princess</em> is a twist on the classic game of Hearts, and this basis makes it a great entry game into the wider, weirder world of board games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/the-switch-2s-first-post-launch-update-is-stronger-and-more-stable-er/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first post-launch update for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is here, bumping the version number up to 21.0.5, and you’ll never guess what it does…</p>
<p>Actually, you probably will guess, because this is a minor version bump, and Nintendo has broken out the tried and true single line patch note for Switch System Update 21.0.5. Here’s what it does:</p>


<ul>
<li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user’s experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it.</p>
<p>It’s all behind the scenes stuff, in other words. Stability can mean all manner of things, and could include stamping out any minor crash bugs, solving GameChat’s activation glitches – something we sadly cannot test again – sorting the strange battery reporting issue, and improving edge case performance for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">backward compatible games</a> by updating the translation layer.</p>
<p>Similar to Microsoft’s cross-gen system software, Nintendo is keeping system updates in lockstep across the original Switch and Switch 2. So Switch System Update 21.0.5 is out now across the original model, Switch Lite, Switch OLED and Switch 2 all together.</p>

<p>While there’s some key system features for the Switch 2, including GameChat and GameShare, a bespoke new version of the Nintendo eShop, and a tweaked home screen design, the absolute core functionality and general layout has remained the same. The systems share Nintendo’s new digital licensing system of Virtual Game Cards, so it makes sense that they share the same core.</p>
<p>Anyway, more stable is nice. We like things to be strong and stable round these parts. Not weak and wobbly.</p>

<p>That really is updating the world</p>

The game has sold over 1 million copies across all platforms, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 version in particular is absolutely fantastic</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the developer has <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">shared more details</a> about that upcoming free DLC, <strong>Update the World</strong>, and it really is updating the world, as Ginormosia will be transforming into a base for a roguelike, open world adventure (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-free-dlc-update-the-world-to-add-new-mode-roguelike-open-world">Gematsu</a>!). A date hasn't been announced, but Level-5 is aiming to bring it to fans "as soon as possible."</p><p><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179jymxiu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Alongside this massive-sounding mode, more powerful gear, new equipment, new mounts, some strange new items, and additional emotes and hairstyles will be coming. But, most importantly, look at this fuzzy new character who will play an important role in the DLC. Is he good? Is he bad? We don't care — he's got a very fluffy mane!</p>
<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time DLC Character" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eae014d763176/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-dlc-character.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Level-5 promises that, for as big as the world sounds, the upcoming DLC will offer "engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." Well, the base game already does that, so Level-5 will be stealing more of our time in the near future.</p>
<p>We're delighted to see how successful and popular Fantasy Life i has become, and the Switch and Switch 2 versions are now totally up to date with other consoles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fantasy-life-i-scores-another-switch-1-and-2-update-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">as of today's free update</a>. Between this and Mario Kart World, we're never going to have time for anything else, are we?</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to this free DLC in the comments</em>.</p>

Tifa, Martial Artist runs the same three colors and has her own abilities:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“Martial Artist” gives Tifa +1 to both Power and Life for each opponent you attack this turn (<em>MtG’s </em>Commander format is usually played with more than 2 players).</li><li>If any of your creatures have 7 or higher Power, at the end of combat, they untap and are able to go into combat one more time. This basically gives you two rounds of combat every turn.</li></ul><h2 id="h179286"><a id=""></a> Get Cloud’s power up to 7 </h2><p> In case it wasn’t clear from the above cards description, your main goal for this deck is to get Cloud’s power up to 7. Luckily, to simulate the Materia System in <em>FFVII,</em> Cloud’s Deck is full of equipment to buff him up. Since he starts at a power of you need to get him a total of +3 to get him there. Here are a couple ways to do so:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>”Conqueror’s Flail” gives +1/+1 for each color permanent you have on the field. Since Cloud runs three different colors, you are likely have three different lands which would give him a total of +3/+3</li><li>”Wrecking Ball Arm” makes the creature it’s equipped to automatically have a power and life of 7. As an added bonus, the equipped creature can’t be blocked by creatures with a power of 2 or less, and legendary creatures can equip it for only 2 Mana as opposed to the 7 it requires for normal creatures.</li><li>A sneakier way is to equip “Champion’s Helm” to Zack Fair. When Zack dies, he can give +1/+1 and any equipment to any other creature. Since Champion’s Helm gives +2/+2, Cloud will hit 7. </li><li>Finally, the easiest is just to equip “Hero’s Blade” which gives +3/+2 to the equipped creature. As an added bonus, if a Legendary Creature enters the battlefield, there is no cost to equip it. </li></ul><h2 id="h179287"><a id=""></a>Other helpful tips</h2><p>If you are having trouble drawing the equipment you need (given Commander’s 99 card deck size, use Cloud’s ability that lets you draw for the number of equipped creatures you have. If a piece of equipment won’t get Cloud to 7, equip it anyway just to get some draw power. You can also try to equip “Darksteel Plate” to Tifa. Since Cloud is a Commander, if he is destroyed, you can easily bring him back, though he will have an additional Mana Cost. Tifa is not so lucky, but “Darksteel Plate” makes Tifa “Indestructible” so she can’t be destroyed unless the equipment is first. It ensures that you are always going to be attacking twice, once you get your board set-up.</p><figure id="" data-id="8c41a5f7085adee72156410737d4acb8" data-recommend-id="image://8c41a5f7085adee72156410737d4acb8" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shoiws Barret wielding a Wrecking Ball arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shoiws Barret wielding a Wrecking Ball arm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8c41a5f7085adee72156410737d4acb8" data-recommend-id="image://8c41a5f7085adee72156410737d4acb8" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shoiws Barret wielding a Wrecking Ball arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>may be incredibly different from <em>Final Fantasy VII.</em> But in this instance, your path to victory is pretty much the same as it is in the video game: Apply buffs to your characters to make them hit harder and faster while minimizing the damage you take. If things get rough, don’t worry, there are some of Aerith’s healing spells in there as well.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Future updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will seemingly include "Hagga-Basin-like maps".</p>
<p>Revealed by community manager Iggy in the Dune Awakening Discord server, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1006265467754790943/1379064253537063103/1384818624283545693">he wrote</a>: "I think Joel kinda leaked in the past that we plan to add more Hagga-Basin-like maps in the future as part of new content".</p>
<p>Iggy refers to pre-launch developer vlogs in which Dune: Awakening spoke about the roadmap for future updates. Creative director Joel Bylos stated updates for the game would be free, with only optional cosmetics, battle passes, and especially large expansions being sold.</p>

<p>Dune Awakening has proven exceptionally popular since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-and-stellar-blade-both-set-new-concurrent-user-records-on-steam-this-weekend">its launch on Steam, breaking 150,000 concurrent players</a> and popping off among the higher reaches of the Top Sellers list alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/rematch-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As someone who has spent an inordinate amount of time playing football games, including FIFA, EA FC, PES, Championship Manager, Football Manager, and even the cult classic Red Card Football, I generally know what to expect from them. Enter Rematch, the new multiplayer football title from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/06/sifu-review-ps5-pc-ps4/">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap, which looks to introduce a different way to play the beautiful game. This is a football game that does away with the pesky rules and demands patience and skill from the player.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rematch | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jQ_GJQQmMMo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Rematch you will only control your own player across all match modes. You can customise them by unlocking different cosmetic items including tops, shorts, and hats, but there are no skill points or attributes to assign. In other words, your player is only as good as you are at the game. That means if you can master the controls of the game, then your player will shine like some of the best players in the world. If you struggle with the controls of Rematch then you will be more like Ali Dia than Lionel Messi. Before you dive in, you should know the default controls do not have a lock on option for the ball. This can be changed in the settings, where there is an alternative control set up that does have a ball lock on mode, which is very helpful when starting out.</p>


<p>In terms of match modes there is 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 which are all playable in quick match, and each of these lets you familiarise yourself with different aspects of Rematch, including positioning and ball control. There are also tutorials to complete that will give you more depth and insight for the game’s various systems. After you reach rank 5 you will unlock the ranked match mode, which is purely 5v5. Once you have a few matches within ranked mode under your belt, you will be given your rank, which will fluctuate depending on your future performances. I was initially placed in Silver One, just missing out on Gold Three.</p>


<p>There are two major elements that count towards whether you are going to have a good time with Rematch. The first is the gameplay itself and the second are your teammates. The controls can be fiddly and the action a little bit too chaotic at times. Let’s take attacking as an example. When you are going for goal you need to manually aim towards the net, but if you are facing the goal you’re not likely to see the ball coming in from a cross. If you are looking at a player who may cross it and the ball does reach you, you then need to turn and line up the shot towards the goal and take it. That gives the defence time to close in and get into position to stop your scoring. There is nothing like auto assist or auto aim in Rematch as, like I said, every move is dependent on your own skill. If you do not have the ball in view there is an on screen indicator that tells you where it is and you can kind of work with that, but it is always better to be watching the ball than not.</p>
<p>Passing also requires precision as you need to be aiming right where you want the ball to go, whether it be directly to a player or into space. A little like Rocket League, the ball cannot go out of play in Rematch so you can also use the stadium walls to bounce the ball off to make passes into tight spaces.</p>

<p>As much as every school kid wants to be playing up front, banging in goals and getting all the glory, defending and keeping are just as important – you don’t want the other side scoring, after all! Rematch rotates players through different roles after each goal is scored, assigning someone to play in goal each time. You can shirk your duties and run off to be an outfield player, but I actually liked being the keeper as you can pull off some great saves and get involved in attacks by creating assists. If you’re lucky you may even score from kicking the ball out, like I somehow managed to do one time. Locking onto the ball as the keeper is a necessity as you can then position yourself better to either run and get the ball off an attack player or dive in the right direction to stop the ball finding the back of the net. Interestingly, crossing the goal line while saving the ball means that the shot won’t count as a goal. How do you feel about that, Mr. VAR?</p>
<p>If you’re playing in a defensive role you have the options to do a light tackle, a sliding tackle if you’re sprinting, or trying to intercept the ball with your positioning or heading it away. The tackling is not as smooth as it could be with tackles that look like they should make contact missing the ball or opposing player completely. All players have the ability to sprint, but it is limited by everyone having the same amount of stamina, so you can’t just whizz around the pitch hoping to run from end to the other and getting a shot off.</p>
<p>Overall the gameplay is okay. It’s definitely an interesting take on playing a football game, but it needs some improvement, especially when it comes to attacking.</p>

<p>Hell can be the other people you play with, and this is where Rematch’s success or failure will truly lie. Football is a team game but in the hours I have played it there have been a number of examples of selfish players that will ball hog in an attempt to go for glory, but almost always messing up and costing the team. When you find a group of players that acts like a team, you see the elements of Rematch which really work as each individual understands there task to defend or attack, calling for passes at the right moments, and linking up well together. It is these teams and players that usually go on to win matches.</p>
<p>Rematch is not without other issues either. For example, after a match if you want to view your performance you can switch to a tab to do so but sometimes it automatically toggles to your progression screen instead. Also post match, the game takes you back to the main screen instead of just matchmaking and putting you into a new match. There should be the option to just keep matchmaking unless you choose to opt out of it. I did have a couple of crashes on PC, but this seems to have been ironed out in a new patch. The graphics are serviceable, but there’s some fun stadium themes that include tropical jungles and outer space, and I quite liked the music too.</p>
<p>Sloclap has addressed some of these issues and areas of improvement<a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps"> in a blog post for today’s launch</a>. Initially stability will be the immediate priority, but they also plan to add cross-play down the line, and are looking at feedback on slide tackling, keeping, wall collisions and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I absolutely adored the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fantasy_life">Fantasy Life</a> on the 3DS, and thankfully, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has proven to be a worthy successor, sinking its claws into me all over again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Kate Gray reviewed the Switch 1 version</a> and said, “It's beautiful, it's robust, it's got multiplayer, it's got three fully-fleshed-out areas to explore, it's got crafting and foraging and cooking and fishing and minigames and beautiful music and sidequests and more. And it's all really, really good.”</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182726 @ 1750344520 -->
<p>Well said, Kate, and I wholeheartedly agree. It's one of those wonderfully addictive games where there's so much to do, so much to see, and all the numbers go up and up making you feel really good about your progress. You could argue that it does little to meaningfully evolve the gameplay from the 3DS original, but when it's this good, I'm really not that fussed.</p>
<p>So it’s great news, then, that the Switch 2 version makes the overall experience even more enjoyable thanks to a small batch of noteworthy improvements to the presentation. We’re mainly talking about resolution and frame rate here, so don’t expect any fancy mouse controls or HD Rumble 2 or tie-ins to a mobile app.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i admittedly looked pretty nice and performed reasonably well on Switch 1 at around 30fps. That said, the significant bump up to 60fps on Switch 2 is very welcome and I can’t imagine going back now. It doesn’t <em>always</em> hit its target, particularly in the larger open-world environments, but I didn't get anything more serious than a few minor dips here and there.</p>
<p>Similarly, the visuals are much crisper than before, especially noticeable when playing in handheld mode. The blur effect is still in place around the edges of the screen, but it feels slightly toned down to allow the game’s world to shine brighter than ever. You can turn this off completely, if you wish, but I find the focus blur adds to the charm; kinda like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link’s Awakening</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>
<p>A small patch applied shortly after release also boosts shadow quality and the object render distance; a minor improvement, but one that further widens the gap between the versions. Load times were acceptable on Switch 1, averaging between 5 and 10 seconds, but this has been cut down significantly to 3 or 4 seconds for most scenarios.</p>
<p>Given how cheap the upgrade is for Switch 1 owners — you’re looking at £2.04 / $2.59 / €2.27 or your regional equivalent — the performance improvements for Fantasy Life i on Switch 2 are more than worth the price of admission. Other publishers have the gall to charge full price again (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">looking at you, Sega</a>), but this is an acceptable middle ground. If you’re keen on trying out Level-5’s long-awaited sequel, this is absolutely the best way to play on Nintendo systems.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

As you might recall, publisher 2K was among those companies that <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-games-is-the-latest-publisher-to-remove-its-lineup-from-geforce-now-while-epic-games-vows-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled out of GeForce NOW</a> when the service first launched out of beta in early 2020.</p>
<p>Something must have changed recently, though. The Mafia franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-the-whole-mafia-franchise-including-old-country-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> GeForce NOW last month, and now it's time for Gearbox's first-person looter shooter games. Moreover, the upcoming Borderlands 4 will be available to stream on day one. Its system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren't that high</a>, but it's still welcome news.</p>
<p>Sid Meier's Civilization franchise is already available on GFN, but BioShock, X-COM, and the sports games (NBA, WWE, Top Spin, PGA Tour) aren't. Will they be the next 2K franchises to join GeForce NOW? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, here's the full list of GFN additions for this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>REMATCH (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 16)</li>
<li>Broken Arrow (New release on Steam, June 19)</li>

<li>Date Everything! (New release on Steam, June 17)</li>

<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a> (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 17)</li>

</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-superpowered-boss-is-here-in-new-update.1223013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>update, and it's got the first of the promised upgraded Nightlord bosses for you to take on.</p>

<p>These bosses were first teased as part of a preview of what's next for the multiplayer-focused spinoff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>, along with duos, which aren't being included as part of this update, unfortunately. They're due to land later this year.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Bandai Namco website, the first upgraded boss you'll be facing is Adel, Baron of the Night, otherwise known as Gaping Jaw on the game's menu screen. The publisher is promising "new moves and increased power", constituting "an even greater threat" to you and your squad.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-upgraded-nightlords-adel.jpg?itok=tlwKx71f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-upgraded-nightlords-adel.jpg?itok=OV-XRv95 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s first upgraded boss is waiting for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware haven't revealed exactly how Adel will be upgraded for your battle against him, so you'll have to head in and take him on if you want to see exactly how he's going to wreck your squad anew.</p>

<p>Beating the new version of Adel - and, indeed, any other upgraded Nightlords - will net you a new resource named Sovereign Sigils, which you can exchange for unique Relics and other rewards. The first time you beat an upgraded Nightlord will net you extra Sigils as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">massively successful</a> open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it also serves as the first ever spinoff of a game in the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series or its ancillaries.</p>

<p>The game sees players descending on a randomly-generated map to scavenge for resources and defeat minibosses, level up, and prepare for battle against a Nightlord, a unique boss with new attack patterns and weaknesses, at the end of a three-day period.</p>




<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has proven hugely successful, but&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in the sales department either; it managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">top two million sales on its first day</a>, and it had reached 3.5 million at last count.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">read my review of it here</a> if you want to know how I felt about it.</p>

            <p>The owners of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> developers CCP Games are looking to sell it off, according to a report from Korean finance website MTN. Apparently, parent company Pearl Abyss are sounding out interest from a bunch of games publishers, though no names have been named for the moment.</p>
<p>Pearl Abyss - a South Korean outfit otherwise known for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a> and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-online-devs-ccp-being-bought-by-black-desert-online-company">scooped up all of CCP's shares in 2019</a> for about 250 billion won, according to the exchange rate of the time. That translates to about $181,139,200 or £134,752,675 in today's money, which is, you know, a fair dollop. You would be pretty chuffed if you found that tucked behind your sofa cushions.</p>
<p>Naturally, Pearl Abyss have been keen to make their money back. According to <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061910371430049">MTN's sources</a>, CCP and their affiliates have been incurring sizeable losses instead. They released a mobile game, EVE Echoes, via NetEase shortly after the acquisition, but this has apparently fallen short of expectations, and CCP are now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-awakening-is-born-from-eve-onlines-fragility-so-its-turning-to-the-blockchain">focusing rather heavily</a> on "web3" games fuelled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-frontier-is-a-survival-game-spin-off-of-eve-online-and-yup-its-full-of-blockchain-bullshit">blockchain bullshit</a>. They are also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-vanguard-is-a-pvpve-shooter-set-in-the-eve-online-universe">still trying to make an EVE Online FPS</a>, despite screwing this up three times in a row.</p>
<p>Amidst all this, the storied and genuinely majestic EVE Online continues to truck along with a <a href="https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility">fiercely dedicated community</a>, who are all playing a vicious meta-game of their own devising I like to call "Backstabbery Betwixt the Space Balkans".</p>
<p>One of the MMO's biggest player alliances, the Imperium, are in the middle of a gigantic operation called The War of the Ruses. During the recent Battle of Lantorn, 3,808 players teamed up to lay 306 dreadnoughts to waste. These are the kinds of losses you enjoy reading about. The ones that emerge from quarterly earnings calls, less so.</p>
<p>While I can only scratch my head at some of CCP's recent doings, I have an enduring fondness for EVE, and am hopeful that its makers will find a way to prosper - whether in the hands of Pearl Abyss or elsewhere. I've reached out to PR representatives for comment on the MTN story. More to follow.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> is a game I briefly gave a go last year, back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a> was still a game we were all yet to play and have a vast slew of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">different opinions</a> about. I thought the little I played was alright, but didn't stick with it that long, slipping back into the pair of comfy slippers that were Civ 6.</p>
<p>Now, though, Ara's just gotten a big update, and it looks like it should solve some of the issues that folks flagged with the base game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Dubbed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507330049932791470?l=english">Living Strategy update</a>, this revamp's the first step in a roadmap for the game that was laid out when Stardock Entertainment took the lead on Ara's continued post-launch additions from original developers Oxide Games. It looks like it'll make Ara a bit less frustrating to play.</p>
<p>For example, the revamp takes its name from the default view being switched to a new "Living Strategy" middle ground that aims to balance the up-close perspective on the stuff you're building with the wider strategic overview you'll want when making bigger moves, meaning you should be able to do everything from one perspective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the patch addresses two of the biggest issues that Sin Vega flagged in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">our review of Ara</a> - the sheer amount of micromanagement required to manually equip buildings and citizens with the stuff from your inventory they need to accomplish certain tasks, and your AI opponents being too easy to outfox.</p>
<p>Now, you've got the option to automate resource selection or control it through policies, meaning you should get less bogged down in just making sure your cities don't grind to a halt. Stardock say AI leaders will "make more nuanced decisions, better optimize their resources and challenge players with deeper strategic considerations", in an effort to ensure you actually face a challenge down the stretch in games.</p>
<p>Skirmishes between you and the likes of bot Otto von Bismarck will feature a new "battle viewer panel" designed to explain fight outcomes and strats more clearly as part of a wider combat overhaul, and map's been upgraded to try and provide more variety in starter setups. Along with those additions and redesigns, Stardock's had a go at making the game run better graphically, gameplay flow more smoothly, and squashed some bugs.</p>
<p>So, maybe worth checking out if you're not happy with where Civ 7's currently at in its own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-next-update-will-make-food-actually-worth-investing-in-and-let-you-play-forever-if-youve-got-that-long">ongoing update metamorphosis</a>, and crave the chance to play dictator/benevolent overlord/person who tells virtual people what to do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

More than 67 million Americans flocked to see it in theaters, only to leave terrified of ever setting foot on a beach again. John Williams’s ominous score, built on low-pitched instruments like basses, cellos, and tubas, combined with Spielberg’s use of POV shots and clever restraint in revealing the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-games-starring-sharks-1843611686&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-games-starring-sharks-1843611686">shark</a></span>, helped cement <em>Jaws</em> as one of the scariest movies of all time.</p><p>From that point on, every shark movie would inevitably be measured against <em>Jaws</em>. And though some have come close to being just as horrifying, many fall short. With so few able to live up to the mastery of Steven Spielberg’s craftsmanship, the genre began to swing in the entirely opposite direction: bottom-of-the-barrel absurdity. These movies put sharks in the most ridiculous scenarios imaginable, and the titles speak for themselves: <em>Space Sharks</em>, <em>Ouija Shark</em>, <em>Sharkenstein</em>, and <em>6-Headed Shark Attack</em> are just a few examples. Only the ones that are “so-bad-it’s-good” make it onto this list.</p><p><em>Jaws</em> set in motion the Hollywood myth that sharks are vengeful and evil killers, when in reality, they’re just curious creatures and human attacks are rare. Still, those toothy giants are the last thing you would want to encounter in open water. If you’re eager to dive into the wild world of shark movies in between episodes of <em>Shark Week</em> on TLC this summer, take a look at the list below. These are the best shark movies that aren’t Steven Spielberg’s iconic blockbuster, ranging from serious horror to those that fully embrace the hokey chaos of Sharksploitation.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-recommend-id="image://6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5760" data-height="3840" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman inspecting a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman inspecting a shark" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sofie Gheysens/Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-recommend-id="image://6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5760" data-height="3840" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman inspecting a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Under Paris</em> carries an ecological message and emotional gravitas that elevates the convoluted plot and silly concept into something genuinely exciting to watch. A grieving scientist named Sophia (Bérénice Bejo) must rescue Paris from a giant shark lurking in the Seine. Conveniently, Lilith is the very same shark that killed her husband, making their conflict far more personal and emotionally charged than it would be with a random, evil shark. While Sophia tries to hunt Lilith down, there’s a triathlon taking place that the mayor refuses to postpone (sound familiar?). This results in the grisly deaths of countless athletes. The militaristic efforts to destroy Lilith are over-the-top, and <em>Under Paris</em> as a whole requires a lot of mental gymnastics to appreciate. But it’s got a great payoff that reminds us of the unstoppable force of nature. The upsetting fact that Lilith is mutated by a polluted, waste-filled ocean makes you stop and think just as much as the rest of the movie makes you clutch your seat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-recommend-id="image://179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Syfy</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-recommend-id="image://179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The low-budget production company The Asylum isn’t exactly known for high art. It mostly churns out cheap copycats of previously released blockbusters like <em>Top Gunner</em>, <em>Transmorphers</em>, <em>The Terminators</em>, and <em>Battle Star Wars</em>. The films are a waste of time and money, and it’s hard to say why they even exist, but one of their original movies became an overnight sensation after airing on Syfy in 2013. In <em>Sharknado</em>, Tara Reid is tasked with saving Los Angeles from a tornado that, somehow, is filled with sharks. Part of the film’s charm lies in how fully it embraces being a winking send-up of the Sharksploitation genre. With sharks out of their natural ocean habitat and raining down from the sky, there’s plenty of room for colorful and outlandish deaths, and <em>Sharknado</em> more than delivers. It may be one of the most shallow shark movies out there, but it’s undeniably worth watching, if not only for its cultural impact. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6b2466205b8a0aa59a32e7b421889564" data-recommend-id="image://6b2466205b8a0aa59a32e7b421889564" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man standing in front of a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man standing in front of a shark" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Their open jaws were much taller than a full-grown man and their body longer than an entire school bus. When I was a little girl, I had a theory that they still existed near the bottom of the ocean. This is exactly the premise of <em>The Meg</em>, which should give you a clue into the maturity and believability of this movie. You just have to ride the wave of this intentionally campy blockbuster—much like the ass-kicking Jason Statham, who hangs onto the fin of the massive prehistoric creature, flies through the air, and somehow still survives. <em>The Meg</em> fully embraces its ludicrousness, which is fitting because a creature as enormous as a megalodon ever existing is bonkers enough on its own. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-recommend-id="image://9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark crashing in" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shark crashing in" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-recommend-id="image://9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark crashing in" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <em>Bait</em> is one of the most creative entries in the Sharksploitation genre. It feels like the filmmakers said: “Sharks in the ocean? Yawn. Let’s put them inside a supermarket!” Director Kimble Rendall tosses <em>Jaws</em>, <em>The Impossible</em>, and Stephen King’s <em>The Mist</em> into a blender for the wild premise: after a freak tsunami hits, a group of strangers (plus a cute little dog) are trapped inside a flooded grocery store with a shark. Standing on the shelves can only help them for so long. Their battle against the shark menacingly roaming the aisles is gorier than most other shark films. The use of animatronics in several scenes makes the carnage believable. Even though the concept sounds idiotic, it actually works and leaves you hooked. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People trapped in cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People trapped in cage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dimension Films</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People trapped in cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In <em>47 Meters Down</em>, a diving trip goes awry for two vacationing sisters. Their cage plummets to the ocean floor, leaving them surrounded by sharks and a dwindling oxygen supply. The viewer is choked with fear by the darkness of the watery environment and the claustrophobic framing. There’s also something terrifying about the characters being completely immersed in the shark’s kingdom—seeing life through their eyes and coming face to face with them. The film uses this setup to deliver some biting jump scares. The sequel, <em>47 Meters Down: Uncaged</em> (2019), raises the stakes by submerging a group of girls in an underwater maze of caves and tunnels filled with sharks. Both films are serviceable popcorn thrillers that venture into uncharted depths of shark terror. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f5c767a7f413cdb5ae9e7cf3a4d1b05" data-recommend-id="image://6f5c767a7f413cdb5ae9e7cf3a4d1b05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

It heightens the stereotype that sharks are vindictive and deliberately hunt down their chosen victims by making them genetically engineered to be smarter. The experiment to see if their brain tissue can cure Alzheimer’s backfires in the most brutal way. It’s great, blood-soaked fun to watch the all-star cast—Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgård, Michael Rapaport, and LL Cool J (who also performs the end-credits rap), etc.—either get caught in the feeding frenzy or narrowly escape. Some scenes use slow motion to heighten the drama and make the adventure feel more epic and cinematic. When <em>Deep Blue Sea</em> bares its teeth, it’s less horrifying and more of a high-adrenaline action flick. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-recommend-id="image://7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looking terrified" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman looking terrified" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Columbia Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-recommend-id="image://7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looking terrified" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Being stranded in the middle of the deep, shark-infested waters, with no land in sight, has been the terrifying concept of several movies already, so <em>The Shallows</em> tries to do something different. It’s a cruel twist of fate for Nancy (Blake Lively), who ends up stranded on a tiny, isolated rock only 200 yards from the shore. All that’s between her and safety in the shallow waters is a giant shark. She’s so close yet so far. Jaume Collet-Serra, who also directed <em>Orphan</em> and <em>House of Wax</em>, has a very lyrical vision that makes even the simplest of his horror movie concepts feel grand and mythic, which really works for this stripped-down survival concept. Blake Lively gives her character some gumption and emotional gravitas that makes us invested in her survival. There are some very creative set pieces involving jellyfish and a buoy, plus some welcome levity from a seagull named Steven Seagull. <em>The Shallows</em> is a solid B-movie that doesn’t pretend to be anything more than it is, but still manages to rise above most brainless shark thrillers. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-recommend-id="image://a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man dangling over a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man dangling over a shark" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->IFC Films</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-recommend-id="image://a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man dangling over a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re looking to expand your shark movie repertoire, you’ll have to wade through plenty of ridiculous ones. But every so often, one surfaces that’s genuinely thrilling and adds something new to the genre. <em>Dangerous Animals</em> has a particularly intriguing premise where a serial killer (played by an unhinged Jai Courtney) uses sharks as his weapon. The breathtaking underwater shots show the sharks in all of their menacing, enormous glory, and they simply behave as they naturally would. <em>Dangerous Animals</em> does not demonize them, instead making it clear that the true predator is toxic masculinity. Tucker’s philosophical attachment to the sharks and the shocking mayhem he causes make for a brutal, fast-paced viewing experience that hits you hard like a tidal wave.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-recommend-id="image://b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark swimming" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shark swimming" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Image Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-recommend-id="image://b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark swimming" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is known for being a shark hotspot, but that doesn’t stop five friends from partying there on a yacht, which ends up capsizing. Director Andrew Traucki was already known for another white-knuckle creature feature, <em>Black Water</em>, about a group of people stalked by a relentless saltwater crocodile in a swamp. Instead of clinging to the tops of mangrove trees, the protagonists in <em>The Reef</em> are forced to make a terrible choice: stay on board the sinking ship or swim twelve miles to the nearest island while a great white shark waits in between. The suspense of this decision, as well as who will be taken by the shark and when, is as razor-sharp as the predator’s teeth. Traucki’s use of actual shark footage gives the water scenes a chilling authenticity. The sequel, <em>The Reef: Stalked</em> (2022), follows an entirely different story in which a kayaking trip goes terribly wrong and is just as intense.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-recommend-id="image://7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking frightened at sharks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People looking frightened at sharks" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-recommend-id="image://7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking frightened at sharks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Filmed on digital video, <em>Open Water</em> makes an American couple’s harrowing experience stranded in the middle of the ocean after a scuba diving trip look like the worst home movie ever made. Based on a true story and using live sharks instead of CGI or mechanical ones, <em>Open Water</em> stands out as one of the most raw shark movies ever made. The sharks patiently circle the couple in the depths below, unlike Hollywood versions where they launch like missiles toward their prey. The film has an intimate, DIY aesthetic that puts you right there next to the couple: waves lap against the camera, natural daylight fades into a dark thunderstorm, and there is no way to see what lurks below. <em>Open Water</em> proves that shark movies do not have to be elaborate and effects-heavy in order to put viewers on the edge of their seat. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
