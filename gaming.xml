		<p>Velan Studios has released Midnight Murder Club into early access, their dark room party game twist on a first person shooter now available for PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The game comes in at $19.99 / £15.99, but also has a generous Guest Pass, allowing an owner of the game to bring in a full lobby of buddies using a free Guest Pass version of the game. As a multiplayer game being published by PlayStation, players will require a free PSN account on PC, and an active PS Plus subscription to play on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club - Early Access Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKc3OtSht98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Midnight Murder Club takes the first person shooter and drops it into the pitch-black rooms of Wormwood Manor. Up to six players enter this blacked-out arena with just a revolver and a flashlight, trying to figure out where the other players are from the sound of their movement, flickers of light and sparing use of the flashlight. This could find a niche within the social deduction genre, and could be a hit with Twitch streamer groups because of this.</p>
<p>There’s five game modes in the game as of its early access launch, as described by Velan Studios:</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Free-for-All</strong> – Six brave souls enter the mansion, and the player with the most kills when time runs out prevails among the rest.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Thief in the Night</strong> – Three fearless teams of two scour the mansion for valuable skulls to deposit into a vault. When the last vault closes, the team with the most value accumulated wins.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong> – Kill-or-be-killed with your team in a murderous stand-off.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Head Hunters</strong> – Two friends become foes as they hunt the remaining four players as they try to find and burn three hidden demonic totems in the haunting halls.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">New Game Mode: <strong>Wildcards</strong> – Valiant attendees will play cards from their collection that change the rules for everyone in-game in wild new ways! From hijacking the toys that appear in vendors, to giving everyone super speed, to exploding into flames when you die—use these cards to show your wild side! Then, when the dust settles and the match is over, you’ll be gifted brand new cards to add to your collection giving you even more ways to change the game.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">One of the best things about this release is how Velan is opening the door to as many players as possible. Only one person needs to buy and own the game in order to host a full lobby, thanks to the free Guest Pass version of the game. It’s a similar concept to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction’s</a> Friends Pass, or games with DLC that allows DLC-havers to invite DLC-have-nots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, Midnight Murder Club has full cross-play and cross-progression.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Velan has also laid out what can be expected through Early Access with a dev diary roadmap:</p>
<p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club Dev Diary - Early Access Roadmap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXZgyRQv16M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">A new PvE mode is planned to release this spring, for example, while the summer will see more Toys added, as well as custom game modes. All of this is subject to change, though, depending on how the game’s community grows and feeds back on what they like and want more of in the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With this game Velan Studios is establishing a track record of cooking up new and inventive multiplayer games. A few years ago they launched <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/31/hands-on-the-knockout-city-cross-play-beta/">Knockout City</a>, a quirky riff on dodgeball that was rather fun and vibrant, but sadly didn’t quite find its audience under the EA Originals publishing arm, and couldn’t recover <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/25/knockout-city-is-going-free-to-play-and-leaving-ea-behind-velan-self-publishing/">after going independent and free-to-play</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">shutting down in 2023</a>. Here’s hoping Midnight Murder Club strikes a cord with more people!</p>

The examples included an AI voice telling a player who to pick in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and a chatbot explaining how to craft wood planks in <em>Minecraft</em>. The program also offered feedback on past in-game failures in <em>Age of Empires</em> and could be used to pull up strategy guides if the player remained stuck.</p><p>Perhaps the silliest use case presented in the podcast was telling the Copilot AI to install a game which, if communicating with Copilot via text at least, would seemingly require several more taps and clicks than just doing that manually (a process that already takes only seconds on mobile).

Instead of telling me how to do a thing in a game, maybe it could just do it for me, like a more experienced friend would if they were playing with me. Maybe the Copilot can show my kid how to grow food to keep his workers from starving during the winter in <em>Overthrown</em> instead of him asking me every five minutes. </p><p>The use cases quickly snowball from there, however, and probably not in a direction Microsoft wants. Why stop at helping me control my console more easily or bypass a frustrating part of a game? Why not have the Xbox Copilot do my dailies for me and grind random encounters in my favorite JRPG while I scroll TikTok? Let the AI grind the battle pass and pop achievements. One reason not to do that might be that I don’t want Copilot spying on me and my family. Or, if it eventually becomes a paid service like it will presumably have to be in order to be financially sustainable, even the cheevos it could earn for me wouldn’t be worth it.<br></p><p>We’ll see how useful, frightening, or silly the tool ends up being once it’s out. In the meantime, Microsoft also revealed that over 1,000 games like <em>Balatro </em>are now Play Anywhere between Xbox and PC, and the number is expected to keep rising.

Patch 1.2 is out now, and alongside fixes and improvements, there's both a barber shop and Steam Workshop modding support added to the massive RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The barber shop is the first of "several" planned free DLCs, per a press release from Warhorse, and will let protagonist Henry visit the barber to change up his hairstyle. There's also an option for either a clean-shaven or rugged appearance, as well as facial hair ranging from stubble to beard. A new haircut will, just like in real life, give Henry a temporary boost to charisma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.2 (massive patch notes below!) addresses over 1,000 fixes and improvements, including equipment and NPC behavior, as well as gameplay balance. Specifically, developer Warhorse Studios tackled country-specific localization as well. The new patch for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 refines the Chinese translations, both Traditional and Simplified, improves the Korean font for clarity, and has a newly recorded French voiceover.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for modding, dedicated Steam modding support has arrived alongside the barber DLC and Patch 1.2. The toolkit allows players to tinker with over 300 elements in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, ranging from user interface and combat mechanics to AI behavior. "Whether making subtle tweaks or complete overhauls, the possibilites for customization are vast," Warhorse said. The studio plans on discussing these updates further during a developer stream, set for March 20, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additional content is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-sets-stage-for-3-expansions-in-2025">expected to roll out for the historical RPG throughout the year</a>, with its first paid content drop "Brushes with Death" set for this summer. The Legacy of the Forge expansion is expected in autumn, and then this winter, Warhorse aims to release Mysteria Ecclesia, which involves a covert mission in the Sedlec Monastery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest from Warhorse Studios doesn't show any sign of slowing down in sales, either.

In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">our own review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 at IGN</a>, the RPG got high marks for its melee combat, story, and a "truly dynamic" open-world sandbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?

            <p>
It's only been six months since Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's well-received arrival, but developer Saber Interactive would already like you to know it's working on a sequel. Yup, Space Marine 3 is officially announced, but that's pretty much all we know so far.
</p>
<p>
Mainly, that's because it's extremely early days for Space Marine 3, with Saber confirming the game is only "now starting" development. The studio does, however, promise the next instalment of its third-person sci-fi shooter series will be an "even more immersive experience" and introduce "large-scale battles that are even more spectacular". And it seems safe to assume it'll once again follow the adventures of Ultramarines Captain Demetrian Titus, seeing as he pops up in Space Marine 3's single bit of promotional art. 
</p>
<p>
"Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games," it says. "We will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment."

<p>
As for Space Marine 2, it looks there's still plenty of life left in it. Saber confirms it'll "continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years" while it works on its newly announced sequel. And next up for Space Marine 2 is update 7.0, which is set to include the likes of private PvP lobbies, a new Operation and PvE weapon, plus reworks for class weapon loadouts and weapon perks balancing.
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 enjoyed a strong critical and commercial reception when it launched last September. Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane called it a "spectacular and mostly thrilling follow-up" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">his four star review</a>, and it would go on to enjoy the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">Warhammer 40K series' most successful Steam launch yet</a>. Which bodes well for a Space Marine 3.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Where do you go after ten years as a live service game? That’s the question that’s been hanging over <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> for the last few years. The game is fully formed with plenty of maps, more spec ops characters than it’s wise to shake a stick at, and a mature esports scene that still surrounds it. Rainbow Six Siege X is Ubisoft’s answer, a major update and overhaul to the game coming in June 2025.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X is an attack on two fronts. On the one hand, this is a deep technical uplift that’s aiming to refine the core experience, add some new options for gameplay and make this game feel a bit more 2020s than 2010s, and on the other, there’s Dual Front, a new game mode that looks to make the most of having ‘Six’ in the game’s name.</p>
<p><iframe title="R6 Siege X: New Dual Front 6v6 Mode" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/li443iqd3Xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s start with the glitz and excitement that a new mode offers. Dual Front is a new permanent mode for the game, taking the core attack-and-defence gameplay and expanding it into something much more freeform and dynamic. This is a 6v6 mode, instead of the usual 5v5, and it tasks you with attacking and defending at the same time.</p>
<p>There’s just the tiniest hint of MOBA to this idea, in a concentrated form, as the map has two lanes – one dedicated that you can attack down and one that you need to defend –&nbsp;with the goal to capture each sector in turn and eventually neutralise the opposition base. Both teams have a practically identical experience, with the map a mirror image, though with one side having a run-down red brick look and the other a more renovated feel so that it’s possible to read where you are.</p>


<p>It’s a big map, with each sector feeling like a half or two-thirds sized version of a Siege map, still giving plenty of room for different attack options for the randomised objective placement. In the middle there’s then a neutral zone, an area where assignments can appear, such as a hostage rescue, giving you a bit of a boost.</p>
<p>The juggling act for your team is whether to prioritise attack or defence, trying to figure out and counter whatever it is that the opposition is doing at the same time. The mode is still very restricted and constrained in similar ways to the rest of Rainbow Six Siege, so you can only attack sectors one at a time, and only after the defenders have had some time to prepare. There’s also a bit of a catch up mechanic, so if one team pulls ahead, then the other team needs less time to plant and capture a zone.</p>

<p>It’s a really interesting concept, but it’s initially quite a messy one without an established team around you. It feels like there’s less room for freelancing here, as you do need to coordinate the balance between attack and defence, and to construct a sensible mix of operators. Each season will have a curated pool of operators to choose from, but there’s a mix of attacking and defending characters, giving a wider set of gadgets and abilities to use.</p>
<p>What will be important is how Ubisoft take this foundation and continue to push it forward over the coming seasons and years. Alongside Dual Front, Siege X is also bringing big changes to the underlying game engine and features. Stay tuned for those in around an hour…</p>

			<p>Focus Entertainment Publishing and Saber Interactive have just <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1900226944853004392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the surprise announcement that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 is already in development.</p>
<p>Now, don't get us wrong—there was never any doubt that a sequel would be made, given the resounding commercial success of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, which, last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold five million units in less than three months on the market</a>. However, the timing is definitely sooner than anticipated, especially as the development team is still updating and expanding Space Marine 2. Indeed, the press release makes it a point to stress that an ambitious content roadmap is still planned for Space Marine 2, including the upcoming release of the Horde mode.</p>
<p>Anyway, Saber is promising even more spectacular and more large scale battles in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3. Here's what John Bert, Deputy CEO of Focus Entertainment Publishing, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We have been honored by the incredible response from fans following the launch of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. We will continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years. Today, we are thrilled to announce that the adventure will continue with Space Marine 3. Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games. Developed in close collaboration with Games Workshop, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 will take the genre to new heights by introducing large-scale battles that are even more spectacular.</em></p>
<p>Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive, added:</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber. ​ It is the culmination of everything we have learned about game development in our 25 years in the business. ​ We are now starting to develop Space Marine 3, a game that carries with it tremendous expectations from our rapidly expanding fanbase. ​ While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third installment. We view this as an opportunity to create a true love letter to the Warhammer 40.000 universe</em>.</p>
<p>What are you most looking for Saber to improve in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3?</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/news/focus-entertainment-publishing-announces-the-development-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the two studios, as well as&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>IP holder Games Workshop, confirm that the game is coming, and that it'll offer "intense, brutal, and spectacular gameplay" while remaining "true to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>

<p>Focus deputy CEO John Bert says you can look forward to an "immersive campaign" in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, as well as multiplayer gameplay and "innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-3-confirmed-space-marine-2.jpg?itok=4qHDQBSZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-3-confirmed-space-marine-2.jpg?itok=ly2ZbcLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 3&nbsp;</em>has officially been confirmed.</figcaption></figure><p>Bert also promises "large-scale battles that are even more spectacular", so if you thought the hordes of Tyranids that swarmed your squad in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>were impressive, it sounds like you ain't seen nothing yet.</p>

<p>Saber CEO Matthew Karch, meanwhile, says&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>was "transformative" for his company, and that while he acknowledges the "tremendous expectations" surrounding&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, he's confident his team can create "a true love letter to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>

<p>Further details about the game are scarce at the moment, but judging by the very short teaser, we'll be seeing the return of Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. If the past two&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>games are anything to go by, you'll likely be fighting the forces of Chaos at some point as well.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>had sold <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1879948638245261796" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over six million copies</a> at last count, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the game is getting a followup, but it's nice nonetheless.</p>




<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>folks are also currently working on a game that will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">utilize a "tentpole" Hasbro IP</a>, although that IP hasn't been revealed yet.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Focus and Saber are cooking up for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>.

            <p>
Saber and Focus Entertainment Publishing have announced Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3, another bloody serving of Adeptus Astarting with a fresh single player campaign and multiplayer component, plus unspecified "innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games". Saber will work on the new action game alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which they assure us will continue to receive updates for "years".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The press release in question is crammed to the visor with talk of "new heights" and suchlike, but does not, alas, contain any real details about Space Marin3, or any images beyond some key art depicting Demetrian Titus, the hero of the first two games. Still, it seems safe to say that he'll be taking his chainsword to a different bunch of marauding aliens and heretics in the threequel. The first Space Marine was all about Orks and Chaos, the second one was Tyranids and Chaos. Maybe the Drukhari and Chaos next time? Possibly the T'au Empire? I've heard they're actually quite nice.
</p>
<p>
The line about "redefining the standards of third-person action" is from John Bert, Focus Entertainment Publishing's deputy CEO. There's also some chinwaggery in the release from Saber SEO Matthew Karch, who notes that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">well-wrought</a> and best-selling Space Marine 2 has been "transformative" for Saber, a company that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-3d-realms-slipgate-metro-devs-and-more-with-them">until recently languished in the claws of cheery job-loss merchants Embracer</a>. "While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment," Karch writes. 
</p>
<p>
The release concludes with the note that parent company Pullup Entertainment (previously Focus Entertainment - I guess they've decided they need to hit the gym more often) have a revenue announcement on April 17th 2025. Perhaps we'll hear more about Space Marine 3 then. 

</p>
<p>Any hopes to share at this point? I would like a more knowing take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">the Imperium's fascism</a>. I would also like Titus to get himself all chopped up and converted into a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dreadnought">Dreadnought</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I made it through countless ship battles with a half-finished crew before I dove into the assignment menus.

There are three: <strong>Cannon Squad</strong>, <strong>Boarding Squad</strong>, and <strong>Support Squad</strong>.</p><h2 id="h13318"><a id=""></a><strong>Cannon Squad</strong></h2><p>Your Cannon Squad is relatively self-explanatory. These brave men and women act as your first line of offense, manning the various port and starboard cannons during a naval battle. Should you take damage during said battle, a few will divert their attention to repairs, keeping the Goromaru floating.</p><p>To maximize your Cannon Squad, opt for <strong>Cannon Power </strong>and <strong>Ship Upkeep</strong> skills to help bolster damage and increase healing capabilities.</p><h2 id="h13319"><a id=""></a><strong>Boarding Squad</strong></h2><p>While your Cannon Squad launches its first assault, your Boarding Squad launches the follow-up, close-quarters battle to take command of an enemy vessel in forward-facing combat. When you slam into an enemy ship, the crewmates assigned to your boarding squad, alongside Majima, jump across the gap to swing swords.</p><p>To make the most of your Boarding Squad, choose skills that will significantly enhance the <strong>Attack </strong>and <strong>Defense </strong>of each combatant.</p><h2 id="h13320"><a id=""></a><strong>Support Squad</strong></h2><p>The Gorumara’s Support Squad is the only unit in your misfit pirate crew that won’t fight in open combat. They’re background actors, helping to buff your other squads through passive abilities.</p><p>Some of the pirates you recruit simply won’t hold their own in a sword fight, so assign them to the Support Squad to help boost, say, combat potential or healing capabilities for the whole crew.</p><hr><p>With the right crew meta, you’ll find that no battle is too harsh, not even the dreaded giant squid lurking in the waters around Madlantis. <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Publisher Focus Entertainment has announced that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 is officially in development. The game will once again be developed by Saber Interactive.</p>



<p>“Your duty is not done,” the publisher posted on social media. “We’re pleased to announce that the development for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 has officially begun…”</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 released <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17120/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to favorable reviews</a> from both critics and players alike. A follow up to 2011’s Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, the latest game has sold more than 5 million copies as of November 2024.</p>



<p>“”We have been honored by the incredible response from fans following the launch of&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2,” John Bert, Deputy CEO of Focus Entertainment Publishing, said. “We will continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years.&nbsp;Today&nbsp;we are thrilled to announce that the adventure will continue with&nbsp;Space Marine 3. </p>



<p>“Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games. Developed in close collaboration with Games Workshop,&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3&nbsp;will take the genre to new heights by introducing large-scale battles that are even more spectacular.” </p>



<p>While it took 13 years between releases of the first two games, it shouldn’t be expected to take that long between Space Marine 2 and 3. That said, details on the next game are limited due to it being so early in development. More information on the game will be revealed at a later date.</p>



<p>What do you think of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 being in development? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/" data-ref-id="5000-285282">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, and alongside that a new permanent game mode coming to the shooter, Dual Front. Dual Front is a 6v6 game mode featuring respawns, but it still preserves the tactical elements that Siege is known for.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual Front takes place on a single large map, split into two lanes heading from one team's base to the other. Each lane consists of two sectors, which teams will have to capture one at a time by planting sabotage devices, similar to planting bombs in the main game mode. The two biggest differences here are that each team has six players and that teams will need to manage both attacking the new enemy sector while still defending their own. Teams can split up however they like, and after dying you have a roughly 30-second timer before you can get back in the fight. There is also a neutral zone in the middle where optional objectives, like escorting a hostage to a helicopter, appear, granting a bonus to the team that successfully completes it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4458873-r6_siegex_screenshots_final_2025.02.21_screenshot_3_4klarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4458873-r6_siegex_screenshots_final_2025.02.21_screenshot_3_4klarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458873"></a><figcaption>Dual Front takes place in a large industrial area, with smaller areas like a Gas Station making up the sectors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4458873-r6_siegex_screenshots_final_2025.02.21_screenshot_3_4klarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another big difference is the operator pool. There is a limited number of operators in the pool, 35 at launch, which will get rotated on a regular basis. The pool contains both attackers and defenders, which you can pick from freely. This means you can grab a defense-focused operator and go on the attack or vice versa, creating new strategic ways to try and win a match. Matches are expected to take around 20-25 minutes, and there is a timer automatically ending a match at 30 minutes. When Siege X launches, there will be one map featuring symmetrical lanes, but Ubisoft plans on updating and changing the map each season.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-closed-beta-starts-today-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530117/" data-ref-id="1100-6530117">Dual Front closed beta begins today</a>, and you can sign up now.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual Front is just one of the many new features coming to Rainbow Six Siege X when it launches on June 10 as part of Y10 S2 of the multiplayer shooter.</p>

            <p>Earlier this month and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">a few unintentional slips</a>, Activision officially announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4</a> are coming back, with the two games getting remade from the ground up.</p>
<p>If you are anything like me, one of the things you will recall fondly when thinking back to those hazy days of playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 on their initial release are the games' soundtracks. Grinding and flipping along to the likes of Alien Ant Farm and Sum 41. Ah, those were the days.</p>
<p>Anyway, with the upcoming combined remakes, players are probably interested in finding out what the soundtrack will include. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">On that initial announcement</a>, Activision promised the remakes will include songs from the original games such as Ace of Spades by Motörhead, as well as new tracks which "capture the spirit of modern skate culture". And now, we know more songs that will be included on the games' combined rerelease, thanks to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU4xkATYcbh7">Spotify</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-of-thps-3-4-remastereds-soundtrack-revealed-song-list-so-far">IGN</a>).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-update-1-2-adds-steam-workshop-mod-integration-barbers-and-lots-more.1133742/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-update-1-2-adds-steam-workshop-mod-integration-barbers-and-lots-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warhorse Studios announced that Kingdom Come Deliverance II has received another major free update, version 1.2. Its highlights are the addition of native mod integration through Steam Workshop support and the new barber feature.</p>
<p>The former will allow players to more easily download and install mods into the game rather than jump through various hoops <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as they had to do until now</a>. The caveat is, of course, that the mod has to be available on Steam Workshop. At the time of writing, there are only four mods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412838982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Saving</a> provides the player with a Saviour Schnapps item every time they use or lose one, effectively providing infinite saving.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442455418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helmet of Henry VIII</a> adds a horned helmet for Henry to wear.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442495480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tourist</a> disables NPC reactions to trespassing, opening up several story places that would normally be inaccessible.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3440052578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pebbles the Zebra</a> visually transforms Henry's horse into a zebra.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the modding section will undoubtedly soon be populated with many more mods. Right now, there are over a thousand Kingdom Come Deliverance II mods available on Nexus. While it is unlikely the Steam Workshop section will ever be just as big, several mods should be on both platforms soon.</p>
<p>Henry can also now go to a barber NPC in Zhelejov and Kuttenberg to get a haircut and optionally also pick a new beard style. Regardless of the actual choice, going to a barber will temporarily buff Henry's Charisma stat.</p>
<p>The 1.2 update is much bigger than just those two features, though, as you can glean from scrolling through the lengthy patch notes article <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the game's website</a>. Warhorse says it introduces more than a thousand between fixes and improvements to nearly every aspect of the game. A lot of that has to do with balancing, but there are also enhancements to various animations and NPC behaviors, such as the crime system, which should now be more accurate. The daily NPCs schedules have been fine-tuned, and there are improvements to horse riding, horse trading, character visuals, and performance, especially in Kuttenberg (the largest city in Kingdom Come Deliverance II) and the biggest battles.</p>
<p>Warhorse plans to discuss all of these tweaks in greater detail during a developer stream next Thursday. The studio won't stop working on the game, either, given that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the 2025 roadmap</a>, three premium DLCs are coming in spring, summer, and winter. The excellent open world roleplaying game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units in its first two weeks and the Czech studio certainly wants to ride that success as much as possible.</p>

I found myself utterly delighted by how the simplistic idea of methodically cleaning grime off a surface with a destructive power tool lit up my brain. Since its release in 2022, the game has exploded in complexity and content with crossover content packs that approach <em>Fortnite</em> levels of wacky metaverse shenanigans. There’s a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/29/powerwash-simulator-dives-into-bikini-bottom/"><em>SpongeBob</em> pack</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23561389/why-is-lara-crofts-mansion-so-damn-dirty-i-must-know">a <em>Tomb Raider</em> pack</a>, and even a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23601203/final-fantasy-7-powerwash-simulator-dlc-corporate-environmental-disasters"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> pack</a> that lets you valiantly attempt to clean up the perpetually dirty streets of Midgar.</p><p>The developers at FuturLab tapped into something unique, and made <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>standout amidst a veritable ocean of simulator games and it seems like <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is primed to do the same. It launches this year on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teardown">Teardown</a> is one of those games that's just fun to look at, with all of its completely destructible voxel environments. When it first got announced it kind of reminded me of those old Flash games where you had simple creatures you could shake around and chuck stuff at, the joy of it being to see how far you could push things.</p>
<p>Messing around like that is all the better with friends though, I reckon, and would you look at that, developer Tuxedo Labs have just announced today that a multiplayer update is on the way to the sandbox game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As shared in a press release, it's not just a simple matter of being able to bust up buildings to you and your friends' hearts' content, as there'll be campaign co-op, competitive, and sandbox modes in what's described as the game's "largest update" yet. All you have to do is check the Teardown subreddit to see how highly requested a feature multiplayer is. There was even a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeardownGame/comments/rsbf1v/teardown_multiplayer_has_been_released/">multiplayer mod released a few years back</a>, so this will be welcome news I'm sure.
</p>

<p>
The multiplayer update will launch initially through the game's Experimental Branch on Steam, and the team will be looking for feedback. Modders might be especially inclined to give it a go, as additions to Teardown's API are planned for around the same time to help people update existing mods to work in multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date in sight for the multiplayer update, not even a release window, just a promise that it's "coming later this year." Teardown's been on my list to pick up pretty much since it came out, just one of those games that got away from me, but the opportunity to cause a little bit of destructive mischief with some friends sounds pretty appealing right now.

            <p>
I'm often put off by gimmicky horror games, but sometimes I see one and think "yeah, that'll be a laugh." This time around it's Eyes Never Wake, the debut survival horror from developer Allan Hedlund. Where some horror games in recent years have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shout-your-dogs-name-into-your-microphone-to-find-him-in-this-horror-game">used your microphone to track how loud you're being</a>, Eyes Never Wake uses your webcam to track whether your face is present or not.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In Eyes Never Wake, the monster that's trying to hunt you down can't see you if your face isn't visible on screen. The trailer quite cleverly shows this by smoothly cutting from gameplay to real world footage of the player ducking down to hide from the incoming threat.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
It's quite obvious the game takes some cues from modern creepypastas like The Backrooms, and I think the monster design itself is a bit generically naff, but I do think the idea of slamming my head into my desk just to avoid being spotted is pretty funny. It's sort of like an evil but less emotionally devastating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-story-game-is-controlled-by-blinking-into-your-webcam">Before Your Eyes</a>.
</p>
<p>
You might ask "can I not just turn my webcam away so the monster can never see me", to which the game answers, "no, because there are doors that require in-world facial recognition scans in order to open them" - and it <em>also</em> uses your microphone, so it might hear you anyway. 
</p>
<p>
The trailer doesn't reveal much about what Eyes Never Wake involves beyond the cam-ducking idea, so I can only hope it also has things like well-designed layouts and decent pacing. Mostly, though, I'm just excited by a dev playing with the medium while considering the real, physical presence of a player.
</p>
<p>
No word on a release date, but if you're into this game that YouTubers like Markiplier are guaranteed to play, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526200/Eyes_Never_Wake/">wishlist it here</a>.

<p>MADFINGER Games has revealed the Winds of War update (0.3), coming soon to Gray Zone Warfare, an open-ended tactical extraction shooter released in April 2024. It’s a massive, community-led update that is positively packed with new features and changes, and as a fan of the game, I’m here for all of it.</p>



<p>At the heart of the update are changes to the game’s PvP mechanics, which will encourage players to actively engage in fights with one another. But beyond that, there are <strong>many </strong>features that will improve the game’s realism, quality of life, and accessibility.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into what we know about Winds of War, the next update for Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paradigm-shift">Paradigm Shift</h2>



<p>I’ve already covered the PvP changes coming to Gray Zone Warfare in another walkthrough, so feel free to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-gameplay-loop-pvp/">check that one out here on Insider Gaming</a>.</p>



<p>I can’t stress how much the Winds of War update is filling me with anticipation for the future of Gray Zone Warfare. I recently sat down with MADFINGER Games’ Rick Lagnese to go through everything that’s coming to this stunning open-world tactical shooter, which has sold 1.5 million units since being released in April 2024.</p>



<p>The immersion and realism in Gray Zone Warfare is being bolstered in Winds of War.</p>



<p>For instance, the dynamic weather system is being introduced and fully fleshed out, and some of the effects, such as rain, are nothing short of jaw-dropping. Having seen them first-hand before the update was revealed, I can attest to the depth these mechanics will add to the open world of Lamang.</p>



<p>This weather system includes storms, fog, wind, and sun, and every setting has an impact on the game’s world. There’s even a forecast system that’ll allow you to plan your raids more effectively. </p>



<p>The team at MADFINGER has also updated the game’s health system and changed how you’ll fight and stay alive. The new mechanic that allows you to drag downed teammates into cover is something I’m very interested in.</p>



<p>On that note, playing as a squad will now offer an enhanced experience, with dynamic, real-time tasks popping up as you explore the game’s open world. These tasks will be much more challenging and will <strong>actively require </strong>a dedicated team for them to be completed, but similar events will also be up for grabs for solo operators.</p>



<p>In terms of accessibility, localisation has been expanded, with more translated content being available. The team has made sure that <strong>eleven </strong>languages are represented in the Winds of War update. </p>



<p>The quality-of-life change I’m most looking forward to is the ability to radio back to base when you’ve completed a task, rather than needing to call in a chopper and go back just to seek confirmation of completion. That’s a game-changer, and in the massive open-world environment of Lamang, it’s a sorely needed upgrade.</p>



<p>Oh, and MADFINGER is working to eradicate LZ camping in the Winds of War update, so look forward to that!</p>



<p>What change are you most looking forward to as part of the Winds of War update? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

In the lead up to its release, Activision is putting together <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU4xkATYcbh7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official THPS 3 + 4 playlist on Spotify</a> and continually updating it as it reveals more and more of the song list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first wave of tracks have just been revealed, and here are the songs we currently know of for the THPS 3 + 4 Remastered soundtrack:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>"Ace of Spades" by Motörhead</li><li>"Them Bones" by Alice in Chains</li><li>"Ultimate" by Denzel Curry</li><li>"Damaged Goods" by Gang of Four</li><li>"96 Quite Bitter Beings" by CKY</li><li>"Yankee and the Brave (Ep. 4)" by Run the Jewels</li><li>"King of the Beach" by Wavves</li><li>"Real Thing" by Turnstile</li><li>"Not the Same" by Bodyjar</li><li>"New Wage Slavery" by End It</li><li>"Head" by Jeff Rosenstock</li><li>"Collard Greens" by Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar</li><li>"Outta Here" by KRS-One</li><li>"Result" by TCMF</li><li>"Dog Years" by Urethane</li><li>"Charlotte" by Kittie</li><li>"Mass Appeal" by Gang Starr</li><li>"Faster than the World" by H20</li><li>"Roadkill" by Starcrawler</li><li>"Amoeba" by Adolescents</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, those who get the deluxe edition of the game, or access it through Xbox Game Pass, will also get a full band version of the Doom E1M1 theme song "At Doom's Gate" as a playable track (along with the Doom Slayer and Revenant skater skins).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I'd love to hear Guttermouth's "I'm Destroying the World" and AFI's "The Boy Who Destroyed the World" from THPS 3 make comebacks, as well as Bad Religion's "Big Bang" and Flogging Molly's "Drunken Lullabies" from THPS 4. That's mostly because I'm a washed up old punk kid. However, it's an opportunity to discover new music and celebrate the scene as it is today, bridging the gap between the new and old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-remake-review">as was the case with THPS 1 + 2 Remastered</a> from 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">preorder THPS 3 + 4 Remastered's deluxe or collector's edition</a> can access the playable demo right now which includes two parks, two skaters, and a limited soundtrack. An exclusive physical Birdhouse skate deck also comes with the collector's edition. You'll also be able to access the full game early on July 8, three days ahead of its official release date.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
