The clear winner is Lugia V (Alternate Full Art) 186/195, which has surged 68% since July to $427, cementing itself as the set’s chase card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainer Gallery standouts like Rayquaza VMAX TG20/TG30 and Blaziken VMAX TG15/TG30 have also doubled or tripled in value thanks to strong artwork and nostalgia, while even Lugia VSTAR continues climbing on competitive strength. At the same time, cards like Regidrago V (Alternate Art) and Alolan Vulpix VSTAR have cooled as the meta shifted away from them, with values slipping back toward the $12–$14 range. </p><p id="snag-classic-mega-evolution-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards">Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards Before Market Rise</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The market for XY-era Mega Evolution Pokémon cards is heating up fast ahead of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and the upcoming Mega Evolution TCG set. Collectors aren’t waiting for modern reprints, they’re chasing the originals, and prices are showing it. Some cards have exploded in value, while others have steadied after sharp climbs, creating both momentum plays and entry points for buyers. Leading the surge is M Rayquaza EX (Shiny Full Art - Ancient Origins), which has skyrocketed over 426% this year, from $275 in January to $1,450 today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">M Gengar EX (Secret Rare - Phantom Forces) isn’t far behind, up nearly fivefold to $415, cementing its place as one of the most sought-after Megas. Other heavy-hitters include M Rayquaza EX (Full Art - Roaring Skies), now at $656, M Charizard EX (X - Flashfire) climbing past $349, and Primal Groudon EX (Shiny Full Art), which has more than doubled to $349. These climbers show how nostalgia, unique mechanics, and iconic artwork are driving a collector frenzy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But not every Mega Evolution is running away in price. Some cards have plateaued after strong early-year gains, leaving a rare buying window before the next spike. M Mewtwo EX (Full Art - BREAKthrough) climbed from $37 to $145 but has leveled off in recent weeks, while M Alakazam EX (Full Art - Fates Collide) sits steady just under $100 after jumping from $28 earlier this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Charizard is showing signs of cooling, M Charizard EX (Generations) and M Charizard EX (Full Art - Evolutions) have tripled since January but are holding in the $190-$200 range for now. These pauses don’t signal weakness; rather, they reflect consolidation before the broader Mega Evolution wave hits with new set releases. For collectors and investors, the message is clear: the grails are climbing fast, but the plateaued cards may be the smarter pickups before Mega hype takes over the market again.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Crown Zenith Prices Are Rising</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crown Zenith market has been showing two very different stories this month. On one hand, several Galarian Gallery Ultra Rares are slipping as hype fades, with fan-favorites like Leafeon VSTAR and Suicune V dropping more than 20% from their peaks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, the gold Secret Rares are climbing steadily, led by Giratina VSTAR and Arceus VSTAR, as collectors chase the scarce, high-end pieces of the set. This split reflects a maturing market: casual collectors are less interested in mid-tier Eeveelutions and V cards, while serious players and investors are doubling down on the big four golds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the crashers, Leafeon VSTAR has fallen from nearly $50 to the $43 range, and Glaceon VSTAR is down 26% since February, hovering in the mid-$30s. Deoxys VMAX has slipped under $37, while Suicune V and Raikou V both lost more than a quarter of their value since spring. These are still striking artworks, but set fatigue and limited competitive relevance are pushing prices down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the climbers are commanding all the attention. Giratina VSTAR (Secret) has surged nearly 20% since July to $180, making it the definitive chase of Crown Zenith. Mewtwo VSTAR is also up more than 30% this summer, with its Charizard battle artwork driving collector demand. Rounding out the gains, Arceus VSTAR, Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR, and Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR are all trending higher as well, thanks to their powerful abilities and limited supply. Taken together, the set still holds broad collector appeal, but it’s clear the market is consolidating around the golden Secret Rares as the safest long-term holds.</p><p id="first-party-switch-2-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="First Party Switch 2 Preorders">First Party Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s 2025 first-party lineup is shaping up to be one of its strongest in years. Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set to arrive in October, followed closely by Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 bundled together for Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then in December, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond lands with its own set of new amiibo figures, alongside Kirby’s big return in Kirby Air Riders.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake from Ubisoft being in the works is one of the videogame industry's currently running open secrets. It's not been officially announced, but there have been several <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake/">rumors</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">leaks</a> pointing towards it being in development for years now, not to mention the fact that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">previously confirmed that remakes of Assassin's Creed games are coming</a>. </p>



<p>But as it's still not officially confirmed, everything we know about it should, technically, be taken with a grain of salt. Today, a new rumor from Jeux Vidéo Magazine, who have previously reported accurate unannounced information about the Assassin's Creed series, added more salt to the pile, though in a slightly unexpected way.</p>



<p>In the video, Jeux Vidéo Magazine alleges that there are a few significant changes being made to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag for this remake. One major change is that the game will reportedly lean more into the RPG side of Assassin's Creed that's been building since the release of Assassin's Creed Origins. Edward will even have stats for his gear.</p>



<p>Jeux Vidéo Magazine also claims that the parts of the game set in the modern day are being removed and replaced by more time spent with Edward Kenway on various pirating adventures. The map isn't getting bigger, but there will be new quests and more to do in the game, loading screens between being in your ship and being on land are gone, it'll bring back content that was cut from the game back in 2013, and it'll be out sometime in the first half of 2026, potentially during March, were among the other big claims Jeux Vidéo Magazine made regarding the remake.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Exclu ! Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag Remake : Nos 1ères INFORMATIONS en EXCLUSIVITÉ 🔥" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qngrBQnukFc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Again, the remake itself hasn't even been confirmed by Ubisoft, so take all of these claims with the appropriate amount of salt, even considering that Jeux Vidéo Magazine has been right with leaks similar to this in the past. </p>



<p>But if even a few of those claims end up being true, specifically the removal of modern-day elements and the gameplay changes to make everything lean more towards Ubisoft's RPG era of Assassin's Creed games, then this will be a fairly significant remake compared to the original.</p>



<p>It also opens up interesting thoughts about the rest of the remakes Guillemot has confirmed Ubisoft is working on. Will the rest of the series get a makeover to be closer to the RPGs of late? Are each of the modern-day sections in the games going to be overhauled in some way? Ubisoft has previously discussed that it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-talks-about-the-modern-setting-storyline-in-shadows/">struggled with merging the modern-day story into its historical epics</a>. Could this be a step towards beginning to do away with it or permanently change it?</p>



<p>Those, and a lot more questions, open up if some of these alleged changes end up being true. We'll see what the truth is when Ubisoft finally does announce the remake.</p>

According to the official <a href="https://www.gama.org/page/GSD" rel="nofollow">Game Store Day website</a>, GAMA was inspired by similar events like Independent Bookstore Day, Record Store Day, and the American Library Association's International Gaes Month.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Game Store Day was created to spotlight and support our retail game store members while establishing a day for the industry to celebrate the joy of playing games," said GAMA Executive Director John Stacy about the event. "Timed with the American Library Association’s International Games Month and the start of the holiday shopping season, it’s a meaningful way to bring communities together and champion local game stores as cultural hubs.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This elevation of the tabletop hobby and of FLGS communities is an extension of GAMA code of conduct. The non-profit organization has helped enrich marginalized tabletop creatives through their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2024-gama-horizons-fellowship-offers-grants-to-diverse-creators-and-businesses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA Horizons Fellowship</a> program, curating their community by suspending bad actors like alt-right grifter <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jon-del-arroz-suspended-from-gama" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jon Del Arroz</a>, and fighting for the health of the tabletop industry by filing lawsuits against <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-joins-second-anti-tariff-lawsuit-against-trump-administration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unlawful tariffs</a>.</p>

<p>At time of writing, it is unclear how structured the Game Store Day annual event will be. Given that most hobby stores tend to accommodate to either <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, or <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, there's a chance one of those games can serve as a tentpole. Either way, the attempt to highlight the joy of playing in-person at a table is an admirable one.</p>

            <p>
There are a bevy of games available in the world that let you play as what can only be described as "a little guy." However, you can throw all of them out of the window, because I have found the game that has the perfect iteration of such a creature. It is called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/letters-to-arralla">Letters to Arralla</a>, and in it you quite simply play as a turnip, who has the juiciest derriere I've ever seen in perhaps any game ever. Yes, even more so than one of those anime gacha games, this turnip's rump has got some serious jiggle physics.
</p>
<p>
A turnip with a pleasant dumptruck does not a game make, though, so here's the lowdown: you deliver mail! There are plenty of equally funny "little guys" who you can bring mail to on an Australian island, with the added benefit of being able to open said mail. As the game's Steam page notes, this is a crime - no, really, don't read other people's mail, it's not allowed - but apparently in Letter to Arralla's world it's encouraged!
</p>

<p>
Said pieces of mail include pictogram puzzles you have to solve, and throughout your journey you'll also need to help the island's inhabitants figure out personal problems. There's no pressure to do anything at any particular time, you're welcome to play around, "throw stuff," and even "call your mum!"
</p><p>
We might be heading into autism in this hemisphere, but Australian developer Little Pink Clouds will slowly be making their way towards summer, and that's exactly the kind of vibe this game gives off. Summer is arguably a video game genre unto itself, with games like Super Mario Sunshine, Outrun, and Boku no Natsuyasumi all being peak examples of such a thing. I think Letters to Arralla could fit quite neatly into that, so it's one I hope to be able to make time for. Even if it's only to warm myself back up again.
</p>
<p>
It's also out today! And you can pick it up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2189310/Letters_to_Arralla/">here</a>.

                <p>EA's new Skate game--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-new-skate-game-in-15-years-is-out-now-and-its-free/1100-6534774/" data-ref-id="1100-6534774">the first in 15 years</a>--launched today into early access, and the free-to-play game is proving popular enough that players are facing server queues due to the player load. Developer Full Circle has now reacted to player complaints about server queues. At the same time, people are logging into the game to find it requires a constant internet connection--something Full Circle warned about months ago but isn't going down well with the community today</p><h2><strong>Server queues</strong></h2><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968012562668179865" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, developer Full Circle said there are "a LOT" of players trying to join the Skate servers today for launch, and that to mitigate the issues, server queues have been put in place. Full Circle said the studio is "on it" and will undertake efforts to improve wait times.</p><p>Server queues are nothing new for online games. EA's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> has server queues for its recent multiplayer beta, for example. They can still be annoying, though, as players understandably do not want to wait to play. Some people in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/top/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Skate subreddit</a> have said they finally got to the front of the queue and joined a session, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1nioad0/this_sucks/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only to be kicked out due to server issues</a></p><hr><h2><strong>Always-online complaints</strong></h2><p>The new Skate is an always-online game--something Full Circle disclosed back in April. At the time, the developer said this was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">necessary due to how the new Skate was designed.</a></p><p>"The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving," the studio said. "You'll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities."</p><p>Full Circle added: "In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection."</p><p>But now that Skate has gone live, many are expressing frustration with the always-online requirement. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/top/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Many posts in the Skate subreddit </a>include people voicing their frustration with this, prompting some people to call on EA and Full Circle to release an offline mode.</p><p>Given what Full Circle has said about always-online being a core part of Skate's design, that might be wishful thinking.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeGXanmlJ_0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DeGXanmlJ_0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><strong>Skate is not 1.0 yet</strong></h2><p>The new Skate launched today as an early access product, meaning development is not finished and that, as with other unfinished games, there are going to be bugs and other oddities that players encounter. Full Circle has said it will pore over the feedback from the early access launch to try to improve the experience.</p><h2><strong>Steam stats</strong></h2><p>At launch, Skate has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already surpassed 78,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>, making it the No. 10 most-played game on Steam right now. And that's just a fraction of the game's total audience, as it's also available elsewhere on PC and on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The official trailer for Netflix and Ubisoft’s upcoming animated series, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-anime-netflix-2000619516"><em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em></a>, gives us a much better look at this new version of Sam Fisher and lets us hear more of Liev Schreiber as the aging operative. And while I was nervous at first, I now feel confident that Schreiber can pull this off. Now let’s just hope the show itself is good, too.</p> <p>On September 16, Ubisoft released the <a href="https://youtu.be/4A9iFjaKeMk">official trailer for <em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em></a>. The new animated show adapts Ubisoft’s popular stealth-action video game franchise into an episodic series that will premiere on Netflix exclusively on October 14. Here’s the trailer, which features Sam Fisher doing what you expect: sneaking around, wearing cool goggles, killing people with wire, and being cranky about stuff.</p>  <p>We get to hear more of Liev Schreiber’s take on Sam Fisher, and while it is different than the version established by Michael Ironside, I appreciate that he still sounds like an old guy who is about to snap at any point, and if he does, God help anyone caught in his way. While I’ll miss Ironside, who voiced the character in the original games, I’m happy that Sam is in good hands. <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-splinter-cell-being-remade-by-far-cry-6-devs-1848221698">And honestly, I’m just excited to get more <em>Splinter Cell</em> in any form</a>.</p>

 <p>In this new trailer, we learn more about what this show is actually about.&nbsp; After a younger agent, Zinnia, gets her hands on some valuable intel, she comes to Sam Fisher for help. This brings Fisher into a mission that involves <a href="https://splintercell.fandom.com/wiki/Douglas_Shetland">Douglas Shetland, a villainous character</a> and former friend from the<em> Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow </em>and <em>Chaos Theory</em> games. His daughter is all grown up and running what appears to be an evil corporation of some kind. Uh oh!</p> <p>Interestingly, in the trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/8c-Jshz9PVc">we briefly see the ending of <em>Chaos Theory,</em></a> with Sam and Douglas standing with guns pointed at each other. It also seems like this series makes it canon that Sam Fisher shot Shetland. In the game, it was a choice between shooting him and not shooting him. If you didn’t pull the trigger, Shetland would shoot at Sam, forcing him to dodge Shetland’s attack before stabbing and killing him. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splinter-cell-deathwatch-trailer-poster-derek-kolstad-interview#:~:text=So%20is%20Splinter,fits%20the%20mold.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D">It’s not 100% clear yet if <em>Deathwatch</em> is canon with the games</a>, but if it is, I wonder what else the show will introduce into the franchise’s (surprisingly) sprawling lore.</p> <p><em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch </em>is being written and produced by <em>John Wick</em> writer Derek Kolstad. It will be available on Netflix on October 14.</p>

            <p>
Telltale Games obviously found a lot of success with its take on The Walking Dead, alongside several other series, but that whole episodic release thing never quite caught on. Even still, some former Telltale Games devs are clearly keen on trying it out again anyway. These devs are called AdHoc Studio, and their game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, a comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game about managing superheroes, which just got a release date (dates?) today.
</p>
<p>
The first two episodes arrive October 22nd, with two episodes releasing weekly after that point for a total of eight. "We think the release format is an underrated part of the player experience," AdHoc co-founder and Dispatch creative director Nick Herman said in a statement (cheers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-the-superhero-comedy-from-ex-telltale-devs-confirms-pc-ps5-release-date-and-episodic-release">IGN</a>). "Episodic is a format that makes the story easy to slip into, easy to keep up with, and easy to share with friends. We want the launch of Dispatch to be ‘appointment gaming’ but with the weekly cadence of a TV show, as opposed to asking people to wait months between each release."

<p>
I'm not quite sure I agree with that assessment that an episodic format makes it easy to keep up with. Weekly releases are the only good way to release a TV show, as it actually keeps people talking about it, but you're already likely to be either subscribed to a streaming service or pay for cable. So I'm not confident that Dispatch will fit into that kind of box so easily.
</p><p>
In any case, those TV show aspirations don't stop at the format. The voice cast not only includes names you've definitely heard the voices of somewhere like Laura Bailey and Matthew Mercer, but also Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul and The Batman's Jeffrey Wright. There's also people like Jacksepticeye, Moistcr1tikal, and Yung Gravy. I will be making no further comments on those particular casting choices.
</p>
<p>
Our own Edwin did feel mostly positive about his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-demo-for-dispatch-the-invincible-style-superhero-comedy-from-former-wolf-among-us-writers">short time with the demo earlier this year</a>, but we'll find out how it actually shapes up when the first two episodes arrive October 22nd.

Blizzard has sold mounts, pets, helmets, and armor sets for real money for years now. Two years ago, Blizzard sold its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rare-world-of-warcraft-mount-returns-but-itll-cost-you-90/1100-6527385/" data-ref-id="1100-6527385">most expensive WoW mount ever</a>, the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur, for $90.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzBU3fGYrC4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xzBU3fGYrC4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The new <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-ascended-regalia-pack?_gl=1*1p05vyl*_ga*MTc5OTA4NDAyMy4xNzI5MTA1NTIz*_ga_8HJGPB88F9*czE3NTU3NTU4NDYkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTU3NTU4ODAkajI2JGwwJGgw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ascended Regalia Pack</a>, however, stands out, but not because of the $30 price tag. Instead, the Spirit Healer-themed bundle is notable because it includes a whopping 100 individual transmog pieces, with four full armor sets and 22 weapon appearances. Blizzard clearly thinks it's a big deal, as it's the only time in recent memory that it has crafted a trailer for a premium cosmetic bundle. Because they are all individual pieces, players can mix and match parts of the armor sets to create their own look, or combine them with their existing transmog collection to create something new.</p><p dir="ltr">While the sheer number of appearances is eye catching, the bundle is essentially two different armor sets recolored into blue and purple, as well as purple and blue versions of different weapons. That does make it a little less impressive than it initially sounds, but 100 transmog pieces is still nothing to sneeze at.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569150-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-1_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569151-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-3_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569152-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-2_1920x1080_jl01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4569150,1300-4569151,1300-4569152" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4569150-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-1_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4569151-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-3_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4569152-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-2_1920x1080_jl01.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569150-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-1_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569151-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-3_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569152-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-2_1920x1080_jl01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Whether or not players will be interested in buying the bundle remains to be seen, but Blizzard has clearly found success selling cosmetics and mounts in the past.

			<p>Activision has debuted a first look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Zombies with a new cinematic trailer that introduces the cast of characters for the narrative this year, ahead of more to come with Call of Duty Next at the end of the month.</p>



<p>As it's a cinematic trailer, there's no gameplay, but it does showcase the Ashes of the Damned map somewhat, and shows how all eight characters come face to face for the first time.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>A new blog post on the Call of Duty website goes into more detail with the new expanded crew, with backgrounds on Grigori Weaver, Dr. Elizabeth Grey, Major Mackenzie Carver, Maya Aguinaldo, Tank Dempsey, Takeo Masaki, Nikolai Belinski, and Dr. Edward Richtofen.</p>



<p>Call of Duty Next arrives in two weeks on September 30, and ahead of that, another blog post will reveal more about Zombies, which is arriving alongside the rest of Black Ops 7 this coming November 14, 2025.</p>



<p>In other Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 news, Activision acknowledged cries from players that Call of Duty is having an <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">"<em>identity crisis</em>,"</a> and confirmed that skins and weapons from Black Ops 6 would no longer carry forward to Black Ops 7.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-arena-steam-epic-unheard-edition-2000626063</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Escape from Tarkov</i>, arguably one of the most hardcore extraction shooters out there, is finally making its way to Steam. The game has previously lived in perpetual beta status, but now the highly anticipated 1.0 release is expected this November. You can’t buy it on Steam just yet, though the listing is up and you can wishlist it. But, as some are learning, if you have already been a long-time <i>Tarkov</i> player and are hoping to consolidate your game library under Valve’s launcher or make use of Steam’s social features, you won’t just be able to download the game on Steam and connect your Battlestate Games account. You’ll have to pay for the game a second time.</p> <p>Like with many things involving <i>Tarkov</i>, this is all a little confusing, if not intimidating. So let’s break it down.</p> <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3932890/Escape_from_Tarkov/">Steam page for <i>EFT</i></a> went public today, with a release date of “coming soon.” Meanwhile, a FAQ on <i>EFT</i>’s official website lists <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/support/knowledge/542">some potentially disappointing news for some</a>: “To play <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> through Steam, you will need to link a Battlestate Games account to your Steam account.” This is hardly unique to <i>EFT</i>’s arrival on Steam, as other games, such as <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> and, more recently, <i>Star Wars Outlaws</i>, that have previously launched elsewhere and later come out on Steam typically have not supported a “cross-buy” situation. Still, this news has left a sour taste for many, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1niiife/comment/nej0yg3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">fans chiming in</a> <a href="https://x.com/OnlyBeysYT/status/1967968457682817456">on social media</a> to suggest the game is likely to get review bombed upon release and that it just feels silly, greedy even.</p>

 <p>The same FAQ page states that if you previously purchased <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/purchase">any of the more expensive versions</a> of the game, a newly purchased Steam copy “will automatically use the higher edition of the two when launching the game” once you’ve linked your accounts. So, technically speaking, if playing on Steam is a must, and you’ve purchased a more expensive version of <i>EFT</i> in the past, you should only buy the base edition on Steam when it goes live.</p> <p>The Steam FAQ page also contains some other potentially upsetting information: There are currently no plans for <i>EFT</i> to support the Steam Deck and Family Sharing is a no-go. Plus, the system requirements, as seen on the Steam page, are pretty steep. Recommended specs include 64GB (!!) of RAM and a 4070.</p>

 <p><i>Escape from Tarkov</i>’s main extraction mode will finally emerge from beta status on November 15, 2025, after nearly a decade in development. But it’s not the only mode that <i>EFT</i> has on offer.</p>  <p>As an extraction shooter, <i>Tarkov</i> features PvP elements that see both bots and players on a live multiplayer map, though the main game loop is all about getting in, looting, surviving, and extracting. Two years ago, however, BSG released <i>EFT: Arena</i> as a standalone solution for those who wanted to experience the tactical shooter in a competitive environment. Though <i>Arena</i> uses the same <i>EFT</i> account to share rank and stats, and is available for purchase individually on the Epic Games Store right now, this mode does not have a Steam listing.</p> <p>So while needing to buy the game a second time if you desperately need to play might be a bummer, it’s worth noting that you <i>can</i> just add non-Steam games to the Steam launcher. That said, given that you’ll still need a BSG account and your previous purchases of the more expensive editions will carry over, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1niiife/discussion_tarkov_has_a_steam_page_now/">some are wondering</a> why BSG can’t just allow the base version to carry over with a download of the launcher through Steam.</p>

While this is a very small update, the patch notes include a few notable bug fixes and changes to Season 5's Deadline limited-time mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 5 Reloaded added the new Deadline limited-time mode, and now the new update makes a few improvements to the match rules. Circles two, three, and four are now extended by 30 seconds each. The developer says this change was made to allow players "extra time to coordinate and rack up points," while also slowing down the gas to provide players with more breathing room.</p>

Now, Godot 4.5 adds screen reader support to Control nodes, as well as screen reader bindings to customize the behavior of any type of Node. In short, it makes it so existing screen readers, which can recognize a button on screen and read its label out loud, can now be used in projects developed using Godot when implemented.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to an announcement, the screen reader support feature is "quite new," and its integration remains in an experimental phase for now. As such, screen reader support for the Godot Editor itself is not complete yet. Rather, it's only implemented for the Project Manager, standard UI nodes, and the inspector.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The internationalization live preview feature allows developers to preview translations directly from the editor viewport, which is aimed at helping test GUI elements in multiple languages in a faster manner. Relatedly, developers can now switch the editor language on demand, making it so that changing the editor language no longer requires an editor restart. This is helpful for editor plugin developers to test their translations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/obituary-marvel-s-spider-man-2-accessibility-engineer-patrick-thor-gass-has-passed-away" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Marvel's Spider-Man 2 accessibility engineer Patrick 'Thor' Gass has passed away</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The announcement notes that over 400 contributors were involved in the new feature release.

<p>Specific figures across Switch, Switch 2, and PC have not been confirmed, but we've reached out and will update this article when we hear more. Nevertheless, it's a solid performance for the game after such a short period of time, and it seems that most are in agreement that it's probably one of the best entries in the series for quite some time.</p>
<p>Marvelous Europe also shared the following piece of artwork to commemorate the milestone:</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436jpmzhg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylLGp-DIVlY" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Grand Bazaar on Switch and Switch 2 is a remake of the DS title Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar and we thought it was really <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">quite good</a>. We said that it "might not have the depth of other farming sims, but it's fantastic to control, and the well-written characters alongside the many tasks and calendar packed with events to occupy your time, make you feel like part of a bustling little community".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Natsume's latest title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_home_sweet_home_special_edition">Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home Special Edition</a> will launch on the Switch on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>. This one originally launched on iOS and Android in August 2024 and was supposedly the "biggest Harvest Moon game ever" on mobile devices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-devs-were-extremely-focused-on-optimization-and-performance.1299609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797">After playing <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s open beta last month,</a> I was impressed by how well it performed on console. And footage of the beta running on an <a href="https://youtu.be/gLqxhWuli3Y">Nvidia 1060 GPU</a>, a nearly decade-old card at this point, further impressed me. So when I recently talked to some of the devs about <em>BF6</em>, I was curious how the team made it run so well, and they explained it was about not pushing consoles too hard and always optimizing during development.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-controversial-quick-turn-flick-console-why-cheating-2000625445">During my video call with <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;technical director Christian Buhl</a>, I asked if he felt like the current generation of consoles was tapped out and needed to be replaced or if they still had some performance to squeeze out of them. He told <em>Kotaku</em> that while he always feels like “there’s more room to improve performance,” he doesn’t expect devs to “double frame rates” in future PS5 and Xbox Series X/S games at this point. And with <em>Battlefield 6</em>, the studios working on it weren’t even trying to push these consoles to some theoretical breaking point. Instead, the goal was always to make an online FPS that ran very well.</p> <p><span>“We also were intentionally not trying to push super hard on [PS5/Xbox Series X/S,]” said Buhl. “We didn’t want to push to the edge and fail. We wanted to make sure that we had an experience that we could optimize, that we could get to the point where it was going to run reliably at 60 frames per second, or, you know, over 80, whatever settings you preferred. And that was our focus, right? Like, get stuff in there, get it performant, and then add [more].”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>Buhl admitted that in the past, developers working on <em>Battlefield</em> games had a different approach. Often teams would “build a bunch of cool shit and then try to make it work.” This time around, that wasn’t the case, and Buhl told me that during development, <em>Battlefield 6</em> had to “<span>constantly be working; it had to constantly be performant.” </span></p> <p><span>“Obviously, it’s not like we’re 100 percent hitting our targets throughout development. But every time we [dropped] too low, we put performance optimization efforts in place, paused work, [and said], ‘You can’t add stuff until we get this optimized,'” explained Buhl. “</span><span>So that we could kind of make sure that at the end, we weren’t trying to do this giant lift of taking it from 30 frames to 60 frames, or something like that. We were taking it from, like, 55 to 60, right? And that’s a much more feasible effort.”</span></p>

 <h2>The ongoing debate around video game performance</h2> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> on consoles does still use upscaling tech. Buhl confirmed to <em>Kotaku</em> that on PS5 and PS5 Pro the game uses PSSR. And on all consoles, FSR is available too. But it’s clear the devs were focused intently during development on shipping a game that ran well no matter where you played it, even if that meant cutting back visuals or effects.</p> <p>The topic of video game optimization has become a hot one following the release of <em>Borderlands 4</em> last week. Many claim the highly anticipated looter shooter is poorly optimized on PC and console, with players complaining about having to use low settings and DLSS to run the game on beefy rigs. For a point of comparison, <em>BF6</em> is pretty playable on a 1060. <a href="https://youtu.be/UnTB3AkNkno"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is very much not.</a> That card is below the minimum PC specs for both games.</p>

 <p>In my experience on both PS5 and PC, <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s performance has definitely disappointed me. Especially on PS5, where some others and I have run into an issue where the game’s framerate drops lower and lower as you play longer and longer. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has pushed back on these criticisms, claiming the game is very well optimized for what it is and has suggested some players need to lower settings. And if you aren’t happy, you can just <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-boss-tells-players-please-get-a-refund-from-steam-if-you-arent-happy-as-randy-pitchford-continues-his-very-public-crashout-over-the-fpss-performance-woes/">return the game and get your money back</a>.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is out on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. EA told me the game will support 60FPS on all platforms, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">even Xbox Series S,</a> and on some machines, like the PS5 Pro, the game can exceed that framerate.</p>

Looking for an excuse to invite her in, Aaron boldly suggests Arianna might like to wait inside, in order to "play Xenoblade on my Switch." I'd have gone for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, personally, but there we go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To the surprise of Aaron — and, let's be honest, everyone at home watching — his offer is taken up by Arianna, who awkwardly laughs and steps inside, looking like she really did not have anything else better to do. Aaron, bless him, looks genuinely surprised his suggestion worked — as well he should.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In this scene from the long-running American soap opera Days of Our Lives (s61e008), Aaron uses playing Xenoblade as an excuse to invite Arianna into his dorm room. <a href="https://t.co/LQ9kCVmuyC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LQ9kCVmuyC</a></p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The moment has since been turned into a clip and uploaded by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendeal</a> to social media, where many Nintendo fans are celebrating someone remembering that Xenoblade exists. (To those who were hoping for a new game announcement in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">last week's Nintendo Direct</a>, I hope you're doing okay.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Monolith Soft, the Xenoblade Chronicles series began back in 2010 on Wii, with subsequent years featuring half a dozen sequels and re-releases. The most recent of those, a new version of Wii U side-story Xenoblade Chronicles X, launched for Switch back in March, at a time when most Nintendo fans were just waiting for Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This show has 61 seasons and I've never seen any bit of it until Xenoblade was mentioned," wrote Zhenghua Yang, founder of To the Moon developer Serenity Forge, after watching the clip. "Top tier marketing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know nothing about this show but Aaron is already my favorite character and there is no question about it," wrote another fan, AmiibroN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally launched in 1965, Days of Our Lives is (still) running — now on streaming service Peacock. For anyone who has watched the full episode, do let us know what happened next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: NBC/Peacock.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

As the name suggests, you're doing a lot of grappling and gliding in the game, exploring floating islands to unlock technology and collect raw materials, but the core of the game is its detailed, physics-based ship-building system. There's co-op for 1-6 players too, so you don't have to fly alone. If you haven't checked it out yet now is the perfect time, and here are a few details to tempt you to take off. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">PSA for sufferers of airsickness </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lost Skies is all about exploring ruins and biomes, collecting resources to craft and refine a skyship, so you're spending all your time at high altitude. You'll start out with a grappling hook for shorter distances, then craft a makeshift glider, and by combining the two you can chain movement that will let you get to the harder to reach areas. Once you have enough materials to start crafting your skyship it will become a home base and a weapon war.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>You are not alone</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The various regions of the Lost Skies world are home to strange creatures, like the Blue Manta that travels through the skies, but will attack if provoked, or the burrowing Spitter Motus Beetle that rudely shoots balls of acid at you. Those are the least of your worries though - there are also the Seraph, strange mechanical looking enemies that are powerful and use nano-technology to devastating effect. They're are not to be trifled with. You do have someone on your side though, an AI companion called ASA that can help explain the strange lands you find yourself in, and stop you turning into a weird sky loner. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Something really bad happened</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like most survival games, there's a terrible event that has left you trying to craft your own underpants or going toe to toe with an enraged boar. In Lost Skies it's not the old zombies or aliens stuff, but something called the Cataclysm. AI companion ASA helps you decode the clues you find scattered around ruins, and figure out how the monstrous mechanical Seraph are involved.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lost Skies Regions, Bosses, and Wildlife Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">You can create your own Lost Skies islands</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're the sort of person who doesn't just want to live in a world, but to shape and control it too, maybe check in with a therapist and then try the Lost Skies Island Creator. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This free tool</a> allows players to sculpt and populate an island, and use assets from the game to refine and populate it. There are already hundreds of player made islands.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It's made by the Surgeon Simulator folks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It might look whimsical, but Lost Skies is made by the studio that brought you cult hits like Surgeon Simulator. That was the cult where you had to perform complex medical procedures with tricky physics-based controls. Many virtual patients died, but hilariously. They also created the self-explanatory I Am Bread and I Am Fish. Lost Skies is definitely a vibe shift, but one that takes the bare bones physics-engine skills of Bossa and makes it real pretty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Disclaimer: IGN Entertainment and publishing label Humble Games operate under separate divisions of the same parent company, Ziff Davis.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If your interests lie in the fairly specific cross-section of Soviet-inspired utopia/dystopia, tinkering with stuff, and techno-goop, then you’ll need to set eyes on The Lift (that’s an elevator, for my American English-speaking friends). This supernatural puzzle game has a compelling pitch, and I was excited to get hands-on with a bunch of quirky tools in a PC demo build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played two polished chapters – one being the tutorial scene, and the other a slice taken from mid-game. All three hours I spent in-game made for an entertaining voyage into the unreal, with only some minor niggles. The Lift may still be on the workbench, but I’m happy to say that it’s looking ready and wired up for a great time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Speculative Fix-tion</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You play a silent man known as a Keeper, filled with pride by a life dedicated to repairing broken things. The amusing tutorial immediately throws you into a “test lift.” A woman’s voice crackles over a speaker and she coaches you, in an over-the-top propagandic way, through your first tests of rewiring circuits and replacing light bulbs. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Lift - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lift’s tactile handyman interactions are a distinguishing mechanic from the get-go. For instance, opening a panel may involve grabbing a handle, then mimicking the real-life movement of physically “pulling” it open towards you with your mouse. Rectify the test lift’s malfunctions, and the doors will open to what hints at humorous but increasingly bizarre goings-on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Lift’s tactile handyman interactions are a distinguishing mechanic from the get-go. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many sci-fi stories before it, The Lift takes place in an abandoned research facility, known ominously as The Institute. It gave me Kowloon Walled City vibes: chaotic, windowless rooms built around the titular elevator. You’ll advance through floors filled with malfunctioning machinery, but find quickly that your job extends beyond simple handyman work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo showcased a very brief amount of time outside The Institute (and an introduction to a character called Trader, who confusingly doesn't seem to have anything to trade), where the most dreamlike of The Lift’s visuals are found. Think Expedition 33-style surreality: traffic lights hang from the sky, furniture drifts about in mid-air, and giant, ludicrously tall chairs tower in the distance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I absolutely love the premise of this irreverent-slash-eerie sci-fi world, though I found it a little difficult to follow the narrative clues dropped by the occasional characters I encountered (more on them in a bit). The indoor environments say a lot, however: What’s that weird black sludge? What spooky force is breaking all The Institute’s chairs? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing you’ll see in The Lift is physically harmful to you, but you just know that those questions are going to have strange answers…</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hidden Object(ives)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lift is heavily objective-driven, with various tasks assigned by chattering, “wacky” characters over intercom known collectively as Rubus. They’ll tune in occasionally to talk at you, alluding to various problems and tasking you with repairing them. I generally found these sequences to be unengaging, and I’d catch my eyes glazing over as I thought, “Please just give me the objective already.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/4-ducttape-1757978971604.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice acting is well-suited to their varied personalities and expertly delivered, but I found all of The Lift’s characters unnecessarily longwinded. It’s not a huge drawback, but having to listen to their prattle without a fast-forward button was a bit distracting in a game built around hands-on, can-do gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for those tasks, you’ll often have multiple objectives – and sub-objectives – on the go at any given time. They are tracked helpfully in your handheld Bureau Utility Gadget, or “B.U.G.,” and range from simple tasks like accessing a blocked-off room to the obscure, like “Get wave production to level 3” (the latter of which I soon learned was simply a euphemism for "just fix as many things as possible”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The very first task is to find the actual Lift and make it move to a different floor. Each floor is essentially a giant puzzle you’ll need to revert its original, non-shabby state, thus unlocking your ascension to higher floors and taking you closer and closer to… well, whatever is leaving black splodges of slime everywhere.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/7-crafting-1757978986519.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll be collecting lots of screws, power cables, and other tidbits. There are two ways to navigate your inventory: one is via a circular menu, and the other is by cycling through items in your hand – both remarkably straightforward. A nice touch are auto-suggested tools for certain broken things you’ll hover over, like a “bee” for a bee socket. Yes, really. With The Lift’s more esoteric machinery, those suggestions help!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tooling Around</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So what needs fixing, anyway? Sometimes it’s simply replacing a screw on a wonky chair. You’ll also discover messed-up circuit boards with missing parts, which you may need to hunt around for. Sometimes that involves finding a spare part on a shelf, and other times you may need to buy a “spinny electromotor” from a vending machine. Not all things mirror the handyman tools of real life and can actually cross into more whimsical fantasy concepts (like the aforementioned bee).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your government job also covers some supernatural cleanup. During the demo I graduated from a screwdriver to more complex tools, such as the Cleaning Beam that sucks up those glowing, pulsating black masses into oblivion. I also wielded a glue gun – which inexplicably uses duct tape and not glue – to patch up holes in the wall, also oozing with that peculiar black substance.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/8-generator-1757979001402.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Be warned: there’s a bit of backtracking. The Lift has minor metroidvania aspects, with certain items or objectives not reachable until “unlocked,” whether through removing gunk off a door or finding a new type of tool. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the earlier puzzles even had me backtracking a bit farther than I would’ve expected. I didn’t mind this at all, and honestly liked how it reflected the unplanned messiness of real-life DIY, but players who prefer a more streamlined experience may want to keep this in mind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t expect solutions to go full IKEA: only one screw may be needed to realign a whole bench, for instance. But if you’re thinking that there can’t be much challenge in playing with screws and light bulbs, think again. The puzzles are environmental as well, and one of the later hurdles I came across was actually quite devious and required serious exploration before I figured out the solution. My biggest tip? Don’t forget to look up. Often.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Glitchcraft</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/11-bee-1757979015649.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll find random, glitchy objects strewn about the world, from staplers to comically large calculators. These can be fed into a trash chute in exchange for tokens, which can be used to purchase limited numbers of spare parts at vending machines. (You may need to repair the vending machine first.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As a fan of crafting games, my short experience with The Lift’s craft system was a notable highlight.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Late in the demo I also gained access to crafting, and I wish I’d had more time to tinker around with it! Feeding specific numbers of those same glitchy objects into a crafting machine transforms them into snazzy new fix-’em-up modules. If one tricky circuit board is giving you a headache, your craft room may be just the place to find its broken part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a fan of crafting games, my short experience with The Lift’s craft system was a notable highlight. This build’s craftables only feature the basics like cables and power units, but I can’t wait to see what else we may be able to make later on. More bees to get circuit boards buzzing again? Even zanier tools?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/2-mainhall-1757979031386.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lift’s developers say that they’re aiming for a much more hopeful, positive take on the Soviet concept of productivity, but I can't say I felt much of that idealism myself. The narrative instead hints more at instability (in a science-gone-awry way – no dystopian government to be seen here). This definitely isn’t a downside – but positive Soviet satire is an uncommon theme that I’m hoping the finished game will lean more into, and maybe even be defined by.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that fans of the puzzle genre will be refreshed by The Lift’s new take on problem-solving. Overall, the execution of the fiddling-and-fixing gameplay is spot-on, and there’s great satisfaction to be had in watching lights flicker on and systems come back online. And despite my rather insignificant annoyance of the wordy characters, I actually can’t wait to tinker more, mend bigger and weirder machines, and see where this strange story (and its goop) leads when The Lift comes out next year.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lift-turns-mundane-productivity-into-a-clever-puzzle-game]]></content:encoded>
