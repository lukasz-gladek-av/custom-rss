			<p>The original&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fairy-tail-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairy Tail,</a> released back in 2020, ended up being one of the best JRPGs based on a manga and anime series ever made. Japanese studio Gust, known for being the developer of the Atelier series, managed to masterfully capture the spirit of the franchise, creating a game that can be enjoyed by both fans of Hiro Mashima's work and complete newcomers, despite some small shortcomings that do not detract from the experience in any major way. Four years later, Gust will bring players back to Earth-land with Fairy Tail 2, which is setting out to outdo its predecessor in a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>Following my short hands-on session during this year's Gamescom, where I also had the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-interview-with-producer-hiroshi-kataoka-discussing-the-series-new-combat-system-additional-content/">speak with producer Hiroshi Kitaoka</a>, I was recently able to try out the first five or so hours of Fairy Tail 2. This allowed me to get a better idea of the game's overall progression flow and, most importantly, the new battle system, which I feel will be one of the highlights of the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241007174217_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As previously confirmed, Fairy Tail 2 will adapt the Alvarez Empire Arc, where Natsu and the entire Fairy Tail guild take on emperor Spriggan Zeref Dragneel and the powerful members of the Spriggan 12. Right from the Prologue, the game wastes no time throwing players into the thick of the action, providing a first tutorial battle that teaches players the basics while introducing some of the major players of the new story arc. Those with no knowledge of the manga may find themselves a little confused, but the game does a very good job providing all the background information needed to understand the story, the world, and the characters themselves, with the Check Terminology feature, which allows the player to quickly learn more about terms highlighted during dialogue sequences.</p>
<p>Still, unsurprisingly, those with knowledge of the story arc Fairy Tail 2 is adapting will have a much better time right from the get-go, as there's a lot the game throws at the player during the first couple of hours. The characters that appear in the first few chapters are already well-established as well, so a little research in the in-game Database is expected. This feature provides information on characters and story events that happened before the Alvarez Empire arc, which definitely helps, although reading the manga or watching the anime remains a way better option to learn more about the world and characters created by Hiro Mashima.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241007175221_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though the first few hours of Fairy Tail 2 proceed mostly on rails, they give the chance to explore a few locations and fight quite a few battles. Exploration is mostly in line with what other modern JRPGs offer, featuring some medium-sized fields filled with items and enemies, which can be attacked beforehand to start a battle with an advantage, and little else, although things could be different in later chapters.</p>
<p>Combat, on the other hand, really stands out from traditional JRPGs. Doing away with the straightforward turn-based system used in the first entry in the series, Fairy Tail 2 uses a system that mixes together real-time and turn-based features. During the battle, players can only control a single character, and the two other party members will fight on their own, unleashing skills as needed. A circular bar indicates when the controlled character can act, and once they can, it is possible to use regular attacks to gain SP that can be used to unleash skills with different properties and area of effects. Skills can combo together or even be used repeatedly to increase power for increased SP. Once all SP has been depleted, the turn will end.</p>
<p>Adding more complexity to this combat system are the Break mechanics. Every enemy in Fairy Tail 2 has a Break gauge that is depleted with every attack. By depleting one bar, it is possible to command any of the characters controlled by the AI to unleash a skill that can also buff the party. Depleting the Break gauge completely permits the party members to unleash Duo Raids, combination skills that deal a lot of damage and have more diverse properties than regular skills, such as healing and debuffing. All this, in conjunction with the ability to guard at any time to reduce incoming damage, switch characters on the fly, and different elemental properties, promise to make combat in Fairy Tail 2 extremely dynamic and fun. The system also has some decent depth to it, as there are ways to extend attacks per single turn, so I'm really looking forward to delving deeper into it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241010142221_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Fairy Tail 2 may be, on the surface, a game for fans of the manga and anime series, but the excellent work Gust seems to have done to make the experience welcoming to newcomers and its combat system will offer a lot even to those who have little knowledge of the original material. To learn if the game will have what it takes to stay toe-to-toe with more established franchises, we won't have to wait much longer, as Fairy Tail 2 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch on<a href="https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-december/"> December 11th, 2024.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-astro-bot-speedrun-stage-tomorrow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first of&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>'s new speedrun levels will arrive tomorrow, Sony and developer Team Asobi have announced, along with ten new Special Bots that need rescuing.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/astro-bot-new-speedrun-level-and-special-bots-out-tomorrow/?sf275076782=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a PlayStation Blog post</a>, Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet says that the first speedrun level, Building Speed, will arrive tomorrow, October 17th. It'll come alongside an online leaderboard to allow you to compare your skills with the rest of the&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>community.</p>
<p>Building Speed will equip you with bulldog dash boost powerup Barkster, alongside whom you'll need to "blast your way through a sky-high city", dodging obstacles like cranes and "a flying car wash" on your way to the goal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-speedrun-stage-new-bots-building-speed.jpg?itok=ihYjDKBh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-speedrun-stage-new-bots-building-speed.jpg?itok=7mKypcas 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting a brand new speedrun stage tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>From this point on, you'll be getting a new speedrun level in&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>every week, so you'll have something to keep you busy if you're looking for an excuse to keep playing Team Asobi's delightful platformer.</p>
<p>Next week's level is called Let it Slide, followed by Spring-loaded Run on Halloween, Helium Heights on November 7th, and Rising Heat on November 14th. It's not clear if the weekly speedrun levels will continue after that.</p>
<p>Naturally, this update also brings ten new bots for you to rescue, some of whom we already know about; last month's State of Play gave us a look at the Helldivers from Arrowhead's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2"><i>Helldivers 2</i></a>, as well as Eve from Shift Up's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million">hugely popular</a> hack-and-slash action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>.</p>
<p>There will, however, also be other bots to rescue, and Team Asobi is being relatively cagey regarding who those bots will be, so you'll have to play the new level to find out. Exciting times!</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, it's a 3D platformer created by Team Asobi that celebrates PlayStation's legacy.</p>
<p>Protagonist and lil' robo-mascot Astro platforms his way across a series of classic-style 3D platformer stages, rescuing a host of bots based on famous PlayStation properties like&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>along the way.</p>
<p><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is available right now <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/astro-bot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively on PlayStation 5</a>.

<p>For a couple of months, a full buyout of Guild Esports was being touted, with many believing it would serve as a last-ditch effort to rescue the brand that has undergone financial issues in recent years. Now, that acquisition has been completed, with US-based firm, DCB Sports LLC, securing Guild Esports in full for a one-off cash payment of just $130,000.</p>



<p>DCB now owns 100% of Guild’s assets – but that also includes outstanding liabilities and debts.</p>



<p>What does this mean for Guild Esports?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-times-are-changing">Times Are Changing</h2>



<p>Per a report, DCB Sports will assume ownership of Guild and set up a new brand identity dubbed ‘Guild Esports and Gaming Ltd’. The $130,000 that DCB paid to secure the brand will be soaked up by the remnants of Guild Esports PLC. It was subsequently revealed that the original company will be renamed to ‘Cassel Capital PLC’ to avoid confusion post-transaction.</p>



<p>As news of the acquisition broke, Guild’s CEO, Jasmine Skee, announced her decision to resign from the company, vacating the position she’d held for almost two years.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.investegate.co.uk/announcement/rns/guild-esports--gild/completion-of-the-asset-acquisition-by-dcb-sports/8488426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a full release</a> published by Guild Esports PLC, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Guild’s Chief Executive, Jasmine Skee, has taken the decision to resign from the Company and step down from the Board of Directors with immediate effect to pursue new opportunities. The Board sincerely thanks Ms Skee for her significant contributions and strategic leadership of the Company under difficult conditions, and in particular, her efforts in completing the Transaction. Following Ms Skee’s resignation, the board will comprise Derek Lew and Brian Stockbridge, the Company’s non-executive directors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To date, Guild Esports has invested time and effort into various competitive ecosystems, such as Apex Legends, FIFA, PUBG, Fortnite, VALORANT, FGC games, Rocket League, EA Sports FC, and more. Presently, the brand is preparing to host The Women’s Esports Finals, a tournament taking place to drive awareness into the low numbers of female gamers in the esports industry.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Official 35 Minute Developer Deep Dive</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I recently played a little more than three hours of Stalker 2 that covered the beginning of the game and its opening few missions. My experience in the Zone could sometimes get frustrating, especially after trying to take down the same group of bandits four or five times, only to get overwhelmed and shot to death or blown up by one guy's extremely well-placed grenade. But once I started to get the hang of keeping myself alive by moving cautiously, exploring, and identifying threats at a distance, I found that Stalker 2 felt harrowing and invigorating in equal measure. It requires players to be on their guard and rewards them with strange, exciting experiences in the Zone.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 starts by immediately introducing you to the weirdnesses of the Zone. After both the historical Chornobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 and a fictional one in 2006, the Exclusion Zone is filled with strange, almost supernatural goings-on. Whirlwinds will toss people into the air and then implode their bodies; there are spherical gravitational anomalies that look like near-invisible bubbles that suck you into them; sometimes, jets of flame or bursts of electricity erupt from the ground if you wander too close.</p><p dir="ltr">Anomalies range from dangerous to deadly, but they can also be incredibly valuable. If you can make your way into the center of some anomalies, carefully picking a path based on the loud beeping of a detector that tells you just how close to danger you are, you can find an artifact--a strange object with unexplainable properties that you can equip on your character. That's what Stalkers--scavengers who make their livelihood in the Zone--are after.</p><p dir="ltr">After a betrayal during your trip into the Zone, you wind up becoming a Stalker too, mostly out of necessity as you try to find the person who turned on you and get back a special artifact they stole. Much like in the original Stalker, you're hunting a single person down and interacting with other people who live their life in the Zone. That means heading to Stalker settlements and taking on jobs to trade for information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385008-s2_hoc_toxic_night.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385008" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385008-s2_hoc_toxic_night.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385008"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385008-s2_hoc_toxic_night.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 throws you in the deep end almost immediately. After the tutorial--where you're left for dead--another Stalker rescues you and introduces you to the mechanic of chucking metal bolts at anomalies to trigger them, which sometimes gives you the opportunity to run through them while they reset, and otherwise can let you probe their edges to see their size and distance. He points you in the direction of a town where Stalkers hang out, and along the way, you can pick up side missions and mix it up with random adversaries.</p><p dir="ltr">One of those side missions involved finding a Stalker trapped in a destroyed post office, engaged in a gun battle with some of the lawless bandits who also inhabit the Zone. Kill them, and he'll offer you the job of heading up the street to the bandits' stronghold to help his pal, this one being held because of gambling debts incurred by the guy in the post office. Here's where I died several times, because fighting human enemies can be extremely tough.</p><p>Combat feels a lot like in the original Stalker, where you're relying on weapons that aren't especially well-maintained or accurate. You can sneak up on the enemies in blasted-out buildings up the road from the post office, a few of whom are patrolling around and having conversations, to get the drop on them, but actually shooting them can be tough. A headshot is generally lethal against any human enemy, but body shots are way less predictable, and getting accurate aim under pressure was tough in any case. Part of it is definitely due to elements of Stalker 2 that are meant to make the game difficult and to make every fight feel intense and dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a jankiness to fighting overall, though, that can get a little irritating. It's not uncommon to be peeking out of cover, blasting away at your foes, only to have another guy walk right up behind you and shoot you in the back of the head, with no way of knowing he was there. And as mentioned, it can be tough to land accurate shots; at times I felt like I was dumping a whole magazine of bullets into one guy to little effect, while others went down immediately after one well-placed shot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385010-s2_hoc_dusk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385010-s2_hoc_dusk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385010"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385010-s2_hoc_dusk.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Reloading the same small firefight four or five times was a little bit galling, and it may be that in situations like this, you'll find yourself playing a fight over and over, getting to know exactly where each enemy is, and then using your knowledge to finally overcome the situation. On the other hand, though, getting walloped a few times in what was essentially my first battle impressed a key piece of information on me about Stalker 2: Fighting is extremely dangerous, and you should avoid it wherever possible.</p><p>The unreliability of combat feels intentional--the developers want you to be careful about taking on people you find out in the world, and staying on guard to avoid bumbling into firefights. It also had me thinking twice about future side quests. Did I really want to walk into some meat grinder of a bandit camp just for a few coupons? Was the Stalker who gave me the job setting me up? Those elements put a different spin on Stalker 2's open world that works well for making the place feel dangerous at all times.</p><p dir="ltr">Even cooler were my chances just to explore the Zone and encounter strange things. Walking to any given place means watching for and avoiding anomalies and mutants, as well as humans. I found two Stalkers running from twisted pigs called Fleshes at a farm, and watched as one barricaded himself inside the farmhouse while the other was killed by the creatures. Killing them all showed that combat can be as clunky against mutants as it is against humans. As I circle-strafed the pigs, they leapt at me over and over again, while I dumped a bunch of bullets into each one. Moments like this, again, gave Stalker 2 a more awkward feel than most modern games tend to have. There's a degree to which Stalker 2 seems like it's right out of 2008, which gives it both a unique feel in keeping with its setting and ideas, and sometimes makes it cumbersome to actually play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385011-s2_hoc_toxic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385011" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385011-s2_hoc_toxic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385011"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385011-s2_hoc_toxic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I saved the survivor, who thanked me before letting me go on my way. Later, I noticed another group of those same mutated pigs out in a field, with an anomaly floating nearby. This time, I drew their attention with a few gunshots and then stood with the anomaly between me and them, letting them charge right into it and implode in midair. It was as satisfying a solution as it was efficient, and played into the idea that paying attention and using your knowledge of the Zone might be more interesting for gameplay experiences than relying on more run-of-the-mill video game elements like shooting. The combat feeling a little clunky and creaky, just like your fragility as a character, encourages that approach.</p><p dir="ltr">One side mission took me to a particularly cool location: a field of deadly anomalous poppy flowers. Like in The Wizard of Oz, the poppies make anyone who strays into the field uncontrollably sleepy, but if you fall asleep here, you never wake up. What's more, you hear strange whispers and echoes of the dead who've been lost in the field. Running around, searching for a lost religious icon belonging to someone who used to live in the area before the accident, I had to keep chugging energy drinks to stay awake. The screen would darken as I started to drift off, signifying heavy eyelids. At the same time, a wisp of petals--some kind of anomaly, seemingly alive--would whip through the field, bringing with it a stronger, deadlier dose of drowsiness. I finally found the icon and got the hell out of there after the screen went dark for so long I was sure I'd succumbed to an endless slumber among the flowers.</p><p dir="ltr">The time spent in the settlement and advancing Stalker 2's main story presented a different kind of tension. In the first town I ventured into, I found locals in conflict with the Wardens, a military group working within the Zone, who were hunting a Stalker they believed had murdered some of their men. To get information about your betrayer, you can choose to work either with some of the locals, who want to protect the accused, or with the Wardens, taking on jobs for either one. If you talk to the Wardens, they'll send you to a location where they think the murderer is hiding out, given to them by a local informant. It was pretty obvious to me the informant had lied, hoping the Wardens would bumble into a trap, especially as he gave me a stern warning to be careful.</p><p dir="ltr">I chose to work with the other group and discovered the man was actually hiding in a windmill full of boobytraps--located in the complete opposite direction--where I helped him escape by venturing into a cave, killing an invisible mutant, and navigating a deadly anomaly in order to get him an artifact he needed. Though the preview ended before I learned about the fallout of my actions, it was clear the occupying Wardens weren't going anywhere, and wouldn't be happy if they never found their suspect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385012-s2_hoc_campfire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385012" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385012-s2_hoc_campfire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385012"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4385012-s2_hoc_campfire.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Navigating anomalies, navigating the open world and its mysteries, and navigating the politics of different competing factions all have me excited for Stalker 2. Its atmosphere of deadly, mysterious strangeness makes wandering its open world both alluring and frightening. Stalker 2 perfectly balances the desire to discover what's hidden out there, like a field full of whispering poppies, with the unnerving knowledge that the Zone is also full of things that can and likely will kill you. Though it can sometimes feel like a throwback to older games, especially in elements like its combat, it's that feeling that also helps make Stalker 2 both frightening and compelling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-league-of-legends-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced a wave of layoffs that will impact the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>development team, although co-founder Marc Merrill says the team will "eventually be even larger than it is today".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243708100091985" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Merrill says the "tough decision" to lay off "some roles" among the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>team was made in order to make "sure we have the right expertise so that&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond".</p>
<p>Merrill doesn't specify how many team members are being laid off, nor does he say which departments will be most affected by the layoffs, but he does say that those being laid off will be supported by "a minimum of six months' pay, annual bonus, job placement assistance, health coverage, and more".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-layoffs-game.jpg?itok=IumIleKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-layoffs-game.jpg?itok=CV5nIfOt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>team is being hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Merrill goes on to say that "team effectiveness is more important than team size", but eventually, the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>team will grow in size "as we develop the next phase of&nbsp;<em>League</em>".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243939843821748" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup message</a>, he says that team size and budget "aren't the right way to measure whether a team will be successful", and that "having the right team, right priorities, and a sustainable approach" is more important than simply having a large team.</p>
<p>I'm sure that won't come as much consolation to the folks who are being laid off today, and the comments about the team eventually being bigger are a little strange in light of said layoffs, but we'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-layoffs-teamfight.jpg?itok=OxnXrJxS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-layoffs-teamfight.jpg?itok=-T4ukt39 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The future of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>is still bright, Marc Merrill reckons.</figcaption></figure><p>These aren't the first Riot Games layoffs this year. Back in January, Riot announced it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-laying-off-530-employees-riot-forge-will-cease">laying off over 500 employees</a> and shutting down its Riot Forge division, which was responsible for publishing the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ruined-king-league-of-legends-story">Ruined King</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu</em>.</p>
<p>Despite these layoffs, there's still plenty in the works for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and Riot Games as a whole. A new&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>fighting game spinoff,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is"><em>2XKO</em></a>, is currently in the works, and&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>itself is still getting new champions, including&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed">Ambessa</a>, who's on the way sometime soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-top-8-million.1010847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced another major sales milestone for its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake, and the studio has also posted a new piece of artwork to celebrate the milestone.</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1846479698232324198" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Capcom confirms that the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake has sold eight million copies since being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-confirmed">released last year</a>. That seems to suggest that sales are coming along nicely; sales were at <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240313.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seven million back in March</a>, so that's another million copies in the intervening months.</p>
<p>To celebrate the game's newest sales achievement, Capcom also posted art depicting Leon S. Kennedy, Ashley Graham, and Hunnigan all enjoying a day out together, which is a pretty heartwarming way to mark the occasion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-artwork.jpg?itok=b8oMu-7d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-artwork.jpg?itok=Aigp8Efn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake has sold pretty well so far.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake was released towards the end of March last year, and it took the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-hit-3-million-in-just-2-days">just two days</a> to rack up three million sales.</p>
<p>Further <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-top-4-million-mercenaries-mode-now-available">milestones</a> would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-reach-5-million-capcom-announces">swiftly follow</a> in the weeks to come, cementing the remake's place as one of Capcom's best-selling&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million">hasn't quite caught up to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>yet</a>).</p>
<p>The remake is effectively a ground-up reimagining of the 2005 original, although it tells the same story, in which Leon Kennedy must travel to an unnamed Spanish village in order to rescue President Graham's daughter Ashley from a cult of parasite-worshipping fanatics.</p>
<p>Several major changes have been made in the remake, though, including alterations to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s core gameplay, narrative elements, and exploration, as well as the removal of some of the original's more contentious moments (looking at you, "ballistics").</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2050650/Resident_Evil_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/resident-evil-4-remake/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/resident-evil-4/9n7jcppcpn37" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. You can also take a look at our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-review">review of the game here</a> if you want to know how Capcom's modernization of the 2005 classic shakes out.</p>

Plants vs Zombies 3 will go offline and get a "major overhaul" following feedback from the app's "soft launch", which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-returns-to-mobile-with-new-sequel-out-this-year">began back in January</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The undead tower defense threequel is now no longer available to download from the iPhone App Store and Google Play, and in-game purchases have been switched off. 
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news/soft-launch-announcement-15-oct">statement</a> released today by developer PopCap gives existing players a month's notice of servers going dark for an indefinite period, beginning 15th November, from which point on the game will be unplayable. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey Neighborville residents!" the statement reads. "We've been grateful for your enthusiasm and feedback during our soft launch. 
</p>
<p>
"It's clear that we're onto something great and following the recent releases of Choose Your Seeds and the manual activation of Grapes of Wrath, we want to go even further to make the game truly special.
</p>
<p>
"That's why we're taking the game offline for a major overhaul, and we can't wait to share what's taking root!"
</p>
<p>
It's been nine months since Plants vs Zombies 3 rolled out via a "soft launch", and received a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/199hdmu/plants_vs_zombies_3_is_atrocious/">decidedly mixed response</a>. At the time, Popcap <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/19aqd00/pvz3_soft_launch_an_update/">admitted</a> there were "some gameplay elements that aren't connecting so much with some people".
</p>
<p>
Over the course of this year, Popcap has continued to tweak the game with new features, and the sentiment to today's news among Plants vs Zombies fans seems hopeful, if not entirely positive.
</p>
<p>
"PvZ 3 is slowly getting better so maybe there's still some hope?" one fan said, posting in response to Popcap via the franchise's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/1g4cqcs/an_announcement_about_pvz3s_soft_launch/">reddit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"It's kinda sad to see the only thing keeping the PvZ franchise alive disappear for a while, but I think it's for the best," said another. "I'd rather eventually have a game that I'll play instead of a game that exists but I don't bother playing."

								<p>Decades before we got married and started a family, my partner and I connected over a little Boxer pup named Charlie. We tossed a ball around, scrubbed him down when he got dirty, and took him for daily walks. It was a bonding experience — mediated entirely through the original Nintendo DS’s touchscreen. The tactile experience turned an otherwise simple game like <em>Nintendogs,</em> where the goal is to take care of virtual pets, into something that created a deep emotional connection. And years before smartphones were in everyone’s pockets, it helped show a generation of gamers just what’s possible with a touchscreen.</p>

								<p>Now, we mostly take them for granted, but prior to the arrival of the first DS in 2004, the idea of a touchscreen was, for many people (myself included), something out of science fiction. The screens I was used to being around — televisions, computer monitors, MP3 players — definitely were <em>not</em> for touching. And commercial devices like Apple’s Newton, with its handwriting tech, were financially out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>But the DS was something different. As the successor to the Game Boy, it was more of a toy than a piece of high-end tech. It took the basics of a traditional gaming handheld and doubled the screens, stacking two displays on top of each other and sticking a hinge in the middle so that you could fold it shut like a book. The most important part was the bottom screen, which could respond to touch via a fingertip or the included stylus.</p>

								<p>The oddball design of the DS made it approachable. Despite the touchscreen, it was <em>just </em>familiar enough thanks to an array of physical controls, and it had two cartridge slots so you could still bring along your old Game Boy Advance carts. One look and it was clear this gray, clamshell brick was meant for gaming. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy">But it was also pretty freakin’ weird</a>.&nbsp;</p>

								<p>In typical Nintendo fashion, the company didn’t just introduce a new control method — it also went ahead and showed you its possibilities. Some of the bestselling DS games are ones that wouldn’t have been possible without that touchscreen. <em>Nintendogs</em> captivated players because of how natural it felt to rub your little pup’s head with a finger or play catch by virtually flinging a frisbee as you did your best to take care of a small group of dogs. Meanwhile, the <em>Brain Age</em> series — a collection of puzzles designed to work out your mind — showed how intuitive handwriting recognition could be for games like sudoku. Hell, <em>Brain Age</em> had millions of people doing <em>math problems for fun</em>. The company also snuck touch elements into its biggest franchises, so you could fight in a new way in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> or tap through even more bizarre minigames in <em>WarioWare</em>.</p>

								<p>Even better, because the DS was such a hit — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">the Switch may be a massive success</a>, but the original DS remains Nintendo’s bestselling piece of hardware — plenty of other developers jumped in as well. The early days of the handheld were bursting with creativity. Here’s a sampling:</p>

								<ul><li><em>Trauma Center</em>, an anime drama about doing surgery via swiping and slicing on the touchscreen, as your finger essentially becomes a scalpel</li><li><em>Professor Layton</em>, a detective-themed series of logic puzzle books, where the stylus subs in for a pencil</li><li><em>Electroplankton</em>, a musical toy where you manipulate nature — like bouncing tadpoles off of leaves or spinning strange circular fish — to create beautiful sounds</li><li><em>Scribblenauts</em>, where you can solve puzzles by writing “anything” and the game interprets your handwriting</li><li><em>Etrian Odyssey</em>, a dungeon crawler / cartography sim where you draw your own map, which takes up the entire bottom screen</li><li><em>Elite Beat Agents</em> (and its Japanese counterpart, <em>Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan</em>), where the touchscreen becomes a <em>Guitar Hero</em>-style musical instrument, forcing you to tap along to the beat</li><li><em>Cooking Mama</em>, where you chop, slice, and plate meals entirely via touch</li></ul>

								<p>The Nintendo DS eased people into the concept of touchscreens because it was also basically a Game Boy. All these touch-friendly games sat alongside titles that barely used touch or ignored it altogether, like Koji Igarashi’s excellent <em>Castlevania</em> run, or role-playing games like <em>Dragon Quest</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>. This allowed Nintendo to slowly introduce the idea of interacting with a screen via touch to millions of people, long before the idea became an integral part of modern life. And you can draw a pretty straight line from its launch to the golden days of early iPhone games like <em>Rolando</em>, <em>Tiny Wings</em>, <em>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery</em>, and <em>World of Goo</em>, which were similarly full of invention and playfulness. In fact, several hit DS titles, like <em>Cooking Mama </em>and <em>Scribblenauts</em>, eventually made their way to mobile. The transition was almost seamless. Even Nintendo eventually made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/15/13961146/super-mario-run-review-nintendo-mobile-app-iphone-ipad">a mobile <em>Super Mario</em> game you play by tapping</a>.</p>

								<p>Two decades later, a touchscreen is an assumed part of almost any gaming device. It’s become so pervasive that it would be weird if modern hardware like the Switch or PlayStation Portal <em>didn’t</em> have touchscreens. What was once novel to me has since become the norm; when I passed down an old DS to my oldest kid, she wasn’t shocked or amazed that she could pet a virtual pup. It’s what she was used to. But that also made her the ideal person to adopt Charlie, who has been waiting inside of that cartridge for the last 20 years.</p>

Meanwhile, first-time lobbed through passes are nerfed, as are driven passes.</p><p>There’s a general boost to attacking play, too, with attacking runs for AI players in certain roles given a shot in the arm among other tweaks. This will hopefully make attacking more effective in-game. Those annoying offsides should hopefully calm down, too, with improved AI player recognition of offside situations.</p><p>Elsewhere, there are fixes for various bugs and improved referee decision making when calling for fouls and penalty kicks. FC 25’s refs had become the focus of ridicule for failing to give obvious penalties in-game.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25s-first-live-tuning-update-patches-out-exploit-that-was-ruining-competitive-play">EA Sports issued <u>FC 25</u>'s first live tuning update</a>, which patched out an exploit that was ruining competitive play. Live tuning lets EA Sports roll out some changes without requiring a full title update like today’s.

For Black Ops 6, however, Activision has changed its approach so that Warzone is a separate download on PC, which has resulted in the more manageable 102 GB SSD storage requirement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 PC Preload Launch Times</h2><p>Activision confirmed those who have preordered Black Ops 6 digitally on PC can preload the game before its October 25 launch date, which means they’ll be able to play the moment it goes live.</p><p>Preloading itself kicks off for everyone at 9am PT on October 21. This lets you download the whole package, including Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/16/cod-bo6-pc-image-002-1729072374571.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Global Launch Times</h2><p>It’s worth noting that the launch of the PC version of Black Ops 6 depends on where you’re getting the game from. It launches regionally for Microsoft PC players (PC Microsoft Store) on October 24 between 4am PT and 11pm PT, which means midnight wherever you are (it’s the same for PlayStation and Xbox). Black Ops 6 launches on Steam and Battle.net, meanwhile, at 9pm PT on October 24.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/16/cod-bo6-pc-image-003-1729072671004.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 PC System Requirements</h2><h3><strong>Minimum</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 64 Bit (latest update)</li><li><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1400 or Intel Core i5-6600</li><li><strong>RAM</strong>: 8 GB</li><li><strong>Video Card</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 470 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or Intel Arc A580</li><li><strong>Video Memor</strong>y: 2 GB</li><li><strong>Storage Space</strong>: SSD required with 102 GB available space at launch</li><li><strong>Internet:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li></ul><h3><strong>Recommended</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 64 Bit (latest update) or Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li><li><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1600X or Intel Core i7-6700K</li><li><strong>RAM</strong>: 12 GB</li><li><strong>Video Card</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti / RTX 3060</li><li><strong>Video Memory</strong>: 8 GB</li><li><strong>Storage Space</strong>: SSD required with 102 GB available space at launch</li><li><strong>Internet:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li></ul><h3><strong>Competitive / 4K Ultra Specifications</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 64 Bit (latest update) or Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li><li><strong>CPU</strong>:  AMD Ryzen 7 2700X or Intel Core i7-8700K</li><li><strong>RAM</strong>: 16 GB</li><li><strong>Video Card</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 6800XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / RTX 4070</li><li><strong>Video Memory</strong>: 10 GB</li><li><strong>Storage Space</strong>: SSD required with 102 GB available space at launch</li><li><strong>Internet:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/16/cod-bo6-pc-image-004-1729072727980.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Black Ops 6 also launches straight into Game Pass, Microsoft’s subscription service, across console, PC, and the cloud via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass only.

Incidentally, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023"><u>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare </u></a>3 and Warzone both also hit Game Pass via the cloud on October 25.

Unfortunately for gamers who want to avoid spoilers, The Veilguard's achievements list has leaked a few weeks early. Anyone who wants to preserve all possible surprises should steer clear of them entirely.</p><p>The Veilguard's achievements have shown up on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1g3lq6t/dav_spoilers_dragon_age_the_veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> thread and in other places online. While we won't be sharing any spoilers in this post, the story-progression achievements appear to be biggest offenders when it comes to ruining any shocks ahead. There are also the prerequisite collectible achievements as well as some that are specific to members of the player's party. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard Won’t Leave New Players Behind</p>
      </div>
<p>It's not unlike a film's soundtrack getting released early with spoilers in the track titles, as exemplified by the 1999 release of John Williams' score for Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. The Veilguard is a more personal experience for players, but some of the turning points in the story are going to happen for everyone. It's probably going to be more fun if players aren't looking too far ahead for any twists that await.</p><p>There are certain things that BioWare does want players to know ahead of time, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-times-and-preloading-information-revealed/1100-6527170/" data-ref-id="1100-6527170">launch times for The Veilguard</a>, preloading info, and the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fear-not-dragon-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-0-spiders/1100-6527078/" data-ref-id="1100-6527078">spiders have been excluded</a> from this game. But there will be plenty of other monsters and creatures to fight as players return to Thedas.</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 31.</p>

"The convenience bargaining group includes Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Llama Productions LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc."</p><p>No further comment is available from either party at this time.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA announced the strike over the summer, saying that while it made deals with the IMA companies on nearly all issues after more than a year of negotiations, they couldn't come to terms for protections regarding artificial-intelligence replication of voice actors and motion-capture performers' voices, movements, and likenesses.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-strikes-league-of-legends-due-to-secret-shell-company/1100-6526672/" data-ref-id="1100-6526672">Back in September</a>, SAG-AFTRA honed in on the Formosa Group on claims that the voiceover production company had sought non-union work via a shell company for a video game currently in development. In response, SAG-AFTRA filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board and expanded its strike to League of Legends, one of Formosa's biggest games, which provides huge amounts of voiceover work.</p><p>In a statement shared with GameSpot, a Riot spokesperson said, "League of Legends has nothing to do with the complaint mentioned in SAG-AFTRA's press release. We want to be clear: Since becoming a union project five years ago, League of Legends has only asked Formosa to engage with Union performers in the US and has never once suggested doing otherwise. In addition, we've never asked Formosa to cancel a game that we've registered. All of the allegations in SAG-AFTRA's press release relating to canceling a game or hiring non-union talent relate to a non-Riot game, and have nothing to do with League or any of our games."</p><p>The guild wants to guarantee that video game performers have given consent and compensation for any use of their work in any AI models for video games going forward.</p><p>"What we're saying to the video game companies is, 'Step up, do the same thing that all these other industries and companies have done, and respect human creative performance," SAG-AFTRA general counsel Jeff Bennett <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/sag-aftra-general-counsel-jeffrey-bennett-ai-laws/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> earlier this month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-no-vrr-improvements-pssr-lifting-veil/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will not feature any VRR improvement over the base model at launch, according to a new online report.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FenN5sOE1WM&amp;t=5402s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry weekly podcast</a>, John Linnemann reported that, during this year's Tokyo Game Show, he spoke with a Sony representative, asking about any VRR changes to allow LFC, low frame rate compensation. Unfortunately, the representative confirmed that there won't be any changes to the way VRR works over the base model, but they did add that they are aware of the feedback on the matter and may look into making changes in the future. If any change is made, it is expected that they would also be introduced in the base model, although the biggest hurdle to overcome is the 60 Hz output, which prevents LFC from being done well. So, at launch, VRR will continue to be limited to the 48-120 Hz range on the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>During this year's Tokyo Game Show, John Linneman was also able to experience the PlayStation 5 Pro in person, highlighting how the improvements the new system brings are better in person than in the footage shared so far. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, in particular, the improvements brought by the system are game-changing, with using PSSR feeling like "lifting a veil of smear" over the horrible image quality of the base model's Performance Mode. With the AI-powered upscaler, the game now sports a clean 4K presentation, with sharp image quality and none of the visual issues that plague Performance Mode on the base model.</p>
<p>The other game running on PlayStation 5 Pro available during the show, Gran Turismo 7, also shows some impressive enhancements. PSSR makes it possible for the game to run at 60 FPS with ray-traced reflections and look great even at reduced base resolution. Unfortunately, the 8K mode cannot be downsampled to 4K, but the option will be looked into to potentially provide even better image quality.</p>

            <p>
The maker of an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> statue has said it will now rework the model's design, after describing its appearance as "insensitive". 
</p>
<p>
In a statement released via social media yesterday, model company Purearts <a href="https://x.com/PureArtsLimited/status/1846193318742434183">said</a> it had "immediately returned to the drawing board" to rework its collectible statuette that featured Assassin's Creed Shadows main characters Yasuke and Naoe, following "concerns" raised by some fans. 
</p>
<p>
So, what's the issue? Well, Purearts' original design included a broken torii gate, similar to one found in Nagasaki that broke amidst the city's 1945 atomic bomb blast. Nagasaki's "one-legged torii", at the city's rebuilt Sannō Shrine, has been preserved as a reminder of the city's devastation.

<p>
Customers who pre-ordered the model will be contacted soon with more information on their purchase, Purearts said.
</p>
<p>
Responses to Purearts' statement are mixed, with some suggesting the company should have been more aware of the design's significance before it went into production. Others suggest this is yet another example of Assassin's Creed Shadows being embroiled in controversy by online commentators keen to highlight problems.
</p>
<p>Certainly, Assassin's Creed Shadows has had a bumpy road to release. </p>
<p>A recurring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">backlash to Yasuke's presence and role in Shadows caught the attention of Elon Musk</a> earlier this year, while there were gripes over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sorry-assassins-creed-shadows-artwork-features-real-life-historical-re-enactment-group-logo">historical inaccuracies in concept art</a> set for a release in a collector's art book. In July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">Ubisoft issued an apology</a> for elements in the game's marketing campaign that had "caused concern" among some Japanese fans. </p><p>Last month, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Shadows was delayed to 2025 following poor sales of Star Wars Outlaws</a>, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot raised eyebrows for saying that his company was focused on "creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda".</p>
<p>"Of course we're making creative choices, it's a video game," Assassin's Creed Shadows art director and franchise veteran Thierry Dansereau <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">told Eurogamer back in August</a>, adding that he was confident with how the game would ultimately be received.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bruce Nesmith, Skyrim lead designer and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> quest designer, has discussed the issue of bugs in Bethesda games, admitting the publisher "could have a higher degree of polish".</p>
<p>Bethesda's games are known for having plenty of bugs - some amusing, some game-breaking - but in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/skyrim-lead-bug-free-starfield-impossible/">VideoGamer</a>, Nesmith said the company can somewhat get away with it due to the complex systems in their games.</p>
<p>"I will be the first person to say that Bethesda Games could have a higher degree of polish," he said. "They have benefited, and when I was there I benefited, from providing such a wide and vast array of gameplay that a certain amount of lack of polish could be forgiven. Having an NPC run in place in front of a wall for a little while became acceptable because of the 17 things you could do with that NPC, whereas most games you’d be able to do two."</p>

<p>Still, Nesmith said it would be "impossible" to release a game without any bugs as games these days are so complex and have "so many working elements that are trying to interact with one another".</p>
<p>"There is no game on the market that is bug free," he surmised.</p>
<p>Nesmith also discussed the possibility of further transparency with players to divulge a list of known bugs ahead of a game's release.</p>
<p>"It's an interesting problem, because when you're in marketing, what you're looking to do is manage expectations," he said. "The players' expectations are that the game is flawless, that it has no bugs. That is their expectation. You don't have to like it, but it's there. And you aren't going to achieve it. So what marketing has to do is say, how can we get as close as possible to that expectation. How can we make it so these guys don't hate us for what's wrong and love us for what's right?"</p><p>Skyrim was notorious for its multiple bugs, though more recently Bethesda has worked to provide more polished experiences. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, for instance, had "the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-has-fewest-bugs-that-any-game-from-bethesda-has-ever-shipped-with-microsoft-says">fewest bugs that any game from Bethesda has ever shipped with</a>" according to Microsoft's Matt Booty ahead of the game's launch last year.</p>
<p>Nesmith left Bethesda in 2021 and, last week, announced he's part of new indie developer NEARstudios creating a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-rpg-hawthorn-looks-like-stardew-valley-and-skyrim-had-an-adorable-baby-together">sim game called Hawthorn</a> that's Skyrim meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> (see trailer above).</p>
<p>Do you think Bethesda games should be more polished? Or would you want to see bug lists ahead of a game's launch?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Do you have a ping of 1000 or something," my opponent asked, during my inaugural bout of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>. Ah yes, this is it, that sense of unpleasantly intimate sheepishness. <em>That</em>'s the withering late-90s chatbox scorn I've been missing, in this age of glossy live service multiplayer. I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.</p>
<p>The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Straftat is the work of them what did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a>, a melancholy Brutalist playground which Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-brutalist-city-with-climbing-axes-and-a-trumpet-in-this-great-free-indie-game">called</a> "a bit Bernband, a bit Off-Peak, a bit freeform explore-o-platformer". That game had terrific, haunted architecture - ponderous, gap-toothed swathes of concrete that begged to be clambered up and "broken" using such unlikely parkour tools as leaf blowers and trumpets. And so does Straftat, though it casts a wider net and seems more happy-go-lucky in its referencing.

It's a 1v1-only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> with no progression systems, just weapons collected from maps that are dealt out at random, from round to round. You get 25 maps in the demo, with 100 in the full release on 24th October. So far, they are all surprisingly non-throwaway. The offerings include: parsley-painted Backroom-style labyrinths (look out for the flamberge spawn, nestled in the crawlspace); vertiginous square walks with sniper rifles at either end, and miniguns perched temptingly in the middle; jumbles of unhelpfully porous gantries and teleporters. Some maps feel like chunks of city, with glowering signage and abandoned cars; others are memes fleshed out into sets, surfing the entropy at the end of history. Everything looks sordid and rundown and unliveable, and I love it all to bits.
</p>
<p>
The weapons, meanwhile, range from glocks and claymores to plasma guns whose projectiles light up the scenery, and instakill electro-cannons that slow you to a waddle. Some can be dual-wielded, others allow aiming down the sights.</p>
<p>The pace of combat feels quite Quakey, with close-quarter duels often consisting of frenzied sliding and jumping, but the more you prance about, the more audible you are. There's no music, and no minimap, so bagging your prey is often a question of listening for footsteps and other, telltale noises - the beep of a mine being deployed, or the death-rattle of a weapon being collected. Is that the sawed-off shotgun you just pinched? You bastard, that's the only gun I can actually hit anything with. Oh lawks, you're behind me, aren't you. Dare I stop moving and sight on a random corner, hoping against hope that you'll blunder into view?
</p><p>
The feeling of pulling from a big hat of FPS levels is delicious, as is the overall aesthetic and presentation. As in Babbdi, characters all look like mouldy potato people, with a selection of dodgy beanies, police caps and pot-bellied suits that feels like quiet mockery of Team Fortress 2. The interface looks like it's been cribbed from a 90s magazine cover demo compilation, then left in the washing machine for about 25 years.</p>
<p>I think this has serious legs as an FPS, providing they can muster enough players: there are no singleplayer options save a firing range, accessible while in matchmaking. Go on, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/">try the Steam demo</a>. I'm sure your ping is better than mine. Everybody's ping is better than mine.

            <p>I’ve never learnt to drive, and while I’ve always told myself it’s impractical - unnecessary, expensive, potentially dangerous for someone with undiagnosed but, I suspect, incredibly likely dyspraxia - I’m not sure it’ll ever stop being one of those quiet regrets; the ambient type that don’t really bubble to the surface much unless I’m watching a <a href="https://youtu.be/SmFQR0IltDQ">Noah Gervais road trip</a> video, but just float there and make my mood like, 1.5% worse at all times.

<p>There’s a lot of creative UI loveliness going on, and between its vivid intricacies, the low-stakes scenario, and the music, it all makes even the most mundane encounter or inconvenience take on a sort of mythical, life-altering importance. In other words, it feels like being a teenager. It’s actually really nice to be told sometimes that yes, you are the protagonist of reality and yes, the tractor you’re stuck behind represents a Bildungsroman chapter’s worth of personal growth.</p>
<p>In game terms, what it actually represents is slightly stiff and drawn-out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>combat where you use skills and items to defang differently flavoured threats - although there does feel like real potential for it to evolve later. Plus, to be fair, much turn-based combat consists of attacking, defending, and maybe one or two skills for the first few hours, anyway. ‘Threat’ icons will target one of several resources - gas, energy, cash, and your car’s health - and you’ll use abilities and items you’ve stuffed in your glovebox to take them out before they affect you.</p><p>What’s interesting here, and I think deliberate, is the way it frames your ability to overcome these challenges through your own openness and curiosity. Picking up hitchhikers means going out of your way, and their possessions taking up trunk space you could be using for precious supplies. But hitchhikers can also lend their skills to help you during these encounters. I suppose you could see this as an expression of either the silent spirit of the road rewarding you for being a dependable dude, or just calculatedly trying to shove as many people in the back as you can to gain numerical advantage. Either way, even when I’m not especially jazzed with the translation of combat, the way the context around these encounters evokes that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a> sensation of personal, evolving, unpredictable stories is captured well.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a fun “strange pivot after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/post-void">Post Void</a>” sentiment floating around on the reveal, but there’s a throughline here, I think. It’s the same sort of nostalgic love letter to the thumb blistering, caffeinated all-nighter of older games - you’re just inhabiting the person on the other side of the screen now. An interesting thought experiment I occasionally remember to think about while playing something: is what I’m watching intended to depict a reality, or a performance? Am I watching a stage play or folk tale or memory depicting these events, or is this how they’re supposed to have occurred? Basically: how many layers of fiction deep does this thing go?</p>
<p>Keep Driving makes me feel too present to be a memory, and but it's so idealised that it almost has to be. It’s the clouds, I think. That’s a remembered skyline if I ever saw one. It doesn’t all hit, but the parts that do hit like, well, a ten tonne tractor. I don’t think tractors come that big but, please, I’m being wistful. About tractors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-pulls-11-xbox-game-pass-trial-ahead-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>With less than two weeks to go before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> makes its debut, Microsoft has removed its £1/$1 Game Pass trial deal.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below, taken by Eurogamer this morning, the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-game-pass?ef_id=_k_cf72e8cacc4e1a7667138fc5bfc0bdb2_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmm3j0z1q0_SEM__k_cf72e8cacc4e1a7667138fc5bfc0bdb2_k_&amp;msclkid=cf72e8cacc4e1a7667138fc5bfc0bdb2#join">Game Pass page</a> currently only shows the full prices for a month on the subscription service.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the company has whipped away its rather enticing £1/$1 Game Pass trial prior to a big game launch. It did the same thing last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-cans-recently-nerfed-11-xbox-game-pass-trial">ahead of Starfield's debut</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-will-fix-diablo-4s-broken-spiritborn-evasions-this-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Blizzard will this week release a hotfix to amend the Evade cast animations of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>'s new Spiritborn class.</p>
<p>The Spiritborn was introduced with Diablo 4's new expansion Vessel of Hatred, but players have found with certain builds their character is able to endlessly evade - even likening it to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a bug as the Spiritborn is able to break animation frames during Evade immediately," wrote <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1845938130735845465">community director Adam Fletcher on X/Twitter</a>. "We will be fixing this so you won't be able to Evade instantly during another one, and instead it will be normalised to the standard Evade cast rate in all situations."</p>

<p>The reason for the change isn't to remove an amusingly overpowered feature, but because it's impacting other players, Fletcher said.</p>
<p>"The reason why we are hitting this bug now (and some may have noticed) is that it is currently impairing other players and their experience in-game," continued Fletcher. "We have mentioned before that if a build ends up impacting the experience of others, we may make changes immediately, and this is one of those instances. We expect this change to come in 2.0.3 later this week."</p>
<p>The patch will also fix crashes and other "hot button items".</p>

<p>Vessel of Hatred launched on 8th October, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-boosts-steam-players-to-record-high-despite-rocky-launch">got off to a rocky start</a> with a short delay due to "a small technical issue" and issues with accessing the expansion on consoles.</p>
<p>Still, the game has reached a new peak concurrent player count on Steam following the expansion's release proving its popularity - though that doesn't account for players on Battle.net or on console.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
