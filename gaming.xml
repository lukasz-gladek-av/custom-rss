            <p>
The next Epic Games Store freebie as part of the company's ongoing Mega Sale promotion will be Marvel's Midnight Suns. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/epic-games-store-voici-lultime-jeu-mystere-aaa-bientot-offert-sur-pc-51882">Dealabs</a>' always-reliable billbil-kun, who notes the game will be available to download next week from Thursday 6th until Thursday 13th June.
</p>
<p>
If you're yet to give it a go, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a brilliant character-centric role-player with Firaxis' trademark turn-based combat. Actions are made by cards, yes, but don't worry too much about that. It's fun, it's well-written, and being able to build up a secret base full of interesting Marvel superheroes is a blast.

Our Christian Donlan wrote that it was "great tactical fun nestled in a sweet-natured superhero dollhouse" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-avengers-and-find-that-perfect-bedside-table">Eurogamer's Marvel's Midnight Suns review</a>. 
</p>
<p>
However, launched right at the tail end of 2022 to lacklustre marketing, Marvel's Midnight Suns failed to find an audience - and any plans for a follow-up quickly evaporated. Earlier this month, our Katharine <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">caught up with Midnight Suns' creator Jake Solomon for details on what happened next</a>, and what he's working on now.
</p>
<p>
The current Epic Games Store freebie is Chivalry 2, which yesterday replaced Farming Simulator 22. This current round of promotions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-inquisition-free-on-epic-games-store-as-mega-sale-2024-begins">kicked off with Dragon Age Inquisition</a> - a strong choice ahead of us hopefully <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-two-unannounced-games-to-launch-this-year-one-is-dragon-age-dreadwolf">seeing more of the upcoming Dragon Age Dreadwolf very soon</a>.

            <p>If you cast your minds back to March, you may recall the story about some missing Playdate consoles. During a talk at GDC, company co-founder Cabel Sasser revealed pallets containing $400k worth of Panic's palm-sized, crank-operated console had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400k-worth-of-playdate-game-consoles-have-gone-missing-in-vegas">gone AWOL in Las Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, Sasser called the whole situation "a bit of a true crime drama".</p>
<p>However, fast forward a couple of months, and the consoles have now been returned to their rightful owner, although the circumstances still seem rather bizarre.</p>

<p>Sharing an update on social media platform X, Playdate said its hardware "got hastily dumped at a random restaurant this morning".</p>
<p>In a subsequent post, the Playdate team said it will share more details about the whole ordeal further down the line. It noted having the consoles returned was the "best possible outcome", adding this resolution was the result of "lots of time and detective work" - something the team enjoyed.</p>
<p>"The real question is, can we sell these as a limited edition? Playdate HotTM," the team jokingly closed.</p> <div>

<p>Our Donlan reviewed the Playdate console back in 2022, calling it "a fascinating puzzle in itself".</p>
<p>"Attached to my memories of Mad magazine are inevitably a bunch of memories of early home computers - the C64 and Amstrad in my case - and there's a lot of that DNA here too," he mused in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-is-weird-and-kind-of-ace">Eurogamer's Playdate review</a>.</p>
<p>"Games straight from someone's attic workspace or the desk in the bedroom. Games straight from their weird head and their weird perspective and their weird take on what games should be. At its best Playdate gives you this - along with the nicely handled Zeldas and the Breakouts and the things it seems to feel it should give you to be well-rounded.</p>
<p>"Now I've seen it, I want more of it."</p>

            <p>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> community. In a <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1796240162185224240">video entitled</a> ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game's Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of '[naughty word SEO doesn't like being in the first paragraph] talk', you aren't welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.</p>

<p>“Player behaviour is a complex problem-space,” Donlon said. Sometimes solutions have to be “painfully manual. Sometimes tech - that has the potential to be a gamechanger - takes longer than you want”. She reiterated that offending community members are in the minority, but added that “unfortunately, there are still people in this world that want to take their insecurity, or their bad day, or their hate, or their whatever, on some stranger through their computer screen.”</p>
<p>“In almost all cases, someone gets hurt in the process of making these systems better,” continued Donlon. Earlier this month, streamer Taylor Morgan went viral with the below post</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>In the attached video, Morgan shared footage from a stream in which she was subject to sexual harassment and verbal abuse from another player. “I know you hear us,” Morgan wrote. “I know you see us. If this goes unpunished I am taking this as an active act from you that you do not give a single fuck about any of the women and minorities that play your game, and I will rally to boycott.”</p>
<p>It would seem that Riot were paying attention. “When you to tell someone to ‘just mute comms’ to avoid harassment, you are essentially putting the harassed person in a position to not communicate,” said Donlon. “To compromise how they want to play the game to accommodate you.”</p>
<p>“Competitive games need to have room for banter. We believe this, and I do understand the fear that we will sanitise gaming by ‘over-addressing’ these issues,” Donlon continued. “We have no interest in doing that. But we do believe that a person should not have to be in a position to ‘grow a thicker skin’ or whatever other unhelpful suggestions have been thrown out there just to avoid threats of violence or literal hate-speech.” Talk is cheap, of course, but it’s heartening to see a studio so quickly react to something that’s making Valorant a worse place for so many. Riot themselves were the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-to-pay-100-million-in-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement">allegations and lawsuits related to an abusive workplace culture</a> a few years ago, and have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-outline-five-year-strategy-including-plans-for-more-tv-movies-and-music">careful to position themselves as having learned from the experience.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-new-patch-dlss-3-frame-generation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation support, and several gameplay tweaks and fixes.</p>
<p>The May 31st patch finally brings DLSS 3 Frame Generation support for improved performance on NVIDIA RTX 4000 series graphics cards. The game received unofficial support with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlss-3-mod-released-for-free-by-puredark-native-implementation-is-there-just-hidden/">a mod</a> shortly after release, but the official implementation should be better, addressing some of the issues seen in the modded implementation, including stability issues.</p>
<p>The new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch also fixes a visual issue that prevented terrain from being displayed correctly on certain graphics cards, increases item storage space from 1000 to 3000, and fixes some other issues regarding Pawns' cosmetics and dialogues. The full patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2054970/view/4174353069101968796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is definitely a step forward from its predecessor when it comes to world design and visuals, but it leaves something to be desired regarding a lot of other elements, such as narrative, AI, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-performance-issues-lod-range/">performance</a>. Still, it is most definitely a game worth playing for all fans of the series, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater may not release this year as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-2024-hype-trailer-metal-gear-solid-delta-silent-hill-2-confirmed/">previously revealed</a>, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>The remake of the third entry in the series by Konami, according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sortira-t-il-vraiment-en-2024-51984">reliable leaker billbil-kun</a>, may slip into 2025. A 2025 release window was referenced by a global distribution giant, the leaker said, with a December 31st 2025 placeholder release date. The leaker, however, wasn't able to corroborate the information, so there's still the chance the game will launch before the end of the year.</p>
<p>No matter when Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is launching, an announcement regarding the game will be made very soon, within the next 10 days or so. Pre-orders will open after this announcement, so a release date will surely be announced soon, whether in 2024 or 2025. A Collector's Edition will also be released for the game, but its contents are yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a remake of the third entry in the series, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5. Not a whole lot is known about the game, but judging from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-unreal-engine-5-in-game-footage/">short footage available</a>, it will attempt to faithfully recreate the original while improving visuals and enhancing the immersive stealth action gameplay that makes the original one of the best entries in the series, if not the very best.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/engineowning-cod-cheat-provider/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Earlier this week, EngineOwning was slammed with a $15 million payment order from a California court in a landmark cheating case against Activision Blizzard. For the longest time, EngineOwning has been one of the most popular cheat providers in the gaming market, specialising most commonly in the Call of Duty space.</p>



<p>However, following the judgement, EngineOwning’s leadership team swore to appeal the settlement order, making some rather out-there threats against Activision Blizzard that included releasing cheating software free of charge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-it-worse">Making it Worse</h2>



<p>Activision Blizzard saw success in the Californian court when a judge ruled that EngineOwning’s unlawful conduct had made the firm liable to pay AB a whopping $15 million (including legal fees). Not only that but the court demanded that EngineOwning surrender its domain identity to Activision. This warranted immediate backlash from EngineOwning, who went on record saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We hope and think that our domain registrar will not defer to this bogus claim, that would not have been approved by any clear headed judge with even basic democratic values in a proper jurisdiction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of an inflammatory response, EngineOwning vowed to create new software to further circumvent Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone’s anti-cheat systems. The company also pledged to offer a free-to-use cheat system if AB continues down this path. In a report published by IGN, it was suggested that the owners of EngineOwning have prepared to keep the business flowing by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-defiant-in-aftermath-of-court-ruling-vows-to-continue-releasing-modern-warfare-3-and-warzone-cheats">setting up a series of backup domains</a>.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has had a problem with cheaters for years – and it’s getting worse. As the anti-cheating systems become more intelligent, so too does the software that cheat providers are designing. </p>

<p>A new rumour suggests that Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater Remake is set to be released in 2025.</p>



<p>The news comes from reliable dataminer and leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sortira-t-il-vraiment-en-2024-51984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bilbill-kun</a>, who often obtains the majority of information via datamining the backend of websites. As he points out, the findings suggest that the announcement is likely to come soon, and he theorizes it could be within the next 10 days.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, that timing puts it firmly in line with the events surrounding Summer Game Fest, which kicks off on June 7, however bilbill-kun does state that the reveal could be prior to the show and take place on June 6th.</p>



<p>It’s said that the release date of the game is placeholder at 12/31/2025, which would suggest a 2025 release date, rather than the 2024 release window that PlayStation previously gave.</p>



<p>Also outlined by the leaker is the prices of the upcoming editions, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<em><strong>Standard</strong></em>&nbsp;<em>Edition</em>&nbsp;(PS5 / Xbox Series X):&nbsp;<em>US$69.99</em></li>



<li><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong>Collector’s</strong>&nbsp;<em>Edition</em>&nbsp;(PS5 / Xbox Series X):&nbsp;<em>US$199.99</em></li>
</ul>



<p>According to Konami, the Metal Gear series has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-series-60m-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed over 60 million unit sales</a> since its first game released in 1987. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake</a> is set to launch in 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. </p>

<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty</em>‘s free-to-play battle royale <em>Warzone</em> has truly dominated the genre since its release, but do you need an Xbox Live subscription to play it? If you don’t currently pay for one, the answer will be music to your ears.</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">When I was growing up, the idea of a free-to-play multiplayer game was rare, as most required you to not only buy the game, but have an active Xbox Live Gold subscription. I still remember begging my mum to buy me an Xbox Live card in our local Game so I could keep playing <em>CoD4</em> with my mates. </p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">Now, things are different, and if you don’t currently have a subscription, or if <em>Warzone</em> is literally the only game you play, then there’s some good news for you. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>You can get into the action without Xbox Live. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-is-xbox-live-required-to-play-warzone" data-injectable="false">Is Xbox Live required to play <em>Warzone</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true"><strong>No, you do not need to have an active Xbox Live subscription to play <em>Warzone</em> on your Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S. </strong></p>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">You will need to have an active internet connection though, so don’t expect to be able to play if your console isn’t hooked up to the worldwide web. If you try that, you’ll be met with an error and spend your time looking at menus without ever jumping out of the plane. </p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="false">If you have your internet connection hooked in, simply open up the <em>Call of Duty </em>app on your console, select <em>Warzone</em>, and jump into a match. Please note though that this only works for <em>Warzone</em> and not <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, which you will need an Xbox Live subscription to play online. </p>

            <p>Capcom's upcoming entry in the lizard pants-making sim, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, got a new trailer at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">last night's State Of Play</a>. It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don't get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.</p>

<p>First off, I've plonked the trailer above. Watch it if you'd like, it's nice. And we certainly get a lot more of the gameplay goodness than we did from last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-looks-heckin-great-and-is-coming-in-2025">Geoff Fest unveiling</a>.</p>
<p>The real details lie in PlayStation's <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/monster-hunter-wilds-new-gameplay-details-from-todays-state-of-play/">blog post</a>, which expands on everything shown. First thing to note: we're shown one area in the trailer called the Windward Plains, that's made up of "sandy deserts, swaying grasslands, and twisting rock formations". And it's "just one such region that awaits you", which suggests there's another place with equally disgruntled dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The cursed lion shown off? Yeah that's a "Doshaguma", who sometimes hunt in packs and have a "wide habitat range". What this means is that you'll likely bump into these bastards a lot, then. Oh and the armoured frog? Yeah that's a "Chatacabra" whose *checks notes* saliva attaches ore and other "substances" to its forelegs to strengthen itself. Wish I could, like, spit some metal pellets onto my shins to make my legs a bit stronger as opposed to go to the gym. </p>
<p>Your new mount is Seikret, who lets you do lots of things while on the move. Like use your slinger or sharpen your weapon or gather materials: all very helpful to reduce tedium. They can even take you to spots automatically and switch to a secondary weapon without returning to base. Birds are great.</p>
<p>Fourteen weapons are returning! I won't list them all, but know that they are the same bunch found in a bazillion other Mon Hunts. The trailer shows off a couple of new actions for the Greatsword and the Heavy Bowgun, a parry follow-up and a bazooka respectively.</p>
<p>Focus Mode is a new thing, too. There's not too many specifics on how it <em>works</em>, but Capcom say it'll let you "have more precise control" over how you guard, aim, and attack monster weaknesses. And it makes it "easier to adjust your distance to the monster", which suggests it works a bit like a toggle to make the game a touch easier for new players.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there's a new version of the slinger that lets you collect items off the back of your bird and more, although they're coy about what "more" is. </p>
<p>I'm not the world's biggest Monster Hunter fan but I'm excited to give it a shot when it launches sometime in 2025, mainly because it looks really nice and is perhaps a touch more approachable to folks who aren't as familiar with the series as the longtime pants makers. One thing, though, they better have updated the bloody menus. God, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-rise-and-its-mountain-of-tutorial-boxes-are-giving-me-brain-freeze">Monster Hunter menus suck</a>.</p>

            <p>
This piece is being written on a train as I trundle towards our very first staff meeting with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more">Rock Paper Shotgun's new overlords</a>. The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2625550/Centum/">Steam page here</a>) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I'm changing trains...
</p><!--more-->
<p>
...I have now changed trains. Stuff and tarnation, there's nowhere to sit in this one and the carriage is full of excited children with musical voices and untarnished souls. How unlike the stone prison chamber of Centum, in which you are alone save for the occupant of a rathole - possibly a rat, though a talking one with unnecessarily large teeth - and a monstrous, multiple-headed jailor called the Judge, who appears each in-game morning to ask questions such as "What was the promise you made?" and then accuses you of lying, regardless (I think) of your answer.
</p>
<p>
Not all that alone, then. This is quite a populous prison cell, actually. There's a boy made of darkness, too, who wants to know if you're his friend, and I guess those disembodied eyes in the shadows count as cellmates? 
</p>
<p>
There's also a window which - once you've found an object you can use to clean it - looks out over a city of tombstone-shaped blocks and towers. "The sky is dead," reads some accompanying text. "The gods are dead. The gods are merciful. All the city can do is weep."  Still, it's easier on the eyes and ears than Finchley Road. Turn back to the table in the middle of the cell and you will find a nice cup of what could be tea and a wailing cosmic cube, a bit like Hellraiser's puzzlebox but a touch more Macintosh. Who you are is a matter of guesswork, but if you spill your "tea" you'll see the face of an old man in the puddle, an old man "with the eyes of a child". 
</p>
<p>
The game's branching dialogue choices make mention of old wars and bloodshed. Perhaps you are an imprisoned dictator of some kind. Not a feelgood game, in short. Also not a game you might enjoy if you dislike unfiltered literary thought experiments. "What's in a name?" asks the rat thing. "What good are names in your deranged and coal-gray limerick, where all is bound to die in flames?" 
</p>
<p>
I've now found a place to sit on the train, but still, Centum is a difficult game to write about on the tube. People keep looking over my shoulder and seeing the wailing cosmic cube and moving to the other side of the carriage. We pass through Kings Cross. Yet more children get on. Six squalling teenagers surround me, kicking my bag and jostling my elbows with scant regard for my expression of vast concentration. Three of them try to sit on the same chair, stacking themselves like Goombas. 
</p>
<p>
They're speaking French. Probably they're on an exchange visit? Do they read English? Are they reading these very words as I type them? Où est la clé de la prison? A hush settles upon the Gallic throng as they catch sight of the above screenshot of the talking rat-thing. I flip hurriedly through my folder in search of one that doesn't contain any images of rodents or other unpleasantries that might irreversibly damage the flower of French youth. Here you go, how about this shot of a smiling chatbot. Pretty sure that's PG-13 or below. Centum seems to hinge on repeated trips between the jail simulation and the opening desktop interface - clues found in the cell can be fed into various software so as to expose possibilities in the simulated world.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/20240519093319_1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Serenity Forge</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
To reword the quote above: "The sky is dead. The gods are dead. Les enfants m'ennuient. Oh hell, I've missed my stop". Centum is an extremely gloomy point-and-clicker with disgustingly rich pixelart that doesn't feel worlds away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a>, though it's more verbose and less (obviously) comedical. I suspect the high-handed writing will turn a few people off, but I'm looking forward to playing the full thing. At home.

        <p>Microsoft is now legally bound to take a neutral approach to the unionisation of employees at ZeniMax</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>ZeniMax Studios workers are now covered by Microsoft's labour neutrality agreement with the Communications Workers of America.</p>
<p>The CWA  announced yesterday that, as a result, all ZeniMax staff can now make their choice about collective bargaining, with Microsoft legally bound to take a neutral approach to the unionisation of its staff.</p>
<p>ZeniMax Workers United-CWA member Page Branson commented: "Thousands of our ZeniMax co-workers now have a free and fair path to organise together for better working conditions. When we organised our union under a similar legal agreement the process was clear and management did not try to influence anyone’s decision and the company did not try to interfere with the voting process.</p>
<p>"There is strength in numbers, and as our numbers grow at ZeniMax, at Microsoft, and in the video game industry, we will gain the respect we deserve and raise the standards of working conditions for everyone across the video gaming industry. When we benefit, the consumer and the company will ultimately benefit with us and help keep this industry stable for current and future workers."</p>
<p>This news comes <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">less than a month after Microsoft closed four ZeniMax-owned studios</a>, including US-based Arkane Austin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-and-cwa-enter-labor-neutrality-agreement">Microsoft and CWA entered a labour neutrality agreement in July 2022</a> as the Activision Blizzard acquisition was pending. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-reiterates-labour-neutrality-agreement-following-abk-acquisition">reiterated its commitment after the deal closed</a>, saying in October 2023 that it remained "steadfast in [its] support of current and future employees in whatever choice they make about their workplace and their representatives."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-qa-workers-form-union">Zenimax QA workers unionised in January 2023</a>, with a majority of 300 QA developers across Zenimax's US operations voting in favour of the creation of Zenimax Workers United.</p>

            <p>
Redfall's final ever update has been released, marking an end to Arkane Austin's work on the game - and indeed the now-shuttered studio's work in general.
</p>
<p>
Known as version 1.451.3.0 - a nod to video games' ongoing 0-4-5-1 easter egg, which dates back almost 30 years - this update adds features such as an offline mode and single player pausing, among others.
</p>
<p>
While these features have long been sought after - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-developer-working-to-u-turn-on-single-player-always-online-restriction">long promised</a>, it is a bittersweet moment. This marks the end of the game's development, roughly two years after it first released.

<p>
Redfall co-director <a href="https://x.com/Harvey1966/status/1796203861448983007">Harvey Smith</a> said this patch culminates months of work by the whole team, adding there had been a "Herculean effort by all involved" over recent weeks especially. "Have fun, always," the developer closed.
</p>
<p>
Resharing Smith's post, Arkane Lyon boss <a href="https://x.com/DBakaba/status/1796207388082471190">Dinga Bakaba</a> congratulated his former colleagues, acknowledging how much work had been put into the game. "Time to bite the fuck back!!!" Bakaba wrote. "I know how hard you all work on this and how much it matters to you all to let fans experience this version of the game, and as one of them, I can't wait to get my hands on it!!!"

The industry was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">quick to condemn Microsoft for its decision to shutter these Bethesda studios</a>, with Bakaba calling it a "a fucking gut stab".

            <p>
The New York Times, owner of Wordle, is suing a one-man geography-guessing alternative project named Worldle. 
</p>
<p>
Hit puzzle game Wordle was the work of British designer Josh Wardle, until it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-buys-puzzle-game-phenomenon-wordle-for-seven-figure-sum">bought by The New York Times in 2022 for a seven-figure sum</a>. It's now operated as part of The New York Times' growing games portfolio and is played by millions daily. 
</p>
<p>
The browser-based <a href="https://worldledaily.com/">Worldle</a>, meanwhile, was built and is still run by one man - Seattle-based Kory McDonald, and has around 100,000 players each month.

<p>
In a legal filing seen by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjrr5ee5zv8o">BBC</a>, The New York Times accuses McDonald of "creating confusion" and taking advantage of "the enormous goodwill" of Wordle for his own project. 
</p>
<p>
McDonald, speaking with the BBC, said in response that there was "a whole industry" of games with similar names.
</p>
<p>
"I'm just a one-man operation here, so I was kinda surprised," he said. "Worst-case scenario, we'll change the name, but I think we'll be okay."
</p>
<p>
Other games similar to Wordle include Flaggle for flags, Lewdle for rude words, Headle for music and Murdle for a mix of Wordle and hangman. But there are hundreds of others. 
</p>
<p>
In March, The New York Times issued a takedown notice to Reactle, a Wordle clone and code repository, which meant around 1900 other versions of the game were also taken down.
</p>
<p>
Last year, the newspaper <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-responds-to-only-connect-resemblance">shook off claims its Connections game bore a close resemblence to BBC Quiz show Only Connect</a>.

            <p>My PC has a big white case, and sometimes, I sit and think: “big white box good!” But other times, I glance over to my PS5 and think: “other big white box also good!” Then I start getting fanciful and imagine a lovely future where they can both combine into one. Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:</p>

Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">State Of Play</a>, Concord being a new 5V5 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of "free" and "vegan" referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled humus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume humus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I've got an overview trailer for you below.

Concord was announced a year ago, and is the work of Washington-based Firewalk. They were originally part of ProbablyMonsters, and were already working on Concord before Sony acquired them fully. The game is very much trying to be one of those sociable moshpit affairs where a brace of different tactics and readily role-playable hero characterisations give rise to a rich spread of watercooler anecdotes. Even as I type these words, I realise that I have never offered or heard a watercooler anecdote. No watercoolers out here in darkest Watford. Our anecdotes are all whispered between the aisles of Budgens, with one eye peeled for CCTV cameras, or scrawled on leaves and tossed into the ditches beside the M1.
</p>
<p>You will, of course, need a PlayStation Network account to play, as you will if you're playing<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-heads-to-pc-with-dlss-ultrawide-support-and-a-psn-requirement-for-some-reason"> the just-announced Steam version of God Of War Ragnarök on PC</a>. Here's our former EIC Katharine's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">announcement post about Concord and various other new shooters at last May's State Of Play showcase</a>. She was none too pleased with it, noting the overabundance of "bland new multiplayer shooters" and commenting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I was all ready to love this sci-fi whateveritis with its weird space burgers, detailed ship innards and enigmatic blinking lights. But oh no. The PlayStation Blog post for it revealed the sad truth. It tells us it's "a bringing together of peoples", that each log on will bring you "a new adventure" and every match "is an opportunity for a new story". 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Gosh, that Katharine certainly was a live one.
</p>
<p>
Preorders for Concord start on 6th June, unlocking beta access for you and four friends in July. There are 16 characters in total, encompassing a familiar spread of tanks and DPS and support. You've got chonky sentinels who can deploy force barricades, mystics who can glide and cast fire walls, and diving assault-types who can use infra to shoot through their own smokescreens. I'm not seeking anything as funky as a Tracer Blink combo or a rolling robo-hamsterball, but it looks like there's some variety, and the visuals and animations are snappy. We can expect weekly cinematic vignettes to introduce each character. Speaking of which, here's a story trailer to close us out.

Panic co-founder Cabel Sasser went on a surprising sojourn during his GDC talk to explain four pallets of Playdate stock had vanished after being dispatched from the company's shipping center in Las Vegas. The company initially managed to retrieve two pallets, but the other two remained unaccounted for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We checked up on our inventory levels and it was a little bit short, and we contacted the shipping center and they're like 'yeah, weird.

More on that in the inevitable podcast/write-up, as it’s a crucial part of how we got these back," said the company, replying to an X user who asked whether all the devices had been returned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Underlining the importance of finding the missing consoles, Panic explained its insurance policy likely wouldn't have covered the theft. "We haven't written them off of inventory yet, and we never filed an insurance claim," it continued. "We're not even sure our insurance would cover this. So you can imagine we're glad they're back."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-heads-to-pc-with-dlss-ultrawide-support-and-a-psn-requirement-for-some-reason<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Per last night’s Sony State of Play, PS5 darling and supposedly rather good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a>-dad adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> is coming to PC on September 19th 2024. The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That’s according to Ragnarök’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/">Steam page</a>, which warns of the looming PSN demand (as does that of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/">Until Dawn</a>, another incoming Windows port that’s being slapped with the added login requirement). Sony’s push to insert PSN into (upon?) their PC games became infamous when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> players revolted, ultimately forcing the publisher to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">abandon the requirement</a>. However, the more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</a> launched with PSN fully baked in, despite it making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-runs-well-on-steam-deck-making-its-psn-nonsense-all-the-more-annoying">co-op impossible to play on the Steam Deck</a>.</p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mVaKztSoJM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>It’s worth repeating that PSN’s problems extend beyond the inconvenience of forcing yet another login process, or the compatibility of a single type of handheld device. Because the service itself is only available in a minority of countries, there are over 170 nations where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement">PSN-reliant games are struck off sale by Steam</a>, rendering them unplayable by legal means. That means the likes of Japan, the British and US Virgin Islands, Vietnam, Pakistan, and most of Africa are all locked out, and while Sony’s justification for Ghost of Tsushima amounted to PSN enabling PC/PlayStation crossplay, that doesn’t explain why it’s a requirement for purely solo games like God of War Ragnarök and Until Dawn.</p>
<p>The most likely reasoning, mind, isn’t hard to figure out. Any increase in PSN signups will simultaneously furnish Sony with valuable user data <em>and</em> make some number in a spreadsheet somewhere go higher, which in turn convinces a man in a suit that their service is excellent and beloved even as it does literally nothing to actually serve the person using it. Urgh.</p>
<p>Otherwise, God of War Ragnarök at least looks like a considered PC port, and will include its roguelike-flavoured Valhalla DLC as standard. You might note that this launch comes just under two years after the godkilling hackslasher’s original PS5 launch, suggesting that Sony are furthering tightening the period for which it leaves the console exclusives as console exclusives. Though if all their future ports are going to be leaden with PSN requirements, then that’s probably not as exciting a development.</p>

			<p>Where Winds Meet, the upcoming Wuxia-inspired RPG from Everstone Studio, is also coming to PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Sony and Everstone producer Beralt Lyu <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/where-winds-meet-brings-superhuman-open-world-martial-arts-adventure-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the arrival on PS5 during Sony's PlayStation State of Play broadcast overnight. Initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-is-a-wuxia-open-world-sandbox-rpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> as a PC exclusive, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuxia-open-world-game-where-winds-meet-starts-first-closed-beta-test-in-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a closed beta for US players recently</a>. The game is set during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in imperial China from 907 to 979. The title is said to offer a vast and seamless open world with richly filled different regions. "Where Winds Meet has an oriental martial arts theme, and we attach great importance to the presentation of martial arts (Wuxia) elements in the game", producer Lyu explains. "Weapons are an important part of the player’s combat ability. We try to restore a variety of unique weapons in Wuxia martial arts in the game such as Spear, Sword, Fan, Dual Blades, Umbrella, and Glaive."</p>
<p>On PS5, the title will be optimized for the PS5 DualSense controller to further enhance immersion.</p>
<p>We've included the trailer that was shown during Sony's event below:</p>

<p>Shortly after the game's announcement in 2022, we interviewed the game's development team. This interview contains plenty of details about the upcoming title. Be sure to <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-qa-devs-reveal-tons-of-info-on-this-exciting-wuxia-sandbox-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read it in full here</a>. We've included a short part of the interview below:</p>
<p><em><strong>How big is the playable world in the game? How long does it take to get from one end to another of the map?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We expect the first version to have more than 20 square kilometers (5K * 5K), but we are constantly adjusting this according to the content. As the world of this game has a 3D structure, there is an underground space and altitude. The game will continue to be updated and expanded in the future. The first version will feature a large city, Bianjing City, a large wild area, and small towns.</em></p>
<p>Where Winds Meet has yet to receive a release date on PS5 and PC. We'll update you as soon as more information comes in on this exciting new title.</p>

			<p>Bungie has announced a new Destiny 2 collaboration with Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise. As a celebration for D&amp;D's 50th anniversary, starting on June 4 (release day of The Final Shape expansion), Destiny 2 players will find three&nbsp;Faerûn-inspired skins in the Eververse store: the Gold Dragon-themed Apex Draconic set for Titans, the Mind Flayers-themed Flayer’s Dominion set for Warlocks, and the Displacer Beast’s-themed Spectral Displacer set for Hunters.</p>
<p>You can check them out in the brief video embedded below.</p>
<p>Additional cosmetic items available for purchase include the Adventurer’s Pack Bundle, which comes with a Queen of Dragons ship, the Owlbear Chariot, and the Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell. There's also a Bigby’s Fist Finisher and a Natural 20 Emote, which will be randomly rolled each time it is used. Out of the game, the Bungie Store will also offer an Eye Tyrant Beholder Ghost Shell vinyl figure inspired by the infamous floating gaze monster from the D&amp;D universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Final Shape | Dungeons &amp; Dragons x Destiny" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hDdeAYUpG1o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is only the latest D&amp;D 50th anniversary cross-over, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-d-and-d-castlevania-2v8-project-t-what-the-fog-spinoff-shadow-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight one</a> that goes live on June 3. Destiny 2 is also very used to cross-overs, having previously hosted <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-gets-the-witcher-themed-cosmetics-with-next-weeks-season-of-the-wish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-destin-2-crossover-free-and-paid-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mass Effect</a> in the past few months.</p>
<p>Of course, fans of the game are mostly focused on the imminent launch of the next expansion, which will finally bring the current storyline to an end.</p>
<p><em>Guardians will enter the Traveler in an epic showdown to stop the Witness from calcifying all reality into a nightmarish shape of its twisted design. Players will join the Vanguard and Cayde-6 to journey through The Pale Heart and take on the Witness’s army. Guardians will battle new enemies, traverse surreal landscapes, and use Prismatic powers that blend Light and Darkness.</em></p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-gets-launch-trailer-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch trailer</a> of The Final Shape from earlier this week, in case you missed it.</p>

The actor says that when developing 2005’s Shadow the Hedgehog, Sega was, at one point, shooting for a “Mature” rating with the ESRB and asked him to record different versions for many of Shadow’s lines. Griffith says that in these M-rated takes, “they had me say f*** in every single line.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"There’s a hard drive somewhere with hours of recordings of Shadow yelling f*** at Tails and Sonic and stuff."</p></div><p>"It was just every sentence, I would be yelling ‘Sonic, give me that f***ing Chaos Emerald!’ or something like that," Griffith added. "I had no idea what was going on but I just went with it, and I had fun. There’s a hard drive somewhere with hours of recordings of Shadow yelling f*** at Tails and Sonic and stuff."</p><p>Sega typically keeps curse words out of its anthropomorphic mascots’ mouths. Sonic is a series suited for children with one major exception: Shadow the Hedgehog. The spinoff game sees Sonic’s edgy other half using a variety of firearms as players navigate a choose-your-own-adventure-style campaign. It’s a darker take on the Sonic universe that even sees Shadow saying things like “damn” just before threatening to send Eggman to “hell.” It’s a lot, but apparently the ambivalent hedgehog almost used some other choice words, too.</p><p>Alas, Shadow the Hedgehog wound up with an E10+ rating when it eventually launched for Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. This is the first we’re hearing of Shadow’s more colorful vocabulary, and it’s unclear if those recordings are truly out there somewhere or if they will ever see the light of day.</p><p>IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><p>Shadow is having quite the moment, as Sega has gone as far as to dub 2024 the “year of Shadow.” The character, who first appeared in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure 2</a> on the Dreamcast, is getting the spotlight in more ways than one. He’ll make his theatrical debut in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-release-date-cast-story-trailer-details"><u>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</u></a> (with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-voice-casting">voicework from Keanu Reeves</a>) when it premieres later this year. There’s also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-announced-for-this-fall-state-of-play-2024"><u>Sonic x Shadow Generations</u></a>, a remaster featuring extra red-and-black-hedgehog-themed content that is set to release this fall.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, we didn’t love Shadow’s standalone game when it first released in 2005. We called it “bad” in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/18/shadow-the-hedgehog"><u>4.7 review</u></a>, saying that its speedy gameplay “doesn’t make up for the game's long list of shortcomings, from stupid level design, unrefined controls and useless gunplay to disappointingly outdated graphics.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

    </div><div>



            <p>Twitch is reportedly terminating all members of its Safety Advisory Council team.</p>
<p>According to an email seen by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/twitch-ends-contracts-for-its-safety-advisory-council-sac-trust-safety.html">CNBC</a>, staff were allegedly told their contracts would end today and that they would not receive payment for the second half of the year per an internal agreement.</p>
<p>A spokesperson told CNBC that the Safety Advisory Council will continue, but will be "primarily made up of individuals who serve as Twitch ambassadors" who will "offer fresh, diverse perspectives."</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Twitch for further clarification.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-unveils-new-safety-advisory-council">Twitch's Safety Advisory Council formed in 2020</a>, and was originally made up of nine online safety experts and Twitch partners to consult on drafting new policies and updating current ones, in addition to creating new products and protecting marginalised groups.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-brings-back-1v1k-action-in-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, during Sony's State of Play, KOEI TECMO announced Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the next chapter in the long-standing 1v1000 action franchise.</p>
<p>Tomohiko Sho, producer and head of developer Omega Force, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>For almost 30 years, the DYNASTY WARRIORS franchise has been built by delivering not only a sense of realism on the battlefield, but by the exhilarating action of 1 vs. 1,000 gameplay. With DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS, we return to these roots and deliver the non-stop action to not only our most loyal fans of the series, but to all game fans worldwide, delivering the most thrilling warfare we’ve ever been able to create.</em></p>
<p>Speaking to the PlayStation Blog, Sho also <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/dynasty-warriors-origins-revealed-for-ps5-out-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>We are creating an all-new Warriors-like battlefield where you’re challenged by massive armies as far as the eye can see. With the overwhelming number and scale of enemy armies pushing towards you, you’ll have to act fast and with force if you want to survive. In addition to your own striking power, you’ll need to coordinate with allied armies and enjoy the tactical aspects of gameplay in order to take out the hoard of enemies in our most tension-filled fights to date.</em></p>
<p><em>But that’s not all, as for the first time in Dynasty Warriors franchise history, we will depict the chaos of the Three Kingdoms from the eyes of a ‘nameless hero’. Play through the historical tale of war through the eyes of our new protagonist, showcasing the vast land of China and its timeless soldiers and generals like never before.</em></p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins will be released in 2025 for PC (via Steam), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. KOEI TECMO and Omega Force will certainly strive to do better than with Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires, which was middling at best, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dynasty-warriors-9-empires-a-kingdom-in-disarray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to our Francesco De Meo</a>.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Grinding Gear Games <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3526594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> during Sony's State of Play broadcast that Path of Exile 2 would launch in late 2024 in early access on both PC and consoles. The game will also offer couch co-op support, full cross-play, and cross-progression between all platforms.</p>
<p>The New Zealand-based developer shared a new trailer that you can watch below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Console Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmZgL234miM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqYTZHX-QVE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a developer diary on how it's 'redefining' the console experience in this sequel. Game Director Jonathan Rogers said:</p>
<p><em>When we started working on Path of Exile 2 on console, we knew we had to do a much better job</em><br>
<em>than we've done in the past. And Path of Exile 2 is a great game to do that with because the combat is so much more visceral and action-oriented. As soon as we tried it on a controller, all of those extra features that we did to make melee combat feel so much better just really came out and felt great. We've got a dedicated team for console now, and they were able to create a new user interface just for controller, and we're really excited to show it to you guys.</em></p>
<p>Trevor Gamon, Console Game Director, added:</p>
<p><em>It's twin stick, so basically left stick is your movement as you'd expect, and right stick is the direction control for your character. It allows you to do things like run backwards and stuff like that. It also overrides the auto targeting, so it allows you to actually manually target enemies that are surrounding you, giving you much greater control. It works in combination with the 24 keybinds.</em></p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-announced-featuring-massive-engine-overhaul-path-of-exile-mobile-in-the-works-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>in late 2019, Path of Exile 2 (despite the name) wasn't initially planned to be a full sequel. This <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-is-now-a-full-sequel-closed-beta-to-start-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> less than a year ago, with news coming out of ExileCon 2023.</p>
<p>The free-to-play action RPG will feature twelve classes, each with three Ascendancy specializations, 240 Skill Gems and 200 Support Gems to customize your skills, a six-act campaign, and over 100 endgame maps, each with its own boss fight.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-final-shape-pre-load-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-final-shape-requires-a-300-gb-pre-load-on-pc.886047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-final-shape-pre-load-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On June 4, The Final Shape – Destiny 2’s long-awaited key update – will be released globally on all platforms. Recently, pre-load information surfaced online, highlighting some monumental and mind-blowing storage requirements – but there are methods to the madness. It was revealed that on Steam, users will need to have 299.7 GB of free storage space to pre-load the update, but that’s being put down to ‘how Steam handles updates’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-final-shape-is-large">The Final Shape is LARGE</h2>



<p>It’s not a small thing on <strong>any </strong>platform, but on PC, The Final Shape is a swole beast ready to devour your drives – temporarily, at least.</p>



<p>Once the update has been installed, the old version of Destiny 2 will be installed as the new version is layered over the top, ultimately slicing down the total installation size by around half. It just needs that extra wiggle room to deliver said update.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of The Final Shape’s install size on all platforms:</p>



<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 143.81 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 4: 110.7 GB</li>



<li>Xbox One: 139.52 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series X|S: 165.82 GB</li>



<li>Steam: 299.7 GB</li>



<li>Epic Games Store: 279.66 GB</li>



<li>Microsoft Store: 156.22 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s significant, that’s for sure. It’s a contender for one of the biggest single update installs in gaming history – and it might just take the prize, I just can’t be bothered to do the research. </p>



<p>On June 3, The Final Shape will be deployed <strong>after </strong>10 AM PT on most platforms, but Bungie has advised:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In an effort to decrease server load, some PlayStation users may be able to pre-download Update 8.0.0.1 starting on June 1, 2024, after 10 AM PT.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the name, The Final Shape doesn’t mark the end of Destiny 2, which was released way back in 2017. Bungie is still hard at work on the game, we just don’t know what’s coming next.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview.886011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At last, an open-world game that measures up – literally. On the one hand, Infinity Nikki is the console-ready follow-up to the Miracle Nikki and Shining Nikki series of dress-up games on mobile from Chinese game publisher Infold. On the other, it takes some influence from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with ex-Nintendo BOTW director Kentaro Tominaga as its executive producer.</p><p>And as I discovered from three hours playing a packed new demo on PC, Infinity Nikki blends the best of these two disparate worlds – and tucks a ton of surprises under its sparkly belt.</p><p>As she digs through her attic in search of an outfit for the ball, titular heroine Nikki is thrown headlong into adventure when she finds an enchanted red and purple glittering dress in a wardrobe. Dancing with the dress, it suddenly pulls her and her talking cat-like pet/BFF Momo into a fantastical, mysterious realm. There, in the bowels of a crumbling castle, Nikki meets a cursed goddess named Ena the Curator, who grants Nikki with the Heart of Infinity and all its powers, sending her to Miraland and tasking her with reviving all the Miracle Outfits to save the world from evil. It’s like The Wizard of Oz meets Final Fantasy meets Paris Fashion Week, with a healthy sprinkling of Gravity Rush and The Neverending Story for good measure.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Just like in BOTW, Infinity Nikki has an impressive sense of scale and varied locations that encourage exploration. The rolling countryside and mountain backdrop of the opening Memorial Mountains location is Hyrule as interpreted by Studio Ghibli, while the village of Florawish is idyllic and alive, drenched in colourful flowers, and bustling with NPCs who give Nikki interesting lore updates or side missions. The village’s gorgeous European architecture is dotted with collectibles such as Blings (currency) and Whimstars (skill-tree points) that reward curious explorers, and Momo is always on hand to help out – temporarily viewing the world through his eyes allows you to find and track nearby Whimstars. Chests hidden here and there may contain a prize, but they sometimes spit out enemies you must defeat before you can get the loot.</p><p>Dungeons offer more advanced platforming action and fantastical boss creatures, while glowing pink cubes open up Zelda-style shrines, with environmental puzzles and other challenges that grant special rewards when beaten. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - General Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>True to the roots of the series, the fashion theme permeates Infinity Nikki from shoulder to hem. With her long pink twin tails and her cute feminine style, Nikki is fabulously dressed from the off, and players can unlock a huge variety of outfits. A skill tree allows you to spend Whimstars on outfit blueprints, while others can be received from NPCs and side quests, or by winning them from a gacha machine. </p><p>Once you have the blueprints for an outfit, you can craft it, so long as you have the corresponding materials. </p><p>Some of these outfits give Nikki new abilities, such as a floating jump to cross wide gaps, a glider (similar to Link’s), a long-range attack to “purify” enemies, or an angling suit to go fishing; each of these can be equipped via a selection wheel or by using keyboard shortcuts. Others are purely cosmetic and can be mixed and matched to your heart’s desire. When you equip a dress and use its abilities, Nikki instantly changes outfits, and then changes back when you’re done, so you can spend most of the time in the ensemble of your choice. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Photo Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The rich graphics show the detail in each item of clothing, right down to the type of material, from delicately patterned translucent silk to chunky wool. Each outfit comes with its own set of animations, too – for example, when Nikki changes into the Floating Outfit, bubbles follow her as she glides gracefully across the screen, adding to the vibe nicely.</p><p>Enemies, too, are sometimes made from scraps of spare fabric, while all of the crafting materials Nikki collects are used for making clothes, from plants in the shape of buttons to insects in the shape of socks. One outfit lets Nikki brush and trim animals for their fur, enabling stealth movement so that she can sneak up and catch them unaware; as you trim creatures based on cats, dogs and sheep, they roll around in ecstasy, which is utterly adorable.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Character and Hero Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The world of Miraland is populated by fashion-conscious characters, both male and female. Early in the demo, Nikki meets Dada and her younger sister Bebe, who invite her to join them in the Florawish Stylists’ Guild. The guild house is bedecked with beautiful décor, every member impeccably dressed. Meanwhile, Giovanni, a local crafter of wishing items, is softly handsome, like he stepped directly from an otome dating game.</p><p>Once registered with the guild, Nikki – now a full-fledged Stylist – receives a Pear-Pal tablet, which is essentially her Sheikah Slate, from which you can enter your nickname, check Nikki’s Stylist level, adjust her wardrobe, check an item compendium and more. Here you can also track main quests, side quests and individual crafting ingredients, a very helpful QOL feature, while the map is marked with useful icons. All in all, it’s a set of immediately approachable tools that make the game accessible to pretty much anyone. </p><p>Similarly, the game offers various options to aid exploration, such as a bicycle rental shop and, if you can find it, a giant bird that you can ride as it flies a predetermined loop around the map.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Challenge Room Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>That said, Infinity Nikki’s dungeons do offer a fair degree of challenge. An early dungeon I played saw Nikki traversing the Dream Warehouse, a magical building with thousands of discarded paper cranes dotted all over the place, each representing a wish cast by the hopeful villagers of Florawish. The warehouse has now been overrun by monsters, which Nikki must purify. The origami papercraft motif continues as you begin platforming across giant paper cranes, which seesaw as Nikki clambers aboard their wings, making timing important. Nikki can also dash, which doubles as a dodge, and perform a Ground Pound type attack to defeat enemies or smash breakable objects.</p><p>Purifying enemies that stand in your path, reaching tricky distant platforms for optional collectibles – it’s not the toughest platforming challenge in the world, but it’s enough to keep you on your toes. Using a mouse and keyboard, I fell down many an abyss, so I was happy to hear that the final game will support controllers. The stage ends with Nikki riding on a massive paper crane that soars ever higher over a stunning skyscape to the soundtrack of a song with lyrics about reaching new heights – a dizzying reward for your efforts so far.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Dungeons Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I played an offline demo, but the game will eventually include online features. The details of the online gameplay are still tbc, but the developers explained it will be a solo-focused game where everyone plays as Nikki, but with community aspects (in line with Death Stranding, perhaps). I played on PC, but mobile and console versions are also in the works. A release date is still tbc.</p><p>There is an innocent charm to Infinity Nikki. The protagonist is endlessly cheerful, constantly bigging up the characters around her with “you got this!” pep talk. When her feline friend Momo pulls out a camera to introduce photo mode, Nikki tells him, “You look like a professional photographer!”, while one dialogue tree I saw gave the option to simply “Say something nice” – a refreshing show of positivity and enthusiasm that is infectious.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Outfits Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Incidentally, the photo mode is excellent – perfectly tailored to such a fashion-focused game, and packed with features such as poses, filters, depth of field control and a toggle switch to have Nikki face the camera. Photo mode alone could occupy you for hours, as you have Nikki switch between outfits against a picturesque backdrop of luscious hills and sparkling streams, and pose for the camera with a bouquet of flowers, lounging on a bench, or making a heart shape with her hands.</p><p>Miraland’s locations are filled with wonder, its atmosphere endlessly engaging, dotted with minigames and soundtracked by gentle piano music. The game is dripping in detailed fashion, rich animations and watercolour concept art, while its mechanics are surprisingly deep and interesting. When using fast travel, Nikki strikes a classic pose, her hand and face towards the sky, as she dissolves into the ether to reappear elsewhere – and little details like this show how much care has gone into development.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Infinity Nikki - Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I was also surprised to find myself drawn into the story, in which an ancient battle between gods and demons has given rise to a centuries-old society of stylists. It’s certainly unique!</p><p>I have to say, I never knew dressing up could be so much fun. My time with Infinity Nikki left me eager to try on the finished game when it eventually arrives.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Earlier this year, Sony announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-pc-ps5-unreal-engine-5-full-camera-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of the cult-favorite narrative horror game Until Dawn</a> from Ballistic Moon, a new studio founded by veterans of original Until Dawn creators Supermassive Games. The game is being developed with Unreal Engine 5 and will feature a fully controllable camera rather than the old-school fixed angles of the original game. That all sounds good, but the original teaser trailer for the new Until Dawn didn’t really show us much.</p>
<p>Well, today during the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a> showcase, we got a better look at the new Until Dawn, including the game’s updated character models. Overall, the game is looking quite good -- very comparable to the original despite its less restrictive camera. Most characters look very much like they did before, or even a bit better, although some do look a bit different. The overall lighting and tone of the game has changed fairly significantly as well. Check the new trailer out for yourself and see how it compares.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Gameplay Trailer | State of Play May 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jl1WjQBzLnI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a big fan of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/until-dawn-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Until Dawn</a>, I think things are shaping up pretty well with this remake. Here’s what Ballistic Moon had to say about the project back when it was first unveiled…</p>
<p><em>“Rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5, Until Dawn has seen a number of enhancements across the board, all made with passion and care for the original from the team of horror lovers, film fanatics, and veteran game makers at Ballistic Moon; and it’s coming to PS5 and PC this year! Until Dawn has been rebuilt with the latest tools and techniques. New and improved animations build on the success of the original character performances. Characters, environments and VFX have been upgraded – all for a truly enhanced cinematic horror experience.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-on-pc-in-september-with-dlss-3-7-and-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just like God of War: Ragnarok</a>, it will require a PSN account to be played on PC despite being a single player game.</p>
<p>The new Until Dawn arrives on PC and PS5 sometime this fall (a more specific release date has yet to be revealed). What do you think? Interested in taking a trip back to the cabin?</p>

For <em>Path of Exile II</em> though, we really wanted to bring the experience of playing together to the couch.</p><p>Players can play collaboratively on a single account, or log in with two separate <em>Path of Exile</em> accounts on the same console.</p><p>In addition, <em>Path of Exile II</em> is introducing full cross-play and cross-progression. Play with your friends without losing any progress!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Twelve Character Classes</strong> – <em>Path of Exile II</em> features twelve character classes, two for every combination of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. While each of the class variants focuses on a different playstyle, they’re just a starting point. You can combine skills from many classes together to create your ideal character build. Each of the twelve character classes has its own three Ascendancy specializations, resulting in a total of 36 Ascendancy Classes to pick between.</li><li><strong>New Skill Gem System</strong> – <em>Path of Exile II</em> features 240 Skill Gems that grant devastating active skills, and 200 Support Gems that modify their behavior. Earn the Gems as you play through the Campaign and combine them together to create your perfect build. This is the next generation of <em>Path of Exile</em>’s famous skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It’s now possible to six-link every skill your character uses.</li><li><strong>Dual-Specialize Your Passive Skill Tree</strong> – <em>Path of Exile</em>’s iconic Passive Skill Tree has made a return, with 1,500 skills that allow you to completely customize your gameplay experience. It now features Dual Specialization, the ability to allocate some passive skill points to two different sets of skills. They engage whenever the appropriate weapon or skill type is used. For example, you can have some points allocated to both daggers and traps, or ice and lightning, and as you swap between attacks, the appropriate skill points will apply. This lets you specialize in multiple areas without opportunity cost.</li><li><strong>Uncover All-New Items</strong> – <em>Path of Exile II</em> features 700 equipment base types and every single one has its own unique item you can find. You can augment your arsenal with new weapons such as Spears, Crossbows and Flails, as well as supplementary items like Focuses, Traps and redesigned Sceptres.</li><li><strong>Encounter Unique Bosses</strong> – In <em>Path of Exile II</em>, every area of the Campaign contains a boss encounter. There’s over a hundred bosses to fight as you make your way through the Acts and they all have unique mechanics to learn.</li><li><strong>Explore a New Endgame</strong> – At the conclusion of <em>Path of Exile II</em>’s six-act campaign, you’ll gain access to its endgame. Each of the more than 100 endgame maps has its own boss encounter! We’ll reveal more details of the surprises that await you in <em>Path of Exile II</em>’s endgame in the leadup to release.</li><li><strong>Fair-to-Play. Never Pay-to-Win</strong> – <em>Path of Exile II</em> is a separate game to the original <em>Path of Exile</em>. We will continue to offer expansions for both games going forward. They are completely free-to-play and will never be “pay to win.” Purchases are shared between the two games.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Console Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmZgL234miM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Developer Diary: Redefining the Console <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></span></h2><p><iframe title="Developer Diary: Redefining the Console Experience in Path of Exile 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GqYTZHX-QVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/balatro-name-joker-poker-cards-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Balatro</em>. It's a <em>great </em>name for a video game about cards. "Balatro" was the Roman word for what we'd later call a jester, which not only ties wonderfully into poker's joker-heavy motif (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2024/03/21/balatro-was-almost-called-joker-poker-and-other-details-from-its-creator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joker Poker</a>!), but also sounds like a dusty old casino game only your uncle would know how to play.</p><p>Like all good names for a thing, though, <em>Balatro</em> didn't get there straight away. There was workshopping to do, alternatives to consider, and earlier today<a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1796267924182974528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the game's creator LocalThunk shared the shortlist of names</a> that were considered before<em> Balatro</em> emerged victorious.</p><p>In the long and storied tradition of taking some fun news and turning it into a video game website blog, I have decided to rank these rejected names:</p><p>1) Balatron<br>2) Hand of the Fool<br>3) Foolish Poker<br>4) Trial of the Joker<br>5) Fools Gauntlet<br>6) Joker Poker<br>7) Trial of the Fool<br>8) Rogue Poker<br>9) Balatronic Hold em<br>10) Fools Gambit<br>11) Fools Hold em<br>12) Hyperborean Hold 'em<br>13) Cartomancer's Hold 'em<br>14) Rogue Hold 'em</p><p><em>Balatron </em>wins because it sounds like the coolest Decepticon ever. An old oil derrick that transforms into a 30-foot robot with a beard and cowboy hat that's voiced by Kenny Rogers.</p><p>The <em>Hold 'ems</em> come last because they suck. They would have made this GOTY contender sound like a mobile game that you only ever hear about in aggressive pop-up ads.</p><p>I'm glad <em>Balatro </em>won out, it was clearly the best option, for the reasons I stated earlier but also because it's just so fun to say. Both in your normal voice and in an exaggerated Italian accent while making hand gestures.</p><p>And just so you know I'm not making fun of the bad options, I know how hard it is to name something! Here's a screengrab of the document we shared while naming this website, whittled down to four options after we'd culled a bunch of excruciating video game-related terms like Mainline and Endgame (🤮).</p><figure></figure><p>"Please subscribe to Vestige"?
