Add-on accessories like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Elite Series 2 Controller</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Headphones-Console/dp/B0DH689JGY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Xbox Wireless Headset</a> can help you get the most out of your new gaming console, while others, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Seagate</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Western Digital’s</a> expansion cards, can help ensure you have ample storage space to stow all of your favorite games.</p><p>Below, we’ve listed some of the best accessories available for the Series X and Series S, many of which often go on sale at most major retailers.</p><div><p id="PiDUH5"><h2>Controllers</h2></p></div><div><p id="9Qjrmb"><h3>Xbox Wireless Controller</h3></p></div><p>The last-gen Xbox wireless controller from the Xbox One generation is compatible with the Series X / S consoles. However, the older controller lacks a few features only found in the newer, better version. For instance, the revised controller (which comes with every new Series X and Series S) has a dedicated button for saving and sharing clips and screenshots, a USB-C port for wired use or charging <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=TheVergeXboxAccessory110921&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fbatteries-chargers%2Fplay-and-charge-kit" rel="sponsored">Microsoft’s play-and-charge rechargeable battery</a>, and an improved D-pad.</p><p>In addition to working with the latest Xbox consoles, Microsoft’s base-model Xbox controller also features Bluetooth support, so you can connect it to modern Android phones, Apple devices, a Steam Deck (or any competing handheld gaming PC), or a PC. If your PC doesn’t have Bluetooth, you can just plug in via USB.</p><p>The Xbox Wireless controller retails between $59.99 and $64.99, depending on the color, but we often see it on sale for as low as $40. And, for those who want something really unique, you can order a custom model through the <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/configure/xbox-wireless-controller">Xbox Design Lab</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->44</span></p><div><p>The official Xbox Wireless Controller has a dedicated share button for saving clips and screenshots and sharing them online, Bluetooth support, and a USB-C port for charging up Microsoft’s play-and-charge rechargeable battery.</p></div></div><div><p id="yXdu1y"><h3>Xbox Elite Series 2 controllers</h3></p></div><p>If you want the ability to customize your controller to better suit your play style, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Xbox Elite Series 2 controller</a> might be a better fit.</p><p>Although it’s twice as expensive as the aforementioned Xbox Wireless Controller, we consider the customizable Elite Series 2 to be the best premium Xbox controller you can buy. Its thumbsticks have adjustable tension (although they aren’t drift-free Hall effect sticks, sadly), it has back paddles that support custom button mapping, and it features hair-trigger locks that enable shorter, clickier throws of the triggers. Just like the basic Xbox Wireless Controller, the Elite Series 2 offers both USB-C and Bluetooth connectivity, along with excellent battery life that should provide roughly 40 hours of playtime on a single charge. Although the Elite Series 2 has an MSRP of $179.99, it’s somewhat normal to see it dip to as low as $139.99.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->150</span></p><div><p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 is easily one of our favorite controllers at <em>The Verge</em>. It’s an improvement on the already excellent Elite controller, with deep customization, optional rear paddle buttons, a swappable D-pad, and analog sticks that allow you to tailor its layout to suit your play style.</p></div></div><p>Then there’s the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23340603/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-white-controller-release-date-price">cheaper version</a> that comes packaged with fewer accouterments (no hard case, no extra sticks, and no back paddles). The Core version is the same controller in two-tone white, red, or blue — but again, without the accessories — and has a list price of $129.99. Thankfully, it’s common to find it for around $100, and you can always buy the accessories later <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fcomplete-component-pack" rel="sponsored">via Microsoft for $59.99</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->96</span></p><div><p>The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 – Core is functionally identical to the more expensive Elite Series 2 but doesn’t come with the extra D-pad, back paddles, thumbsticks, or charging case.</p></div></div><div><p id="7e5i5Y"><h3>PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller</h3></p></div><p>If you’d rather spend less and don’t mind using a wired controller, the PowerA Enhanced is a great budget-friendly pick. It lacks wireless connectivity, but it works just the same as official controllers on Xbox Series X / S consoles and PC. The low-frills controller comes in several colors as well as some licensed designs, and is available for as low as $27 in some instances.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->27</span></p><div><p>The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller includes a 10-foot USB cable, and is supported by Xbox consoles and PC.</p></div></div><div><p id="8bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller"><h3>8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller</h3></p></div><p>Another option that typically goes for around <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSP5BB7Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$30</a> is 8BitDo’s newer Ultimate Wired Controller. It isn’t nearly as flashy as the PowerA Enhanced, but it has some features that might make it a better choice — again, so long as you don’t mind connecting to your console with a long cable. What sets it apart from other affordable options, as well as both of Microsoft’s wireless controllers, is its Hall effect joysticks and triggers. Those, unlike what you’ll find in first-party gamepads from Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony, are built to resist wearing down over time, thus preventing degraded performance.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->28</span></p><div><p>The newest 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox includes Hall effect analog sticks and triggers, plus two rear buttons, customizable mapping and sensitivity, and is also compatible with PC and mobile devices.</p></div></div><div><p id="charging-stands"><h2>Charging stands</h2></p></div><div><p id="oVZGVG"><h3>PowerA Solo Charging Stand</h3></p></div><p>If you’re keen on buying an Xbox wireless controller, you’re probably already well aware of another cost associated with using them: batteries. Those can get costly, but PowerA’s Solo Charging Stand is a great, inexpensive workaround. The handy stand includes a 1,100mAh rechargeable battery, two battery covers, and a USB charging cable. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Solo-Charging-Stand-Xbox-X-dp-B0C8RQJ4L2/dp/B0C8RQJ4L2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPowerA-Solo-Charging-Stand-for-Xbox-Series-X-S-Black%2F661963767" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fxbox%2Fxbox-one%2Fcharging%2Fsolo-charging-stand-for-xbox-black-xbpw0078-01%2F" rel="sponsored">PowerA</a> typically sell the black and white configurations for $19.99, but you might find it for less. Alternatively, if you own two gamepads, you should opt for a <a href="http://amazon.com/dp/B09FZ45891/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$29.99 PowerA Duo Charging Station</a>, which can occasionally be found for less than the single-controller base model.</p><div><p id="uMlSvQ"><h2>Headsets</h2></p></div><div><p id="rkwJPA"><h3>Xbox Wireless Headset</h3></p></div><p>You don’t have to miss a call while you game, thanks to Microsoft’s $99.99 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Headphones-Console/dp/B0DH689JGY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Xbox Wireless Headset</a>. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review">we reviewed the first-gen model in 2021</a>, we found it to be a comfortable, intuitively designed headset that’s well worth the price. In addition to working well with Xbox consoles, it can connect to another device simultaneously via Bluetooth. That said, gamers should specifically seek out the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276564/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-update-release-date-price-features">latest model</a>, which looks almost identical to the original headset but boasts support for Dolby Atmos, longer battery life, and improved mic performance.</p><div><p id="steelseries-nova-pro-wireless"><h3>SteelSeries Nova Pro Wireless</h3></p></div><p>SteelSeries makes an Xbox-specific version of its Nova Pro Wireless, which fans of great-sounding audio should flock to if they have the budget for the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1S99TD7?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$349.99 headset</a>. It remains one of the best wireless gaming headsets for a number of reasons: it’s comfortable, it sounds great, it features swappable batteries, and it pairs with a handy base station that lets you fine-tune the sound to your liking. The base station even allows you to connect a second device — whether it be another gaming console or a PC — and easily switch between audio sources.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->350</span></p><div><p>The Nova Pro Wireless aims to be the one headset to rule them all. It features multiple ways to connect wirelessly, active noise cancellation, great sound quality, and swappable batteries. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132836/steelseries-nova-pro-wireless-review-gaming-bluetooth-anc">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div><p id="x0SAmQ"><h2>Storage solutions</h2></p></div><div><p id="4lqYLC"><h3>Seagate Game Drive (HDD)</h3></p></div><p>Delegating your older games to a slower but far cheaper storage solution — like <a href="https://howl.me/cjq0yxtdQtj" rel="sponsored">Seagate’s 4TB Game Drive for Xbox</a> — is a clever way to let you have all of your games accessible without crowding your already-limited SSD space. However, it’s worth pointing out that any external USB drive will be significantly slower to load than what the Series X’s and Series S’s respective SSDs will tolerate. As such, you can only play Xbox One and earlier generation games directly from it. If you want to play a Series X game, you’ll need to move it over to the console’s internal SSD.</p><div><p id="9Kx3Bu"><h3>An expansion card</h3></p></div><p>Of course, you can (and probably should) buy faster storage solutions, which will allow you to play Series X / S games without transferring games around. That said, the storage expansion cards that are currently available will cost you significantly more than a traditional drive. Seagate and Western Digital are, so far, the only companies that make proprietary, memory card-like SSDs that can be inserted into the rear of either Microsoft console.</p><p>The SSDs are available in multiple configurations, including 1TB and 2TB sizes (there are 512GB configurations, but they aren’t worth the money). At their standard retail price, these expansion cards are far pricier than their M.2 SSD counterparts for the PlayStation 5, but they’re the only option for Xbox owners who want additional console storage. Thankfully, they go on sale every couple of months, knocking $50 or so off the price.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->130</span></p><div><p>Proprietary SSD expansion for the Xbox Series X / S consoles.

It offers access to more than 100 games from both small developers and powerhouse studios, including titles from Microsoft, Bethesda, and other Xbox Game Studios.</p><p>There are three tiers to choose from, starting at the $9.99 per month “Core” tier, which offers the fewest games but enables online multiplayer. The “standard” tier that costs $14.99 a month adds close to the full suite of Game Pass games available, but not the latest games. Stepping up to $19.99 a month grants you access to Game Pass Ultimate, which includes all of the aforementioned perks, plus day one releases, the ability to stream games over the cloud, and Game Pass access on PC as well as Xbox.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->26</span></p><div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to more than 100 titles for PC and Xbox consoles, which you can play on multiple devices.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deadpool-secret-lair-brings-merc-with-mouth-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has made a special April Fools' Day Secret Lair announcement for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. A certain red-suited, wisecracking <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marvel</a> character is coming to the popular card game. Not Spider-Man or The Avengers; it's a Deadpool Secret Lair.</p>

<h2>The Deadpool Secret Lair Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/product/1151231/secret-lair-x-marvel-s-deadpool" rel="nofollow">store page</a> listing, the Deadpool Secret Lair will include five cards featuring the merc with a mouth. The description is written from the perspective of Deadpool, complete with crass self-awareness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-secret-lair-card-artwork.jpg?itok=OFn9eZXw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-secret-lair-card-artwork.jpg?itok=WclidR4r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Four of the five cards in the Deadpool Secret Lair are reprints. These reprints feature Deadpool-themed artwork by Justine Cruz, Slawomir Maniak, Miguel Mercado, Kevin Sidharta and Tomasz Zarucki. The reprinted cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Deadly Rollick</em></li>
	<li><em>Saw in Half</em></li>
	<li><em>Blasphemous Act</em></li>
	<li><em>Vandalblast</em></li>
</ul><p>Presentation-wise, the cards are a solid representation of Deadpool's anarchic sense of humor. <em>Blasphemous Act</em> shows him sitting on the moon, wielding the Infinity Gauntlet. <em>Deadly Rollick</em> portrays him riding on a unicorn with a rainbow in the background. Mechanically, <em>Saw in Half</em> is taken from the Unfinity set, which is, by design, silly and irreverent, which fits the character perfectly.</p>

<p>But the fifth and final card in the Deadpool Secret Lair is a mechanically unique legendary creature: Deadpool, Trading Card. It is, as the name suggests. Deadpool is a Black/Red creature with 5/3. On its own, not a bad card, until you read the text, "when Deadpool enters, you may exchange his text box and another creature's."</p>

<p>This is potent enough on its own. Deadpool can steal an enemy creature's abilities through their rules text. But that's not all that is in Deadpool's text. You also lose life at the start of each turn, which is a devious combination.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Deadpool Secret Lair drop will be coming to certain retail stores. Like all prior Secret Lairs, you can order both foil (MSRP $39.99) and non-foil (MSRP $29.99) bundles online. In addition, all WPN retail stores will have non-foil bundles available on April 25. This is the first time a Secret Lair drop has been available at retail.</p>

We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable&nbsp;resolution that acknowledges the teams’&nbsp;contributions. </strong></em></p><p>“<em><strong>There&nbsp;has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table.&nbsp;We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair — if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid&nbsp;model&nbsp;of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.”&nbsp;</strong></em></p></div>



<p>According to the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> announcing the authorization, members of the union say that the decision comes as negotiations between Microsoft, ZeniMax, and the union fail to make any meaningful progress into its second year. Specifically, return to office mandates along with “underpayment” are causing friction between the groups.</p>



<p>“Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” ZeniMax Workers United-CWA Local 6215 Member and Senior QA Tester Zachary Armstrong said via release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.”</p>



<p>Union member and Associate QA Tester Aubrey Litchfield added: “Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?”</p>



<p>It’s important to note that the union isn’t officially going on strike. What the authorization vote means is that should negotiations continue to move forward without progress, the union can call a strike without another vote.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and ZeniMax for comment on the negotiations. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>



<p>What do you make of the ZeniMax union voting to authorize a strike against Microsoft? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/"><em>Satisfactory</em></a> starts out as a game you play, then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/satisfactory-hits-1-0-removing-your-last-excuse-to-avoid-falling-in-deep">becomes a way you think</a>. The only way I have been able to keep the ridiculous factory simulation from eating an even-more-unhealthy amount of my time was the game's keyboard-and-mouse dependency. But the work, it has found me—on my couch, on a trip, wherever one might game, really.</p>
<p>In a 1.1 release on <em>Satisfactory</em>'s Experimental branch, there are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/520835140699555676">lots of new things</a>, but the biggest new thing is a controller scheme. Xbox and DualSense are officially supported, though anyone playing on Steam can likely tweak their way to something that works on other pads. With this, the game becomes far more playable for those playing on a couch, on a portable gaming PC like the Steam Deck, or over household or remote streaming. It also paves the way for the game's console release, which is currently slated for sometime in 2025.</p>

      Coffee Stain Studios reviews the contents of its Experimental branch 1.1 update.

          </p>
  </div>

<p><em>Satisfactory</em> seems like an unlikely candidate for controller support, let alone consoles. It's a game where you do a lot of three-dimensional thinking, putting machines and conveyer belts and power lines in just the right places, either because you need to or it just feels proper. How would it feel to select, rotate, place, and connect everything using a controller? Have I just forgotten that <em>Minecraft, </em>and first-person games as a whole, probably seemed similarly desk-bound at one time? I grabbed an Xbox Wireless controller, strapped on my biofuel-powered jetpack, and gave a reduced number of inputs a shot.</p>


<p>The biggest hurdle to get past, for me, is not jumping in place when I wanted to do something, though it's not unique to this game. In most games that have some kind of building or planning through a controller, the bottom-right button ("A" on Xbox, "X" on PlayStation DualSense) is often the do/interact/confirm button. In Satisfactory, and some other games where I switch between keyboard/mouse and controller, A/X is jump. Satisfactory wants you to primarily use the triggers and bumpers to select, build, and dismantle things, which feels okay when you've got the hang of things. But even after an hour or so, I still found my pioneer unexpectedly jumping, as if he needed to get the zoomies out before placing a storage container.</p>

                <p>After two years of contract negotiations with parent company Microsoft, ZeniMax Workers United members have voted in overwhelming favor to authorize a strike. The union announced the news earlier today via a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> shared by Communications Workers of America, writing, "We’re not afraid to use our union power to ensure that we can keep making great games. All of us want to be working. We hope that Microsoft will allow us to do so with dignity and fairness to all by securing a first contract with our union.”</p><p>First reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, the news comes after more than two years of contract negotiations between ZeniMax Workers United and Microsoft. Since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/" data-ref-id="1100-6510268">union's formation back in 2023</a>, members have been actively pushing Microsoft for better wages, workplace improvements, and to address "key concerns, including a lack of remote work options and the company’s replacement of in-house quality-assurance work with outsourced labor without notifying the union." Last November, members of the union <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/zenimax-video-game-workers-walk-job-maryland-and-texas" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">walked off the job</a> in a one-day strike, to "call out the company for lack of progress at the bargaining table." Though the most recent vote does not mean union workers have officially gone on strike, it gives the organization permission to call for one, should contract negotiations further break down.</p><p>"Despite being one of the world's largest corporations, we've had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum. Paying your employees a livable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing; however when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we're asking for too much," ZeniMax Workers United member and associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield wrote in the press release. "Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We've released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?"</p><p>Consisting of more than 300 quality-assurance workers across Bethesda and ZeniMax studios, ZeniMax Workers United is one of Microsoft's largest unions. Its members are known for their work across several prominent Microsoft series, including The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Doom. With Doom: The Dark Ages scheduled to release in just over a month, a strike could have significant consequences for Microsoft.</p><p>Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA members who work in the video games industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">continue to strike</a> following growing concerns about AI. As of right now, it's still not clear when the strike (which went into effect July 26, 2024) might end. As it stands, any developer looking to employ SAG-AFTRA talent to perform must sign either the new Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, the Interim Interactive Media Agreement, or the Interim Interactive Localization Agreement before moving forward with production, all of which offer "critical AI protection."</p><p><em>Update: Following this article's publication, a representative from Microsoft reached out to GameSpot to provide the following comment:</em></p><p><em>"Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love. We respect the team's right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams' contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair--if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations."</em></p>

            <p>
With March now rapidly vanishing in the rear view mirror as we continue our race along highway 2025, Humble Choice has announced its April line-up, which this time brings a spot of classic tomb raiding, some seafaring terror, and even Xenomorph-flavoured tactics action.
</p>
<p>
April's offerings are available to claim and keep right now - provided you've a Humble Choice subscription, that is - and the current selection lingers around until Tuesday, 6th May. But before it's all change, here's what you can download:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered</li>
<li>Dredge</li>
<li>Alien: Dark Descent</li>
<li>1000XResist</li>
<li>Nova Lands</li>
<li>Diplomacy is Not an Option</li>
<li>Distant Worlds 2</li>
<li>Nomad Survival</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Tomb Raider I-III Remastered | Official Launch Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_vH_0gpVlk?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered | Official Launch Trailer</span>

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Here's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_vH_0gpVlk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
So there you go! Tomb Raider 1-3 are obviously bona fide platform classics, and last year's remaster is a lovely way to experience them, while developer Black Salt Games' Dredge - a strange blend of fishing and unnerving cosmic horror - is also a bit of a treat if you're so inclined.
</p>
<p>
Alien: Dark Descent also has its fans, taking the iconic movie franchise and turning it into a surprisingly suspenseful top-down, real-time tactics game - and as for 1000XResist, Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/1000xresist-review">called it</a> an "intense and intimate narrative adventure" when it released last year.
</p>
<p>
Moving further down the list, there's real-time 4X space strategy in Distant Worlds 2, furious medieval fantasy defense in Diplomacy is Not an Option, and a bit of cheery factory automation in Nova Lands. And finally for April, there's Nomad Survival, an "auto-attacking, wave clearing, time-based Roguelite" - which is to say it's basically <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> in a different bow.
</p>
<p>
As ever, five percent of each Humble Choice subscription is donated to charity, with this month's proceeds going to One Tree Planted - a non-profit focused on global reforestation. And for the sake of transparency, here's the usual note Humble is, like Eurogamer, owned by IGN.
</p>
<p>
If April's Humble Choice offerings appeal, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/membership">you'll find additional details over here</a>.

			<p>At GDC 2025, 10 Chambers Collective invited Wccftech to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818140/Den_of_Wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den of Wolves</a> for the first time. After their debut title, the co-op horror-themed first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gtfo-cooperate-or-die-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTFO</a>, this is a return to the Swedish developers' true love: heists. Before 10 Chambers was founded, they worked at OVERKILL/Starbreeze to make the first two Payday games.</p>
<p>You can read our Den of Wolves preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-back-on-that-heist-biz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. After the hands-on session, we were also able to interview writer and composer Simon Viklund to really dive into this new sci-fi setting they've created for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves Pre-Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGYfx7vKpRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How do you feel that the reception's been so far?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a pretty pessimistic guy, but I think we're proud of the build. Obviously, otherwise, we wouldn't show it. We know what works in it and what works less well, and we're working on that. We know stealth may be a bit unclear right now, the feedback and stuff, but I feel that this demo, when it was put together, was very focused on combat and gunplay, which I think works well in it. The hit feedback, the sounds and the animations, everything is pretty tight.</p>
<p>We know how to do that stuff. We've been working on shooters for so long. But there are issues. We know it's unpolished in some parts, and some parts are obviously completely missing. I mean, there are animations missing.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe your vision for how the game's flow will look, whether in the first early access iteration or when it's fully released?</strong></p>
<p>For early access, we will have one storyline. And for the full release, we will have multiple. We can't say how many at this point. There will be some things not present in early access. It will only be developed in English, with no localization at that point. We'll also use the early access phase to find out where people are enjoying the game and maybe focus on those territories in terms of whether there's voice localization. There are other aspects also that we're gonna hold off&nbsp;until later.</p>
<p>But for the most part, the important thing is the storyline, the ability to play different prep missions, choose which one to take on and avoid or reject others and play a heist at the end and see your choices throughout the prep mission phase sort of manifested, your choices having consequences.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The important thing is the storyline, the ability to play different prep missions, choose which one to take on and avoid or reject others and play a heist at the end and see your choices throughout the prep mission phase sort of manifested, your choices having consequences.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Can you talk about how dynamic these prep missions may be? Are there different mission types or rewards?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, every prep mission essentially has some sort of a MacGuffin that you're looking for. That's a plot device, really, which will unlock an approach in the heist at the end. You're looking at the heist, essentially. You need to get into the vault. It's a cliché, but let's take that. It's like, we can place an explosive on the weakest part of the wall around the vault, but then we need to play the prep mission where we acquire the explosives and we need to play another prep mission where we acquire the blueprints for the building to find out which wall is actually the weakest one. It's a nice climax to the storyline where you're playing this mission that you've been prepping for a long time and you've invested time and it matters more when you play it.</p>
<p>But then there might be other ways to get into the vault. Maybe you could drill, so you're like, let's find out what vault door they have and then you go into whatever company provided the vault door and find out what its weak points are. Maybe you could find out when the changing of the guard is happening, and then you play different prep missions to unlock the way. That doesn't entail playing all the premises, obviously, which in turn creates replayability because you can play the same storyline again and try a different approach.</p>
<p>The geometry of a heist would be the same every time. It's not a complex mission. The complexity, I would say, comes from your ability to play in several different ways, but it will be the same layout every time, whereas prep missions are more like, we're breaking into this bad warehouse or this laboratory or whatever. Those missions would not be narratively different. There's no different ways to do it. They might have a different layout every time you play them, as we randomize their layouts every time you replay the storyline. It's not procedurally generated, but it's us creating and curating a set of versions of that same map, which are then chosen at random by the game.</p>
<p>They're pretty straightforward in terms of what you do in them, and they're snack-sized in duration, but you have to keep on your toes because of the different layouts. With Den of Wolves, we're trying to really create a game where it's a lot of fun playing the same storyline several times because of player agency.</p>
<p><strong>When you finish all of your prep missions, you get everything ready for the main heist. If you either complete the main heist or if you fail, does that progression you've made through the prep missions stay, or do you have to start from scratch?</strong></p>
<p>When you have invested that much time into finding the different intel and the gear that you need in order to beat the heist, you get to try the heist several times. If it turns out that it's too difficult, you can go back to certain prep missions that might unlock things that aid you. You can maybe bribe someone or threaten some guards to look the other way. If you put more effort into more prep missions, that might alleviate a little bit of the pressure on the heist, so that's a way for you to offset the difficulty a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>With this being such a multiplayer-focused title, with these prep missions in Den of Wolves, when you're playing with a group of friends when you're going into the heist, is it based on the host progression, or is it a combination of the team for what they've done for their prep missions?</strong></p>
<p>Let's say I start a heist or initiate a storyline. I do it with the two of you, so we're three together. We&nbsp;agree on the rules that we need to be all three of us in order to make progress in this instance of the storyline. We play one evening and make some progress. The next evening, Robin can't join, but you and I can't play because we set those rules. Still, we can play either another storyline or start a new instance of that same storyline where we make progress&nbsp;and it's a little bit different.</p>
<p>But the next time all three of us are online, that version of the storyline, that instance where we play together, becomes available again. We can also start a storyline and say anyone can make progress in the storyline, regardless of who's online, or only I can make progress in the storyline, and whenever you guys are online, you can join in. You set the rules for yourselves, and then you can have essentially an infinite number of instances of the same storyline, just with different progress within them and stuff.</p>
<p>You can't collect stuff like resources in one instance of the storyline and bring it over to another version. However, if we're playing together in one storyline and you can't play one evening, I can still play in the same storyline without making progress. There are certain prep missions that are just collecting assets or resources, like consumables and stuff. Or I can be a gun for hire for other people playing their storyline, so I'm joining other people's games as a gun for hire and just protecting them and being sort of a bodyguard, not even completing objectives, just joining mid-game as a random player. That might reward me with stuff that we can use in our storyline.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Let's say I start a heist or initiate a storyline. I do it with the two of you, so we're three together. We&nbsp;agree on the rules that we need to be all three of us in order to make progress in this instance of the storyline. We play one evening and make some progress. The next evening, Robin can't join, but you and I can't play because we set those rules. Still, we can play either another storyline or start a new instance of that same storyline where we make progress&nbsp;and it's a little bit different.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>When you say joining midgame, is this like dropping into a mission, or is this joining a party when they're still in their prep phase in the hideout?</strong></p>
<p>No, you can join in the middle of an actual first person shooter mission. When you start an instance of a storyline, you can say other people can join my game and they get to play with me just as if they were heisteri, really. But you can also say other people can join, but I don't wanna be robbed of the experience and the joy of completing the objectives. In that case, if my mission is to complete the heist, other people can't do that. They can't even interact with the vault door, or whatever it might be, so they're only allowed to protect me.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of incentives are there for Den of Wolves players to take the role of a gun for hire?</strong></p>
<p>They would get progress towards the next drop, just like you would when completing the heist. They'd be rewarded with gun parts or consumables like explosives and stuff like that that you can use in other missions.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider that to be more like a progression track or a reputation level system? Progression track meaning like a battle pass.</strong></p>
<p>I would say it's like filling out your golf bag with new gear and widening your arsenal with new stuff that you can use. They could be difficulty offset type of things, almost like a card that you would play in a card game. It could be something like calling in a favor from another criminal gang where they can attack another facility that is owned by the same company and that will thin out the security in this heist.</p>
<p>But it could also be something that allows you to find out about another extra vault that is available in this heist that you wouldn't otherwise know about or even be able to access unless you had this drop. Then you can go for that extra vault if you're greedy, but it's also a higher risk because it's more dangerous to stay on the map and try to get the stuff in that vault.</p>
<p>Players who want to play at an easier difficulty level will have to look for these things that help them when they think the game is hard, and people who want more of a challenge have the ability to play permutations of maps that ramp&nbsp;up the difficulty but also give them more reward for that.</p>
<p><strong>The system you're explaining sounds like a modifier system where players use cards before going into the heist to modify the enemy density or increase the rewards, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good way of putting it, but we're roleplaying it as some sort of favor or something from a rival team.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the player expression and customization in Den of Wolves?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that's a big part of it. It's something we like to explore and give the players the ability to do, but it's not necessarily something that exists as we're going into early access, but yes, we want the players to be able to customize the character and choose the voice and the face and the clothing and weapon customization.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'There also has to be a point to playing longer heists as well, because what happened in Payday 2 was that players only played the same small bank over and over because it was the one that had the shortest loop and you got drops more easily. In Den of Wolves, we are trying to create a system that will reward you regardless of the duration of the heist that you're playing in relation to the investment in time and effort.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>That actually leads me to my next question, which is about weapon customization in Den of Wolves.</strong></p>
<p>It's something that might not exist as we go into early access, but it might be added during early access. What I think it's important to point out is that you're not, like, stealing $1.5 million and now you have $1.5 million to spend on weapons, because then a pistol would have to cost a million dollars.</p>
<p>It's more like we roleplay it as you collecting money and then fencing those things off to some other criminal gang. After they got enough of that resource, whatever it might be, it's a currency of sorts (like the bags that you collect, the more bags you get, the more of that stuff you have to sell). Every once in a while, you level up or get to a point where you get a drop and a reward. It's not like we played this mission where we stole a shipment of weapons and now we have all these SMGs or AKs or whatever. You wouldn't be able to do that. There needs to be some conversion of your time spent in the game, a conversion between that and the reward that feels like it matters.</p>
<p>There also has to be a point to playing longer heists as well because what happened in Payday 2 was that players only played the same small bank over and over because it was the one that had the shortest loop and you got drops more easily. In Den of Wolves, we are trying to create a system that will reward you regardless of the duration of the heist that you're playing in relation to the investment in time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>Would customized gear drops be something that's permanently part of your arsenal, or would you only get to use them one time?</strong></p>
<p>No, that would be permanent.</p>
<p><strong>In the smaller prep mission, we saw a bit of GTFO's inspiration in the smaller discrete rooms that you would enter, clear out the encounter there, and then scan and go into the next room. So, I was curious how much of GTFO's DNA is present in Den of Wolves.</strong></p>
<p>Well, there's a little bit of your DNA in each one of your children, I guess. I mean, we did the PC version of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and that had co-op. We've been working on and refining the co-op formula for a long time. Every new game is not so much inspired by our previous games, but more like a refinement, and maybe look at whether we are leaning into a certain direction with this thing?</p>
<p>Obviously, with GTFO, that was horror and hardcore difficulty. For this game, it's not that. I think it's somewhere between Payday 2 and GTFO, maybe closer to Payday 2, but still, it's not an entry-level first person shooter, but it is something that's less hardcore.</p>
<p>The sci-fi component, we feel, unlocks a lot of creativity. We're creating a world. It's not an existing IP; we can make the rules ourselves. We don't have to follow the lure or the backstory of some existing franchise, TV show, or movie, which is a huge creative freedom. It allows us a lot of liberty.</p>
<p>We can interject the gameplay with a change of pace and a change of environment, and the fact that you're in these huge megastructures where people live their entire lives within the same building. These are enormous places: you can live your entire life there and be born in the hospital in that building with its own grocery stores, schools, residential areas, slums at the bottom, and penthouses at the top.</p>
<p>That allows us to create really interesting levels where you're moving between different places and they're all segmented and they can be run by different private security firms and stuff and they're not necessarily communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Then we can have that thing that we had in GTFO, which we think was a huge step forward from Payday, where it's like stealth, stealth, stealth, and as soon as you get discovered, it's just action, and you can never go back to stealth again unless you restart. In GTFO you could sort of regain control and go back to stealth again, exactly the way you described, and that'll be possible in Den of Wolves as well. Losing it and then regaining it and coming back to that several times in the same mission is really nice.</p>
<p><strong>I've been sitting on this for a while, but I loved talking with you about music&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-qa-10-chambers-goes-back-to-heist-roots-with-a-sci-fi-espionage-flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when we did our first interview</a>. I was curious about what sort of lessons or new ideas you've come up with for the dynamic soundtrack to Den of Wolves.</strong></p>
<p>On a technical level, it's somewhere between GTFO and Payday. Payday's music system is deceptively simple, rudimentary even. GTFO's music system is overly complex. I went on a rabbit hole with that game where it's like I'm making these short loops and they're all pieced together and layered in at one time by the game and the game can react to whatever is happening. The music changes and there are infinite combinations between the drum loops that are chosen randomly with a bass line that's chosen randomly and whatnot.</p>
<p>But it was not a lot of fun making the music because I only made these short snippets that then are arranged and put together by the game engine at runtime, so I never got to write really long songs. This is how the combat music works in GTFO, not so much the atmospheric music, but the combat music.</p>
<p>So I wanted to find a way to make the creation of music more stimulating and inspiring and fun again, so the music system needed to be less complex than GTFO. It goes for everyone involved in game development; I think you need to enjoy the journey as well. You can't just look at the end product and say, if it gets nice reviews, you're happy. You want to enjoy your life while you're making the game as well, and I need to enjoy making the music.</p>
<p>So yeah, the music needs to be larger chunks, like one minute, one minute and a half, two minutes, that I can make a song that has a little bit of changes going on through it. On a technical level, it's finding that balance between simplicity and complexity. On more of a creative level, in terms of the genre, I'm super happy to get back to making music for a power fantasy in Den of Wolves. It was fun making core music for GTFO, but it's not really my wheelhouse. Now I feel I can really utilize what I consider my primary skill within music, which is making music with a lot of attitude that gets the adrenaline pumping,</p>
<p>So, the music is electronic&nbsp;and saturated and distorted and dirty. A lot of it is inspired by hip-hop and trap. Trap music has a lower tempo, so it becomes not as stressful, obviously. It's slower moving and heavier in a way with these bass sounds and whatnot. It has a lot of street vibe and attitude to it, but I think it's really cool. What's nice about that slower tempo is that when you go double tempo, it's a natural transition into a more stressful track, so it's easy to go from 75 BPM to twice that tempo (150 BPM) and get a completely different vibe in the music.</p>
<p>When you're fighting the enemies and things are going well, there's one type of music, but when you're escaping and time is running out, the same track shifts into something else seamlessly. I think I find I've found a style of music that I think is really malleable and I can do at a great level.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any new artists or composers that you're collaborating with for the Den of Wolves soundtrack?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Jamie Christopherson, who I think might be most famous for making the music to Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. He's helping out.</p>
<p><strong>I think we talked about that in the first interview. I didn't know if there were any other announcements you could share.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, no, unfortunately not. I'm looking for rappers or vocalists who can contribute because when you come to the success screen, there's rap. The track from the escape as you were running out seamlessly goes to a rap song, and that felt like a good tone to strike with a lot of attitude as you sort of celebrate on the results screen. But I can't really announce at this point exactly who&nbsp;it will be.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to have a call to action or recruitment to try and find rappers to contribute?</strong></p>
<p>No, I haven't thought about that. I've looked at the avenues or the channels that I have at my disposal at this point, but that might be something that we use during the access when there's more of a community surrounding the game. It would be cool to find uh talents within the community.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We set the stage for interesting scenarios within this science fiction world with all the corporations and the concept of breaking into people's minds and everything. It's just a juicy concept that I think is going to excite people.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>After this whole preview cycle, when do you anticipate the next time that players can kind of get the next info drop for Den of Wolves?</strong></p>
<p>We will be dropping a lot of beats actually this year. We'll be showing more and more, but the next one big like this, it's hard to say. Hopefully, for the beginning of next year we could have a whole storyline or at least more of it so you understand how the prep missions give consequences for the main heist.</p>
<p><strong>Any other parting thoughts you want to leave our readers with for Dead of Wolves?</strong></p>
<p>We'd like to think that we know first person shooter co op games pretty well. We have a pedigree with Payday: The Heist and PD2 and GTFO and even Ghost Recon 20 years ago. Anyone who's a fan of that sort of game, and especially if they're into heists, should check it out; we'd like to think it's going to be pretty awesome. We set the stage for interesting scenarios within this science fiction world with all the corporations and the concept of breaking into people's minds and everything. It's just a juicy concept that I think is going to excite people.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game developers&nbsp;<span>who are part of the ZeniMax Workers United-CWA union working at&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-runs-pro-union-ad-alongside-the-cwa-to-push-activision-blizzard-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's</a> subsidiary ZeniMax Media overwhelmingly voted in favor of giving their leaders permission to call a strike</span>&nbsp;after failing to reach a deal for the union's first contract after two years of negotiations.</p>
<p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA), who helped the ZeniMax employees form their union, announced the news in a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft">press release</a> on Tuesday, saying that members of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA voted <strong>94% in favor</strong> of authorizing strike permissions. Which, to be clear, just means that the leaders negotiating the deal with Microsoft now have the ability to call a strike. It doesn't exactly mean that a strike will happen.</p>
<p>"<em>We’re not afraid to use our union power to ensure that we can keep making great games</em>," said Skylar Hinnat, a quality assurance tester and member of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA.</p>
<p>Hinnat continued, "<em>All of us want to be working. We hope that Microsoft will allow us to do so with dignity and fairness to all by securing a first contract with our union."</em></p>
<p>Some of the key issues the ZWU-CWA is bargaining over are expanding remote work options, better pay, workplace improvements, and mandating that Microsoft inform the union of any intentions it may have to outsource quality assurance work to a third party.</p>
<p>Specifically on issues like return to office mandates, senior quality assurance tester and ZWU-CWA member Zachary Armstrong said, "<em>Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>None of us wishes it had come to</em> <em>this,</em>" he added, "<em>but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.</em>"</p>
<p>When the ZWU-CWA was formed at the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/quality-assurance-workers-microsofts-zenimax-studios-establish-companys-first-union">top of 2023</a>, it was the first union to come from a game studio under Microsoft, and it was also immediately one of the largest unions in the video game industry in the US.</p>
<p>As part of its campaign to push its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King through, Microsoft signed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</a> to demonstrate that it would not prevent its employees from unionizing. Now that Microsoft has what it wants, it has seemingly yet to make good on any of the promises it made regarding its position towards unions and labor organizations.</p>
<p>"<em>Despite being one of the world’s largest corporations, we’ve had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum. Paying your employees a livable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing; however when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we’re asking for too much,</em>" said quality assurance tester Aubrey Litchfield.</p>
<p>"<em>Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?"</em></p>

But at long last, this cardboard adaptation of the Hideo Kojima masterpiece has finally reached the masses. From sneaking around in cardboard boxes to dynamic and exciting boss fights, the game’s tactical stealth gameplay has successfully made the jump from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video games to board games</a>. However, the whole package isn’t without its faults, leaving me feeling both satisfied and let down at the same time.</p><div catalogid="f71f0ecf-f449-4d70-ad81-bc7b3b9d5ab7" id="217981"><div id="217981" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign-style board game</a> that retells the story of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid">first Metal Gear Solid game</a>, originally released on the PlayStation in 1998. Designed for one to four players (at least according to the box; more on that below), the game has players move plastic miniature versions of series favorites like Meryl, Otacon, Cyborg Ninja Gray Fox, and Solid Snake himself through 14 scenarios featuring iconic moments from the game, such as the confrontation with Ocelot, changing the PAL Keycard, and, of course, taking out REX.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there is one significant omission that didn’t make the cut: the final confrontations between Solid and Liquid are not recreated as playable scenarios. It’s a bummer that neither the barehanded fight on top of REX nor the Jeep escape is included. Perhaps the developers couldn’t find a way to balance or explain a 4v1 battle on REX or figure out how the escape would work with all present characters. Instead, they've opted to end on the high note of a dramatic and memorable team-up against Metal Gear REX. But in the meantime, the fan community around this game has you covered. Over on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/296527/fan-made-scenario-stage-15-liquid-vs-solid" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>BoardGameGeek, user @Geoff907</u></a> and their wife devised and published their own unique Stage 15 for this game for you to try out, if you just absolutely need to get some of that shirtless fist-fight action into your game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you opt for the more expensive “Integral Edition,” the rest of the story bits that aren't told through gameplay are instead presented in a striking 109-page graphic novel with art by comic artist Kenneth Loh. It's reminiscent of the scenes in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker or the Digital Graphic Novels on PSP. But MGS wouldn’t be MGS without its CODEC calls. These little burst transmissions between Snake and his support team have been faithfully adapted to this new format, with prompts directing players to specific calls in the included Codec Book, as well as pre and post-scenario briefings. I particularly appreciate the care the developers have taken to make them just as campy yet informative as those in the video game. For example, Snake refers to how many actions he can take or offers tips on beating Psycho Mantis involving “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/metal-gear-solid/How_to_Beat_Psycho_Mantis">Player 2</a>”-like trickery. Even as a game made of cardboard and dice, this still feels distinctly Metal Gear.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Players unlock new equipment, from Snake’s favorite sidearm, the Socom, to the iconic cardboard box.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding gameplay, players take up to four actions per turn, chosen from those listed on their character’s unique player boards. As scenarios progress, players unlock new equipment, from Snake’s favorite sidearm, the Socom, to the iconic cardboard box, which can be used in future scenarios. This equipment expands each character’s skill pool, effectively replicating the video game’s “procure on-site” philosophy. Once players take their actions, it’s time for the enemies to act. Both generic guards and bosses have action cards that dictate their movements and behaviors, which can change depending on whether they’ve spotted the player. Guards also have a separate reaction deck used in various situations, such as spotting a knocked-out guard or investigating a noise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss encounters pose their own unique challenges, forcing you out of your comfort cardboard box and requiring you to think on your feet. Each boss fight feels distinct, from Revolver Ocelot darting around while bouncing bullets off walls to the Hind D having multiple target areas to damage. Thanks to the game’s tile-based nature, each boss fight takes place on a unique, large board with special elements affecting the encounter. For example, in Ocelot’s arena, the injured Kenneth Baker can be hit and killed, adding a new way to trigger a game over. These special tweaks only enhance the excitement and tension of the encounters, as they are rarely designed to favor the players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This element of randomness kept me on my toes, never knowing exactly how far guards would move or which way they’d turn. The added dice rolls for checking if my actions made noise or if enemy shots would hit me resulted in an experience that balanced strategy with luck. There were multiple moments where I held my breath as I pulled a guard movement card, waiting to see if I’d be spotted. I never felt the game was unfair, but I also never expected it to be kind. Metal Gear does a superb job balancing strategy and luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the box suggests the game can be played with up to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a>, at least for the campaign mode, I wouldn’t recommend going beyond two players. Personally, I found playing it as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> offered the best experience. Each scenario specifies which of the four playable characters can be used, with the first two scenarios playable only by Snake. Only five scenarios in the entire campaign allow for four players (with no missions designed for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three players</a>), and the first four-player mission doesn’t appear until the ninth scenario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a narrative standpoint, this makes sense. It wouldn’t be logical for Snake to infiltrate Shadow Moses with Gray Fox at his side or for Otacon to tackle Vulcan Raven alone. But from a board game perspective, this limitation significantly impacts the experience, making it hard to convince my MGS-loving friends to play when only one of them could participate in most of the game, while the others had to wait for the last few missions. I would have loved to see optional modifiers allowing additional characters in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player</a> scenarios or “What if?” scenarios offering alternate viewpoints and player counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To the game’s credit, the developers addressed this issue by allowing up to four players in the “VR Missions” mode. This additional mode, which includes its own set of special unlockable equipment cards, </p><p data-cy="paragraph">has its own caveat: a lack of content. The included VR Missions book features six mission types – Recon, Escape, and Sabotage, among others – but each type has only one associated map layout. While some tokens and traps may change between sessions, and you can swap in a boss model for extra challenge, the guard layouts and objectives remain the same. With the map never changing, once you know what to do, the mode quickly loses its luster. I hope that CMON or the community releases creative and fun new maps and missions to keep things fresh.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9YOmrx?object_uuid=2a3bae9b-fd59-40a6-8568-380ae799f55d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Board Games Based on Video Games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also check out our recent reviews of board games based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-cells-the-rogue-lite-board-game-review">Dead Cells</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-the-board-game-review">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-the-board-game-review">Elden Ring</a>. </p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 1, 2025 6:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game successfully distills much of the tactical espionage action from the video game into an engaging and challenging board game adaptation. The gameplay and miniatures are the stars of the show, striking a great balance between creativity and strategy. However, restrictions on character selection and player count for most of the campaign make it difficult to play with a full group of friends. When paired with the limited stage options in VR Missions, what could have been a sturdy and impressive cardboard box ends up feeling like one that’s been tossed onto too many FedEx trucks on its way to delivery—functional but slightly battered.
If you’re a fan of solo play or want to experience the game with one other person, you’ll find plenty to love. But if you’re looking for a game to play with a group of three or more, you may want to think twice before diving in.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Run between them to avoid getting hit. After he sends out several of these, he will start to slam on the ground, raising chunks of ice that need to be jumped over.

Once this is done, Mio should run over to his face and begin pummeling it. Note that sometimes, after sending out the shockwaves of ice, the Ice King will pause for a moment before resuming his attack.

Make sure he is fully upright before trying to pull him down.</p><p>After dealing enough damage to him, the Ice King will cause icicles to litter the arena, culminating in a gigantic one in the center. Stand in the small spaces between or where the icicles have already fallen to avoid getting hit. He will then resume the pillars of ice, but this time, icicles will be falling as well. Continue moving to avoid taking damage.

Dodge as you did previously and he will use a new attack once the tornadoes clear which has him sending out bombs that follow you around.

While that doesn’t mean a strike is currently in effect, it does mean the 300 members who are part of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA could initiate a strike if progress isn’t made at the bargaining table on their first contract.</p><p> “Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” said senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong in a press release. “None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.” </p><p> ZeniMax Workers United-CWA formed back in 2023 after the CWA cut a deal with Microsoft to support its bid to acquire Activision Blizzard in exchange for the tech giant remaining “neutral” on unionization within the company. Instead of fighting the process, Microsoft would voluntarily recognize any union with majority support among its members. Things sound less congenial at the bargaining table. The Bethesda union held a one-day work stoppage last fall and filed an unfair labor practice charge against Microsoft for outsourcing work. The Xbox maker disputes that it’s being unreasonable. </p><p> “Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love,” a spokesperson for the company told <em>Kotaku </em>in an email. “We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams’ contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair—if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.” </p><p>Quality assurance testers have long been one of the most exploited groups of developers in the game industry, forced to work long hours for low pay as studios crunch to ship massive games with as few delays as possible. But the work is also one of the most valued by players. There’s nothing worse than running into a game-breaking bug or watching your character randomly die while falling through the floor after an hour-long boss fight. Bethesda championed 2022's <em>Starfield </em>as one of its most bug-free releases in years, and it was. </p><p>Microsoft is currently bringing<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> to PlayStation 5 this month, followed by the release of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> in May. Bethesda’s next big release is expected to be <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, though the open-world RPG is likely still years away from coming out. A strike could potentially slow things down even further if a deal isn’t hashed out at the bargaining table.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-i-continues-to-soar-as-fifth-patch-is-released.1151367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The most sensational indie game of 2025 is one that nobody saw coming. It’s called Schedule I, and as the blurb goes, it sees players go ‘from small-time dope pusher to kingpin’ by making and selling all kinds of drugs. It’s bizarre, and it was pieced together almost entirely by a single developer over three years, and it’s turning heads worldwide.</p>



<p>Schedule I’s fifth patch is here, and it adds a few key improvements and addresses some outstanding bugs. Despite it being a little bit of a work in progress in some ways, Schedule I is one of the most popular games in the world right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-on-the-charts">High on the Charts</h2>



<p>Schedule I isn’t a game to be taken seriously, but many players are. It has picked up a rating of Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam from 38,778 reviews – and it was only released a week ago. It’s one of the boldest success stories we’ve seen from an indie game in a very long time.</p>



<p>It sits in the number one spot on Steam for sales, and it’s the fourth most-played game on the platform as I write this. There are 275,500 people playing it, and the game’s peak count has exceeded many AAA titles on the platform.</p>



<p>Here are the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546730838559032913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest patch notes</a> for Schedule I:</p>



<p><strong>Tweaks/Improvements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added an active display setting to choose which monitor the game displays on.</li>



<li>Botanists will now automatically move product from their supplies to drying racks.</li>



<li>Owned vehicles are now visible on the map app.</li>



<li>Implemented a few validity checks/failsafes for NPC pathfinding and warping. I think this was one of the primary causes of crashing on certain chipsets (thanks to Chi Chi on Discord for bringing this to my attention).</li>



<li>Refactored employee item movement behaviour to be a bit smarter.</li>



<li>Implemented NPC effects culling at a certain distance to improve performance.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed non-host clients sometimes not being able to hit/stand in blackjack.</li>



<li>Fixed a quest UI bug that was sometimes causing infinite loading screens in multiplayer.</li>



<li>Fixed clipboard selections not reassigning without first manually clearing the existing selection (employee beds, botanist supplies, etc).</li>



<li>Fixed the dealer sometimes preemptively revealing its hand to non-host players in blackjack.</li>



<li>Fixed the first-person jacket looking janky.</li>



<li>Fixed the ‘Master Chef’ achievement being rewarded prematurely.</li>



<li>Fixed some property null references that were causing multiplayer loading/desync issues.</li>



<li>The drying rack ‘dry’ button is now non-interactable if the input slot is reserved by an employee.</li>



<li>Fixed NPC ‘stay in building’ behaviour sometimes causing errors for non-host players.</li>



<li>Fixed NPC voiceover emitters sometimes throwing a null reference.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s creator and (almost) solo dev, Tyler, also revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve started work on the first content update and am planning to release it this weekend. I’ll be posting some sneak peeks soon – stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schedule I is available exclusively on PC at the moment, and if you want to try before you buy, the game has a decent demo on Steam.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A new event is coming to Destiny 2 as part of the final arc of Episode Heresy: Rite of the Nine. This limited-time event will bring with it tons of new challenges, the return of some fan-favorite loot, and even a new social space. Here are all the details you need to know about Rite of the Nine and how it will work.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_does_Rite_of_the_Nine_come_out_">When does Rite of the Nine come out?</a></li><li><a href="#What_is_the_Rite_of_the_Nine_event_in_Destiny_2_">What is the Rite of the Nine event in Destiny 2?</a></li><li><a href="#Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Loot">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Loot</a></li><li><a href="#Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Difficulty_Modes">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Difficulty Modes</a><ul><li><a href="#Explorer_Mode">Explorer Mode</a></li><li><a href="#Eternity_Mode">Eternity Mode</a></li><li><a href="#Ultimatum_Mode">Ultimatum Mode</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_does_Rite_of_the_Nine_come_out_">When does Rite of the Nine come out?</h2><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine doesn't have an exact release date as of yet, but it will be launching <strong>sometime after the start of Episode Heresy Act III</strong>, which is now live, having launched on April 1, 2025. This will be a limited-time event that likely will last until the launch of the new expansion of Destiny 2, currently only known as "Project Apollo" from Bungie's 2025-2026 roadmap. But the specific end date is unconfirmed.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite these three featured dungeons previously requiring a Dungeon Key from their respective expansions, <strong>Rite of the Nine will be free for all players</strong>. That means anyone with a base copy of Destiny 2 can play the event while it is live.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_the_Rite_of_the_Nine_event_in_Destiny_2_">What is the Rite of the Nine event in Destiny 2?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4468999" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4468999"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine will be focused solely on dungeons in a similar vein to the Pantheon challenges from Into the Light. Three dungeons will be featured on rotation: <strong>Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher,</strong> and <strong>Ghosts of the Deep</strong>. The Rite of the Nine event adds a slew of new difficulty modes, updated loot, and a revamped farming system to earn loot on repeated runs.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will also have access to a new social space called <strong>The Third Spire</strong>, which is a revised version of the old victory space from Trials of the Nine when players completed a Flawless run. Here, players can visit an old ally, the <strong>Emissary of the Nine</strong>, for access to all the new rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Each week, one dungeon will be listed as the featured dungeon and players will engage in various challenges in that one dungeon. There will be three difficulty options available, allowing players of all skill levels to earn something. For players willing to take on the highest difficulty, special loot is up for grabs.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Loot">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Loot</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine will feature 12 revised weapons from past encounters with an all-new selection of perks. Adept versions will be available earned if dungeons are completed on the highest difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">A new Origin trait called <strong>Gravity Well</strong> will be exclusive to these weapons. Along with the initial Origin perk in the fifth column, Gravity Well will also be able to be chosen as an option. Gravity Well's effects are listed as "Reloading this weapon automatically gathers nearby ammo." It's not known exactly how far away this takes effect, but the perk seems to gather any nearby ammo bricks on the ground, Heavy or Special, and pull them to your character on a reload.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also visit the Emissary of the Nine in the Third Spire space to attune their loot drops from dungeon completions. Similar to how the Brave Arsenal worked in Into the Light, only one attunement can be active per run, and this will increase the likelihood of obtaining that weapon as a reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Players who finish a dungeon on the highest difficulty,<strong> Ultimatum</strong>, will be able to earn an Adept weapon. These weapons have a unique shader effect on them making them glow and shimmer. Adept versions of weapons will also have boosted stats over the normal versions, so they will have an upper hand over normal drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the 12 weapons coming with Rite of the Nine:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Prosecutor</strong> Auto Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Relentless</strong> Pulse Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Judgment</strong> Hand Cannon</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>A Sudden Death</strong> Shotgun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Wilderflight</strong> Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Long Arm</strong> Scout Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Liminal Vigil</strong> Sidearm</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Terminus Horizon</strong> Machine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>New Pacific Epitaph</strong> Breach-loaded Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Survivors</strong> Submachine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Greasy Luck</strong> Glaive</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cold Comfort</strong> Rocket Launcher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Other rewards from Rite of the Nine also include <strong>five new Emblems</strong>, <strong>a new Title/Seal</strong>, and <strong>weapon ornaments.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Difficulty_Modes">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Difficulty Modes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine's rotating dungeons are broken up into three difficulty tiers, allowing players of any skill level to earn something and experience a challenge. Each mode changes aspects of the dungeon, such as displaying helpful tips to the rather difficult "Notswap" modifier. Here's how each one is broken down.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Explorer_Mode">Explorer Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This mode is essentially "Beginner Mode" with an incredibly forgiving difficulty level and much less harsh punishments for wipes and party deaths. While we don't know the maximum Power level for these dungeons yet, we can assume it will be a low bar to clear. The rules for Explorer Mode are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Darkness Zones.</strong> Normally when players come across a Darkness Zone, if the full time dies with no revives available, the encounter resets back to the start of the last checkpoint. In Explorer Mode, Darkness Zones are completely disabled.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Revive timer is only five seconds.</strong> Revive Timers in dungeons typically range from 20 seconds to 45 seconds. In Explorer Mode, they are much more forgiving so players can be revived more quickly.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Tooltips explain mechanics.</strong> Before beginning the encounter, tooltips will be visible that explain how each encounter basically functions. New players will be able to immediately pick up on these tips and execute their mechanics.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Waypoints guide players</strong> during more open sections of dungeons. These will constantly be visible to guide players to the next objective.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Helper platforms</strong> appear when a player reaches a checkpoint, helping those who struggle with jumping puzzles.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eternity_Mode">Eternity Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">Bungie has not shared the full details on how this mode will work, but it is likely more geared towards casual players seeking a challenge. It's possible most of the standard rules for dungeons will be present here such as Darkness Zones, longer revive timers, and possibly even more strict timers on certain encounters.</p><p dir="ltr">There will also be a scoring mechanic live in Eternity Mode that will gauge players' performance based on time spent on an encounter, enemies killed, and revives remaining after an encounter is completed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ultimatum_Mode">Ultimatum Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the highest difficulty level for Rite of the Nine. Basically this is only where the best of the best can thrive. It's likely this will have a lower power cap and feature lots of extra modifiers to make the encounters much more unforgiving and difficult to navigate. The rules that we know of so far are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Contest Mode difficulty.</strong> Much like when a raid is live for the first time, players will be at least 20 levels below the Power level of all enemies in the dungeons. Enemies will also be much more aggressive, shooting more often and running towards players whenever possible. Limited revives will prevent players from completing encounters if they run out.</li><li dir="ltr">"<strong>Notswap" Modifier.</strong> Notswap is a new modifier where, if a player swaps an Exotic armor, a weapon, or a class, all of their energy is drained to zero. All cooldowns will be reactivated, the Super gauge will be set to zero, and they will have to regain all energy to use abilities again.</li></ul><p>Scoring will be based on deaths.The fewer deaths accumulated through an entire run, the higher the score will be. If players achieve a <strong>Platinum</strong> score, they will receive an <strong>Adept</strong> weapon at the end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-rebellion-most-successful-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rebellion is celebrating the successful launch of Atomfall, a pseudo-apocalyptic survival game set in rural England in the 1950s. It’s a history-bending title with plenty of mysterious meat on some well-built bones, and that’s partly why <strong>one million players </strong>found their way into the game over the launch weekend.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team revealed that Atomfall is Rebellion’s most successful launch <strong>ever</strong>, and the company has been making games for more than thirty years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-is-here">The End is Here</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/">my Atomfall review</a>, I praised the game’s solid foundation, genuinely intriguing story, and sumptuous visuals, topics that have been mirrored by players worldwide. It’s a phenomenal concept for a game that has been delivered very nicely by Rebellion after years of development.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, Jason Kingsley CBE, the CEO of Rebellion, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall.</p>



<p>To have surpassed the one million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.</p>



<p>We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.</p>



<p>We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team released some statistics along with the news, revealing that 316,000 people brutally murdered the innocent scientist who helps the player at the very start of the game.</p>



<p>I was one of those 316,000 people.</p>



<p>Also, 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed, which is nothing if not indicative of how <strong>quintessentially British </strong>Atomfall is.</p>



<p>Atomfall is available now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC – it’s also on the Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve played Atomfall in the comments and pop over to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> to let the community know what you think.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-major-ii/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-ahead-of-major-iii-qualifiers.1151325/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-major-ii/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Preston ‘Priestahh’ Greiner has split from Los Angeles Guerrillas M8 in the Call of Duty League following a turbulent time for the team. Presently, LAG sits one from the bottom in the CDL standings, sitting on a match record of 4-15, which is fairly woeful. The only team behind LAG is the Vegas Falcons, which has yet to win a single match in the CDL.</p>



<p>Priestahh has been passed from pillar to post since his monumental season in 2023 that saw him secure two chips and a world championship, and it’s hard to tell where he’ll end up next.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-fall">The Fall</h2>



<p>During the 2023 CDL season, Priestahh saw immense success while playing an integral part in the New York Subliners roster. He was a member of the crew that landed one of the most historic grand finals in COD Champs history – a 5-0 wash over Toronto Ultra that ended in record time.</p>



<p>As a tenured veteran of Call of Duty esports, Priestahh has been around since Advanced Warfare (2014). He has flown the flag of some prestigious organisations, including 100 Thieves, FaZe, Cloud9, and now Gentlemates, represented in the Call of Duty League by the Los Angeles Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>LAG has failed to gain any traction this season, though. The team has been hampered at every post, and it’s looking extremely likely that the squad won’t make it to this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-championship-2025-kitchener-june/">COD Championship tournament</a>, set to take place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On March 18, LAG M8 started breaking down the roster, bidding farewell to Skyz – who has since wound up starting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-skyz-new-official-roster/">with OpTic Texas</a> in place of Kenny. On March 27, Lynz was pushed to the sub spot, being benched by LAG M8 after a crushing defeat <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlanta-faze-lan-3peat-major-ii-finals/">at Major II</a>. Two days later, Priestahh was benched – and now he has departed the team entirely.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Nous disons au revoir à </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> , qui quitte le club aujourd’hui

Merci Preston, nous te souhaitons le meilleur dans tes prochaines aventures 🩷 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Rostermania has been pretty wild so far during the gap between Major II and Major III. This coming Friday, matches will return, but will everyone be too distracted by the resurfacing of Verdansk in Warzone?</p>

Among them, he says it might be time for Sony to reconsider its adherence to cutting-edge graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001814.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVWatch</a> (translated via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1906929110980653479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genki_JPN</a>), Yoshida said it's time for PlayStation to reconsider its focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Up until now, PlayStation's DNA has been driven by values such as 'cutting-edge graphics' that have continued since [Ken Kutaragi]'s time," Yoshida said. "Users have also expected that from PlayStation games. However, it's about time we have to reconsider that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I think it's necessary to provide the very best (in terms of graphics quality) to those who want it," Yoshida continued. "But, in order to continue to be popular with users in a broad sense, we naturally have to change our way of thinking."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's little doubt that games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, or other major Sony exclusives have put a lot of focus into graphical fidelity. Yet Yoshida's comments indicate it might be time to reconsider approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that's a focus on relatively smaller experiences like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, or a complete pivot to lo-fi or stylized graphics, it's not suggested. But with the price of making a big, AAA game like those in Sony's stable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make">seemingly only going up</a>, fresh approaches might be welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only insight Yoshida has shared in his interview rounds. The former PlayStation exec <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-convinced-it-to-stop-chasing-overseas-trend">also discussed NieR: Automata's impact on the games industry</a>, especially in Japan. Whether that's the blueprint for a renewed approach to games or not, I certainly wouldn't complain about more games like NieR: Automata going around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Thankfully, after more than a decade away from the glamor and gunpowder of criminal activity, a group of familiar faces behind Payday: The Heist and Payday 2 have taken a break from making the insanely difficult co-op shooter GTFO to go back to what they do best. And that is, make games where you and your friends work together to break the law by pulling off a series of elaborate and high-risk burglaries for no other reason than to satisfy your wanton greed. But where the Payday series was and continues to be a fairly standard game about robbing banks, the upcoming Den of Wolves adds a compelling sci-fi world with a gritty, cyberpunk flair, multi-phase planning and execution of break-ins where you can decide exactly how you want to pull it off, and most importantly: the ability to dive into the minds of others to steal the valuable secrets hidden within their brains. If that doesn’t get your blood pumping, I don’t know what will!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Den of Wolves takes place in the extremely dark near future where the world’s technology ecosystem imploded due to hackers, and corporations were given free rein to do whatever they pleased to combat the crisis, including but not limited to human experimentation, and building dangerous and unpredictable technologies (y’know, your basic cyberpunk hellscape stuff) so long as they kept their activities contained to the newly minted libertarian dystopia and Andrew Ryan’s wet dream: Midway City. Naturally this leads to corporations storing their data straight inside totally unhackable human brains, transforming the host to all that delicious data into a wonderful little flesh battery, from the looks of it. But we’re hardened criminals, guys. Are we really gonna let a super creepy meat computer locked away in a bank vault get in the way of us pulling off heists? I think not!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Den of Wolves GDC 2025 Preview Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Den of Wolves has you and three friends planning and carrying out a series of felonies in Midway City, where you’ll overcome those pesky brain-based security systems by mind-melding with victims to rip off their secrets and make off with the loot. My demo focused on a single operation where my crew and I planned and executed a high-stakes assault on a bank currently under new management by a very aggressive street gang with power and tech enough to rival world governments – pretty nasty stuff. In this particular case, our plan of attack was to use a swarm of drones acquired from a previous robbery to ambush a number of these gang members to gain entrance into the reinforced stronghold, then go loud as possible, shooting up the place with reckless abandon until we found what we were looking for. In this instance, the big prize was the data inside someone’s head who was locked safely away inside a vault and scarcely resembled a human anymore; truly just straight nightmare fuel, if I’m being honest.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You'll mind-meld with victims to rip off their brain's secrets and make off with the loot.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this caper went off in a way any Payday fan will immediately recognize: we used a variety of automatic weapons to smash and grab everything in sight while holding off waves of folks who were quite mad about being ripped off, deploying and repairing drills that break every couple seconds even in a sci-fi future, apparently. Naturally, cooperation was critical to our success, as we laid down cover fire for one another, revived downed teammates who got caught in a bad spot, and called out to one another as we heaved bags full of loot across the ruined fortress. There really wasn’t a whole lot new about the foundation of this heist game, aside from maybe the consumable equipment abilities that let my squad do things like throw down a temporary barrier that provided some limited cover in the middle of a fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But all that changed when the bank vault doors slid open, revealing the prize we were chasing after: a caterpillar-like human lump locked away to contain valuable secrets. After a little bit of hacking, we lept from the physical plane and into the mind of this person to hack open their brain and make off with their secrets. Now, I don’t know what exactly is going on in the mind of this clearly and understandably disturbed individual, but what we found waiting for us inside his dome was an unsettling and surreal series of landscapes that we had to leap between to gain access to their thoughts. And since we were on a timer, we couldn’t afford to take our time or slip up, lest we get booted back out to the real world and have to continue to hold out against enemies before getting another crack at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the only brain I dove into in my limited time with Den of Wolves, but I was told that every mind would present unique challenges to play against, not just the high-stakes platforming of our current mission. And while it remains to be seen just how interesting or how much variety these will have, this section completely shook up an otherwise familiar formula in a seriously cool way. I love shooting at rival criminal gangs and robo cops as much as the next convicted felon, but it was really neat to jump back and forth between reality-based FPS combat and completely bizarre cooperative platforming in a geometrically impossible world of imagination. That really helps to set this one apart from what I worried might just be a Payday sequel with a cyberpunk skin plastered over it. Instead, it seems Den of Wolves plans on taking some real risks and trying stuff that makes it weird and interesting, and I’m absolutely down for that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In between trips into our poor, troubled victim’s mind, we were yanked right back out to where we left off, only milliseconds apparently having elapsed in meat space while we went parading around in someone’s noggin. After jumping back into his skull for a few additional servings of deeply uncomfortable jumping puzzles, we got what we came for and made our exit by blowing up some windows with high explosives and diving out to what I can only hope was some Assassin's Creed-style hay piles waiting conveniently placed just below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Den of Wolves borrows quite a bit from Payday and other crime games, the setting, elaborate planning mechanics, and especially its surreal mind-hacking mechanics all made me feel pretty confident that developer 10 chambers’ return to the wonderful world of heisting has a good chance of being another stunning success. Here’s hoping they can pull off the score of a lifetime when this thing eventually makes its way into early access on PC.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But should contract negotiations break down, the ZeniMax union now has the permission to call a strike.</p><p>This authorization comes as contract negotiations between union members and parent company Microsoft continue into a second year.</p><p>The strike authorization is the latest escalation between the union and management. Last year, ZeniMax Workers United <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295556/video-game-developer-strike-zenimax-microsoft">participated in a one-day strike</a> claiming that Microsoft did not adequately address employee concerns over its return to office policies and its outsourcing practices. Those concerns have come up again in negotiations alongside better pay and benefits.</p><p>“Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time,” said associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield in <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft">the press release</a> announcing the strike authorization. “Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?”</p><p>“Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love,” Microsoft spokesperson Delaney Simmons says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams’ contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair — if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.”</p><p>ZeniMax Workers United is one of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202271/bethesda-game-studios-workers-unionize-cwa">several</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">unions</a> under the Microsoft umbrella. It formed in 2023 and was once the largest union within the company with 300 members before Activision Quality Assurance United organized roughly 600 quality assurance workers last year.</p><p>At GDC 2025, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) announced the launch of the United Videogame Workers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-workers-form-first-north-american-industry-wide-union-with-communications-workers-of-america">a nationwide direct-join union</a> open to any worker in the video game industry.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
