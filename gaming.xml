			<p>As part of its GDC 2025 news, NVIDIA announced that a free Half-Life 2 RTX demo will be released on March 18. Fans will have the opportunity to sample around two hours of gameplay of the work that Orbifold Studios has already completed, checking out the full ray traced graphics, remade assets, particles, and animations in the Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, today marks the official release of the RTX Remix remastering suite, a little over a year after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-open-beta-qa-with-nyle-usmani-past-present-and-future-of-the-generalized-modding-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Beta debut</a>. NVIDIA has introduced features like DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin, and RTX Volumetrics, all of which are, of course, included in the Half-Life 2 RTX demo. NVIDIA boasts frame rate improvements of 2.4x compared to the RTX Remix Open Beta, which only supported DLSS 3.5 Frame Generation, in Portal RTX, mainly thanks to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and RTX Radiance Cache, although the runtime was also optimized and texture streaming improved.</p>

<p>With a new Character Replacement feature, RTX Remix users will find it easier to remaster the original assets of old PC games. After working on the remaster in the Blender software, they'll be able to remap the skeleton in RTX Remix to get a properly remastered asset that works correctly.</p>
<p>NVIDIA said there are 150 compatible games (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Left 4 Dead 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/painkiller-rtx-remix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Painkiller Remixed mod</a>), not to mention 350 mod projects being actively worked on by a community of over 30K modders. PBRFusion 3 is also now available to easily remaster materials for Physically Based Rendering (PBR). This new version introduces the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom fine-tuned model for better upscaling of lower resolution textures</li>
<li>Custom fine-tuned depth model</li>
<li>Higher quality Normal Maps</li>
<li>Seamless Maps</li>
</ul>
<p>It generates normal maps, height maps, and roughness maps. You can find a guide <a href="https://huggingface.co/NightRaven109/PBRFusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As a side note, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-now-in-over-100-games-more-titles-coming-soon-neural-shading-support-directx-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that there are now over 100 games and apps with support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. They also confirmed the following titles will support the technology:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-april%E2%80%99s-directx-agility-preview.1133232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has kicked off the official GDC 2025 news rounds with a bang, revealing that official RTX Neural Shading support will go live next month thanks to an updated DirectX Agility SDK Preview released by Microsoft. While the RTX Kit <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-with-neural-shaders-is-out-now-mega-geometry-and-neural-texture-compression-demos-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been available</a> via GitHub since last month, the DirectX support will accelerate RTX Neural Shading with GeForce GPUs Tensor Cores.</p>
<p>John Spitzer, NVIDIA VP of Developer Technology, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Neural rendering is the future of graphics and we are happy to partner with Microsoft to bring AI to programmable shaders in DirectX. All game developers can use Tensor Cores built into GeForce RTX GPUs to deliver next-gen realism and performance to Windows gaming.</em></p>
<p>Shawn Hargreaves, Direct3D Dev Manager at Microsoft, added:</p>
<p><em>Microsoft is adding Cooperative Vectors support to DirectX and HLSL, starting with a preview this April. This will advance the future of graphics programming by enabling neural rendering across the gaming industry. Unlocking Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX will allow developers to fully leverage RTX Neural Shading for richer, more immersive experiences on Windows.</em></p>
<p>For now, three main uses of RTX Neural Shading have been detailed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-neural-compression-technique-unlocks-16x-texture-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Neural Texture Compression</a> can create neural representations of thousands of textures in less than a minute, saving up to 7x VRAM/RAM compared to regular compression techniques.</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Neural Radiance Cache</a> can infer theoretically infinite multi-bounce indirect lighting starting from just one or two bounces, optimizing visuals and performance.</li>
<li>RTX Neural Materials compresses complex shader code typically reserved for offline materials composed of multiple layers, such as porcelain and silk. It provides material processing that is up to 5x faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, this is just a preview. It will be a while before it's officially released, and then we'll have to wait for game developers to actually implement the features. However, owners of the GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs are future-proof in this regard since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new graphics cards</a> already support RTX Neural Shading.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah | Neural Rendering, Powered by GeForce RTX 50 Series and AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtTtUyqGs-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In other GDC 2025 news, NVIDIA demonstrated an updated version of the Zorah demo first showcased at CES. A sample will be available next week with the following features: RTX Mega Geometry, RTX Hair, ReSTIR Path Tracing, and ReSTIR Direct Illumination.</p>
<p>Additionally, the NVIDIA RTX Unreal Engine 5 branch on GitHub was just updated with support for the RTX Mega Geometry and RTX Hair technologies. The former <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> in the most recent Alan Wake 2 patch, while the latter will do so in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through an update</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NVIDIA-ACE-inZOI-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>NVIDIA also confirmed that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACE AI technology</a> will debut when inZOI (whose system requirements have just been <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>) launches in early access on March 28, offering an on-device language model exclusively available on GeForce RTX GPUs. NVIDIA ACE will also be integrated later this month in NARAKA BLADEPOINT: MOBILE PC VERSION, where the AI will be a helpful game companion. The same will be added to Black Vultures: Prey of Greed, an upcoming MMOFPS by Korean developer WEMADE, previously codenamed <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/korean-games/newsView/ked202305080012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Means War</a>.</p>

With the unique thrills of great cooperative play so fresh in our minds, we wanted to look back at some other great co-op games that you can play with relative ease if you’re looking for something to play with a friend, family member, lover, or sworn enemy. Here are our picks for the 18 best co-op games you can play right now.</p></div><div><p>Hazelight got its start as a force in co-op games with <em>A Way Out</em>,<em> </em>which follows two criminals who escape from prison and are on the run. That could easily be a setup for a generic third-person crime shooter, but <em>A Way Out </em>marks the beginning of Hazelight’s inventive and varied co-op design. Everything you do in <em>A Way Out </em>is a team effort, whether it be setting things in motion for your prison break or escaping to freedom with the cops on your tail. The studio’s later offerings lean harder into fantastical premises and riff on more interesting cooperative ideas, but <em>A Way Out </em>is where it all began and it still holds up. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>  <em>A Way Out </em>established that Hazelight was skilled at creating memorable co-op experiences, but <em>It Takes Two </em>is where the studio really found its footing. The charming platformer puts you and a friend into the shoes of an estranged couple whose daughter wants them to remember why they fell in love in the first place, and that means using a spell to turn them into toys who have to overcome a series of challenges by working together. <em>It Takes Two </em>is constantly changing things up, giving both players different tools to use in wildly varied segments that are smooth, intuitive, and could easily have been extrapolated into separate, standalone games. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><p><em>Split Fiction </em>is the culmination of everything Hazelight has done up to this point, taking the co-op action platformer structure of <em>It Takes Two</em> up a notch as it shifts nimbly between sci-fi and fantasy worlds to pay tribute to different pieces of genre fiction as well as a wide array of video games. The game is a bit more challenging than <em>It Takes Two</em>, however, so if you’re looking to ease someone into format, maybe start with the previous game before jumping right into Hazelight’s latest. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Often imitated but never duplicated, <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> is still the best co-op shooter around some 15 years after its release. Many have tried to copy its format, but none have come close to beating<em> L4D2</em>’s mix of amazing level design, intuitive UI, fast-paced action, and perfect pacing. I’ve played so many memorable matches of<em> Left 4 Dead 2</em> with complete strangers who had no mics. Didn’t matter. We still had an amazing time mowing down zombies or killing survivors as special infected. Truly one of the all time greats. Pick this up ASAP, get some friends together on Steam, and have a blast. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>For most of its run, <em>Splinter Cell Conviction</em>’s cooperative campaign plays like most others in Ubisoft’s stealth franchise. It’s two players sneaking, shooting, and interrogating guards with a gun to their heads. However, what separates <em>Conviction </em>from its predecessors is its incredible and subversive ending, one that other games on this list would also go on to emulate. If you want a rock-solid stealth game with an intriguing espionage story full of twists and turns, you can’t go wrong with <em>Splinter Cell Conviction</em>. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Studio MDHR’s run-and-gun platformer <em>Cuphead </em>is notoriously challenging. But you know what makes it less so? Having a friend running and gunning by your side. Playing <em>Cuphead </em>with a friend is a surefire way to cut down your play time, as you’re able to revive one another after a death you’re sure was bullshit and you don’t even know what killed you. Co-op <em>Cuphead </em>is basically giving yourself a second, third, and fourth life. Playing it alone is just making it harder on yourself. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s<em> </em>tabletop inspirations are most apparent when you play it with friends. Yeah, hanging out with Larian’s party of would-be mind flayers makes for an incredible single-player RPG, but journeying through Faerûn with a group of friends playing as custom characters, getting into hijinks, and coordinating battle strategies together is the game’s chaotic potential realized. Like a good tabletop session, playing <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>with friends can either be filled with incredible moments of creative problem-solving and synergy, or it can be an absolute dumpster fire of everyone sabotaging each other and creating new problems. Sure, it’s still limited by the finite possibilities of Larian’s code, but it does a great job of emulating the concept. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Super Mario 3D World </em>is another co-op game that can easily see the action devolve from jolly cooperation to playful trolling, with its ample opportunities to wreak havoc on each other. But even when the most annoying player is throwing you off the side of the map, you can’t beat four friends running and jumping around in a <em>Mario </em>level. <em>3D World</em>’s co-op brings the multiplayer madness of the <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>sidescrollers to a 3D space. You’ll probably reach the goal pole faster on your own, but it won’t be nearly as memorable without a few hours of laughing together on the couch. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>What’s more cooperative than building something together? <em>Minecraft </em>needs no introduction as the best-selling video game of all time, but if you somehow don’t know about the game that spawned an upcoming Jack Black-led film <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve-jason-momoa-trailer-1851639338&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jack-black-steve-jason-momoa-trailer-1851639338">that looks pretty bad</a></span>, it’s equal parts survival adventure and creative suite. So many incredible things have been made in <em>Minecraft</em> that you might be intimidated by the game and hesitant to jump in. But in my experience, the best <em>Minecraft </em>experience is having a chill hangout with friends as you explore and build. It’s calming and therapeutic, almost like gardening with your pals. It gives you a digital space to hang out in without the stress of objectives or puzzle-solving. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Oh look, another Valve game is on the list. This time we’re spotlighting <em>Portal 2</em>, a game that shipped with a fantastic single-player campaign and didn’t need more. Yet, Valve also tossed in a damn fine co-op mode, too, complete with its own story, characters, levels, and mechanics. You’ll probably need to play this one with someone who has patience, loves puzzles, and has a strong stomach, as portal hopping can cause some motion sickness. But with the perfect person, <em>Portal 2</em> co-op is an amazing experience that is both immensely satisfying and fun. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>The <em>Lego </em>games aren’t the most complex of co-op experiences, but they are reliable and very easy to pick up and play, and there are so many different games and franchise adaptations that there’s bound to be something you and your friend are both interested in. Are you a <em>Star Wars</em> fan hoping to journey to that galaxy far far away? Looking for something <em>Marvel </em>you can play with your friends that isn’t as sweaty as <em>Rivals</em>? Or maybe you want to play a good <em>Horizon </em>game to help you and your buddy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-ai-aloy-ps5-horizon-zero-dawn-1851769086&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ai-aloy-ps5-horizon-zero-dawn-1851769086">forget about the AI monstrosity Sony is cooking up</a></span>? You can find all of the above in the <em>Lego</em> games, so you and a friend can beat up blocky baddies and usually enjoy a funny spoof of your favorite franchises. They’re a fun, uncomplicated romp. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>My favorite kind of cooperative games are the ones that give everyone a role to play. <em>Operation: Tango </em>is one of the best examples of asynchronous co-op I’ve played because the tools it gives its two players could not be more different. One player is a field agent doing espionage and sick spy tricks, the other is a hacker who only sees what’s on their computer. Both players have to be locked in, communicating, and telling each other what they see to solve problems and accomplish their mission. There’s something incredibly satisfying about finding the answer to your field agent’s problem by solving puzzles and hacking into a system. <em>Operation: Tango </em>exemplifies teamwork better than most co-op games and can be completed in a sitting or two. Just make sure you play with someone who will be patient while you’re scrolling through all the hacking UI. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Journey </em>is a little different than most of the games on this list in that you can’t queue up with a friend and guarantee that you’ll play through Thatgamecompany’s gorgeous playable screensaver together. You can play <em>Journey </em>by yourself, but throughout your trek through a desert up to a mountain in the distance, you’ll pass by other players making their own pilgrimage; you’re free to heed them as they try to help you find your way, or you can ignore them. However, <em>Journey</em>’s only form of communication is through chirps that don’t have a specific meaning, so you and your traveling partner will essentially create your own language by wordlessly chirping at one another as you move through the world. The expedition to the mountain is arduous, emotional, and beautiful to behold, and it’s also one that’s better when walking alongside another. Even if you don’t know just who it is you’ve been paired up with. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>When talking awesome co-op experiences, it’s too hard to pick one <em>Halo </em>game. And luckily, in the year 2025 we don’t have to because we have the<em> Master Chief Collection.</em> Now you and a friend (or a few more, depending on the game) can play through all of <em>Halo</em>,<em> Halo 2</em>, <em>Halo 3</em>, <em>ODST, Halo Reach</em>, and <em>Halo 4</em> together without having to swap games or consoles. And thanks to plenty of updates, the <em>MCC </em>is the best way to enjoy the action-packed and bombastic campaigns found in each game. Sure, you can play them solo, but having a buddy in your Warthog is always better. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Like <em>Halo</em>, all of the <em>Gears </em>games—even <em>Judgement</em>—are fun co-op games. However, I’m going to specify<em> Gears of War 3</em> for this list as I think it’s still the best game in the series and it features 4-player co-op, too. This was only seen one other time, in the previously mentioned <em>Judgement</em>, and while I can imagine it was a pain to implement, it makes <em>Gears 3</em> so much fun to go back to in 2025. You can bring your whole crew and play <em>Gears of War 3 </em>all at the same time. And thanks to Xbox’s backwards compatibility and FPS boost, playing this aging cover shooter is as easy as chainsawing a Locust drone’s head off. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Really, any <em>Borderlands </em>game is made 10,000 times better when you bring a friend or two along for the ride. But personally, <em>Borderlands 3</em> is my favorite to replay with friends these days and that’s mainly because of how good the combat and movement feel in this one. However, you could also check out <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands,</em> which plays just as well as <em>Borderlands 3</em> but also supports crossplay and features a lot of cool magic and fantasy melee weapons. And best of all, when playing any <em>Borderlands </em>game in co-op, you will all be too distracted by each other to hear the cringey jokes. A win-win situation! — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><p>When the original <em>Diablo </em>arrived in 1997, the alluring pull of the Lord of Terror wreaked havoc on the work and school schedules of thousands, who couldn’t resist diving into the dungeons beneath the cathedral in Tristram with friends to slaughter monsters and score some sweet loot. The series and its emphasis on co-op continue to this day, of course, but if you ask me, the fun factor for co-op play peaked with the second game, 2000’s <em>Diablo II</em>. (To be clear, I like the tone, story, and core experience of <em>Diablo IV</em>, the series’ latest entry, but I also think the game is bogged down with live-service elements and obnoxious endgame grinds designed to keep you playing for the sake of keeping you playing, rather than because those grinds are actually fun or meaningful.)</p><p> Thankfully, <em>Diablo II </em>got a great modern refresh with <em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em>, a 2021 remaster of the 2000 game and its excellent <em>Lord of Destruction </em>expansion that makes hopping into Sanctuary with a friend and fighting the forces of evil on modern platforms a piece of cake. <em>Diablo II </em>is one of the most influential games of all time, cementing the very way we think about in-game loot in everything from <em>Borderlands </em>to <em>Fortnite </em>as having different color-coded quality tiers, and the appeal of its incredible classes, weapons, combat, and world is as apparent today as it was a quarter century ago. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>When the sun sets and the robot stops to charge, you’ll make camp, craft new gear, and repair your mechanical guardian. But the wasteland is freezing cold at night.

                <p>In addition to being a winner on the PGA Tour, golfer Joel Dahmen is a self-proclaimed ace at Mario Kart 64. The 37-year-old said in an appearance on <a href="https://youtu.be/EqrffNbcpwA?feature=shared" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Good Good</a> recently that he's yet to meet anyone in the world who is better than him at the 1996 kart racer.</p><p>He said he played the the game nonstop in college when he was roommates with fellow golfers Nick Taylor and Kevin Spooner. They might have been better at the game back then, but today, Dahmen claims he's the best.</p><p>"I still have met no one who can beat me at Mario Kart N64. If we do a best-of-10 races, I'm definitely winning 6, 7, 8. I put in more hours than anyone else," he said.</p><p>Dahmen went on to discuss his skills on the sticks, saying he knows the technical ins and outs on how to gain the advantage on Mario Kart 64's tracks.</p><p>"It's more about drifting than item placement. If you can start blocking corners, blocking jumps--if you block those things, then all of a sudden you're just getting ahead. You have to understand angles to be able to block items coming at you," he said.</p><p>One tactic he uses is holding items behind his character to block incoming attacks. He also noted that he's a big fan of the <a href="https://mariokart.fandom.com/wiki/Triple_Green_Shell" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">three green shells</a>. With a steady hand they can be used to snipe other racers and knock them off course, he said. He also pointed out how, on <a href="https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Mario_Raceway#:~:text=Mario%20Raceway%20is%20a%20track,pipe%20and%20a%20sand%20field." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Raceway</a>, it's possible to drift, then fire all three off the walls while moving sideways, to creating a deadly trap for others.</p><p>Dahmen has <a href="https://www.pgatour.com/player/34076/joel-dahmen" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one win on the PGA Tour back in 2021</a>, along with 25 top 10 finishes, nine top 5 finishes, one third-place finish, and two runner-ups. He is featured prominently in Netflix's Full Swing golf series.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">next Mario Kart game</a> is rumored to be in the works now for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. The Switch 2 announcement trailer in January might have revealed a first look at the game, but nothing is confirmed at this stage--we might learn more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">during the Nintendo Direct in April. </a></p>

                <p>Late last year, ESPN carved out a place for itself in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fortnite-battle-royale-review-laying-the-foundatio/1900-6416891/" data-ref-id="1900-6416891">Fortnite</a> with the debut of ESPN Football Island. Now, the network is adding a second island in Fornite Creative, which will be called ESPN Basketball Island. The two ESPN islands will be connected through in-game portals, and the latest attraction is adding a few new basketball-inspired minigames.</p><p>The first new minigame, Dunk to Win, can be seen in the Basketball Island launch trailer below. It's essentially another riff on Capture the Flag, except the flag is now a basketball. Once players have the ball, they have to avoid the other team's defenders and make their way to the net to score a slam dunk.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDGuh11L8bk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HDGuh11L8bk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other basketball-themed minigame is Swing Shot, which puts players in Fortnite Baller vehicles as they attempt to land inside of a moving basketball hoop located on the opposite side of the court. There's even a new minigame called The Ocho Obstacle Sprint--which is a more challenging obstacle course than the one on Football Island. The Boxtagon is also making its return for 1v1 battles inside of a UFC-style cage. This minigame can still be found on Football Island as well.</p><p>ESPN's islands are accessible in Fortnite using code: 5265-7665-9581 or you can find them by searching for "ESPN" in-game. ESPN Basketball Island is available now, and it was created as part of a collaboration between ESPN, Disney Games, and developer Meta4 Interactive using Unreal Editor for Fortnite.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lara-crofts-return-to-fortnite-leaked-with-prices/1100-6530088/" data-ref-id="1100-6530088">Lara Croft's return to the game</a> was leaked earlier this week, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaks-hint-at-kendrick-lamar-x-fortnite-collab/1100-6530055/" data-ref-id="1100-6530055">Kendrick Lamar is rumored to be getting a Fortnite collaboration</a>. Additionally, the game is adding its first Major League Baseball player, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-baseball-players-in-the-world-might-be-hitting-the-fortnite-shop-soon/1100-6529993/" data-ref-id="1100-6529993">Shohei Ohtani</a>, the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar who is MLB's reigning MVP and a member of the 2024 World Series champions.</p>

			<p>Big changes are underway at Netflix, as the executive who led the streaming giant's foray into gaming has been confirmed to have left the company less than six months after assuming a new role.</p>
<p>As confirmed to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-mike-verdu-exit-gdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameFile</a>, Mike Verdu, former Vice President of Netflix's GenAI, has left the company for undisclosed reasons. GameFile asked the executive for comment but did not return the request.</p>
<p>Mike Verdu joined Netflix back in 2021 to help the company launch its gaming division, whose reins he left to former EA and Ubisoft executive Alain Tascan last July, then assuming the role of<a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-investing-in-generative-ai-for-games-after-closing-studios/"> vice president of GenAI</a>, the company's division focused on generative AI. This transition was reportedly planned, although the quick exit from the company as a whole only five months after assuming a new role suggests that other issues may have been ongoing behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Considering how generative AI is becoming more and more prominent, it is unlikely Netflix's plans for GenAI are going to change with Mike Verdu leaving the company. The former vice president highlighted, last year, how he was focused on "<em>a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant."</em> This is a vision that is shared among big publishers such as Microsoft, who recently revealed its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/">Muse AI model</a> that is capable of generating gameplay, but it remains to be seen how much they will stick to the idea of generative AI empowering developers, and not use it to take their jobs away.</p>

            <p>
I love a game that features some kind of cooking element, so I was quite pleased yesterday when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/humble-games">Humble Games</a> revealed they're publishing Town Of Zoz, a new action RPG that's all about fighting off rats from eating your crops, taking down baddies to gather up ingredients, and using said ingredients and crops to make some tasty meals. It's got wonderfully vibrant art and animation. The announcement trailer quickly won me over with the choppy, almost stop-motion-like quality of certain character models.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Town Of Zoz is the debut title from Studio Pixanoh, following Ito, a "young shaman chef adventurer" who has to come home to help run his family's farm and restaurant. There's the usual RPG questiness - dark secrets amongst the locals that you have to uncover, you know the drill - but what really sells me is its Breath Of The Wildy cooking format. Kill an enemy and out comes something like an avocado or chicken legs. Once you've got enough ingredients, you head to the kitchen, where it looks like you'll have to fend off more enemies while your food cooks.
</p>

<p>
It looks like a fun, satisfying loop, and the cherry on top is what you do with the food afterwards. As you get to know people around town, you might learn their favourite meal. Making it for them will bring you closer together, and let you learn more about them. Obviously this is just a trailer, but so far Town of Zoz really seems to understand that food is best when it's a communal activity, something to share and bond over. As someone whose family used to run a restaurant themselves, this one's really speaking to me.
</p>
<p>
And if I wasn't sold enough by this game already, some of the score is coming from 2 Mello. His <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> inspired album Memoirs Of Tokyo-To is a banger, and he's done excellent work for games like If Found, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bomb-rush-cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/later-alligator">Later Alligator</a> too. I'll take that release date now please! You can, like I already have, wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748110/Town_of_Zoz/">right here</a>.

            <p>Sony has quietly expanded the cloud streaming feature on its PS Portal handheld to include a number of games from its Classics Catalogue.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">streaming feature launched back in November</a> last year and allows PS Plus Premium subscribers to stream games directly to the handheld without the need for a PS5 console.</p>
<p>Since then, Sony has been quietly adding to the service, which now includes almost every PS1 and PSP game from the Classics Catalogue in the streaming library (thanks <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/ps-portal-ps-plus-premium-streaming-update-march-2025">TrueTrophies</a>).</p>
<p>At its launch, the beta allowed players to access "select PS5 games", with over 120 games included. Now players can dive into the likes of Ape Escape, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>, Legend of Dragoon and more.</p>
<p>As it remains in beta, the cloud streaming service is only available in 30 countries, though that does include the UK.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the service can be accessed in: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.</p>
<p>It's unclear when the service will arrive in full globally, but for now it's clear Sony is keen to add to the catalogue of games - even if it's not including news in its regular PS Plus updates.</p>
<p>If you own a PS Portal, instructions on accessing the beta can be found on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/subscriptions/psportal-cloud-game-streaming/">PlayStation Support website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">PS Portal</a> was released in November 2023 - it's impressive hardware but does require a strong internet connection to function well. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-already-sold-out-as-scalpers-take-advantage">quickly sold out after release</a>, though scalpers took advantage of demand.</p>
<p>The device is also included in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-uk-ps5-rental-scheme-from-11month">Sony's new PlayStation rental service</a>, priced at £6.50 per month. Separately, you can rent PS5 consoles each month, or a PS VR2 too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sony announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-premium-and-extra-games-for-march-revealed">PS Plus Premium and Extra lineup for this month</a>, including the excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> and a number of classic Armored Core games from FromSoftware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While never officially announced by Bethesda, rumours of an Unreal Engine 5 remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> have been circling the proverbial dialogue pie since 2023, surfacing first via an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/oblivion-linked-virtuos-is-making-an-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-remake/">alleged developer</a>, then leaked court documents. Edwin wrote about its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">potential improvements to combat here</a>, while noting that the same leaked documents also mentioned both a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> remaster and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-is-the-only-exciting-thing-on-bethesdas-leaked-5-year-plan-and-im-worried">Dishonored 3</a>. This might well either prime you with a healthy dose of scepticism, or else have you running around the house shouting "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> 3!" at your pets, as I do at least once a week.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/">Very Gary Computing</a>, "noted insider" NatetheHate reckons this Oblivion remake is getting revealed "in the coming weeks' - a claim they say they've corroborated. "Nate claims the game will likely release before June, while sources have told VGC it could arrive as soon as next month".</p>

<p>It's reportedly being developed by support n' port studio Virtuous - who've worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, Uncharted, and most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Delta</a> - and "fully remade" in UE5, with reworks to stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reactions, and the HUD.</p>
<p>The armoured elephant in the room here is, of course, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> - the full fan remake of Oblivion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">still on track for a 2025 release date</a>. It's been in development since 2012, and the team pegged this year for likely release back in 2023. I'm being genuine when I say that the official Oblivion remaster rumours manifesting that year is likely a coincidence - the Skyblivion team have been in dialogue with Bethesda throughout development, so I doubt there's any real tension there.</p>
<p>I do, however, feel that Bethesda could possibly show a bit more respect to their modding community here by not swooping in to steal Skyblivion's thunder, even if I understand the business rational behind not wanting to miss out on potential sales from players that already have a perfectly good modern Oblivion, thank you very much.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I couldn't tell you why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nintendo">Nintendo</a> has left Star Fox to rot with the likes of Kid Icarus, while other series like Advance Wars have made a comeback (no shade to Advance Wars fans), but it has. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/chuhai-labs">Chuhai Labs</a> are here to save the day with Wild Blue, an upcoming on-rails shooter just revealed yesterday at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/humble-games">Humble Games</a> Showcase. The teaser itself didn't show a lick of gameplay, but it's worth noting that Chuhai Labs were founded by Giles Goddard, one of the programmers for the original Star Fox on SNES.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Goddard boisterously introduced himself in Wild Blue's teaser trailer as the "only person that worked on S**r F*x". The redactions are courtesy of the trailer itself - don't worry, I've not somehow convinced myself that the name of a classic Nintendo game is a curse word or anything.

<p>
There's another tongue in cheek moment with a character that definitely isn't Peppy Hare reciting the infamous "do a barrel roll" line, before being cut off by someone else - presumably protagonist Bowie Stray (excellent name) - saying "we don't call them that here". So this really is just legally distinct Star Fox.
</p>
<p>
The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921490/Wild_Blue/">Steam page</a> doesn't share all that much either, there's an indication of the kind of locales you'll by flying over like deserts, oceans, that kind of thing, and that there'll be branching paths you can take, but for the most part this is very much an "our game exists" kind of announcement. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing wrong with that, especially seeing as Nintendo haven't given any kind of indication they're working on a new Star Fox. The last official entry was from way back in 2016, so I'm happy for all of you retroheads that will be able to get your "anthropomorphic animal cool spaceships fix" with Wild Blue, whenever it comes out.

            <p>Spectre Divide developer Mountaintop is taking the game offline, and the studio will be "closing its doors" at the end of this week.</p>
<p>The first season of the free-to-play tactical shooter, in which players control two bodies, only began two weeks ago. However, despite optimism during the first week, the developer hasn't "seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio", and Mountaintop is now out of funding.</p>
<p>"We expect to take Spectre offline within the next 30 days, but we plan on disabling new purchases and refunding money spent since Season 1 [launched] via the platforms," Mountaintop's CEO Nate Mitchell wrote, in a <a href="https://playspectre.com/news/letter-to-spectre-fans">post announcing the studio's closure</a>.</p>

<p>"We pursued every avenue to keep going, including finding a publisher, additional investment, and/or an acquisition. In the end, we weren't able to make it work. The industry is in a tough spot right now," the CEO said, calling this a "painful update" to share with the Spectre Divide community.</p>
<p>"This has always been a passion project for us, born out of love for this genre. An indie team of insanely talented individuals who came together from around the world to build a game we believed in," Mitchell continued.</p>
<p>"We wanted to deliver something innovative and original in a crowded genre that would bring friends together around unforgettable moments. We shook up the format, created a fresh art style and universe, and partnered with some of our heroes. All of us knew from the beginning that the odds were against us, but that's what we signed up for.</p>

            <p>
It's a fact: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> is much easier to play in a city or large town. There are more gyms and PokéStop locations to interact with, more Pokémon that spawn, more fellow players to battle alongside.
</p>
<p>
For years, rural players have complained the game is harder for them in comparison. Now, finally, it's the turn of those who live in busier areas to complain. 
</p>
<p>
The latest set of challenges to obtain an ultra-rare Shiny Meloetta in Pokémon Go include the requirement to hold a bronze Showcase Star medal, something that means a player needs to have placed first in a PokéStop Showcase. 
</p>
<p>
This is an easy task in remote areas - where essentially you can enter a Pokémon into a Showcase tournament, and be the only person to do so, automatically winning. But in built-up areas, Showcases can attract hundreds of entrants, making your chances of winning much harder.
</p>
<p>
For some players who've already bought the Shiny Meloetta ticket (sold for £4.99 earlier this month), it's proved an unexpected sticking point in their progress. For others, who live in the countryside, it's provided an easy step forward.
</p>
<p>
"Bronze medal only requires one win," wrote a fan on <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/eurogamer-net/content-article/new/news/?tab=compose">Pokémon Go reddit TheSilphRoad</a>, "yet some people struggle cause cities like Singapore are so dense and popular with PoGo that Showcases fill up very fast and you can't even enter it."
</p>
<p>
"Well so much for that," wrote another fan. "I have tried for over a year and never won a single showcase."
</p>
<p>
"Just let us rural players have this one win and don't be a sook," said a third. "Literally every other aspect of the game is better in the city."
</p>
<p>
The solution? Over the 21 days it'll take to complete the other steps in this next set of challenges, fans say those wishing to push forward should consider a day trip to somewhere a bit quieter to get that Showcase victory sorted.
</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">Niantic confirmed it was selling Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go giant Scopely in a deal worth $3.5bn</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">move has sparked concern from fans over the game's future</a>, something the game's development team has attempted to assuage.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Balatro developer Locathunk has responded to a debate on AI art, stating "I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds".</p>
<p>The debate raged on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7nz5q/opinion_from_localthunk_on_ai_art/">Balatro subreddit</a> after one of its moderators posted that AI art would not be banned in the community. Many fans believed both Localthunk and the game's publisher Playstack supported AI art.</p>
<p>As such, Localthunk took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/localthunk.bsky.social/post/3ljygv23un22v">social media</a> first to respond. "I learned about this a little bit earlier - this is not how I feel about AI 'art'," he wrote. "I normally wouldn't say something about the r/balatro community but this doesn't represent my beliefs nor do I believe it represents how Playstack feels about AI-generated imagery. I don't condone AI generated 'art'."</p>

<p>Then, the developer took to reddit to address the situation once again.</p>
<p>"A mod recently changed the flair in this subreddit for AI generated art making it seem like Playstack condones AI art," he wrote. "This was not due to a direct order from Playstack (a Playstack representative told me this) but from an interpretation of a message about enforcing the rules of the subreddit.</p>
<p>"Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds. The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic."</p>
<p>Localthunk confirmed the moderator has been removed from the team and that AI-generated images will not be allowed on the subreddit.</p>
<p>"Please remember to be excellent to each other - this mod doesn't deserve hatred. Please leave them alone," he concluded.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/regarding_ai_art/">Regarding AI art</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/localthunk/">u/localthunk</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/">balatro</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>A statement from Playstack followed.</p>
<p>"As LocalThunk points out, we do not support the use of AI art, but perhaps the rules around this should have been clearer so it could not be interpreted as 'acceptable'," wrote communications director Wout van Halderen, confirming the mod team will tighten the rules and FAQ on the topic.</p>
<p>AI art is increasingly being used in game development, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">Square Enix using the technology for Foamstars</a>, to more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision acknowledging the use of generative AI in Call of Duty</a> (which likely resulted in that six-fingered zombie Santa).</p>
<p>In an unrelated drama, last month the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">Balatro developer successfully appealed PEGI's decision to classify the game as PEGI 18</a> due to its poker theme.</p>
<p>Localthunk previously commented on PEGI's perceived mishandling of the game's rating. A year after release, Balatro has been recategorised as suitable for players aged 12 and up.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will in fact be compatible with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, Ubisoft say, despite a previous <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">tech Q&amp;A</a> on the sneaky-stabby ninja sim declaring point-blank that it won’t. Announced on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1899863156995903687">whatever the fuck Twitter is</a> these days, the confirmation that Shadows will play nice with the Deck comes as a pleasant surprise – even without that prior naysaying, games with a GTX 1070 listed among the minimum specs typically don’t cope too well on the handheld’s frugal hardware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The only question, suggesteth the tweet, is whether Shadows will get a full-on Verified stamp of approval from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Valve’s compatibility testers</a>, or the Playable classification, which is normally handed to games that run well enough but might have awkward controls or tricky-to-read text. It’ll help, at least, that this particular Assassin’s Creed is launching with a native Steam version, and won’t solely be yoked to Ubisoft Connect (though there are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">other ways</a> of installing that launcher on your Steam Deck too).</p>
<p>Another barrier that Ubisoft have seemingly both erected and cleared is Shadows’ mandatory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">ray tracing</a>. While not slathered in always-on megalighting like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, it won’t be possible to entirely switch off ray traced effects, as they’ll always be enabled in the player’s hideout hub at minimum. With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-eternals-ray-tracing-now-works-on-the-steam-deck">few exceptions</a>, ray tracing will cut down Steam Deck performance like an impertinent daimyo’s neck, but Ubisoft have also created a more easygoing, software-based version of these effects, which will supposedly function adequately on lower-end GPUs. Which would explain why the GTX 1070 is in the minimum specs and not, say, the RTX 2060, with all its hardware-based ray tracing tools.</p>
<p>Whatever you might play it on, Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches next Thursday, April 20th. Ed (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-enjoyed-my-time-with-assassins-creed-shadows-but-i-remain-unconvinced-by-its-split-protagonists">had a play in January</a>, finding it a competent open-world yarn, though was less impressed with the dual-protagonist gimmick that left hulking samurai Yasuke feeling less fleshed-out than stealthy shinobi Naoe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Parents shouldn't let their children play Roblox if they are worried about their kids' safety in-game, Roblox boss Dave Baszucki has said.
</p>
<p>
Roblox, the gaming and social platform with 80 million daily users, has frequently been criticised for its lax player safety - particularly as the bulk of its audience is under 18. 
</p>
<p>
"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox," <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yrjkl7dd6o">Baszucki told BBC News in a new interview</a>. "That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">Roblox made a flurry of changes in late 2024 designed to improve child safety</a> with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">the addition of basic parental control features</a>, such as the ability to set playtime limits, remotely manage a child's account and view a child's friend list.
</p>
<p>
Parental access is now required for children to access some in-game chat features, and children under 13 have been blocked from social hangout games due to "user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk". 
</p>
<p>
The changes came a month after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">a damning report was published detailing the ongoing safety issues for children in-game</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">had been regularly highlighted for years</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many," Baszucki told BBC News today. 
</p>
<p>
"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">In 2013, Roblox reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation to US authorities</a>, and responded to over 1300 requests from authorities for detail on predatory players. Over the last six years, at least two dozen people have been arrested in the US for abusing victims met via Roblox.
</p>
<p>
During the interview, BBC News showed Baszucki evidence of how easy it was to still set up accounts to chat between a user who was a minor and adults, as well as the titles of Roblox experiences recommended to an account of an 11-year-old, including "Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP" and "Special Forces Simulator".
</p>
<p>
"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well," Baszucki said in response.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-shares-drop-by-20-as-platform-misses-target-active-users">Roblox shares dropped by 20 percent</a> after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of expectations, something the company blamed on a recent ban of the platform in Türkiye over child safety concerns.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/boulies-master-chair-rex-review.1133097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/boulies-master-chair-rex-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Humanity does a lot of sitting. Sitting when we work, sitting when we relax, and, of course, sitting when we game. A few years back, office chair sales went bananas to accommodate all the extra sitting time when we were all locked in our homes, and bottom comfort and back support has remained in high demand ever since, resulting in keeping people’s posteriors well-propped becoming something of an art form. So, does the Boulies Master Chair have what it takes to make your buttocks and back feel like their ensconced on a cloud, or is it more akin to perching on one of those weird butt-hating blue seats of despair located in bus stops all over the land?</p>
<p>First off, the box the Master Chair Rex arrives in is insanely heavy. The delivery man was literally crying sweat and weeping tears dragging the enormous behemoth along my driveway. Unless you’re an Olympic Power Weightlifter, it’s probably best not to attempt to lift the box on your own. Also, it’s probably worth not trying to lift the weighty chair up the stairs after it’s been built, as I did, promptly sending my back muscles into spasm. This did, however, fill that first time sitting in the chair with relief for my suffering body.</p>
<p>Building such a heavy chair was also a challenge, and not one to undertake without a protein shake and a DIY partner. The instruction book – well, more like a leaflet if I’m being entirely honest – is hilariously unclear. A poor English translation and murky images make for much confusion. Fortunately, I had enough DIY experience to figure things out, but if you’re new to the office chair building game, get ready for some head scratching befuddlement as you attempt to put the Master Chair together.</p>



		
		

<p>The actual individual pieces of the chair feel very high quality, though, with plenty of aluminium, steel, and solid building blocks. When you do figure out which bit connects to what bit, they clunk together in a satisfying manner. Bolts are chunky and robust, ensuring that once the chair is built it’s absolutely going to stay in one piece.</p>
<p>Once you’ve sat yourself upon the imposing chair, it does rather feel like you’re an evil emperor plotting to take over the Universe. Still, you’ll definitely be a <em>comfy</em> evil emperor plotting to take over the universe. The style leans toward the gamer end of the market, with that overall car seat style, instead of the “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/12/sihoo-doro-s300-chair-review/">lots of floating panels</a>” that’s more common to offices, but it’s a mature take without even a hint of neon orange stitching.</p>


<p>Every aspect of the chair can be tinkered with until you find your optimum set-up. The 4D arm rests can be moved to pretty much any position – up, down, shifting front-to-back and side-to-side, and twisting – and then lock in place, and there’s adjustable lumbar support built into the back that can be increased or decreased using side-mounted knobs to find just the right amount of pressure to keep your back in a good shape. Even just sitting down, there’s 15º of tilt in the base, and then the back can tilt back and lock into position at 15º increments until you’re practically lying down. With the Master Rex variant, you can flip out the leg rest and you can have a little snooze, even.</p>
<p>The material of our review unit, Ultraflex PU leather, is luxurious to behold and is surprisingly easy to clean, as an early accident with a chocolate milkshake aptly demonstrated. You can also opt for a water repellant fabric, or go all-in with Nappa leather (at a cost). While there’s claims that the castors are friendly to wooden floors, I wasn’t able to test this as I have carpets, but they’re simply plastic and the sheer weight of the chair would have me suggesting you still invest in a floor protector.</p>
<p>With a starting price of £370 (currently on offer for £290) for the standard Master Chair, this is great value when stacked up against the similarly featured AndaSeat Kaiser 3 (£400) or Secretlab Titan Evo (£469 after discount). The Master Rex does bump the price up by £40 for the leg rest to £410 (discounted to £330), while larger humans have the Master Max as an option.</p>
<p>The only thing is that it turns out this style of chair just isn’t for me. It’s so heavy and cumbersome to move and so blinking massive that I find myself returning to my old budget priced office chair more often than not.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, WindowsCentral's Jez Corden <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a report</a> detailing Microsoft's plans for the next-generation Xbox as well as the long-awaited Xbox handheld. As for the former, the report said a successor to the Series X is already in the works for a targeted 2027 release window.</p>
<p>When it comes to the latter, Microsoft is allegedly planning its own handheld system (also due in 2027), but the report also mentioned an Xbox-partnered handheld device codenamed Project Keenan due this year with the partnership of a PC OEM manufacturer.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/628073/microsoft-xbox-handheld-project-kennan-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared his own (paywalled) report</a> in the latest Notepad newsletter. First, the project's correct codename is Kennan, not Keenan. Second, his sources revealed that the Xbox handheld's manufacturer is ASUS. The device will run on Windows, of course, but it will feature an interface very much reminiscent of the Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>This is reportedly part of a larger project codenamed Project Bayside to unify Xbox and Windows under a unified Xbox user interface regardless of the device being used. Warren also wrote that Microsoft is working to ensure a single store for games and an easier way for game developers to create titles for handhelds, console-like hardware, and PCs.</p>
<p>At CES 2025, Microsoft's Jason Ronald, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem, openly teased this concept when he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that they've worked hard to bring the best of console and PC together, drawing on their long-time experiences on both platforms, as part of their Xbox handheld efforts. Right now, Windows-powered PC handhelds don't really offer the most user-friendly experience, and Microsoft aims to address that with this initiative.</p>
<p>Following Warren's report, Corden <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-project-kennan-gaming-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> another article to admit that the colleague was right on the Project Kennan codename. He also corroborated that ASUS is indeed the chosen manufacturer and offered an estimate on the likely pricing: between $499 and $599. This could hint that the hardware could be using AMD's Z2 Go chipset previously seen on the Lenovo Legion Go S. The Z2 Go chipset is <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-go-slower-than-z1-extreme-lenovo-legion-go-asus-rog-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly slower than the Z1 Extreme</a> and quite a bit slower than its larger sibling, the Z2 Extreme. However, it's still more powerful than the APU currently available in Valve's Steam Deck. The Xbox handheld would, therefore, sit somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to performance, although again, this information is not at all assured.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more details.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pocketpair-publishing-warns-gamers-to-not-expect-%E2%80%98more-palworld%E2%80%99.1133082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Pocketpair Publishing was announced just a few weeks ago, at the tail end of January. As an all-new arm of Pocketpair, the developer behind Palworld, Pocketpair Publishing is dedicated to bringing indie titles to life. However, the brand’s publishing manager, John Buckley, recently issued something of a warning.</p>



<p>He mentioned that while Pocketpair Publishing bears <strong>the name</strong>, it’s not related to the creation of Palworld, nor should it be assumed that ‘more Palworld’ is coming from the games that sign to the publishing label. By that, he means that players shouldn’t expect the vast levels of success seen with Palworld’s 2024 release, which turned heads worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-are-all-bangers">‘They Are All Bangers’</h2>



<p>John Buckley from Pocketpair Publishing recently took to social media to stress how nervous he is about announcing the first batch of games that the team is working on. It was revealed in January that Surgent Studios, the creator behind Tales of Kenzera, has aligned with Pocketpair Publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-surgent-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to produce a new game</a>.</p>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1899644637826203835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Buckley wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m very nervous to reveal our first batch of games. </p>



<p>Not because I think the reception will be bad (they are all bangers), but because I worry people will just expect more Palworld. </p>



<p>PPP’s goal is to help cool indies get made so I hope you like our first round of games!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then pointed out that Palworld’s ongoing development is ‘completely unaffected by PPP’ and that ‘us publishing more games like Palworld’ isn’t on the cards.</p>



<p>It’s a relatively loaded statement that has been taken with a mixed reception. Some feel that Buckley – who goes as ‘Bucky’ online – has immediately soured the line-up of games that PPP is yet to announce, restricting expectations and making us feel as though there’s a lack of faith at the publisher regarding the potential success of these games.</p>



<p>After all, nobody expected Palworld, which was presented as ‘Pokémon with guns,’ to break player count records and secure tens of millions of fans in the blink of an eye, but that’s what happened. If I were a developer aligning with Pocketpair Publishing, I’d perhaps be critical of that post by the brand’s publishing manager.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing what Pocketpair Publishing can produce? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>There’s <strong>another </strong>live-service competitive multiplayer title in the works at PlayStation, but the identity of the game is yet to be revealed. In a recent job posting that was discovered from PlayStation, it was revealed that a studio under the label is working on an ‘unannounced project’ that’s set to feature competitive, esports, and live-service elements.</p>



<p>Because that has worked so well for PlayStation in recent years, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-could-it-be">What Could It Be?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ja1ptk/playstation_next_unannounced_multiplayer_title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, eagle-eyed users spotted the recently-posted job listing from an undetermined studio, and they instantly started theorising what game the role could be referring to. The consensus was that it could be some kind of multiplayer fighting game, but at this point, it could be anything.</p>



<p>What’s made clear by <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5447168004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the job listing</a> is that it’s set to be a live-service multiplayer game, and the team is eager to introduce a ‘competitive gaming/esports landscape’ into the title. As some one who has been in the esports world for many years, I’d like to point out that you can’t just invent a landscape or a competitive community – that only works when it’s grown, not bought.</p>



<p>The listing goes on to mention that the game will be multi-platform, covering PC, console, and mobile, and that it’ll be developed in Unreal Engine. It might be that the game is <strong>very early in </strong>the development cycle, as the listing says that the successful candidate will help drive the game ‘from prototype to production’. </p>



<p>It <strong>might </strong>be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-sony-studio-la-jason-blundell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Blundell’s new game</a>, too. In 2023, rumours started surfacing regarding Blundell’s appointment to a new PlayStation studio in Los Angeles, and it has been suggested the former Call of Duty legend is working on a game that fits the bill. If the job listing was for a placement in LA, it would offer more credence to that claim, but it’s a remote position, so there’s nothing to go on.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s a safe idea for PlayStation to piece together another live-service multiplayer title given the state of the industry? Hours ago, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-spectre-divide-closing-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spectre Divide</a>, another game fitting into that category, is shutting down.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-spectre-divide-closing-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Spectre Divide went live in September 2024, and in March 2025, it was announced that the game – and the developer behind the title – would be shutting down. This news came despite the studio securing tens of millions of dollars in investments while being backed by some of the most prolific streamers in the business.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spectre-divide-and-mountaintop-studios-to-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The news</a> shocked everyone involved, even if Spectre Divide wasn’t the first shooter released in 2024 to close down so quickly. Let’s take a closer look at the situation and determine why Spectre Divide is closing down in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-did-spectre-divide-fail">Why Did Spectre Divide Fail?</h2>



<p>Spectre Divide was penned as being the next big thing in competitive arena shooters, boasting a unique aesthetic and some innovative mechanics. It was publically backed by Michael ‘shroud’ Grzesiek, one of the biggest streamers and former esports players in the world.</p>



<p>The core USP of Spectre Divide was a ‘duality’ feature that would allow players to split themselves into <strong>two bodies</strong>, controlling each in real-time.</p>



<p>None of this was enough, as ultimately, Spectre Divide fell down the charts relatively quickly at launch, failing to gain traction and secure a healthy base of users.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Mountaintop Studios revealed that was why Spectre Divide failed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the Season 1 launch hasn’t achieved the level of success we needed to sustain the game and keep Mountaintop afloat.</p>



<p>We were optimistic about the first week. We’ve had ~400,000 players play, with a peak concurrent player count of ~10,000 across all platforms. But as time has gone on, we haven’t seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a huge pitfall for free-to-play shooters built around a live-service operating model. If there are no players, there’s nothing to support the studio, and this is something we’re seeing happen increasingly often. Last year, Concord was pulled from stores mere weeks after launch, after failing to secure a meaningful player count.</p>



<h2 id="h-was-spectre-divide-bad">Was Spectre Divide Bad?</h2>



<p>Almost as soon as the game hit the market, people were asking, ‘Is Spectre Divide dying?’ It was an immediate concern for those eager to explore the game, as it looked as though the game was on the rocks from the moment it arrived. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Spectre Divide was fairly buggy when it was released in September 2024. That kind of thing can cause a game to be DOA, as nobody wants to play a game riddled with glitches – even if it’s free.</p>



<p>It was also determined that the Duality feature was more of a gimmick than anything else and didn’t necessarily add too much to the game’s core makeup. </p>



<p>Many prospective fans of Spectre Divide were also displeased with how Shroud, the game’s main advocate, busied himself with other games like Deadlock and Marvel Rivals, failing to support the game he’d promoted since day one.</p>
