<p>Hours ago, one of the most monumental grand final matches in the history of Call of Duty esports unfolded in Texas. On a stunning stage, the New York Subliners and OpTic Texas (on home turf) collided after a weekend of competition that saw both teams battle ferociously for their shot at the title.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled, a 5 – 1 scoreline saw OpTic secure the trophy – the organisation’s first Call of Duty world championship since 2017. This match was a contender for the most electrifying fixture we’ve ever seen in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finally">Finally.</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas are your new Call of Duty League champions after eradicating the reigning champs, the New York Subliners, in an intense best-of-nine. Every step of the way, OpTic Texas was dominant, maintaining control in almost every round and refusing to relent against a capable Subliners squad. </p>



<p>It was a relatively balanced fixture in the opening Hardpoint and the first round of Search and Destroy, with the first two rounds going the way of OpTic before the Subliners picked up a clean win in Control on Karachi. That’s when OpTic Texas entered a flow state, winning the second Hardpoint by a 120-point margin and walking all over the Subliners in the second Search and Destroy.</p>



<p>On home turf, the crowd was volcanic, and the presence of the OpTic leadership team alongside the iconic dynasty of Crimsix, Scump, Karma, and FormaL meant that the Green Wall was alive and enthralled during this event. It couldn’t have worked out better for OpTic Texas if it had been scripted.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Special commendations should be handed down to every member of the OpTic Texas squad. For Dashy, it’s his first ring after seven appearances at Champs. Kenny (with his headband) is a two-time world champion now and maintained a flawless aura throughout this fixture. Shotzzy, who became MVP of the event, deserves endless praise for netting another ring. Finally, Pred, who played out his rookie season in 2022, needs recognition for his unparalleled energy this year.</p>



<p>It was a phenomenal event from start to finish, but it marks the end of our CDL 2024 season. Now, we look to the Esports World Cup for what comes next.</p>

Unlike the Steam Deck which runs Linux, Asus went with standard Windows for its operating system, which in theory allows for more games to run natively as well as the option to more easily run a variety of PC gaming storefronts. Now, in 2024, the Ally X provides a much-needed hardware refresh that improves the form factor and functionality of the device. And this time, Asus assures us the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ally X won’t be frying SD cards</a></span> (more on that later).</p><p>The Ally X, notably, is not a full blown “sequel” to 2023’s Ally. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmHGuBNq2wF&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmHGuBNq2wF" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">At $799</a></span>, it doesn’t upgrade the processor from the first, higher tier model. The AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme, however, is more than capable of powering a vast majority of modern games, from tiny indie titles that won’t ever trouble it, to more substantial graphical powerhouses like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The Ally X, however, did add more (and faster) memory, with 24GB of ram and it has a very, <em>very</em> generous 80Wh battery that made me almost never think about battery life during my time with it. And it does have the same 7-inch, 1080p, 16:9 LCD screen that, while obviously not as flashy as an OLED panel, never fails to look splendid (that is, when my fingerprints weren’t all over its glossy surface).</p><p>While I have issues with Windows as an operating system for handheld gaming, the Ally X has made it hard for me to go back to my Steam Deck. That said, I still find Valve’s portable PC to be a better gaming experience overall. But oof, it’s gettin’ close ya’ll. </p><h2 id="h371745"><a id=""></a>My experience with the Ally X</h2><p>I’ll spit numbers and stats at you in a moment, and I’ll more thoroughly address my complaints where they exist. But there’s no mistaking it: The Ally X provided me with a wonderful portable gaming experience, and it’s likely to continue doing so. It is a substantial improvement to the experience of the original Ally and is compact enough to make it worth putting up with Windows.</p><p>As a New Yorker, I decided to really lean into the Ally X’s portable potential as much as possible. While that motivation was a little cut short by the fact that the Ally X doesn’t include a case (forcing me to use the inner shell of my Steam Deck OLED case in which it…mostly fit), its smaller size compared to the Steam Deck was welcome as I traveled on trains and buses daily. </p><p>Once I got past some frustrations with Windows 11, I rarely thought about hardware and software, I just gamed. My time was largely spent with <em>Flintlock</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em> (which I had to be home for due to a required internet connection), and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. All ran with virtually zero flaws at a decent 40-60 frames per second depending on how I fiddled with the graphics settings. The screen has a 120HZ refresh rate too, so you can push to even higher framerates with the right game.<br></p><p>And because I was playing games on my Steam account, I could come home and pick up right where I left off on my much more powerful home computer. Like the Steam Deck, the Ally X flattens the boundary between PC gaming at home and on the go, but with wonderful battery life and a form factor that is more like pulling my Switch out of my bag than it is the mini battle tanks other portable gaming PCs tend to be.</p><p>The Ally X provides a fantastic PC gaming experience on the go for a price that’s a touch steep, but fair if you’re up for investing in a great portable experience. </p><p>That said, the choice of operating system here, which technically is not Asus’ fault, can make for some rough setup and more than a few frustrating quirks.</p><h2 id="h371746"><a id=""></a>Windows %@*&amp;ing sucks for this kind of gaming experience</h2><p>My first hour or so with the Ally X was spent, well, setting up Windows. I had to sign into my Microsoft account, turn down all the offers for a free trial of OneDrive, Microsoft 365, and other stuff that isn’t a concern to me whatsoever on a gaming machine. Then, for some reason, it wouldn’t recognize my pin to sign into the device. So I had to reset that a number of times. </p><figure id="" data-id="4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-recommend-id="image://4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Windows error shows on an Ally X screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Windows error shows on an Ally X screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-recommend-id="image://4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Windows error shows on an Ally X screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given that you shouldn’t leave a portable Windows machine just open for anyone to pick up and sign into your personal account, having a pin to unlock the device is necessary. And because Windows doesn’t recognize controller input on its lock screen, I had to use the touch screen as I attempted and reset my pin two or three times. </p><p>By the end of going through Windows setup and constantly entering my pin, I was exhausted and left with a device with fingerprint smudges on it because I can’t use the controller buttons to sign in. </p><p>And it didn’t end there. Windows would constantly do its weird Windows things. While playing <em>Elden Ring</em>, I’d get spontaneously taken back to the desktop with no way to get the game back on the screen easily. Remember, there’s no keyboard, so I can’t Alt + Tab to it. I’d swipe up constantly to make the Windows taskbar appear to keep pressing the game’s icon to no luck. That, of course, left more fingerprint smudges on the device. </p><figure id="" data-id="d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-recommend-id="image://d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X shows several fingerprints on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Ally X shows several fingerprints on the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Just navigating Windows will result in more smudges than anyone ideally wants.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-recommend-id="image://d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X shows several fingerprints on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Suspending the device to toss it back in my bag while moving between trains was also unpredictable. I’d hit the power button to see it go black and then suddenly pop to life again on the Windows lock screen. Why? I don’t know. Sure, there are ways to tailor Windows to play nicer with this kind of form factor, but the operating system is an unideal solution for portable gaming. It pales in comparison to SteamOS on the Steam Deck and doesn’t even come close to the seamless experience of using something like a Nintendo Switch. I would gladly take a gaming-specific operating system that might technically run fewer games (though the Proton compatibility layer for Linux OS is making Windows less and less essential these days) over an operating system that is just foundationally not meant for this kind of form factor.</p><p>There’d be other issues, like troubleshooting randomly disconnecting Bluetooth with a pair of Pixel Buds Pro that never has issues on other devices. Random Windows prompts here and there were another pain point, as was any time I seemingly activated Co-Pilot for reasons unbeknownst to me. </p><p>While Windows has gotten better with recognizing a gamepad as an input device, it’s still best practice to set up your Ally X with a keyboard and mouse connected. I loved the hardware of the Ally X, but companies like Asus desperately need to start exploring alternatives, or Microsoft needs to relent and offer some kind of more lightweight version of its OS for these kinds of gaming devices.</p><figure id="" data-id="af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-recommend-id="image://af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error screen on Windows shows why headphones won't work." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An error screen on Windows shows why headphones won't work." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>I spent most of a morning’s train ride trying to troubleshoot this nonsense.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-recommend-id="image://af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error screen on Windows shows why headphones won't work." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Something’s gotta give because this is not a great solution. </p><p>But once I got gaming, and Windows left me alone, <em>damn</em>,<em> </em>the Ally X rocks. </p><h2 id="h371747"><a id=""></a>The Ally X just <em>feels </em>right</h2><p>Upon first holding the device, the Ally X is immediately more comfortable than its predecessor and everything just feels more premium this time around. The shell has been tweaked a bit so it’s a touch larger than the original Ally, but its grips are less angular so it just rests in your hands more naturally. To be honest, I still find the Steam Deck to be more comfortable even if it is a larger device compared to the Ally X.</p><figure id="" data-id="282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-recommend-id="image://282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rear of the Ally X shows off its grips and buttons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The rear of the Ally X shows off its grips and buttons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-recommend-id="image://282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rear of the Ally X shows off its grips and buttons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The triggers and bumpers have been reshaped and feel better. The same is true of the four face buttons, which, though still flat and less colorful as I’d like them to be, feel better to press than the original device. The thumbsticks, in particular, are excellent, with more resistance than the previous ones. The d-pad also got some love and feels more reliable and less slippy than the glossy one on the original. The dual rear buttons are also less prominent than the original Ally, which on that device I had found to be too prone to accidental presses.</p><div><h4> I almost never thought about battery life  </h4><p> The Ally X ships with a 65W charger that gets  the Ally X up to a full charge quickly (it’s compatible with a 100W  charger if you want even faster charge times). I don’t remember how many  times I charged this device, but it wasn’t an everyday requirement.  You’ll get less battery life if you switch the device to its more  powerful performance setting in Asus’ utility software, but even while  playing modern games, battery life was beyond generous.  </p></div><p>The Ally X is a touch heavier than the original Ally, but in my opinion, this helps it feel a little more “premium” in the weird way that extra weight sometimes does. </p><p>All of these form factor changes mean that if you’re considering an upgrade from the first Ally, you’re gonna have to go shopping for a new case and/or skin since it won’t be compatible with existing accessories for the first Ally. </p><figure id="" data-id="f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-recommend-id="image://f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X runs Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Ally X runs Destiny 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-recommend-id="image://f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X runs Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, the choice to go with a slick matte black isn’t just aesthetically pleasing, it helped me focus a bit more on the game. While I like a colorful object as much as anyone else, the black case makes it easier for your eyes to focus on the screen more so than the bright white of the original Ally’s case. </p><div><h4> What exactly did Asus upgrade?  </h4><p> Though it sports the same processor and 120HZ  screen of the original Z1 Extreme Ally, the Ally X comes with twice the  battery capacity, an additional 8 GB of RAM (which runs at a faster  speed than the original), more cooling vents and improved fans to push  heat out of the device. It also ships with 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe storage.  Check out the one-to-one breakdown of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rog.asus.com/articles/rog-ally/rog-ally-vs-rog-ally-x-all-the-improvements-in-the-new-rog-handheld/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rog.asus.com/articles/rog-ally/rog-ally-vs-rog-ally-x-all-the-improvements-in-the-new-rog-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both model’s specs on Asus’ blog</a></span>.  </p></div><p>Perhaps the best addition, however, is an extra USB-C port that can both charge the device and connect to peripherals or any USB4 compatible device. With the Ally X, Asus has made the case that these kinds of machines need two USB ports. You won’t need an external hub, for example, to charge the device while connecting it to a screen or other device. With two ports, the Ally X just feels more portable and less dependent on carrying around a bag full of extra stuff to sprout more connections into the device.</p><figure id="" data-id="60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-recommend-id="image://60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two cables are plugged into an Ally X." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two cables are plugged into an Ally X." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-recommend-id="image://60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two cables are plugged into an Ally X." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Ally X is an excellent, premium-feeling portable PC gaming experience with fantastic battery life, a very pretty, color-rich screen, and increased utility with its additional USB C port. </p><h2 id="h371748"><a id=""></a>The most minor of hardware complaints</h2><p>I love the Ally X, as you might’ve noticed. But there were a few things I think could’ve been better (aside from Windows sucking the fun out of the room).</p><p>While the screen looks great, it is a fingerprint magnet. Given how much you need to use the touch screen to operate Windows to use the machine, that means a single session of gaming will see this thing smudged up pretty quickly. I found that I had to carry around a microfiber cloth to consistently wipe away the marks. The Ally X also repositioned its right thumbstick to be closer to the screen. This would often lead me to accidentally touch the screen with my right thumb. Not only would that leave more fingerprints, it would sometimes trigger something in-game as many games recognize a touch screen as a mouse click.</p><p>I also would’ve liked to have seen a 16:10 1920x1200 screen instead of the cinematic, more desktop standard 16:9 1920x1080 size. With 16:10, you get a taller image which pairs nicely with a smaller device. Such a ratio is standard on the Steam Deck and Switch for a reason. The 16:9 letterbox shape just feels a little too tight for me. That said, some older games don’t support that resolution, so the extra real estate isn’t always getting used. Still, it would’ve been a nice inclusion. </p><p>Also, for 800 bucks, the Ally X should ship with a case. </p><h2 id="h371749"><a id=""></a>Asus’ past Ally troubles</h2><p>An impressive machine in its own right, the first Ally certainly impressed with a pretty LCD screen, a slim form factor, and some satisfyingly powerful compute power to run games at 1080p, often at great framerates. But with great power comes great heat, and that heat turned out to be a problem for the 2023 Ally model as it would be known to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fry SD cards</a></span>. </p><p>To make matters worse, Asus <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1c6dr0d/asus_finally_officially_acknowledges_the_sd_card/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1c6dr0d/asus_finally_officially_acknowledges_the_sd_card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t exactly swift to own up to this problem</a></span>. Eventually, the company would issue an additional year warranty on the Ally to make up for any future problems users may have with the SD card reader. </p><p>That wasn’t the end of it. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/7pMrssIrKcY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/7pMrssIrKcY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamers Nexus </em>documented</a></span> in its video on the Ally’s repair services, Asus seemingly wasn’t the most honest and transparent when it came to servicing a defective device. It was an experience many other Ally owners had as well, which would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lead Asus to promise</a></span> to revamp its customer service experience to avoid further issues.</p><p>For some, the damage may have already been done. And, to be honest, that’s something to take into consideration when we’re talking about throwing down $800 on the new Ally X. </p><p>Speaking to <em>Kotaku</em>, an Asus representative stated that the SD card issue has “long been identified” and that the team “took all precautions possible to avoid users encountering similar issues with the Ally X.” Time will tell how true that is. Asus also said that it will be offering a standard, one-year warranty with the Ally X, as it doesn’t anticipate the new device running into the same issue that caused them to extend the warranty on the original Ally to two years.</p><h2 id="h371750"><a id=""></a>The ROG Ally X is a fantastic hardware refresh</h2><p>The Ally X is easily the best version of the Ally. It feels great to play. Has beyond-excellent battery life and comes in a form factor that’s perfect for on-the-go gaming, despite a frustrating operating system.</p><p>All of that said, Asus is going to have to earn its trust back after previous problems. I hesitate to say it’s worth an upgrade if you have already invested in the Ally Z1 Extreme from last year, but if you’ve been interested in portable PC gaming and <em>need</em> Windows, the Ally X is more than up to the job.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It made sense at the time as he met his end during Tekken 7's story, but he's been such a mainstay that fans wanted him back in some form.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We had the chance to speak to Tekken's Katsuhiro Harada and Kohei Ikeda about Heihachi's return, and they shared the thought process about bringing him back from the dead.</p><p>"Tekken 7 really focused on the story arc between Heihachi and his son, Kazuya, and so, we really wanted to show that kind of final conclusion, and he seemed to die at that point," Harada said. "But then, after that happened, Tekken 8 was released, and we put a lot of effort into the story and the fans really seemed to be engaged with that. And as that was happening, we were kind of feeling that the players kind of missed him as well. Obviously, we did, too. So, it was kind of decided later on that we would do that."</p><p>Despite that, preperations were being made in the background to set the stage for Heihachi's return.</p><p>"We did kind of make the preparations for Heihachi," Ikeda said. "<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8s-final-character-reveal-is-reina-perhaps-the-spiritual-successor-to-heihachi">Reina was one due to that link that she has to Heihachi.</a> And then, if you look closely at the 30th anniversary logo, you can see that it's comprised of Devil's wings. There are two different styles, but if you take a step back and look at, it actually looks like the silhouette of Heihachi's face. Right? So, we were doing some of the preparations in the background."</p><p>While they weren't ready to share many more details on Heihachi, there did have a few teases to share. </p><p>"Like you imagine, it is a bit too early to be talking many details about his character, but to give some hints, he has a very powerful play style throughout the series, so we tried to recreate that in Tekken 8," Ikeda said. "So, the focus is on that. But also, if you saw the story hints about the monks in the footage and what he has to do with them, that will maybe dictate some of his move set as well."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Heihachi is the third DLC character for Tekken 8 and follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska. While his arrival is exciting, there is plenty more for fans to look forward to, including the first ever story DLC in the Tekken franchise. This new chapter of 'The Dark Awakens' will continue the clash between the Kazama and Mishima families and will be available as a free update for all players in the future. </p><p><em>Have a tip for us?

                <p>Bandai Namco has announced <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Heihachi_Mishima" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heihachi Mishima</a> as the next DLC character for Tekken 8 and revealed that, for the first time in the series' history, a new chapter in the story mode will be added to the game. The extra story content will delve deeper into the ongoing feud between the Mishima and Kazama families.</p><p>The announcement was made during Evo 2024, at which Tekken 8 was a major attraction for players wanting to compete in high-level battles and viewers who want to see the best of the best duke it out in the fighting game. Heihachi is a fan-favorite character and one of the main antagonists of the Tekken series. His arrival follows <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Eddy_Gordo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eddy Gordo</a>, a DLC character that is already available, and <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Lidia_Sobieska" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who will be available widely from July 25. Heihachi is expected to be available in Fall 2024.</p><p>The story expansion, which builds on the ongoing 'The Dark Awakens' storyline, will be free, but publisher Bandai Namco has not yet confirmed when it will be available.</p><p>The other notable Tekken-related announcement is a collaboration with Nike, which includes in-game gear and the Nike Air Foamposite One Kazuya Mishima sneakers. A trailer that debuted during the Tekken finals at Evo 2024 showcased a variety of the game's characters sporting Nike sneakers and the iconic branding integrated into the stages.</p><p>The shoes, meanwhile, got a surprise drop and were available to purchase to Evo attendees via the SNKRS app. Bandai Namco indicated it would provide further details on the Nike x Tekken collaboration in the future.</p><p>Evo 2024 in Las Vegas officially became the largest in its history, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evo-2024-is-officially-the-largest-esports-competition-ever/1100-6524526/" data-ref-id="1100-6524526">largest competitive tournament in esports history</a>. Over 10,224 players across 63 countries signed up for at least one of Evo's eight big tournaments and, alongside Tekken 8, Street Fighter 6, Mortal Kombat 1, Guilty Gear Strive, and King of Fighters XV were a few other big draws. The throwback game for 2024 was Street Fighter III: Third Strike. </p>

			<p>The Witcher 3 PC players unite as modder 'Freak' has released an interesting new mod that restores the reputation concept in The Witcher 3.</p>
<p>Developer CD Projekt Red cut the reputation concept from the game when it was released back in 2015, but this new mod aims to restore that feature. When using the mod, player choices and behavior correspond to reputation points in different regions. The mod includes five reputation levels, including hated, disliked, neutral, liked, and respected. Each level corresponds to Geralt's reputation points range in the region. According to the modder, the different reputation levels will influence the corresponding region's economy. In addition, all bedding&nbsp;and bargaining activities are also affected.</p>
<p>What's cool here is that the outcome of certain quests based on Geralt's choices will affect Geralt's reputation in the region, gaining or losing. We've included an overview of the different reputation influences below:</p>
<p><em><strong>Hated</strong>: +30% buying price, -70% selling price, -20% bargain multiplier, -50% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em><br>
<em><strong>Disliked</strong>: +15% buying price, -15% selling price, -10% bargain multiplier, -25% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em><br>
<em><strong>Neutral</strong>: same with vanilla</em><br>
<em><strong>Liked</strong>: -15% buying price, +15% selling price, +10% bargain multiplier, +50% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em><br>
<em><strong>Respected</strong>: -30% buying price, +30% selling price, +20% bargain multiplier, +100% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em></p>
<p>Those interested can download The Witcher 3 Reputation System Mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9383?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from here</a>. Be sure to follow the provided installation instructions. As expected, this mod is only available for the PC version of the game, and aside from working on the regular version of the game, it's also compatible with the next-gen version.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its DLCs are available worldwide now for PC and consoles.</p>

		<p>SNK headed to Evo 2024 with a surprise that no one had been expecting. During the incredibly popular annual fighting game competition, SNK dropped a trailer for SNK vs Capcom SVC Chaos, announcing a re-release of the 21 year old fighting game. Going further, SNK announced that the game is available to buy now on Steam, and it will be available from 22nd July on PS4, Switch and GOG.</p>
<p><iframe title="【ENG】SNK VS. CAPCOM SVC CHAOS｜Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JqjMpn6JrYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The SNK lineup of characters features the likes of Kyo Kusanagi, Terry Bogard, and Mai Shiranui, Mars People, and Athena. Meanwhile, on the Capcom side there are the likes of Ryu, Chun-Li, Demitri, Zero, and Red Arremer. In total the game includes a roster of 36 characters to fight as.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442380/SNK_VS_CAPCOM_SVC_CHAOS/">SNK VS. CAPCOM SVC CHAOS is on Steam</a> for £16.95. The price is likely to be similar on the other platforms when it launches on those too. SNK vs Capcom SVC Chaos has had some updates applied to it including rollback netcode, and online lobbies for up to nine players. In online tournaments there are options for single elimination, double elimination, and round robin. There is a hitbox viewer too which shows every character’s collision areas. The gallery mode features 89 pieces of artwork.</p>

<p>SNK vs Capcom SVC Chaos first released in 2003 for PS2, Xbox, and Neo Geo. It did not have the best reception critically, averaging a score of 56 on Metacritic.</p>

            <p>Netflix has just dropped a new teaser for Arcane: League of Legends' second – and final – season.</p>
<p>Whilst it's barely a minute long, the trailer offers a peek at a "stealth mission" and shows how "Zaun's finest [...] makes sneaking back into your lab look good".</p>
<p>You can check it out in the video embedded below:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">Arcane may be ending with its second season</a>, but Riot Games is planning more projects with the show's talented animation studio Fortiche, the developer has now said.</p>
<p>"Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and our partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," co-creator Christian Linke said in a <a href="https://x.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1800543519725297679">developer update video last month</a>.</p>
<p>"From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with the second season."</p>
<p>As Tom reported at the time, the show's upcoming second season has taken another three years to put together, and it was hoped its story would continue on further. There's still the possibility of another Arcane-style series set elsewhere within its universe, perhaps, but fans should prepare themselves for the show's overall series finale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-two-teaser-reveals-a-big-new-character-and-sets-fan-tongues-wagging">when new episodes arrive this November</a> on Netflix.</p>

            <p>Stormind Games has shared a ten-minute teaser for its upcoming horror, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-quiet-place-the-road-aheads-new-gameplay-footage-faithfully-recreates-the-tension-found-in-the-films?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN</a> captured ten minutes of hitherto unseen gameplay in which, on Day 119, the player fights to escape through the air ducts of an old building. It is dark, atmospheric, and absolutely terrifying in equal measure.

<p>"In A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, experience the harrowing journey of Alex, a young college student suffering from asthma and struggling to survive the end of the world alongside her boyfriend, Martin," the description teases.</p>
<p>"But the nightmarish creatures stalking the land aren’t the only threat she’ll have to contend with as she travels through the ruins of civilisation in search of a safe haven for herself and her family."</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead doesn't have a firm release date yet, but it's currently expected to launch later this year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <p>A "leaked" trailer of Guilty Gear Strive's fourth season has popped up online.</p>
<p>Initially, the video was seemingly stumbled upon as a live, if unlisted, upload on YouTube. As soon as the news spread, however, the video was swiftly marked private… but not before about a dozen people uploaded it to their own channels, and many others grabbed a handful of informative screenshots.</p>
<p>The news below may include spoilers, <strong>so please only proceed</strong> if you're happy to have the surprises ruined!</p>

<p>According to the screenshots, Guilty Gear Strive Season 4 boasts new stages, an exclusive new colour, as well as the all-new "Team of 3" mode.</p>
<p>We also saw a number of new and guest characters, too: fan-favourite Dizzy – she's now a Queen – Venom, newbie Unika, and Cyberpunk Edgerunners' Lucy.</p><p>Wes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guilty-gear-strive-review-finally-a-guilty-gear-for-everyone">gave Guilty Gear Strive a recommended badge in his review</a> of the game's original release, and last year, it joined the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guilty-gear-strive-arrives-on-game-pass-next-week">library on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>"I've never been able to get into a Guilty Gear game before. I love fighting games. I love Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, Marvel vs. Capcom and Tekken, Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter, but Guilty Gear has always remained just out of reach," Wes wrote at the time.</p>
<p>"Strive extends a helping hand, one I have gripped, firmly. And I have no intention of letting go."</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-fresh-shadow-x-sonic-generations-levels-in-new-teaser">Sega unveiled our first look at two new Shadow x Sonic Generations levels</a>, delving into the Sonic nemesis' past.</p>
<p>As with the original Sonic Generations, the new separate Shadow campaign will reimagine stages from Shadow's past. So far, we've seen the Space Colony level, inspired by Sonic Adventure 2's Final Chase. Now, in a new teaser video comparing old and new, two more stages have been revealed based on zones from Sonic Heroes and 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>

            <p>Silent Hill: The Short Message developer Hexadrive is developing a new horror game, Niraya of ■■.</p>
<p>I have no idea if that "■■" is permanent or merely obscuring the final word until we get closer to the release, but an announcement teaser – which boasts the dubious honour of having one of the most disturbing cinematic openings I've ever seen – says it's currently slated for Q4 2025, so it may be a while yet until we know more.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="『■■ノニラヤ』アナウンストレイラー / &quot;Niraya of ■■&quot; Announce trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GitrLzD_89U?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>The teaser begins with a news report detailing how "a large number of bodies", including children, were discovered at a temple. At the same time, a huge hand with inhumanly long fingers is caressing the face of a dead child. So that's nice.</p>
<p>Then we see a little of the gameplay, which has a very retro/PS1-esque presentation faintly reminiscent of the Fatal Frame games. It's a significant departure from the hyper-real graphics of The Short Message.</p>
<p>"Niraya of ■■ is a Japanese horror game inspired by the Buddhist beliefs," the Steam description explains.</p>
<p>"The game focuses on a unique system where players 'avoid' the attacks of various monsters. This, combined with the fear of exploring eerie environments and solving puzzles, is a major draw of the game.</p>
<p>"In this game, the protagonist is cast into a mysterious realm unknown to the modern world and must attempt to escape. Players will guide the protagonist through unknown areas, solving hidden puzzles to progress. However, as mentioned, the exploration is filled with terrifying experiences, including strange phenomena and sudden monster attacks."</p>
<p>Right now, it looks as though the horror game is only coming to PC via Steam, although there's plenty of time for that to change, of course.</p>
<p>"I suspect that anyone who can relate to Anita's fictional experiences from a real-life perspective will have one of two polarising responses to Silent Hill: The Short Message: deep outrage, or deep admiration," I wrote in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review">Silent Hill: The Short Message review</a>, giving it three out of five stars.</p>
<p>"For me – someone who can, unfortunately, relate to some of the darker themes expressed in The Short Message – it's the latter. Despite its inelegant delivery and high-school drama framing, Anita's story, if clumsy at times, is impactful, thoughtful, and – perhaps most importantly of all – hopeful.</p>
<p>"No, it may not be the Silent Hill game many of us were expecting; it may not even be the Silent Hill game some people want. But even with that infuriating chase sequence, I'm very glad it exists."</p>
