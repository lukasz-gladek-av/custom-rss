			<p>In just three days, Frostpunk 2 has already crossed over 350,000 sales, as posted by Frostpunk 2 developer and publisher 11-bit Studios&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/frostpunkgame/status/1838181485859246232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on X</a>. They have said that the game has already recouped the development and marketing costs and has already been profitable in the three days it's been available on the market.</p>
<p>If you want to know whether this is a game you should pick up, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/">Chris' review of Frostpunk 2 here</a>.</p>
<p>The game has over 5,000 reviews on Steam so far, and has a Mostly Positive standing on Steam. Frostpunk 2 is also available on Game Pass, and was available as a day one title. Of course, this is just the beginning of Frostpunk 2, as 11-bit Studios say that the players' support touches them, but "the work doesn't stop here" as they continue to work on improving the Frostpunk 2 experience by adding new hotfixes and updates in upcoming patches. Development is still ongoing to make Frostpunk 2 the perfect game, and the game may receive major DLC expansions in the future, as the first Frostpunk game also did.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 isn't just an ordinary city builder, as this one comes with a story, much like the first one. It's the sequel to Frostpunk, a highly successful indie game made in 2018, and takes place 30 years after the first game. You have to work on building up a city in a post-apocalyptic land that is blighted by a permanent winter. Although you'll be building up a city, you'll also have to make difficult moral and political decisions, as you are the leader of your new town. Although Frostpunk 2 features a lot of the same stuff as the first game, it also introduces factions, districts, and the ability to create smaller cities. These new features can help or hinder you, depending on how successful your city is and how many supplies you have.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It also features a <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-to-have-mod-support-on-launch/">modding tool</a> so that players can experiment and add extra features to their game from the start. Compared to the first game, the sequel was built in Unreal Engine, meaning the process for adding mods to the game was totally different, and made it much easier to be able to implement a system like that. The modding tool is called FrostKit and will allow players to create their own custom maps and custom models and create custom scenarios as needed. Having the modding tool will allow players to create thematic cities. This means players can create a Lovecraftian or Cosmic city if they want to, depending on what assets they use.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Private Division and developer&nbsp;Wētā Workshop have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>release date, and the cozy hobbit game, which will let you live an idyllic life far from the likes of Ring-wraiths and Balrogs, is launching in spring.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the two studios revealed a&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>delay; the game was originally intended to launch this fall, but it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-the-shire-delayed">pushed back to early 2025</a> owing to a need for additional development time.</p>
<p>Now, however, it's <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1837932214920634512" rel="noopener" target="_blank">been revealed</a> that&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC and consoles on March 25th next year. It won't be an Early Access game, either, so you'll be getting the full cozy hobbit life sim experience when it arrives.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-release-date-hobbit-home.jpg?itok=_zH96Ylo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-release-date-hobbit-home.jpg?itok=dVvwKdVH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is officially launching in March.</figcaption></figure><p>To commemorate the release date announcement, Private Division and Wētā Workshop revealed a new trailer in which the studios describe the game as a "<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>gaming experience like nothing that's come before".</p>
<p>The devs say that "every aspect" of&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>"has been carefully crafted", and that "each bridge, path, plant, hobbit home, and second breakfast is drawn from the original vision", referring to&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>author J.R.R. Tolkien.</p>
<p>Wētā Workshop says it's a game about "fellowship, community, and comfort", but that "most importantly, it's a game about living as a hobbit". If you've ever wanted to shirk the call to adventure and settle down in a cozy hobbit village, this one's for you.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>release date announcement trailer, which also features some small snippets of gameplay, right here.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cyberpunk-2077s-most-complicated-boss-was-built-concept-to-controller</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-cyberpunk-2077%E2%80%99s-most-complicated-boss-was-built-concept-to-controller.988959/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cyberpunk-2077s-most-complicated-boss-was-built-concept-to-controller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you’ve played Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, you’ll no doubt remember the Chimera. It’s a hulking, spider-like tank that chases you relentlessly, destroying every piece of the building around you before trapping you in a one-on-one battle. It's the biggest boss fight in the whole game, and was a monumentally complex sequence for developer CD Projekt Red to create. </p><p>So, how was this intricate multistage mission put together? We spoke to multiple developers from across several different departments to find out what the joys and complications were. This is how Phantom Liberty’s Chimera encounter was built, from concept to controller.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/awakening-1726849466079.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The thoroughly elaborate design process for the Chimera started with the most simple of propositions: a big boss battle with a big boss tank. Filippo Ubertino, Cyberpunk’s Senior Concept Designer explains:</p><p>“I had a very small brief and it was something like this: we want to do a boss fight that will be a spider tank. Internally, we always refer to it as a spider tank, but in fact it's not a spider because it has six legs, so it's not really a spider and it's not actually a tank because it doesn't have a crew. So Chimera fits better.</p><p>In the beginning, we didn't have this claustrophobic environment in mind. So we also thought about maybe we could have this tank jumping around, but we decided that we wanted something heavier, something scary in a sense, not like a toy jumping around.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/hologram-spidertank-chandelier-room-20230112-1726849529872.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>That desire for heft and weight informed the complete look of the Chimera. It almost evokes kaiju-like monsters, further playing into the metaphor of it destroying the model of Night City’s Dogtown district at the centre of its museum home. It was built to impose itself on both the tight confines of its surroundings and the player, who is tiny by comparison, something Paweł Mielniczuk, Art Director at CDPR, expands upon:</p><p>“We thought that it would be perfect [to create] this kind of man versus machine, David versus  Goliath moment where we have to, as a single person, fight with something so massive and elaborate and powerful. There were a lot of iterations on even an accomplished model. Changing something, replacing things. Adding range, the capability of rotating faster, moving faster, et cetera. Adding grenade launchers. Eventually also adding the drone compartments, which were not part of the original design, but were needed to add an additional phase of combat in the third stage of the boss fight.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/spider-tank-blue-print-wip11final-1-1726850576357.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We didn't have a perfect gameplay idea at the beginning,” Ubertino reveals. “So we started with [lots of different ideas;] many legs, high legs, something smaller, something bigger. And when one of those sketches was chosen, we were like, ‘Okay, now we need to block it out.’ So we have very rough 3D models so [the gameplay team] can test it in the level. That one was a little bit more similar to the final one. I tried to keep the shape as similar to that block out, even when I started adding details in 3D and making it more believable, more like a real tank.”</p><p>But despite being neither a spider nor a tank in the end, the eagle-eyed among you will be able to spot some aspects of the original design that remain to this day. Something that Ubertino found the perfect way to repurpose.</p><p>“If you look at the rear section, there's quite a big door. At the beginning we didn't know that we were not going to use a crew, so that door was supposed to be the opening for the crew. But we ended up [making the Chimera] a huge drone essentially, and the door is still there.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - Chimera Work in Progress Designs</h3></div></output><p>Being an automated machine rather than a crewed vehicle allows the Chimera to move in a more animalistic way. Unhindered by the limitations of humanity, its motions are free to be animated in a way that better reflects its natural world influences, as explained by Cinematic Animation Acting Lead David Cordero Iglesias:</p><p>“We were mostly relying on scorpions, beetles, things that have six legs, because it's very important to pick up the balance on how he's moving, the volume motion that the Chimera showed through the entire sequence.”</p><p>Contributing to that animalistic-yet-mechanical feel is the fact that the Chimera is possessed by a rogue AI from beyond the Blackwall. This ‘cyberspace hell’ and the corruption it inflicts is at the core of Phantom Liberty’s storyline – and would also need to be conveyed in the way the metal monster would be heard. As such, noises were engineered to sound like nothing else – an amalgamation of natural, digital, and demonic worlds. It needed to sound like an overwhelming force eating away at whatever it came into contact with, be that the hulking Chimera or the new central character, Songbird – it’s an audio hellscape she, nor the player, can escape.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/tank-sound-1726849720036.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We wanted the Chimera to sound mechanical but not fully robotic”, states Lead Sound Designer Krzysztof Popiel.  “We wanted it to be something alive, and robotic growls help a lot with this. As the sequence progresses, the vocalisation of the Chimera changes to almost demonic Blackwall sounds.”</p><p>It’s a sentiment echoed by Michał Pukała, Senior Sound Designer: “I think the coolest and the most interesting thing about Blackwall is that it wasn't supposed to be futuristic. The descriptors I got from both the narrative director and the lead cinematic designers, they were talking about shamanistic sounds, cyber monsters. Essentially you would need to create sounds of cyber hell.”</p><p>Further inspirations for the sound of the Blackwall came from other, non-audio departments working on the sequence. This collaboration was made possible thanks to a completely new organisational system, implemented by CD Projekt Red after the release of Cyberpunk 2077. The Spider and the Fly, the mission in which the Chimera appears, was a big test subject for this new way of working. Members of every design department needed to be in constant conversation with one another to ensure that the visual design and animation all worked in concert with the sequence’s gameplay goals.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This sequence is one of the biggest achievements we did in terms of blending gameplay with cinematics.</p></div><p>“It was a bit tricky from our side because it was the first time in the company that we were divided into what is called content teams”, Iglesias recalls. “It's like a multidisciplinary team based on every discipline that we want to create this sequence. So everyone participated in the design with their own ideas. We have environment artists, we have animators, we have designers, we have gameplay, we have level design, so everything together to create the best approach to this. It was a very, very, very intricate process.</p><p>We needed to have this heaviness, this weight, tons of steel chasing you. But at the same time, later we have a boss fight. So we have to balance it out with gameplay that has other requirements, right? Because this sequence, for me, is one of the biggest achievements we did in terms of blending gameplay with cinematics. We tried all the time to mix those two in several intensities during the whole sequence.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/balcony-sweep-1726850035140.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Blending gameplay with cinematics is something that Cyberpunk 2077 does elegantly. CDPR aims to never fully take control away from the player, even when a scripted scene is playing out in front of them. The Chimera sequence is a finely tuned set piece that demanded a tight relationship between the gameplay and cinematics staff. Managing the balance was a task that largely lay in the hands of Cinematic Designer Michał Zbrzeźniak:</p><p>“When the tank is rising up for the first time in this room and he's shooting at you in the middle of his animation, that makes him go to gameplay. So normally you would have a cut, a fade out and fade in, or maybe something will glitch at the transition from gameplay to scene. And in Cyberpunk, especially in this sequence, we always strived to make it invisible.</p><p> So actually almost the whole sequence, except for maybe just the fight itself, is actually a cinematic sequence. There are dialogues being played by the characters. There are even contextual animations played on V where she's covering her face from the missiles. But the soldiers that are on the balconies actually have gameplay behaviour. But we did it in a way [where] the turret’s swipe is so meticulous that they will die anyway. So it's kind of a risky mix, but it worked out in the end.”</p><p>From here, the mission transports you from the wide open museum space to a tight corridor, made even more claustrophobic by the presence of the Chimera hunting you down. It’s a chase sequence built on the principle of knowing when to pick your battles. The tank is too powerful to take down by yourself, and if you try, you’ll learn that the hard way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/the-chase-1726850067335.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We kind of try to make sure that it's impossible to fight with it”, Iglesias explains. “There are several fail states that we create along the whole sequence, but I will say 90% of the players run away the first time because it's too scary. </p><p>It was a bit of a challenge to put this gigantic beast inside the corridor because it's pretty difficult to make him move anywhere. So we decided that he's destroying everything on his path [as he chases you]. It was the best way to create this horror feeling. [It’s] funny because I animated everything with the Chimera moving forward and destroying everything on his path, and probably 99% of the players don’t look [backward], which is kind of sad for me.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/chase-running-1726850102476.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Running forwards may be a simple enough task for the player, but was far more complex a conundrum for Zbrzeźniak and the cinematics team to solve: </p><p>“So the chase part was a challenge in that regard. We had to align the speed of the tank, which wasn't an easy task to do because it was completely animation-driven. So any change in his movement would require some animation tweaks. [We also had to] align that with how fast the player can go, because the player can be a bit faster or a bit slower [depending on their character build], and for every type of build it still needs to work and it still needs to feel like he's right on your toes. But he can never catch you if you are actively running from him.</p><p>One of the goals in the sequence for us was to foreshadow as much of the stuff the tank is doing as possible. For example, you shouldn't be close to it. Being close to it means death. He has a turret that is deadly, he has a laser swipe that is also deadly. So then when you actually fight him, you know what a given attack is because we showed it already through the sequence that precedes it.”</p><p>Before the big fight, though, comes a long fall. A floor-shattering descent through concrete and metal, this incredibly complicated transition scene posed some of the biggest technical challenges of the whole sequence.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/the-fall-1726850128269.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“That fall was kind of my own personal baby, actually”, states Iglesias. “I wanted to create a bigger action sequence instead of just falling. So I took some inspiration actually from some other places. For example, the Uncharted 4 clock tower sequence. You are trying to grab onto everything you find for your life, right? We have these cables, you are on top of the tank again, and you have to jump out [and grab them]. </p><p>At the same time, to give this scale, I had another inspiration that I like a lot: Gandalf falling with the Balrog from the Bridge of Khazad-dûm [in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]. So it's this massive fall, but you are still fighting and you have this behemoth by your side that you are watching fall with you. In the end, trying to achieve this result of an insane action sequence was very, very difficult from an animation point of view.</p><p>What we did is we had an incredible [motion capture] stunt team that we recorded for several days and we divided it into several clips. So you have your fallings – everything is recorded actually in motion capture, which looks insane  – but everything is recorded from the ground level. Of course, we're not throwing anyone three floors down. Later we have to cut and clip everything, cut and paste every single bit, so it makes sense. </p><p>It was incredible to work with that, but it was kind of a gigantic puzzle to build all these animation clips while at the same time having this Chimera keyframe animated on top of it and trying to sync everything. This was a very close collaboration with cinematic designers to try and nail that timing together with this insane action sequence.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/fall-stunts-1726850169689.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“For the longest time we couldn't really make it work”, Zbrzeźniak adds. “We needed to be like, ‘This will work eventually, please trust us, we will make it happen’. But there were some tricks that we had to do there. For example, when V is falling down through the air, when you actually would fall [in real life], you would fall much faster. But we had to kind of fake it a bit to achieve a better effect and to also make it readable because in sequences, especially first-person ones, everything that you see is dictated by your perceivable angle of vision. And so we really had to be careful on what we present [to ensure that]the player even understands what's happening in that sequence. Achieving that wasn't an easy task and it went through many, many iterations.”</p><p>What looks like a simple fall actually turned out to be the most complicated part of the sequence for the cinematics team. Ensuring that the most scripted of events looks reactive is an art they put a lot of time and effort into perfecting.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We try to never take full control from the player for too long. It's kind of like a rule, like a philosophy of ours.</p></div><p>“Nothing there is procedural”, Zbrzeźniak continues. “Everything needed to be directed by us and put in a very specific, deliberate place. [We had to make sure that the] destruction that is happening [occurs] at the very precise moment when you're falling through that concrete floor. The smoke needed to go off at the very precise, specific moment. The pieces of debris needed to clear out for you to be able to see where you're falling. And it needed to be clear that you fall down on the tank and roll off from it. So putting this specific part of the sequence [together] was certainly the most challenging, but also the most fun.”</p><p>While this sequence delivers cinematic spectacle in spades, Cyberpunk is a video game, not a movie. As such it’s important that there are still flashes of interactivity through the most scripted of scenes. Not paying attention? Deadly quicktime events will make you pay the price. Zbrzeźniak explains how:</p><p>“We try to never take full control from the player for too long. It's kind of like a rule, like a philosophy of ours. There cannot be  [non-interactive] scenes that are too long, basically. And so on top of it being already difficult and containing multiple elements to piece together to work in perfect sync, we also made it so that you can get hit by the turret if you don't react quickly. If you don't manage to grab the cables, you will bounce off them. And if you don't dodge the spider tanks leg, you’ll get crushed by it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/fall-fails-1726850293543.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We wanted to kind of test the streamers a bit. Sometimes during the scenes they just tend to look at the chat, maybe not pay full attention to what's happening on the screen. And in this case, and actually we witnessed it several times, they just died in the middle of the scene because they weren't paying attention. That's exactly what I'm talking about when we talk about scenes in Cyberpunk. You can never really look away. You can never put down your gamepad and just witness the events.”</p><p>The biggest challenge for the player was yet to come, however. After landing, the briefest of respites is granted so that you may gain a bearing of your surroundings. Savour those few seconds, though, because it’s the calm before the biggest storm Cyberpunk has to offer.  What was previously seemingly indestructible is now weakened, but that doesn’t mean it won’t put up one hell of a boss fight.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/the-battle-1726850352594.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The fight itself tasks you with taking on the Chimera and its many, many different weapons. It’s here that the design of the tank and the design of the gameplay scenario all comes full circle, with gameplay influencing visual design and vice versa. It’s something that influenced Mielniczuk and the art team's ever-evolving iterations:</p><p>“In the early pre-production of Phantom Liberty, the combat was supposed to happen on the street level. So we were thinking about ranged combat, larger distances, a big arena. Eventually, in the process of designing the expansion, we decided that it would be all held inside the buildings and, eventually, in the abandoned metro station.</p><p>When we ended up with the design of enclosing the whole arena in the interiors, it completely changed the game. So we needed to adjust a few things, but there was a constant negotiation with the gameplay team. In the beginning, I remembered they wanted to have a really fast and agile robot that runs over the ceiling and the walls, and it's all over the place. We wanted to have something super heavy, static, slow, inspired by Ghost in the Shell. So finding the compromise, it took us quite a time, but we found it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - Chimera Encounter Early Storyboards</h3></div></output><p>The arena’s not too big, not too small. Also, the device itself, which is designed to fight on the medium and long range, now has to deal with us, the small opponent, which is walking, running around their feet.” </p><p>Through player testing it was discovered that further tweaks to the tank’s design would need to be made. “There are many weapons on that tank and some of them were added very late,” recalls Ubertino. “For example, we found out that being in the middle of the level, if the character goes too close to it, you can keep shooting [with minimal danger]. So we added this [sweeping] beam just to make the player go far away from it.”</p><p>For the sound of the laser, Popiel and the sound team conveniently had the perfect reference point. “We had this case of the laser weaponry in the base game, when you were fighting in Royce's boss fight, and he was using this laser weapon that can sweep the environment. So with the Chimera, we wanted to do it x10. So basically what we went for here is this constant feeling of the threat, but also it needed to give the player information that the laser gun is winding up to give them a chance to hide behind cover and avoid the damage.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - Chimera Laser and Turret Alternative Designs</h3></div></output><p>It wasn’t just the Chimera’s weapons that needed to be tweaked over time, though. Its armour also needed redesigning. Ubertino continues:</p><p>“Once we had a blockout, I knew that we needed armour, so I started designing the armour and what's underneath the armour and which places we wanted to be destroyed. We also worked with weak spots and we wanted to reveal them in a sense. We used the Kiroshi eyes [cybernetic ability] to reveal them, so you just need to scan and you see them. So I didn't really need to make them yellow or too obvious. It would also be kind of stupid for a weapon to show his weak spots. So using the Kiroshi eyes, it's a fantastic solution.”</p><p>It’s another great example of gameplay and art design working in tandem, and it and other similar combinations all build to the fight’s grand finale. After exploiting the Chimera’s weak spots and disabling it in spectacular fashion, it’s time to deal the killing blow. That finisher, involving the tank’s beating mechanical heart, is the perfect example of every department of the content team coming together.</p><p>“This whole boss fight is this story arc of the tank first being indestructible, impossible to defeat. And we wanted this feeling to slowly, over the course of the sequence, to shift and make you as a player feel more and more empowered”, Zbrzeźniak explains. “Finally the finisher, we wanted to do this kind of exclamation point after the boss fight to really make the tank go out with a bang. We assumed that you're going to be struggling with this guy for quite a long time, and we wanted you to really feel good when you finally destroy it.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/tank-heart-1726850471326.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“So we have this Chimera core that resembles a heart,” says Iglesias, “and that was kind of a conversation internally because we said, ‘What looks cooler than having heart beating, heart of your enemy in your hand before you finish them off?’ Later it was super cool because with this multidisciplinary content team, we managed to even make it a piece of loot so later you can craft something out of it. So it is just a very cool ending for it.”</p><p>“The gameplay guys [told] me kind of late in the production that they wanted something to be used by the player, and I was kind of lucky in that case because I had just the spot for it”, Ubertino recalls. “So yeah, I got lucky there. There's a cylinder in the top with a hatch that you can open, take the heart, toss it, and destroy it.”</p><p>“We wanted the heart to sound consistent with the Chimera’s approach to sound design, where it needs to sound organic and mechanical at the same time”, adds Popiel. “I think there's a really cool thing when you just open the hatch and you can actually start hearing the heart beating and then once you grab it and rip it off, you can hear it's basically dying.” </p><p>Teamwork, does, in fact, make the dream work. But, in a level full of towering machines, crumbling architecture, and complex scripting, you’d perhaps expect something explosive to be the biggest challenge the team faced. Well, turns out it’s actually all in the much smaller details, Zbrzeźniak tells us: </p><p>“The small thing actually was to make Myers' rifle be attached to her back when it was necessary. You' will not believe how many issues we had with this one. Sometimes the rifle was going directly through her head. This was probably the biggest issue for us in this entire sequence, the small rifle from Myers.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/myers-gun-1726850427701.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you look at our game, there's never a situation where characters put guns on their back. It just doesn't happen. But she has a rifle, and since this is a main story [quest], we didn't want to create this artificiality where the rifle is just disappearing when she's putting it away. So we had to come up with a method of her putting the rifle on her back and then taking it out again seamlessly. We had it easier at the beginning because Myers had a pistol, not a rifle, so it was simple. She would just hide it in her pants and that's it, end of story. But no, it was decided that she needs to have a rifle, and the rifle then needs to be a reward for the player. And it created a bit of a complication for us. But it was all fun and games.”</p><p>All fun and games, and months and months of hard work. The Chimera encounter is one of the standout moments of Cyberpunk 2077, a complicated beast at the heart of the Phantom Liberty expansion that wouldn’t have come together without all of the different disciplines at CD Projekt Red combining forces tightly. It’s a mission with as much heart put in as is taken out of its central beast, and as cool as the metal panels that shield it.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy might get himself a pair of mantis blades for Christmas.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-developer-bullet-noir<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem&nbsp;</em>developer Wolcen Studio has announced&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir</em>, a gritty and stylish top-down shooter that looks to blend&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami</em>. It's scheduled to land in Early Access later this year.</p>
<p>Like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/hotline-miami-5th-anniversary-retrospective"><em>Hotline Miami</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir&nbsp;</em>will let you choose your approach; you can either break doors down and go in all guns blazing, or you can adopt a more methodical and stealthy approach to maps instead.</p>
<p>Of course, in&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami</em>, the stealthy approach very often gave way to bullet hell carnage (for me, at least), so it'll be interesting to see whether&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir&nbsp;</em>can pull off this mixture of approaches and make both of them feel rewarding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bullet-noir-wolcen-dev-gameplay.jpg?itok=zsHJ-NgU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bullet-noir-wolcen-dev-gameplay.jpg?itok=bx3hCY_q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bullet Noir&nbsp;</em>has more than a shade of&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami&nbsp;</em>about it.</figcaption></figure><p>Wolcen Studio is also promising a "rich, story-driven experience" in&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir</em>, one that tells the interconnected stories of four distinct protagonists.</p>
<p>As you play, you'll discover how each character's story dovetails with the main plot, and you'll also navigate each protagonist's "personal journey", so there'll be plenty of narrative meat to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>According to Wolcen Studio, each of the game's characters will also have unique abilities you'll be able to use to take on combat challenges "in creative ways". Each chapter focuses on a different character, too, so you'll get a chance to try out each one.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir</em>, which gives a sense of what the stylish art will look like in motion, right here.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of games like the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami</em>, as well as adjacent titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/otxo-review"><em>Otxo</em></a>, you'll probably find lots to like in&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir</em>.</p>
<p>You'll get the chance to discover whether that's the case or not when&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir&nbsp;</em>lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3204960/Bullet_Noir/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on November 4th.

It’s a dark, atmospheric game set in a procession of ruined streets and abandoned buildings, where your flashlight is often the only source of illumination.<br></p><p>If you like exploring old buildings and abandoned neighborhoods, interspersed with the occasional puzzle or zombie brawl, you’re set for <em>Hollowbody</em>.</p><h2 id="h316047"><a id=""></a><strong>What Should I Know About <em>Hollowbody </em>Before I Start?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="33c724f96fba0b1ef841bc941caef1df" data-recommend-id="image://33c724f96fba0b1ef841bc941caef1df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hollowbody fighting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hollowbody fighting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Headware Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33c724f96fba0b1ef841bc941caef1df" data-recommend-id="image://33c724f96fba0b1ef841bc941caef1df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hollowbody fighting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First off: <em>Hollowbody</em>’s resources are more scarce than those of the <em>Silent Hill </em>games that inspired it. If you aren’t careful, it’s easy to run yourself out of ammunition right around the same time that some tougher enemies start showing up. But worry not, you’ve got access to some good melee weapons, such as a spiked bat and an improvised ax, but they don’t work equally well on everything you’ll encounter.<br></p><p>So go into <em>Hollowbody</em> with an eye toward conserving your health and ammo, the same way you would in a <em>Resident Evil </em>game. Don’t get into any fights if you don’t have to, and when you do need to take out an enemy, try to use your bat or ax whenever possible.<br></p><p>Second: if you’re a serious arachnophobe, steer clear of this one. Trust us.</p><p>One final thing that I wish I’d known before I started: you don’t hit a real point of no return in <em>Hollowbody </em>until right near its end. You’ll probably know it when you see it.<br></p><p>Before then, you can backtrack all the way to Mica’s starting point, although it takes a while and you might have to dodge a few new enemies. There are a couple of big secrets and one useful weapon that can only be secured by returning to the first area with some of the later key items.</p><h2 id="h316048"><a id=""></a><strong>How Long Is <em>Hollowbody</em>?</strong></h2><p>My first blind run on Intended (normal) difficulty took about six-and-a-half hours. At the time of writing, you can’t skip all the way through cinematics, so <em>Hollowbody </em>isn’t very speedrun-friendly.<br></p><p>Once you know the routes and puzzle solutions, you could probably clear<em> Hollowbody </em>in well under three hours, especially if you skipped as many fights as possible. In order to unlock 100 percent of its achievements, you’ll need to run through it at least three times, one of which has to be on its hardest difficulty.</p><h2 id="h316049"><a id=""></a><strong>How Many Endings Does <em>Hollowbody </em>have?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="96bf0447504c2d7e73908164da16f75e" data-recommend-id="image://96bf0447504c2d7e73908164da16f75e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man stands on the ledge of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man stands on the ledge of a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Headware Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="96bf0447504c2d7e73908164da16f75e" data-recommend-id="image://96bf0447504c2d7e73908164da16f75e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man stands on the ledge of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On a fresh save, you can get one of two endings.

Facing an existential malaise, Belova takes a job that ends up entangling her and a bunch of other washed-up Cold War operators like Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) with a CIA run by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Lots of punching, shooting, and car chases ensue, as well as a stripped-down remix of The Pixies’ “Where Is My Mind?”</p><p>Take a look:</p><p>Pugh and Harbour’s on-screen charisma and father-daughter dynamic helps give the <em>Thunderbolts</em> trailer the feel of something beyond just another pit-stop on the never-ending MCU content roadmap. Louis-Dreyfus, putting a more sinister spin on her “WTF” smile and laugh from HBO’s <em>Veep,</em> is also putting in work. It helps that at least some of the big scenes in the trailer look like they were filmed in the actual real world instead of against a green screen, or at the very least with all of the principle actors actually in the same room together. </p><p><em>Thunderbolts</em>, which releases in May 2025, is part of a one-two punch with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-trailer-red-hulk-1851589562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-trailer-red-hulk-1851589562"><em>Captain America: Brave New World</em></a></span>, which premiers months earlier on February 14. Harrison Ford plays President Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross in that movie, complete with a Red Hulk transformation. It’s unclear if he’ll also be reprising that role in<em> Thunderbolts</em>, but it could be one of a number of interesting tie-ins between the two blockbusters. I’m sure, though, that really dedicated fans will also be retracing all of the steps leading up to <em>Thunderbolts </em>that Marvel has been laying out in its Disney+ streaming shows. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rocksteady Studios could be returning to the Batman franchise in a more traditional sense. </p>



<p>According to Shpeshal Nick of Xbox Era, he understands that Rocksteady is, in fact, working on a new Batman game. On top of that, he think’s Sony is trying to make a play for exclusivity in some way.</p>



<p>“Not sure which studio people’s dreams is, but I heard Rocksteady are back making it,” he <a href="https://x.com/shpeshal_nick/status/1838116987236655458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a response</a> to a Tweet asking for fans’ dream developers on the next Batman game. “I also think Sony are trying to moneyhat it lol.”</p>



<p>No other information about what a new Batman game from Rocksteady would entail. The main question is would it be similar to the Batman games of the past — a single-player game — or would they go the live-service route due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-live-service/">parent company Warner Bros. Games being determined</a> to keep making them?</p>



<p>Rocksteady hasn’t worked on a true Batman game since 2015’s Batman: Arkham Knight wrapped up the original Arkham trilogy. Since then they worked on the mixed Arkham VR for PC and PS4 in 2016 and 2023’s disappointing Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>



<p>It’s important to keep in mind that Insider Gaming has yet to independently verify this information. Nor has anything been officially confirmed by Warner Bros. Games or Rocksteady themselves. That said, if they are working on a new Batman game, it’s still likely years away from any sort of release.</p>

            <p>The mass exodus of staff from hit indie game company Annapurna earlier this month has been described as "a baffler" by a company spokesperson.</p>
<p>The publisher - responsible for the likes of Stray, Outer Wilds, and Cocoon - saw its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">entire staff quit  following a dispute with the company's owner</a> that's put its future in jeopardy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">Developers working on projects with Annapurna have since reassured players they will still be able to play planned future releases</a>, but it remains unclear how the dispute can be resolved or how Annapurna will continue with its projects. It is, however, openly hiring to replace staff.</p>

<p>"The whole situation is a baffler, but now we're focused on moving forward," reads a statement from an Annapurna spokesperson to IGN.</p>
<p>"We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership. If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. P.S. We're hiring."</p>
<p>One project left in a precarious position is Annapurna's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> 2033: Labyrinth, its first in-house game. Game director Chelsea Hash appears to have left the company (per <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saveremreve/">LinkedIn</a>) and, IGN understands, all other full-time members of the development team are out. Annapurna told IGN development on the project will continue despite these departures.</p>
<p>So what exactly happened to cause all staff to leave at once?</p>
<p>As per a lengthy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation">new report from IGN</a>, upheaval began in mid-March 2024 when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> co-founder James Masi was suddenly and unexpectedly let go. Annapurna president Nathan Gary also left the company, which Annapurna claimed was voluntary. However, sources told IGN both execs had been fired, sparking fury among staff - some even left in protest.</p>
<p>When Annapurna founder Megan Ellison allegedly expressed to staff the desire for all staff to stay, Masi, Gary and other staff returned and a new plan was formed: to form a new company called Verset with split ownership between Annapurna and Verset's leaders. However, staff eventually became sceptical of the plan owing to the return of Hector Sanchez (who previously left the company) to work on gaming projects without their knowledge.</p>
<p>This led to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">deal between Remedy and Annapurna Pictures</a> for the film and TV rights to Control and Alan Wake, reportedly without the knowledge of staff. Ellison's intent for the two companies, a spokesperson told IGN, was for Verset to deal with indie games and Sanchez to lead on AAA and transmedia projects. Sources also told IGN Ellison herself began to exercise greater control over Annapurna Interactive in a way they found uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The situation ultimately reached a head in August when all 25 Annapurna Interactive staff signed a joint resignation letter and provided two weeks' notice before leaving on 6th September. Reportedly, partner developers did not learn about this mass departure until a day or two before, seemingly due to a dispute over whose responsibility this was.</p>
<p>While the staff who left could potentially be continuing the Verset company (as per a <a href="https://verset.com/">website currently online</a>), Annapurna has been left scrambling to replenish its workforce.</p>
<p>Annapurna's future projects include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-artful-escape-developers-next-is-teen-drama-mixtape">Mixtape</a> from Beethoven and Dinosaur, Wanderstop from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> creator Davey Wreden, and No Code's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rumor-resident-evil-9-reportedly-launching-in-second-half-of-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a reputable insider, Resident Evil 9 could be announced soon, with a release date set for the second half of 2025. Many rumors have already been circulating throughout 2024, with rumors surrounding the game's starring characters, protagonist, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-is-official-director-it-was-difficult-to-figure-out-what-to-do-after-7-but-i-found-it-and-it-is-substantial/">other ambitions</a> popping up every so often. It was rumored that Resident Evil 9's reveal was going to happen this summer, but the plan was postponed at the last minute.</p>
<p>Lunatic Ignus is a reputable industry insider and has claimed in their Discord channel that the teaser for Resident Evil 9 will be coming in the following weeks or months. While this doesn't sound like much information at all to many people, and this rumor is quite vague in the grand scheme of things, Ignus also said that Resident Evil 9 can be expected to be released in the second half of 2025. This comes after a previous rumor said that Resident Evil 9's release has been delayed to late 2025, which adds more fuel to the rumor fire.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are a couple of major events coming up in the next couple of months that could all be possible times for Resident Evil 9 to be announced. The rumored PlayStation State of Play will be held on September 24, followed by the Tokyo Game Show 2024 on September 26. On December 12, the Game Awards will be held, which is often home to some major release announcements.</p>
<p>The announcement window would be consistent with previous release patterns for Capcom, as they have consistently announced the games a year in advance. The insider didn't give any details on where and when Resident Evil 9 would be revealed, so it's completely up in the air now. However, <a href="https://tgs.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2024/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokyo Game Show 2024</a> and The Game Awards are both likely candidates, as Capcom is an exhibitor at Tokyo Game Show this year. Of course, we won't be able to know until the announcement comes.</p>
<p>However, if a State of Play is coming, it is also possible that it'll be announced there, as Capcom and PlayStation have a strong business relationship. Resident Evil Village was announced during PlayStation's Future of Gaming event in 2020, with the Resident Evil 4 remake being announced during a 2022 State of Play. If the State of Play is confirmed to be happening in the coming days, it is very possible that fans will see Resident Evil 9 announced at the State of Play.</p>

The PS1-style makeover of the all-digital PS5 slim model will seemingly cost $500 (it’s normally $450), while just the PS1-style DualSense controller alone will cost $80 (it’s normally $75 following a recent price hike). </p><p>That’s not terrible for the PS5 slim bundle. While the all-digital PS5 started at $400 when it launched back in 2020, Sony raised the price of the slim model to $450 when it was released last year. So what is that extra $50 getting you? In addition to the PS1-themed console, the bundle also comes with the matching DualSense, a PlayStation controller-style cable connector, PlayStation shape cable ties, a limited-edition poster, and a 30th anniversary sticker and paper clip (yes, there’s really a paper clip shaped like a PlayStation logo in the bundle). </p><p>The PS1-style DualSense controller, meanwhile, is the same price as the recent limited-edition <em>Astro Bot </em>and <em>Concord </em>(RIP) controllers. Only $5 more for the classic look seems like a good deal. We’ll see if the rest of the stuff in the collection feels as competitively priced. The PS5 Pro, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-build-pc-graphics-card-price-digital-foundry-1851648164&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-build-pc-graphics-card-price-digital-foundry-1851648164">which is already asking a lot at $700</a></span>, seems likely to be at least $750-$800 for the anniversary version, not even including a proper vertical stand or disc drive. I’m also curious to see how much the special edition PS Portal is. </p><p>We’ll no doubt get a better idea later this week ahead of pre-orders going live on September 26. Whether anyone is actually able to get what they want once that online rush kicks off is another question entirely. The PS5 Pro bundle is limited to less than 13,000 units. I’m sure they’ll all be resold on eBay. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Viewers of the original Gladiator may recall that there was some question about the paternity of Lucius Verus (Spencer Treat Clark), because it was made very clear that his mother, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), was the former lover of the first film's hero, Maximus (Russell Crowe). But in the new trailer for Gladiator 2, the older Lucius Verus (Paul Mescal) finally learns the truth. He is the son of Maximus, and he's following in his father's footsteps.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts0N8swyWFI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ts0N8swyWFI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the years between the first movie and the sequel, Lucius turned his back on Rome and became a warrior in his own right. He also started his own family and lived peacefully until General Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) conquered his lands and sent Lucius back to Rome as a slave. Like his father before him, Lucius will have to work his way up the gladiatorial ranks if he ever wants to get his revenge.</p><p>Geta (Joseph Quinn) and Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) are the co-Emperors of Rome, and Lucius isn't their only enemy. A former slave named Macrinus (Denzel Washington) has his own plans to take down the emperors, with the reluctant help of Lucius and his fellow gladiators. Their endgames may partially align, but Lucius makes it clear that he has no love for Macrinus either. The new poster for the film has also been released, and it hints that Lucius' final battle may be with Marcus in the arena.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4371128-gladiator2poster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371128" data-ratio="1.4815384615385" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4371128-gladiator2poster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371128"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4371128-gladiator2poster.jpg"></figure><p>Gladiator director Ridley Scott returned to helm the sequel, which was written by David Scarpa.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Essential Tips For Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</p>

<p>"When you have a big hit and you have that internet kind of popularity, there's more passion and there's more responsibility for the quality that you do. And you look at yourself through a different lens. And sometimes that success lens can be a little dangerous because then you get so paranoid about making sure everything is great that you overstress about things," he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "But it's that success lens that really drives amazing games into the future. So I do believe that through the success lens that we have, we will just make far better products in the future."</p><p>Space Marine 2 had more than 2 million players at launch and became the most-played Warhammer game of all time on Steam. Willits has also said it's the fastest-selling game he's ever worked on, stretching back to the numerous Doom, Wolfenstein, and Quake games he was part of at id Software over his two decades at the company.</p><p>Willits also revealed that the budget for Space Marine 2 was less than half of what Doom Eternal cost to make, though he did not divulge specific figures.</p><p>Space Marine 2's big success means its developers can now "dream bigger," Willits said, and this includes the possibility of story DLC for the game and Space Marine 3.</p><p>"Our game director Dmitry Grigorenko, he has proposed some story ideas that could either be DLC or a sequel," Willits said. "We're literally just catching our breath. This is two weeks out. We just need to get the dust to settle. But I can confidently say that we will not disappoint our Warhammer fans in the future. It's too big of a success! I know that's an obvious thing to say, but hopefully we'll be working on Space Marine content for a long time."</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 review</a>, we called Saber's sequel "a more than worthy successor to the 2011 original," with "brutally gory action" that "brings the tabletop game to life in all its grimdark splendor."</p>

			<p>There’s a real hustle and bustle to the historical 4X strategy genre right now, and Oxide Games’ Ara: History Untold is another strong contender for the crown that brings more fresh ideas and perspectives to a very familiar setting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ara: History Untold Launch Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iF4gAZnZF4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ara: History Untold tries to put a distinctive spin on how historical events and the rise and fall of various civilisations are depicted in this genre, and one thing I particularly like is how this affects the victory conditions. Everything that you do is in the name of accruing Prestige, and points are handed out for everything, from completing technological research to winning wars, holding onto alliances, simply producing a lot of goods, or pushing for cultural advancement and looking after your people through your governance.</p>


<p>You’ll still progress through historical technological eras in turn, but there’s also an overarching three-act structure as soon as multiple nations reach certain eras – and if you want, you can skip certain research groups in order to skip ahead an era. Each act transition also brings with it a winnowing of the field of competitors, the lower nations being consigned to the history books, their cities turning into ruins in the process.</p>
<p>It helps add some stakes earlier in the game, giving you a hurry up if you see that you’re falling behind after the first hundred turns, and potentially pushing you to min-max down a particular path to earn Prestige. Find yourself lagging behind in the Iron Age, and you might start throwing some armies around in the Antiquities, picking on some other lower-placed nations to scrabble your way back up.</p>


<p>One of the biggest and best ways to get ahead, though, is simply to look after your people and their quality of life. Each city has an individual measure of its citizens’ contentment across five categories, ensuring that you have to keep your city fairly well balanced in terms of what it provides. You’ll have to keep pace with providing a well for your people to give them fresh water, build inns and trading posts to help commerce come through your city and enrich them, add commodities to dwellings so there’s a degree of comfort, and provide certain structures like watchtowers and city walls to give a feeling of security. With all of these at least decently catered to, and keeping up with technological building upgrades, your city will grow naturally, your Prestige points growing alongside.</p>
<p>Ara: History Untold ditches the hexagonal tiles so common to the 4X genre in favour of more organic-looking regions, in the fashion of Total War’s campaign map. In addition to simply giving a baseline batch of resources each turn, each region is subdivided into multiple smaller plots where you can place your Improvements (buildings), each one giving the visual appearance of a city’s sprawl spreading across it, with higgledy-piggledy roads, buildings, and people meandering around, all visible as you select Improvements and the camera zooms in. As you butt up against rival nation borders, it will eventually lead to the world starting to look like a Neo Tokyo-like mega-city with every plot available occupied, but this general art direction and the way it’s presented is really lovely.</p>

<p>You have a similar effect when presented with a narrative decision moment, whether it’s interacting with a small tribe or a diplomatic message, the camera again pulling right into the world. More dramatic are battles, which let you view replays that feel ripped out of TABS as your units just mash into each other.</p>
<p>There’s a great deal of emphasis put on the resource gathering and production lines through your nation, and it just about tip toes along the thin line between complex depth and ease of use. Beyond basic food, materials, wood and gold, you have all manner of items that you will want and need to craft with production buildings. A farm will produce the grain that can head to a granary to craft grain store, or eventually to a mill that can create the flour needed for a bakery, which can produce baked goods that have a greater impact than raw food.</p>
<p>Workshops and their later evolutions are the real backbone to your production pipelines, able to craft all manner of fundamental tools and utility items – metal tools, wheels, rope and more – which are sometimes required for construction or which can be added to buildings to boost their overall output. A lot of goods are also able to pull double duty that can give a city-wide impact for a period of time, whether it’s feasts that boost happiness and growth, books that boost city knowledge, or wine to help them loosen up a bit.</p>

<p>Through all of this, there’s understandably quite a bit of micro-management, though there’s a good few views that put all of your buildings and production into perspective. It takes a while to figure out where everything is and what views work best for you, but you get the hang of things before the second age. Again, it does teeter on being overwhelming, but over time I feel it comes down on the right side of the scale.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that diplomacy is one of Ara: History Untold’s strongest suits. It’s perhaps a little too easy to just get along well with pretty much everyone, quickly fulfilling their requests, no matter how trivial they might sound, and getting a commensurate bump in perceptions. With no real effort of my own on standard difficulty, I was being bombarded with requests for trade, to share research and get a boost to research output, and eventually to form alliances.</p>
<p>Those alliances don’t seem to really be affected by wars, as you can happily ally while in the middle of a regional scuffle, and there’s no real ding to your reputation for being a bit of a scrapper (except for the nations you actually fight with, of course). Of course, being allied can see you dragged into a war, and that led to some really confounding results, admittedly somewhat obscured by sight range. One of the most baffling instances saw an AI-started war where an overwhelmingly strong alliance capitulated to a single, very surrounded nation, and cede both capital cities of my allies. It was difficult to really pin down what happened.</p>

<p>Battles feel similarly abrupt. They will generally unfold over multiple turns, giving you a chance to reinforce with a second army or send long-ranged fire from ships and artillery, but there’s little ceremony to them, outside of the optional battle replays. It would be nice to have an optional battle report pop up at the start of a turn to give you a run down, and foreground it beyond the resource management and jobs list. It would also be nice to be able to redeploy your armies in different configurations as you unlock new formations, and to be able to upgrade units to newer technology.</p>
<p>However, it’s fair to say that war is more of a necessary evil than a go-to tactic –&nbsp;even being able to declare war for anything more than mischief requires shared borders, retaliation, or certain government types. Much more emphasis is put on furthering your culture, crafting the goods you need, spreading your city borders, and constructing landmark wonders.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-working-on-real-time-combat-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the release of the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, modders&nbsp;<span>have been pushing the boundaries of what they can create for the hit game made by Larian Studios. Not only do they have access to the official modding toolkit, but it didn't take people long to access the developer mode of the toolkit, which allows people to make&nbsp;new cutscenes,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new maps,</a></span>&nbsp;and much more.&nbsp;A Baldur's Gate 3 modder named tinybike has started creating a mod that implements real-time battles into the game instead of the turn-based combat that players are used to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Real time combat test (Baldur's Gate 3)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEBW4qIW28c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original Baldur's Gate games included real-time combat, which, if you think of how chaotic the combat in Baldur's Gate 3 can get, it seems like a recipe for chaotic disaster. At the moment, the mod is in very early, experimental stages. The mod doesn't have any sort of pause button yet, which could spell disaster if you're expecting to be able to take a toilet break in the middle of battle.</p>
<p>The modder tinybike has uploaded a video of the real-time combat test in Baldur's Gate 3 so that you see what kind of action you can expect by utilizing the mod whenever it comes out. The video only shows one person being involved in the combat, so it's uncertain whether the mod will allow players to utilize a full team for combat or not.</p>
<p>The modder has mentioned that this mod for Baldur's Gate 3 is still very much a rough draft, as they haven't yet added a pause ability so that you can give your party commands before the chaos ensues. It's set to resemble the combat system from the original Baldur's Gate games. They have also told people in the comments on their video not to try playing the campaign with the mod how it currently is. "I don't think it plays nice with dialogue yet (i.e. you will get butchered in real time while the dialogue is happening)," says tinybike in a comment on the video. They have also said that pausing should be pretty simple, as the mod means that the real-time combat is done "technically out-of-combat", so it should just be as easy as pressing the button to swap to turn-based mode.</p>
<p>The mod is available for <a href="https://github.com/tinybike/Brawl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download at the moment</a>. You can also favorite it to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-is-already-profitable-as-sales-top-350k.988845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher 11 bit studios has announced that the game has recouped its development and marketing costs, which means that after just a few days on sale, it's already profitable.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/frostpunkgame/status/1838181485859246232" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, 11 bit says that in the three days since&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-delayed-september">was released</a>, the game has crossed 350,000 sales, which is pretty impressive for what is essentially a fairly niche title.</p>
<p>The studio goes on to say that the total estimated revenue from the sales&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>has accrued so far "has already covered the costs we spent on producing and marketing the game", so everything that comes in from sales now is profit rather than cost recouping.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-city.jpg?itok=UOnXfFpj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-city.jpg?itok=RkUvm_7e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Your city in&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>might be failing, but the game certainly isn't.</figcaption></figure><p>11 bit says that although it's touched by players' support for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, "the work doesn't stop here". The studio says it's "continuously working on improving" the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>experience with hotfixes and updates, so development is still very much ongoing.</p>
<p>So, what does&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s success mean for the game? Well, it's too early to call just yet, of course, but&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 3&nbsp;</em>seems like it's probably on the cards now, if it wasn't already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, given that 11 bit looks like it'll have some money left over from&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s success, we might very well expect a major DLC expansion or two somewhere down the line, akin to the first game's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-last-autumn-shows-us-days-before-winter">The Last Autumn</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-reveals-on-edge-its-final-expansion"><em>On the Edge</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you might expect, the sequel to the 2018 societal survival sim&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. It takes place 30 years after the first game and has you building a city amidst the advent of petroleum in a post-apocalyptic land blighted by permanent winter.</p>
<p>Just like in the first game, you'll be making very difficult moral and political choices as you navigate your newfound position as leader, but the sequel introduces factions , districts, and other new features that complicate matters.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

Expect some classics, like <em>The Exorcist</em>, the OG <em>Halloween</em>, and <em>The Addams Family</em>, as well as some newer and cult-ier stuff like <em>Jennifer’s Body</em> and <em>Near Dark. </em>Whatever kind of mood you’re in, we’ve got a movie here for you—hell, there’s one for every day in October! You can start early if you want, or wait until the month kicks off and start getting through the list, the choice is yours. Click through for 31 movies to help you celebrate spooky season.</p></div></div><div><p>Before there was <em>Twilight</em>, there was <em>Near Dark</em>. The hard-to-find Kathryn Bigelow film (which only recently cropped up on YouTube, the last time I wanted to watch it I had to wait for it to be available on Criterion) tells the story of small-town farmer Caleb (Adrian Pasdar) who meets a beautiful drifter named Mae (Jenny Wright). The two flirt and fall in love that same night, but just before sunrise, she bites his neck and runs away, turning him into a vampire. Caleb is unwilling to feed, and Mae’s coven of vampires don’t like him one bit—they want him dead, and the most unhinged one in the bunch (played brilliantly by Bill Paxton) poses a threat to Caleb’s entire town.</p><p><em>Near Dark</em> is sexy and gory and intense, a neo-Western meets vampire flick meets Shakespearean romance. Though this is just her second film, Bigelow’s talent in establishing a vibrant, vibey atmosphere and pulling incredible performances out of her actors is apparent—this could be one of Paxton’s best roles, and I absolutely adore the crossover between this film and James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em>. Cameron (Bigelow’s ex-husband) suggested she use his ensemble of actors from the 1986 film in <em>Near Dark</em>, and history was made—the terrifying trio of Paxton, Lance Henriksen, and Jenette Goldstein play off of each other brilliantly and act as a fine, furious foil to the star-crossed lovers.<br></p><p>By the end of <em>Near Dark</em>, you want nothing more than Caleb and Mae to walk out into the sun together, unscathed. They walked so Edward and Bella could run. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>Isolation is one of the most horrifying things a person can experience, and <em>The Shining </em>expertly captures the psychic damage it can cause. Author Stephen King has raked the 1980 adaptation of his novel through the coals over the years, but the public has been much more receptive. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall give career-defining performances that punctuate the Torrance family’s descent into madness, and <em>The Shining</em>’s fingerprints are all over pop culture, as its shocking imagery and absurdist line reads have embedded themselves as staples of the horror genre to be replicated and parodied decades later. Stephen King might not want you to remember the adaptation of his novel, but the film has since overshadowed the source material. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Halloween</em> is the best movie to watch on Halloween. The slow, moody, and atmospheric horror film about Michael Myers returning to his town to kill again barely resembles the slashers and sequels that would follow in its footsteps. Its body count isn’t very high, it’s not super gory, and it doesn’t feature too many over-the-top moments. And yet, it’s still the best slasher ever made and the quintessential Halloween season flick.</p><p>It nails the feeling of Halloween night, even all these decades later. The slow build to Michael’s attack on the town and his intense confrontation with Laurie Strode is the perfect thing to have on in the background while handing out candy to trick-or-treaters. And then, as it gets later and quieter outside, you’ll be able to sit down and finish <em>Halloween</em> and you’ll almost believe that out there, somewhere, is Michael Myers. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Millennials, be honest: how many times have you watched <em>Hocus Pocus</em>? The 1993 film was basically permanently on the Disney Channel during spooky season when I was a kid, so I’d catch snippets of it when I was having my breakfast in the morning, when I got off the school bus in the afternoon, and after a soccer tournament over the weekend. As such, much of this film has been burned into my brain, from Sarah Jessica Parker’s hilarious take on an airhead witch to the adorable Max Dennison (played by Omri Katz) and the entirety of the musical number. </p><p>This is a classic spooky season movie—it’s campy and colorful and set during Halloween (there’s even a costume party). Bette Middler is absolutely brilliant as the head witch, and the child actors expertly hold their own against Hollywood royalty. <em>Hocus Pocus</em> is one of those films you throw on when you’re feeling a bit sick and need a soothing pick-me-up. It will forever remain one of the best spooky season movies of all time. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>When I first saw Ari Aster’s feature-length directorial debut, I thought about it for days. <em>Hereditary</em> is the violent, demonic endgame of what happens when no one ever sorts out their generational trauma. The Graham family are picked off one by one by a chain of events set in motion by their grandmother who was long gone by the opening of the film. <em>Hereditary </em>is known for the grotesque, no-punches-pulled violence to which it subjects its family of four, but the worst of its violence are the acts of psychological torture they deal to one another. Whether it’s a son’s carelessness, a mother’s resentment, or a father’s inaction, the underlying horror of <em>Hereditary </em>isn’t in watching a family be torn apart by outside forces, it’s seeing it be desecrated from the inside with only the slightest push. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Full disclosure, I’m the adult child of an alcoholic, which definitely gave this film a particularly resonant power with me, but you don’t need to bring that baggage to the film for its humanity and horror to grip you. I also haven’t read the novel <em>Doctor Sleep </em>yet, but nonetheless, the film left me astounded by how Stephen King, decades after centering the destructive effects of alcoholism on family patriarch Jack Torrance in <em>The Shining</em>, turns compassionately to his son Danny, now grown and struggling (and, in Mike Flanagan’s wonderful film, played brilliantly by Ewan McGregor). There’s just so much wisdom here, about growth, about forgiveness and healing, about how finding a way to be kind and offer something to others can be what makes life meaningful. </p><p>Oh, and it’s also fun as hell, a story about a classic battle of good and evil, with the evil side represented by a group of soul vampires led by Rebecca Ferguson, and the good side helmed by Abra Stone (Kyleigh Curran), a young Black girl with psychic powers. If you can, watch the Director’s Cut. It makes a good film even better. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>Jordan Peele’s most recent film makes horror <em>grand</em>. It blows the typically intimate genre into a sweeping flick all about spectacles and the virtues we forsake in our pursuit of them. Like <em>Signs</em>, one of its inspirations, <em>Nope </em>conveys much of its horror through sound and brief glimpses, even suggestions, of the capabilities of its main threat, an alien that OJ and Em (Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer, respectively) dub Jean Jacket, before a rousing showdown near the film’s end. </p><p><em>Nope </em>is as heady as Peele’s socially conscious brand of horror has ever been, and it’s also just as inventive. Jean Jacket is a horror film villain (if you can even call it that) like I’ve never seen, and the most refreshing take on an alien in my lifetime at least. Its forms and motivations defy our preconceived notions of the alien, all while maintaining the very real danger of a confrontation with the unknown. In the words of OJ, it’s a “bad miracle,” and god am I glad that <em>Nope </em>came out of that. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Perhaps the quintessential witch movie, 1996’s cult classic <em>The Craft</em> is an absolute must-watch during spooky season (and required viewing if you want to be in my friend group). It has all the hallmarks of a great ‘90s film: the trials and tribulations of high school, the horrors teenage boys inflict, and the joy of finding a group of fellow outcasts to bond with—except there’s witchcraft. Think <em>Heathers</em> but on Halloween.<br></p><p>Fairuza Balk gives a legendary, infinitely quotable performance as Nancy Downs, the punk-rocker-turned-conjurer who gets drunk off her newfound power, while Robin Tunney plays the preppy protagonist with an effortlessness that makes me wonder why she didn’t get more leading roles. <em>The Craft</em> may not be <em>technically</em> accurate in terms of how it portrays witchcraft (maybe don’t bring this film up at your local occult store) but it’s my favorite witch movie of all time and the perfect thing to queue up with a glass of pumpkin beer in your hands. Don’t forget the cinnamon sugar rim. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p> The <em>Saw </em>movies get a bad rap from people who consider them to be “torture porn.” By the time the series concluded its first run with 2010’s <em>Saw 3D</em>, it had truly fallen into the trappings of that descriptor, exchanging its philosophical debate about the value of life to instead treat characters as playthings to be put through a meat grinder  as grossed-out audiences watched through their fingers. </p><p>But I’d argue that <em>Saw </em>is not torture porn, and not even really a “horror” franchise in the traditional sense. Instead, I view it as a death game, complete with players, high stakes, and a philosophical struggle driving the whole thing. John “Jigsaw” Kramer is still one of the most fascinating villains in the horror genre. As a man with delusions of grandeur fueled by his own mortality, his fundamental views are so flawed that half the fun of the series’ elaborate timeline is watching him clash with everyone he comes into contact with. Yes, <em>Saw </em>is violent, often needlessly so considering some of the people Kramer puts into his death games, but watching its central villain paint social and moral commentary with the blood of his victims never gets old. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>In the <em>The Witch,</em> a goat named Black Phillip asks its main character, a young Puritan woman whose family has been cast out of their village and who is blamed for her youngest sibling’s disappearance: “Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?” Yes, you read that right, and after watching writer and director Robert Eggers’ debut film and seeing how alluring witchcraft and devilish deviance would be for a woman living in such patriarchal and oppressive times, you understand the allure of such a question. From the moment the film opens, it’s clear you’re in for a somber, moody experience—but as soon as things start to go south, you can feel fear creep up your body like a cold, dank chill in a log cabin. </p><p>Along with exploring the cultural mindset of early Puritanical settlers, <em>The Witch</em> shows off Eggers’ obsession with historical accuracy—the structures on set were built by thatchers and carpenters well-versed in building in 17th century British-American style, and Eggers spent years researching language to ensure the script was written accurately. It’s a beautiful, haunting movie that put superstar Anya Taylor-Joy on the map.<br></p><p>Watching <em>The Witch</em> is like stepping into a time machine and out into an unknown, virtually uninhabited 1630s New England. With an unknown evil lurking in the woods and puritanical men telling you how to behave, wouldn’t you decide to live deliciously, too? — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>Dan Stevens is a national treasure. Not ours, but I still love him. After charming our pants off in <em>Downton Abbey,</em> he played against type as an unnerving Afghanistan war veteran who arrives back stateside in a small town to wrap up  some unfinished business in 2014's <em>The Guest</em>. I haven’t seen anything else its director, Adam Wingard, or its writer, Simon Barrett, have made, but <em>The Guest</em> has become an almost annual Halloween watch for me. It’s incredibly low-stakes but also very unsettling, mixing some ‘80s B-horror movie vibes with the stomach-churning dread of all those post-9/11 war crimes stalking your conscience just off screen.</p><p>Stevens perfectly sells his performance as the war buddy of a family’s dead army son that teaches them to live, laugh, and love. Think <em>Black Mirror</em> meets <em>Napoleon Dynamite </em>with a stiff-upper lip Brit at the center of it. I showed it to my parents and they hated it, so it has that going for it too. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>I think <em>It </em>surprised the hell out of all of us in 2017. After years of drab remakes of classic films, here was one that had some bite to match its bark. <em>It</em>, from director Andy Muschietti, successfully turns Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård) from a possible gag into a living nightmare, all the while adapting things that work from Stephen King’s acclaimed novel and, let’s just say, <em>streamlining </em>elements that always felt really out of place. </p><p>The cast of young losers are a marvel, especially Bev and Bill (Sophia Lillis and Jaeden Martell, respectively), but the movie really does belong to Pennywise, whose tendrils can be found puppeteering the evil machinations and tendencies of the town of Derry. Pennywise toys with the kids in increasingly absurd and horrific encounters that never lose sight of what a frankly silly villain a clown makes, while revealing that there’s obviously more to him than the clown greasepaint and his big-ass head. If you’ll forgive my use of the phrase, it’s a modern classic, through and through. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Hands-down this is Megan Fox’s best performance, not to mention an absolutely iconic film. Written and directed by Diablo Cody, <em>Jennifer’s Body</em> is a tongue-in-cheek flick about a popular high school girl who is sacrificed to the devil so a pop punk band can find fame—except she comes back to life as a man-eating demon. From the moment the movie begins, you know it’s going to be full of zingers and hilarious moments—there’s a 9/11 joke, more than one period gag, some bisexual barbs, and a jump-scare cameo by a young, scummy Chris Pratt. Fox is sarcastic and savage as the popular Jennifer Check, while Amanda Seyfried plays her hapless, hokey friend Needy with wide-eyed wonder that she, brilliantly, turns on its head near the end of the movie.<br></p><p>With a banger soundtrack (that includes Panic! At The Disco, Florence + The Machine, and Dashboard Confessional), gnarly gore, biting humor that could only come from the aughts, and a dark, sensual sexiness, <em>Jennifer’s Body</em> is an all-time classic. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>David Robert Mitchell’s <em>It Follows </em>just works on so many levels. First, there’s the core concept of a relentless force pursuing you, somewhere out there, that can take the form of just about any person you can imagine, that will kill you if it catches up with you, and that you can only throw off the scent by having sex, in which case the person you sleep with becomes the target. It’s the kind of chilling notion that gets inside your head, haunting you long after you leave the theater, and it can serve as a metaphor for so many things. </p><p>Then there’s the virtuosic filmmaking, which makes the absolute most of this concept. Not only does protagonist Jay (Maika Moore) scour every environment she’s in, looking for anyone who stands out and could be the relentless pursuer, but so do we as viewers. The film takes devilish pleasure in showing us crowds, knowing that our eyes will scan everyone—all the people cluelessly just going about the business of their lives—wondering if, soon, it will become clear that one of them is the film’s Terminator, getting dangerously close to Jay. </p><p>And finally, there’s the way that <em>It Follows</em>, not content to be just a horror film about modern-day young people, engages in some subtle but terrific worldbuilding that makes its setting feel both recognizable and ever-so-slightly off.  For instance, early in the film we see a teen using what looks at first like a clamshell-style makeup compact, but when she opens it, it’s actually some kind of high-tech e-reader. This is just the first of many (no-doubt deliberate) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thoughtcatalog.com/m-j-pack/2015/08/heres-why-you-missed-the-scariest-part-of-it-follows/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/m-j-pack/2015/08/heres-why-you-missed-the-scariest-part-of-it-follows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strange details and anachronisms</a></span> that make the setting of <em>It Follows </em>as memorable and strange as the chilling concept at its core. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>We can play favorites all we want, but the truth is that the first <em>Scream </em>is the best one. I doubt one will ever come along that’ll outdo it, even if I find the escalating lunacy and campiness of its <em>several</em> sequels enthralling in its own right. What other franchise is constantly mocking itself while providing scares <em>and </em>commentary on the genre and the movie business? <br></p><p>The first <em>Scream </em>is the gift that keeps on giving. The opening with Drew Barrymore is timeless, not least of all for being the genesis of the line, “What’s your favorite scary movie?” <em>Scream</em> gave us the best final girl ever in Neve Campbell’s Sidney Prescott. It gave us the incredible homoerotic sexual tension between Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard). It gave us freakin’ Ghostface, the most iconic slasher villain since Jason Voorhees, Jamie Kennedy as a horror film aficionado trying to predict and get ahead of the slaughter that descends upon the town of Woodsboro, and one of the most mesmerizing finales of a horror flick ever. It’s got gore, humor, and a star-studded cast. <em>Scream </em>will simply always be one of the best horror films you can possibly watch now or ever. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p><em>Barbarian</em> is one of those movies that you should go into absolutely blind (if the internet will allow it) to ensure you get to experience maximum madness. I remember seeing this movie in theaters—how I simultaneously laughed and gasped in disbelief at certain moments, how my heart rate refused to drop long after the credits rolled, and how I couldn’t stop talking about it to anyone who’d listen for days after seeing it.<br></p><p>In <em>Barbarian</em>, a young woman named Tess (Georgina Campbell) arrives at a Detroit rental house that is already occupied by an incredibly handsome guy named Keith (Bill Skarsgård). The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, and though she’s initially wary, Tess warms up to Keith and decides to sleep in the bedroom while he takes the couch—it seems like the two may even have a *vibe* going on, so there’s hope that this messed-up situation could turn into something great. Except, of course, it doesn’t. The entire situation descends into full-blown horror, as the two discover the house’s hidden secrets, the horrors that have taken place there, and the monsters that lurk within.<br></p><p>Though <em>Barbarian</em> includes plenty of the kind of cruel violence you’d expect from a horror film, there’s also the pleasure of seeing Justin Long appear as a slimy, skeezy actor who gets exactly what he deserves, and it is glorious. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>“Because you were home.” These words, chillingly delivered by one of <em>The Strangers</em>’ anonymous assailants at the very end of the movie, have never failed to make my spine tingle. <em>The Strangers </em>is no gore fest, nor is it a rampage. It’s got arguably one of the lowest kill counts of similar horror movies, and yet it is one of the most terrifying things in the world. </p><p>What if death and violence just comes for us indiscriminately one night? What if it creeps into our home and snuffs us out just because? What if there’s no significance to these life-or-death matters beyond being in the wrong place at the wrong time and in the sights of the wrong people? That’s the paranoia that <em>The Strangers </em>taps into as you slowly watch a trio of masked strangers terrorize a couple, creepily linger in the background of scenes, and finally shed blood just for the hell of it. If you want to be scared off from ever living in the suburbs, or are a millennial or Gen Z kid who’s never going to own one anyway and wants to feel alright about it, watch <em>The Strangers. </em>— Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Almost undoubtedly the best horror comedy romance movie ever made, <em>Shaun of the Dead </em>is a spectacular crowdpleaser, and an ideal horror movie for people who don’t like (or who think they don’t like) horror movies. It’s not that it skimps on the scares, it just wraps them up in such delightful, hilarious, infectiously enjoyable circumstances that even most scaredy-cats will be laughing along, enjoying the ride, and discovering that horror can be wonderfully fun. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p><em>The Ritual</em> may be my favorite full-blown horror film, thanks in large part to the eeriness of its setting (a Swedish forest) and its folk-horror roots—few things scare me more than ancient evil, and this movie is full of that shit. <em>The Ritual</em> begins with four friends whose relationship is strained (to say the least) embarking on a hiking trip together in an effort to heal after they experienced an incredibly traumatic event. Horror loves trauma dumping, and boy does it just get worse from there.<br></p><p>Shortly after the foursome steps into the dense woods, one of them gets hurt (surprise) and they decide to cut through the forest to ostensibly get him help faster. A torrential downpour forces them to take shelter in a creepy old cabin, but when the men wake up in various states of panic and pain, it’s clear that there’s something wrong with these woods. Things only get crazier from there as they realize they’re not only lost, but being pursued by <em>something</em>. The acting is top-tier, the movie <em>looks</em> beautiful, and its perfectly balances the pace throughout its 94-minute run-time. <em>The Ritual</em> has it all: confronting traditional notions of masculinity, people impaled on trees, a cult worshiping an offspring of Loki, and, of course, a lot of moments that will make you scream. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>I like my horror to be a little more ambient than the balls-to-the-wall bloodshed and gore sort we often get. There’s a time and place for that kind of stuff, but I’m much more into movies that creep at the same pace as <em>Lake Mungo</em>, a film shot as a fake documentary about the death of a girl named Alice and the ways in which her family deals with her loss. </p><p>There isn’t much in the way of thrills in <em>Lake Mungo</em>, but the action of the movie gets increasingly unsettling as the family begins to spiral and believe that Alice is haunting them. It doesn’t go full <em>Paranormal Activity</em>, but the family does start recording their home in the hope of finding some proof that she is still with them, and what comes of these explorations is sufficiently lo-fi and eerie. If the rising tension of the movie keeps you around long enough, stick through its credits to be totally weirded out and gain a newfound uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p><em>The Descent</em> was the first horror movie I ever saw in theaters, on a first date with a guy who would eventually become my high school sweetheart. So, I bizarrely have fond memories of a rather horrifying film for that very reason—because let me be clear, <em>The Descent</em> is <em>intense</em>. It follows a group of women who go on a spelunking expedition after one of them suffers a tragedy, just for more tragedy to ensue because this is, after all, a horror movie.<br></p><p>Not long after their descent (teehee) into the convoluted cave system (an unexplored one, which the woman who led them there conveniently leaves out), a collapse blocks their exit. They forge onward, finding signs that  other expeditions have made their way through this place seeking an exit. But there’s something else: horrible, Gollum-like predators that feast on human flesh. <em>The Descent</em> is a gory 100 minutes of heart-pumping jump scares and horrors, and is definitely one of the scarier films on this list. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>I’ve watched a lot of horror flicks over the years, but <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>is one of the few that I think really captures the essence of evil. A far cry from the weird and offbeat TV show that preceded it, <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>recounts the last living days of Laura Palmer, a tortured American teenage girl if there ever was one. <strong>It is not a movie for the faint of heart, and you should consider this a warning for the lengthy list of troubling subjects and material in this movie</strong>. If you do manage to brave this thoroughly unsettling movie, preferably after at least watching <em>Twin Peaks</em>, you’ll find a deeply sorrowful and empathetic tale that is more than just a bizarre blend of surrealism, off-kilter quirkiness, and homegrown horror.</p><p>If the goal of <em>Twin Peaks </em>was to slowly and eerily subvert the cutesy image of suburban domesticity, <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>is the ringing and piercing final shot into the dark heart underneath all that artifice, or at least it was until the show was eventually revived 25 years after its conclusion. In that light, <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>is also the agonizing and confounding blueprint for <em>Twin Peaks</em>’ eventual return, which borrowed heavily from the sensibilities of the film rather than the show’s original run, making it the most essential viewing to understand the entire arc of the series. Again, <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>can be a rough watch, but I think it’s one well worth the time and hardship. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Spooky season isn’t just about getting scared, it’s about embracing your campy side—something the Addams family understands better than most. Though the earlier 1991 film was the first to introduce us to this incredible cast (which includes young Christina Ricci, the hilarious Christopher Lloyd, and, as Gomez and Morticia Addams, the brilliant and beautiful Anjelica Huston and the late, great Raul Julia), this sequel is far better. </p><p>Not only is the title a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Republican obsession with conservative family values, but there’s a trio of ridiculously funny plots that weave together well, and an absolutely crackerjack performance from Joan Cusack. It’s a must-watch that will have a smile permanently plastered on your face. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p><em>Pulse</em>—the 2001 Japanese original rather than the American remake—is another film that is low on thrills and jump scares but is dripping with dread. A horror parable for the internet generation, <em>Pulse </em>tells two parallel ghost stories at the turn of the century which hone in on themes of loneliness and connection. It’s one of the slowest burns ever, but it’s a sufficiently creepy and profound ride to the very end. As people begin to disappear around Japan, the film turns from one about metaphoric isolation to the actual thing, and seeing the city streets slowly empty out over the course of the movie feels like watching the apocalypse quietly claim us all.<br></p><p><em>Pulse </em>is unnerving as all hell, and nowhere is that truer than in its most iconic scene. In it, the character Yabe (Masatoshi Matsuo) crosses a threshold he clearly shouldn’t and meets with a ghost in a poorly lit and clearly abandoned passage. The striking silhouette of the apparition emerges from a shadow towards Yabe, at which point he recoils, but the ghost doesn’t attack him. Instead, it menacingly just walks towards him, performs an unusual movement that briefly reveals its visage, and then reverts back to its stalk. The score and physical performance here are so unnatural that despite the lack of any real surprise, the scene’s action feels uncompromisingly urgent, and <em>Pulse </em>carries that to unease to its very final moments. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>I won’t tell you anything about <em>The Exorcist</em>, in part because you probably already know its key story beats (and probably a few of its classic lines), but also because the story I will tell you will sell it for you. </p><p>My high school soccer coach was quite the orator, and every year when it got close to Halloween he would tell us scary stories at the end of practice, in a corner of the pitch where the field lights didn’t reach. One year, he told us about the night he had gone to see <em>The Exorcist</em> when he was a kid, and walked home alone in the dark, absolutely petrified the entire way. When he finally arrived home, his father was waiting in the bushes for him, and jumped out just as he reached the front door. My coach screamed and did a near-perfect back flip off of the front porch, to which his dad replied, “Wow, guess it was a scary movie, huh?” — Alyssa Mercante<br></p></div><div><p><em>Signs </em>is well-remembered these days for a particular scene. I know it, you know it, everybody knows it. It’s the birthday party that traumatized everyone, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/1blsxvc/in_signs_2002_joaquin_phoenix_shouts_in_spanish/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/1blsxvc/in_signs_2002_joaquin_phoenix_shouts_in_spanish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conjured a baffling bit of Spanish from Joaquin Phoenix</a></span>. But surrounding that moment, <em>Signs </em>does a whole lot with very little, a trick director M. Night Shyamalan’s would hone, misuse, and then sharpen again across the next two decades. </p><p>The aliens that are constantly terrorizing the cast are heard more than they’re seen. You can tell they’re around by the shuffling of grass, the crop circles burnt into fields, and in one scene, by the sound of crickets chirping. When they are seen, they’re often obfuscated by darkness or some other scene element. They maintain an air of mystery and danger, even as <em>Signs </em>gets to its climactic showdown, because Shyamalan waits until he absolutely <em>must</em> show the alien threats to ever put them on screen. Even if the movie isn’t all that terrifying, the director still puts on a clinic, showing how to economically and tastefully build up suspense, making it a must-watch for lovers of the form. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>I remember some choice aspects of <em>28 Days Later</em>, otherwise known as the film that put zombies back on the map. Here are the two that stand out the most: Grandaddy’s “A.M 180” and the aesthetics of its apocalypse.<br></p><p>First, “A.M 180.” The synth-driven song seems vintage, like the sounds of an old arcade machine being played back through a warped or damaged recorder. Considering how it plays over a scene of the movie’s leading band of survivors pillaging an undisturbed supermarket after the collapse of society in a zombie outbreak, its deliberately nostalgic sound and lyrics pining for better days and company are well deployed.<br></p><p>Second, the movie’s style. <em>28 Days Later </em>is widely heralded as the work that revitalized the zombie genre, which had become stale by the time of its release in 2002. Its plot was mostly character driven, and the aesthetics of its apocalypse were a bit more disheveled and grimy rather than rapturous and surreptitious. The band of militaristic and chauvinist villains revealed toward the end reflected a sentiment that’d only grow through the years: a deep distrust of the patriarchal institutions our society has propped up over eons. </p><p>Oh, and I guess this movie popularized zombies that could run. These are tenets that would go on to be found in tons of horror and horror-adjacent zombie media, such as the 2004 remake of <em>Dawn of the Dead </em>that heavily borrowed from <em>28 Days Later</em>, and even <em>The Last of Us</em>. It’s one of the most influential pieces of horror since the turn of the century, and you’ve likely engaged with something that owes its existence to <em>28 Days Later</em>, so it’s probably worth a watch. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Jordan Peele’s debut horror film, you will always be famous. From the brilliant casting of <em>Girls</em>’ Allison Williams as the fake-ass girlfriend to the incredibly uncomfortable white liberalism woven throughout, <em>Get Out</em> will make your skin crawl. Daniel Kaluuya is brilliant in the lead role, and the random punctuations of genuinely hilarious moments offer a reprieve from all the racism. White people, watch it with your parents. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>I’ve watched a lot of movies throughout my life, meaning it’s hard to keep the plots of them all straight in my head. I know that <em>Sinister </em>is a movie about a writer discovering several snuff tapes, but I don’t remember a lot of the events around it all that much. I don’t really need to, though, because <em>Sinister</em>’s eeriest moments have been burned into my brain since my very first viewing. </p><p><em>Sinister</em>’s most spine-tingling stuff are the snuff tapes that Ethan Hawke’s character watches over the course of the film. Each begins and ends in much the same way: an unseen figure seemingly records a family from a distance. In the videos, they are often enjoying time together, either in their living rooms or maybe by the pool. Nonetheless, the fact that they’re being observed prompts a sense of dread that is only made worse by the sudden shifts in the home video. Without fail, the happy scene of domesticity gives way to a murder. The kills aren’t gory or flashy, and in fact the camcorder sometimes seems like it’s struggling to make sense of the action, but the sound editing in these moments, as well as the unnerving and choppy footage, never fail to make me shudder. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p><em>Evil Dead 2 </em>is far from the scariest movie on this list, but it damn sure is the funniest. Horror and comedy have a deep and intertwined history, and <em>Evil Dead 2 </em>is one of the shining beacons of that legacy. Essentially a remake <em>and </em>sequel to the original movie, it once again features Bruce Campbell in the role of Ash Williams, who takes a romantic trip to a cabin in the woods that gets disturbed by the forces of hell and evil trees. A bigger, better, more ridiculous, yet somehow more sensible movie, <em>Evil Dead 2 </em>skews more toward hilarity than outright scares, resulting in some big laughs while keeping things suitably weird. You ever blast a hole in the wall of a clearly haunted house, only for it to spew fountains of blood and then visibly mock and laugh at you? Well, Ash does in <em>Evil Dead 2</em>, and it’s as horrifying as it is hilarious. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p><em>Under the Skin </em>is an entirely different kind of horror movie, in that it really isn’t even trying to play to the genre all that much. Many folks would probably argue with my classification of the movie, and that’s fine. Nonetheless, it <em>is</em> eerie as hell watching Scarlet Johansson drive a van around as a detached alien observing the human condition, pick up men around town, and subsume them into a nebulous void. The nothingness of this liminal and distinctly alien place is only exacerbated by the impeccable and sparse set design and score of the scenes that take place there. <em>Under the Skin </em>feels like a miracle: a quietly hostile feat of filmmaking that just needs to be seen to be absorbed and understood, and it’s a testament to the skill of director Jonathan Glazer that it came out as fully formed, bewitching, and confident as it is. — Moises Taveras</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite the massive financial success of Nintendo’s Wii, the console’s games (outside of the central first-party titles) have always had a somewhat negative reputation. While it’s true that there was a lot of awful shovelware and games ruined by shoehorned waggle controls, there were also standout games that were overlooked by the wider gaming community. Perhaps chief among these was Epic Mickey, a surprisingly dark and interesting take on Disney’s most iconic character. Indeed, looking back most of the interest in the game came from the involvement of industry legend Warren Spector (of Deus Ex fame). The eventual sequel, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, moved away from exclusivity and released on all contemporary platforms with added coop multiplayer and a shift towards being an interactive musical. But, going back to the original, Epic Mickey has now been remastered – or Rebrushed as the title has it – in the hope of finding a wider audience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed - Deep Dive Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeSqXnhlBio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Put simply, the story of Epic Mickey stems from Mickey Mouse being a pretty terrible character. He breaks into mentor Yen Sid’s office and interferes with his magical paint, bringing devastation to the world of Wasteland in the process. Wasteland is where all the forgotten cartoon characters go and for Mickey to compound his role in eclipsing the likes of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit shows what a villain he truly is. However, given his iconic role as the face of Disney, he is cast here as the hero and it’s up to you to fix what he has done and restore the world of the Wasteland. Wider allegories to the role of Disney as a corporation could easily be made here but that is perhaps outside the remit of this review, and a game about a mouse with a paintbrush.</p>



<p>Graphically Epic Mickey was always a striking game, but one whose 3D sections were held back by the limitations of the Wii hardware. The interspersed 2D sections were highlights back in 2010 and remain so now, but the quality of the presentation as a whole has improved almost beyond recognition. The fantastic art design of the world of Wasteland really gets a chance to shine here and it is a good example of a game that really needed a visual update.</p>

<p>Audio has, somewhat disappointingly, been kept very faithful so the various cutscenes still lack voice acting with characters employing grunts and chirps. Given the extended use of voices in the sequel this feels like a shame.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the game mixes two different platforming styles. The majority of the game plays out in 3D as you traverse environments both original and inspired by Disney classics. Travelling between the different 3D spaces occurs through jumping into projector screens that take you to levels closely based on original Mickey Mouse shorts such as Steamboat Willie. These are beautifully animated and strongly reminiscent of the Illusion titles from the 16-bit era. Both styles control well, but I would have liked to see longer 2D sections and even perhaps a boss fight or two in this style.</p>

<p>Mickey comes equipped with traditional traversal mechanics, such as a double jump and spin but newly added to this version are evasive dashes and ground pounds. These have been widely publicised in the promotion for the game but the new mechanics are almost entirely unnecessary as the actual game has not been changed to require their use. I never used either throughout my entire playthrough as the game is still mostly based around the magic paintbrush that Mickey wields. You can use this brush to either add paint or remove it with thinner, and there are many areas where either approach is valid. Enemies can either be befriended with paint or destroyed with thinner whilst navigating the world requires you to remove barriers or repair platforms and moving machinery.</p>
<p>When the game is at its best it requires you to use both platforming skills and environmental puzzle solving to work through complex areas and the different brush skills provide a simple moral level as well. Do you repair and befriend or take the quicker and more destructive route? Every boss can be defeated by either approach with the game playing out differently either way. This provides the advertised multiple endings but in truth it works out as a binary choice between paint and thinner, with the main reward being an upgrade to whichever you use. The boss fights themselves play out more as separate puzzle areas rather than combat per se but are enjoyable. However, much of the game still feels quite repetitive and padded out, issues I always had with the original.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Epic Mickey Rebrushed is the ultimate version of the game and the team at Purple Lamp have clearly put a lot of love into updating the game for a contemporary audience. That being said, the additions to Mickey’s moveset are completely unnecessary and the core game remains largely the same. If you’ve played Epic Mickey before then this version will bring back any nostalgia you have for the game and if you haven’t then it is a good way to experience a neglected title. The lack of anything more than a cosmetic upgrade does make the high price a little hard to justify but this is still a solid game for anyone with a fondness for the Mouse.	</p></div>

					<p>From its <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-mickey-rebrushed-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>, Dysney's Epic Mickey felt unlike any other game starring Mickey Mouse. Instead of the usual colorful platform game, the game developed by Junction Point Studios, a development team founded by the creator of the Deus Ex series Warren Spector, was a darker game that was part of a much wider project to reintroduce Mickey's more adventurous side to a bigger audience.</p>
<p>Featuring a very interesting setting that granted players the chance to delve into the more obscure Disney productions and characters, as well as some sort of morality system, the game promised to be a new beginning for Disney in the video gaming space. Unfortunately, Disney's Epic Mickey proved to be nothing more than a rather run-of-the-mill platform game marred by plenty of issues that were only barely salvaged by the setting and some interesting mechanics that weren't exactly fully developed, like the aforementioned morality system.</p>
<p>14 years later, THQ Nordic decided to give the game a second chance. Developed by Purple Lamp, Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed aims to improve the original experience by addressing a variety of issues and expanding it a bit with a slew of new content. Unfortunately, the improvements, while welcome, fail to address some of the game's core issues, which have only become more aggravating in the years since the original release.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240909182808_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed's story is the same as the original, and it's still one of the highlights of the experience. The game is set in the Wasteland, a world for forgotten things, namely Disney's forgotten or underused characters, created by the sorcerer Yen Sid that gets heavily messed up by the clumsy intervention of Mickey Mouse. Due to the damage he causes, the Wasteland becomes a post-apocalyptic world tormented by the monstrous Blot. Decades after the incident, Mickey Mouse is abducted by an ink monster and brought to the Wasteland, where he makes the acquaintance of many different characters, including Oswald the Rabbit, Walt Disney's very first character, in the attempt to save the Wasteland and return home.</p>
<p>While the story isn't anything special by itself, it's the Wasteland and the twisted recreation of some iconic Disney locations that make Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed a very interesting experience. The vast majority of locations Mickey explores in the game are based on popular Disney locations such as Sleeping Beauty Castle, Main Street, U.S.A., Toontown, and many others.</p>
<p>In these locations, Mickey will also meet tons of forgotten or underused characters, such as Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow, rarely used variants of popular characters like Pete, and even animatronic versions of Donald Duck, Goofy, and Daisy Duck. All this is incredibly interesting for both hardcore Disney fans and those with only a passing knowledge of classic cartoons, and they manage to make the experience interesting from beginning to end, even with a mid-story and gameplay.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed has plenty of gameplay enhancements over the original Wii release, not counting some forced tweaks due to the lack of Wiimote controls. Mickey's movement and core abilities have been improved, and he can now sprint, perform a dash maneuver, and ground pound attack, which makes exploring the Wasteland slightly better than before. The Guardian Meter system was improved, giving players a better idea of the Guardians that will join Mickey depending on their combat choices. Collectibles have also been increased, and select locations have been expanded with new areas, secrets, and puzzles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240909194945_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>All these additions make Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed a little more fun to play, but they don't address what made the original game an average 3D platform game to begin with. For starters, level design is not that interesting, featuring gimmicks that already felt a little dated back in 2010. Mickey's Magical Brush, which grants players better interaction with the environment, allowing them to restore or destroy certain elements to access secret areas or solve puzzles, is a great idea on paper but isn't used to its full potential, mostly due to the unexciting level design. The project-screen 2D stages, which can be replayed at will in the remaster, are just as average as the 3D stages, featuring dated gameplay concepts and gimmicks. It's not that they are terribly bad per se; it's just that they feel uninspired. Making matters worse is the extreme linearity of the experience, which is a far cry from other modern 3D platform games such as Super Mario Odyssey.</p>
<p>Combat is also pretty straightforward and not particularly engaging. While the vast majority of enemies roaming the Wasteland can be destroyed easily using any of Mickey's attacks or the Magical Brush's Thinner, using Paint grants him the chance to win them over to his side. This is just one aspect of the morality system featured in the game. Depending on choices made in combat against regular enemies, two types of Guardians can join Mickey, allowing him to activate the Thinner and Paint effects of the Magical Brush in a single hit. Depending on how the player approaches boss battles, different power-ups will be handed out as a reward once the battle is won.</p>
<p>The morality system also comes into play during exploration. For example, Mickey will sometimes come across a special machine that can only contain either Thinner or Paint and depending on his choice, there will be different effects and consequences. Certain quests can also be completed in several different ways, and depending on the choices made, it is possible to skip mini-boss battles. Unfortunately, there are no far-reaching consequences for the player's choices, as they are relegated to the area where they are made most of the time. The only exception to this is the ending, which is influenced by how much Thinner or Paint is used during the course of the game. Seeing all endings shouldn't take too long for most players, as a single playthrough with a decent chunk of optional content is around 10 hours long.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240909193339_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The visual upgrade featured in Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is undoubtedly well-realized and one of the best features of the remaster. Every game asset was remade from the ground up, and it shows. The visuals look crisp, with great character models and textures that succeed in portraying the Wasteland and its somewhat oppressive atmosphere. The original 2D cutscenes were also re-rendered in 4K resolution, making them look better than they ever did in the original.</p>
<p>Despite being an undemanding game, Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed doesn't exactly run smoothly, even on a high-end system, which was sadly expected, being powered by Unreal Engine 4. During a benchmarking session held in the Mount Osmore Slopes area, the game ran at native 4K resolution, max settings, at a whopping average of 407 FPS on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM). The 1% low 94 FPS, however, makes it clear how there was some stuttering during gameplay. It was nothing major, to be honest, but still very noticeable. Those with systems not as powerful as mine should still be able to run the game reasonably well with the help of the Intel XeSS upscaler, which is strangely the only upscaler the game supports at launch.</p>
<p>As a remaster, Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed effectively addresses some of the original game’s gameplay issues while adding new content and improved visuals. However, some of the core issues of the original were left untouched, keeping this version from being a significant upgrade. While exploring Disney’s forgotten history is still enjoyable, the game’s platforming mechanics continue not to don't stand out, especially against today’s competition like Super Mario Odyssey and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a>.</p>

<p>Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a solid remaster that enhances the original experience with some nice improvements. Unfortunately, the experience is still carried by the setting exploring Disney's forgotten history, as the remaster does little to address dated level design, lackluster combat, and underdeveloped features like the morality system. Despite these shortcomings, Mickey's journey in the Wasteland remains enjoyable, especially for hardcore Disney fans eager to see some of the company’s long-forgotten characters brought back to life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/epic-mickey-rebrushed-review-we-need-more-mischevious-mickeys<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I missed the majority of the Wii's lifecycle when it first came around. While I returned to a lot of the larger Wii titles over time,&nbsp;<em>Epic Mickey</em> was one that was always on my periphery as a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> and Disney fan, but never played. With <em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed</em> releasing, I was excited to jump in and see whether I had cheated myself out of an 'Epic' adventure, or if Mickey's big Wii outing was a bit thin.</p>
<h2>Mickey Used To Be A Rascal</h2>
<p><em>Epic Mickey</em> begins with the premise of Yen Sid creating a world for all of the Disney characters of yesteryear, the different variations of characters used in one-off appearances or even the characters that completely disappeared like Horace Horsecollar. Mickey, having found his way through a portal in his mirror, runs amok, spilling a bottle of paint thinner that becomes The Blot into the world, cursing it to fall to ruin.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-story-mischevious-mouse.jpg?itok=llxXlVyk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-story-mischevious-mouse.jpg?itok=tI9JHFWQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mickey is at the finding out part of... well, you know.</figcaption></figure><p>Years later, Mickey is discovered as the culprit and, along with a magic paintbrush, is pulled into the Wasteland. Trying to make his way out, Mickey befriends and assists the people of the Wasteland.</p>
<p>One of the first touches I really enjoyed about the story of <em>Epic Mickey</em> is that it's Mickey back to his mischievous roots. He's not the paragon of positivity that we know now on the mast of the Disney corporation but a mouse looking to create some trouble thinking he knows best.</p>
<p>Within the world of the Wasteland, that attitude is unfortunately immediately tempered as he begins to take on the tasks of different characters, but it is also somewhat molded by the ever so slight morality system of being able to use thinner to create a darker world or paint to bring life back to it. The way you conclude major boss fights or alter different areas of the game come down to how you use your tools. Unfortunately, it never felt like <em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed </em>took the mechanic as far as it could have, leaving us with surface-level changes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-boss-fight-clock-tower.jpg?itok=FYnDaqZS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-boss-fight-clock-tower.jpg?itok=GRZEN6iH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thin the boss to get more thinner capacity and destroy it, or paint the boss to increase your paint and make the world a bit better (at least on paper).</figcaption></figure><h2>Hybrid Platforming In <em>Epic Mickey</em></h2>
<p>The gameplay in <em>Epic Mickey</em> is a mix of 3D platforming and 2D platforming, with just enough third-person shooting allowed to aim and fire paint and thinner at the world. Mickey is required to explore the world in an effort to find a way to escape. This journey takes him through a number of areas modeled as darker reflections of the kinds of locations you'd expect to find at a Disneyland theme park.</p>
<p>You first arrive at the Dark Beauty Castle (Cinderella's Castle), before progressing through Mean Street (Main Street), Tomorrow City (Tomorrow Land), and so on, and you even get to see different takes on rides like the Pirates of the Wasteland or Great Big Tomorrow (the Carousel of Progress).</p>
<p>These references to real-world locations do a good job of creating a number of visually unique and enjoyable locations, while also winking at the Disney fan enjoying the game that there's another reference for them to enjoy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-mean-street.jpg?itok=97WJ6Nty 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-mean-street.jpg?itok=XJcqj_Y7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mean Street is an immediately recognizable parallel.</figcaption></figure><p>Platforming is smooth if not a bit floaty. Mickey tends to hang in the air and then drift down slower than you might expect; it makes for easier platforming, especially for a younger age demographic, but it also makes the game feel a lot slower than it should be. A benefit of this floaty jump is how it can be used to get around the map very easily. I found myself routinely sequence breaking while exploring off the beaten path only to have to return to the start of an area so as to not miss major plot points.</p>
<h2>Paint or Thin to Alter the World</h2>
<p>While in the land of 3D, you'll also see a variety of 'toon' elements that you can either fill in with Paint or remove from existence with Thinner. This allows a lot of the world to be extremely interactive. You could paint a platform or building in to reach new heights, or thin something out and reveal an underground bunker with a collectible inside.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-pirates-of-the-carribean-platforming.jpg?itok=kaxPBkNb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-pirates-of-the-carribean-platforming.jpg?itok=Qv-BYsLg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look out for silhouettes or differently colored objects to know what can be painted or thinned.</figcaption></figure><p>This element is most interestingly used when it comes to the larger boss fights of <em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed</em>. Every boss you face will have a way to defeat them or a way to befriend them depending on whether you use Thinner or Paint respectively. Each opportunity can be quite different; against a robotic Captain Hook, using thinner might result in his destruction while you can use paint to platform up The Jolly Roger to release Peter Pan's sprite.</p>
<p>In between moments of 3D platforming, Mickey travels between hub spaces using projectors themed of different classic Mickey Mouse cartoons. In these 2D platforming spaces Mickey can do everything he normally can, except use Paint/Thinner. A lot of the same floatiness in the platforming is present, but it's a nice way to take what is already a reference-filled video game and pack it even further with references to the past.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-side-scrolling-platforming.jpg?itok=Pq1lp7EA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-side-scrolling-platforming.jpg?itok=XEMkqE8W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2D platform through Mickey's history? This is almost an homage to <em>Mickey Mania.</em></figcaption></figure><h2><em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed</em> does a good job of melding together pretty good but not great platforming for younger Disney fans who want to see Mickey's latest (reimagined) hijinks, as well as for the old guard who remember some of the obscure characters behind references.</p>
<p>While it is still a shame that elements like voice acting were never implemented it still delivers a fun and complete platforming challenge.</p>

<p><em>Mea Culpa&nbsp;</em>will bring new zones, new bosses, and a brand new alternative ending to&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>, and it's launching, appropriately enough, on October 31st. Hopefully, you'll be able to find enough time to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer">put down&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>&nbsp;</em>to check it out.</p>
<p>In total, you can look forward to two new zones and two new bosses in&nbsp;<em>Mea Culpa</em>, as well as four new NPC quests. A new weapon (presumably the Mea Culpa of the title, which was the Penitent One's sword in the first game) will also be added in the DLC.</p>

<p>The True Torment Update brings a number of improvements to&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>, including a New Game Plus mode, a "host of upgrades for the Penitent One", and a ton of quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>You can also expect expansions to the Choir of Thorns, Sunken Cathedral, and Basilica of Ancient Faces zones, which The Game Kitchen says will add "new challenges to explore and conquer".</p>
<p>New connections between zones have also been added to facilitate faster travel, and the Labyrinth of Tides has a new challenge for you to take on. The update will also bring new enemies across the whole of&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>'s world.</p>


<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>, it's the sequel to 2019's Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous</em>. Like its predecessor, the sequel is heavily themed around religion, with much of the game's terminology, as well as many of its enemies and aesthetics, strongly evoking Christian concepts and themes.</p>

Curry has also taken issue with the way her videos somehow only score viewing numbers in the four figures, despite her enormous subscription, inevitably due to the grim YouTube algorithms that will crush thumbnails of an elderly lady or in-game footage, preferring some gurning buffoon with gaped mouth next to the words, “WORST FAIL EVER!” or what have you.</p><p>In the past, Shirley has received <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shirley-the-skyrim-grandma-has-her-own-fully-voiced-mod-1846852430&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shirley-the-skyrim-grandma-has-her-own-fully-voiced-mod-1846852430">a fully-voiced mod that adds her to <em>Skyrim</em> as a companion character</a></span>, and she’s supposed to be an NPC in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646?_gl=1*1s9jmfb*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzA5MzIzNi4xNjkuMS4xNzI3MDkzNDA4LjQxLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646?_gl=1*1s9jmfb*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzA5MzIzNi4xNjkuMS4xNzI3MDkzNDA4LjQxLjAuMA..">the  forthcoming <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em></a></span>.
