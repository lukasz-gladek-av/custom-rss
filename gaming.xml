The game provides four graphics presets: low; medium; high; and epic, as well as a target resolution and FPS for each. The high graphics preset is what GSC calls 'recommended,' and provides 60fps gameplay at 1440p. For that high graphics preset you’ll need a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti / RTX 4070 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT GPU and 32GB of RAM. Low and medium require 16GB of RAM and less powerful GPUs. All graphics presets, however, require 160GB of SSD storage, which is a significant footprint worth bearing in mind if you’re planning on playing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, GSC confirmed S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 features upscaling options for DLSS and FSR.

		<p>Final Fantasy XIV – A Realm Reborn has had the unlikeliest journey to success. The original release was widely panned, crucially flawed, and so bad that they needed to sit the hard reset button, and yet here we are, 14 years later, with the game consistently standing as one of the biggest MMO’s in the world. Today, we’re witnessing a new chapter in the game, as Square Enix have announced Final Fantasy XIV Mobile, an all-new version of the game that you can take on the go with you.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV MOBILE – Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n1vk2A--ZbY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Now, if I were a pessimistic man, this would seem perilous territory. Final Fantasy XIV is one of the most addictive and time-consuming games in modern times; the need to go outside has, for many, been the only reason why they’ve not been playing Final Fantasy XIV, so this could be an important moment in human history.</p>
<p>The journey through Eorzea is one that every gamer should experience – the world is beautiful, the character’s compelling and memorable, and the gameplay remains top tier – and if you are yet to jump in, you can play up to <a href="https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/">Level 70 now for free</a>, without any restrictions on your time.&nbsp; Sorry, I may just have damned you.</p>
<p>The mobile version is being developed by Lightspeed Studio, though they’re very keen to point out that it’s under the supervision of Square Enix. You can expect a series of beta tests around the world, before its initial launch in China, though no dates have been given yet for this.</p>

<p>The most recent expansion, Dawntrail, continued the run of incredible success, with Reuben awarding it a stunning 10/10 and saying, “Dawntrail’s shift in narrative focus injects a vibrancy into Final Fantasy XIV with this more lighthearted romp, while still keeping track of a greater story. With an increase in challenge of the instances, a couple of excellent new Jobs, an introduction of new characters, and the development of existing ones, Dawntrail clearly shows there’s life after averting the end of the world and I – for one – wouldn’t change a damn thing.”</p>
<p>I’d be excited. Very excited.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/luma-island-review-indiana-jones-meets-stardew-valley.1040355/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/luma-island-indiana-jones-meets-stardew-valley<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d2a677d2-7696-414f-a338-b9b6f0d36f5b" href="https://techraptor.net/games/luma-island" rel="nofollow"><em>Luma Island</em></a>&nbsp;is an RPG simulation adventure game from Feel Free Games. It has multiple professions or side quests you can choose to follow, a town that needs repairing after a natural disaster, and an ancient prophecy that's starting to become reality. There are elements of adventure games, exploration, puzzles, creature collection, and life simulators woven throughout the title.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all there is to do you can easily get 30-40 hours of playtime in. Even when you complete the main quest you load into the game and can continue with any professions you haven't mastered or relax with your animals. You can hop into your friend's game to help them with a puzzle or have them visit for a farm tour. There's plenty of value in the different things you can do in <em>Luma Island</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-town.jpg?itok=-M8_mxpy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-town.jpg?itok=DZ615dCV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Different Story</h2>

<p>One of the main highlights of&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;is the story. Unlike the majority of cozy farming simulation games available, you don't come from a hectic job to revive a farm and small town. Your background isn't clarified, all you do know is you bought a used caravan and moved to the island. Instead, the focus of the story is on an ancient prophecy and the mysterious happenings of the island itself. The characters are humorous, often giving you important information sandwiched in between jokes. The prophecy itself isn't even taken seriously in the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You go through trapped temples to obtain prized artifacts. Traps include dodging flaming projectiles, falling rocks, and rolling saws. Then there are puzzles, like rotating flamethrower statues to create a pathway. On top of that, there are ghosts and bats that live in the ruins. It really feels like you're an intrepid archaeologist searching for hidden treasure.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-ancient-farm-temple.jpg?itok=ZrGPAtJ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-ancient-farm-temple.jpg?itok=Bra_tXwq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you try to play through the whole story without taking time to explore the regions, advance in your profession, or just relax, you may find yourself getting burnt out. The Forest, Mountain, and Jungle regions require you to go through three ruins in each, with traps and puzzles increasing in frequency and complexity. I found myself burnt out on puzzles, and overstimulated by all the flying, falling, and rotating contraptions by the time I was in the jungle. Puzzle lovers, however, will find themselves with at least 25 hours of content to play through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The downfall of the story is the ending. Not the ending itself, but you have to make a decision and there's no manual save. If you want to see both endings, you have to do two separate playthroughs. Once the ending cinematic plays the game is saved and you'll load in after your decision is in effect. I found this a bit off-putting as I wanted to experience both conclusions. For those with the time, however, this shouldn't have too much of an impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-farm-color-sound-puzzle.jpg?itok=h31Fya1b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-farm-color-sound-puzzle.jpg?itok=lzWIxiVX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Animals of&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em></h2>

<p>If you're interested in <em>Luma Island</em> for the creature collecting part of it, sorry to say, but that's the least satisfying element in the game. There are many different Lumas, each hatching from their own adorable egg. You feed them, pet them, and can take one with you as you explore the different regions and towns. They can find hidden treasure and their energy is used in the different professions when crafting. That's all you do with them, however. They don't do anything on the farm, don't react to other creatures, and don't give additional perks in situations they might be helpful in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A rabbit-type Luma could help with the weeds similar to actual rabbits, or a horse type could be ridden to shorten the time spent traveling to collect resources. Even the farm animals have more impact than these special creatures. While the Lumas are cute and have their own little quirks, they do the same task that a cat or dog can do.</p>

<p>Depending on the profession you pick, like Treasure Hunter, you'll even get a pet for free. Lumas' purpose in the main story doesn't even come into play until the very end, leaving a lot of possibilities for the creatures on the table.&nbsp;It feels like Lumas were included for the story and given little thought to their utilization in other areas of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-animals-luma-garden.jpg?itok=WchDwzXN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-animals-luma-garden.jpg?itok=mov7hmSM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Speaking of farm animals, how&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;does gardening and farming is refreshing. You can start to grow plants but find they have weeds. Instead of spending time picking the weeds every day, rabbits will take care of the problem. Chickens will clear bug infestations, but a fox will try to get into the hen house. Goats chase away the foxes and pigs can dig up Ginger for cooking. That's on top of their "normal" farm purpose of providing milk, eggs, and fertilizer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would've enjoyed&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;more if the main story ruins and professions were more seamlessly blended. They could almost be two separate games, of which I would enjoy the profession title more than the puzzler. It's also easy to not progress through the main story unless you're working on the archaeologist profession, which needs items found in the ruins. If the two sides of&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;were more cohesive, the experience for both would be better.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luma-island-map-quest-log.jpg?itok=8WMnQxu- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luma-island-map-quest-log.jpg?itok=NbXvEZwO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thankfully, the actual implementation of the game and playing it is a rewarding experience. After 34 hours I had only experienced two bugs. The first was a vase that wouldn't smash and the second, which occurred in hour 33 of gameplay, was glitching into a statue and being unable to move. Using the unstuck button in the game menu sent me home, so the overall impact was quite low.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Luma Island</em>&nbsp;is a well-executed simulation game with a variety of side quests, crafting, and regions to explore, but a few too many of the same puzzles and a lack of creativity when it comes to the Lumas.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Workers at Reflector Entertainment, the Montreal studio that recently released third-person action adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unknown-9">Unknown 9: Awakening</a>, have been hit by layoffs, according to a number of employees who made the cuts public on social media. The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn't known, as Reflector haven't made a public statement about it. But among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The layoffs were spotted by Kotaku reporter Ethan Gach, who pointed it out <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lbdcdushd22s">on Bluesky</a>. Sure enough, a glance at LinkedIn shows several game workers announcing they are looking for new jobs. Among those I've seen are a 3D modeller, character artist, UI programmer, community manager, lighting expert, game designer, narrative designer, and a senior environment artist. That range of roles suggests the layoffs are widespread, affecting all departments. We've asked Reflector Entertainment for more information on the job cuts. </p>
<p>Unknown 9 is set in an alternate history earth, in which you play a "Quaestor" with special abilities, travelling the globe to fight a shadowy secret society. Bandai Namco liked the look of it enough to buy the studio in 2020, and there was enough invested in the world to produce two novels, a scripted podcast, and a comic book. It's unclear from these layoffs whether the fictional world itself is also being retired or if Bandai Namco intend to keep it going.</p>
<p>For the real people affected, this looks like further brutal cost-cutting from Bandai Namco, who have recently been <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bandai-namco-is-reportedly-cutting-workforce-following-cancellation-of-several-titles">axing jobs</a> in their Japanese studios (via a very unpleasant method if <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles?">reports by Bloomberg</a> are accurate). Early this year they also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-publishers-bandai-namco-cancel-at-least-five-games-target-future-emphasis-on-quality">cancelled several games</a> due to "higher than expected" development costs. </p><p>As for Unknown 9 itself, the game seems to have sold quite poorly, and currently has an average "mixed" rating on Steam. It was arguably under-marketed for a game of its production values. We saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unknown-9-awakening-is-a-brand-new-game-that-already-has-a-big-weird-expanded-universe">a 90-second teaser trailer</a> in 2020, then heard no more about the game itself until earlier this year, when it reappeared to show off a mix of Tomb Raider adventuring, Assassin's Creed conspiracy theories, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars">Star Wars</a> force powers. </p>
<p>Former RPS editor Katharine Castle continues to earn her reputation as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">a hellish prophet</a>, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-years-of-silence-unknown-9-awakening-re-emerges-as-a-supernatural-mash-up-of-assassins-creed-with-star-wars-force-powers">playing a preview</a> of the game earlier this year and speaking to the studio's head of production Jean-Francois Deschamps. During which she suspected the game's final months of creation would be a challenge.</p>
<blockquote>Ultimately, it's a challenge that's "really exciting" to try and meet as a studio, [Deschamps] tells us, though given everything that's happened to the industry over the last 12 months, with studios big and small having to down-size or outright shut up shop after failing to make back their development costs, I do worry how long that excitement will last when Unknown 9 launches later this summer.</blockquote>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, it's probably because something similar happened recently with multiplayer shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>. After a financially disastrous launch, the studio behind the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">unceremoniously shut down</a> by parent company Sony earlier this month. Once again, it is the workers who are most impacted when big companies get over-excited.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a> will finally get support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> game streaming, fixing one of the most glaring omissions from the remote play device’s feature set.</p>
<p>PS Plus game streaming on PS Portal has now been added in a new system software update, and is available to PS Plus Premium members, allowing a selection of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> games to be streamed directly from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog.</p>


<p>Once you’ve updated, you need to opt in. You do this via:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open “Quick Menu” and access “Settings” on your PS Portal.</li>
<li>Select the “Cloud Streaming (Beta)” button</li>
<li>Switch the Cloud Streaming (Beta) toggle on (this will be off by default).</li>
</ol>
<p>The features available for the cloud gaming beta are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream select PS5 games in the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog
<ul>
<li>Over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog, including Dave the Diver, Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, will be accessible on PS Portal via cloud streaming*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Streaming up to 1080p/60fps**</li>
<li>DualSense wireless controller features, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, speakers, touchpad (emulated on the touch screen for PS Portal), and motion sensor***</li>
<li>PlayStation Plus Cloud storage
<ul>
<li>Save data and game progress can be stored up to 100GB and will be automatically synced with your PS5 console, making it easy to switch seamlessly between local and streaming gameplay, and between multiple devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is initially being labelled as a beta, and does have some minor compromises and feature limitations, when compared to the regular remote play experience from a home PS5 console and PS Plus in general. The biggest limitation is that you can only play PS5 games, with PS4 and PS3 game streams quite bizarrely locked off from the PS Portal. You also can’t use Game Trials, you also cannot stream games purchased from the PS Store, and you can’t use system features like party chat, the Create button, 3D audio or in-game purchases.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the system update does also fix one of the more aggravating aspects of the PS Portal, that it was just so damn loud on its quietest setting! The update patch notes also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker audio output adjustment to make the volume lower when the audio level is set to minimum</li>
<li>You will now be able to adjust settings of your PlayStation Link device from the PS Portal Settings menu, allowing you to optimize the volume and sidetone volume.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly there’s still no support for generic Bluetooth headphones. It’s either Sony’s locked in PlayStation Link headphones and earbuds, or you’d better have a wired headset handy.</p>
<p>Nobody knows why it took Sony quite so long to figure out that the PS Portal should be a PS Plus streaming device – literally everybody could see this is what it should be able to do – but it’s great to see them finally get around to adding the feature.</p>
<p>We’ll just have to see how well it performs in that role, considering that the streaming experience from a PS5 console to Portal isn’t always the best.</p>

			<p>Square Enix and Tencent's LightSpeed have finally announced the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-reportedly-in-development-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> Final Fantasy XIV Mobile. LightSpeed is developing the game with the supervision of FFXIV Director and Producer Naoki Yoshida, who stated:</p>
<p><em>It has been 11 years since Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn launched, and this new mobile game will be a sister to Final Fantasy XIV, aiming to recreate the grandeur of the original’s story and combat mechanics on mobile devices. Non-combat features, such as Disciples of the Land and Hand, will also be faithfully implemented and we look forward to growing alongside the passionate Final Fantasy XIV community.</em></p>
<p>The official website of this new version of the game includes a detailed overview of its features.</p>
<p><em><strong>Relive the Grand Tale, Confront the Primals</strong></em></p>
<p><em>In Final Fantasy XIV Mobile, you are beckoned by the Mothercrystal, carrying the light of hope to the world of Hydaelyn. Heed the Mothercrystal’s call, embrace your destiny as an adventurer, and confront the primals to deliver Eorzea from certain destruction. An epic story and endless challenges await, with every heart-wrenching moment creating unforgettable memories within this vast realm.</em></p>
<p><em>Test your skills in battle with controls optimized for mobile devices, enabling you to experience dynamic and intense combat from the palm of your hand. Immerse yourself in stunning visuals and audio as skills and boss effects dazzle, culminating in a glorious finale with a limit break!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Choose From a Myriad of Playable Races and Switch Jobs with a Single Tap</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile offers a variety of playable races, each with its own distinct appearance and background. Nine jobs will be available at launch, and the Armoury system allows you to switch jobs freely. The freedom to change roles on the fly brings endless possibilities to your adventures.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fishing, Triple Triad, and Chocobo Racing: Take a Respite from Adventuring</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Intense and thrilling battles are just one part of your journey. In your spare time, you can wander over to the Gold Saucer for some chocobo racing and the Triple Triad card game. Customize your own cozy home, take part in various festive seasonal events, or express yourself with an array of outfits and glamours for your Warrior of Light. The first release of the mobile game introduces 11 crafting and gathering classes, allowing you to experience a different pace of Eorzea; cast your line as a master fisher, become an adept miner, alchemist, and more.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Play Together or on Your Own. Enjoy a Relaxed Social Community</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile inherits the relaxed and welcoming community aspects of the original game, allowing you to enjoy social interactions the way you want. You can experience the game in your own way, whether solo or alongside other players. Beginners and mentors, party members, and even adventurers you meet by chance can become your friends. Explore the unknown, share moments of joy, and make Eorzea a better place through the bonds of friendship.</em></p>

<p>The game will begin playtesting shortly in China, and the developers hope to launch it globally soon after. You can stay up to date on the official <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</p>
<p>The visuals of Final Fantasy XIV Mobile certainly look very faithful to the highly popular PC and console MMORPG, which has now surpassed 30 million registered players (the figure includes free trial accounts) and was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-releases-patch-7-1-crossroads-for-final-fantasy-xiv-will-follow-up-with-more-updates-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with patch 7.1.</p>

<p>As noted on the <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/">game's website</a>, nine jobs will be available at launch out of the full game's 22 battle jobs. While these aren't listed, imagery suggests the likes of Black Mage, Warrior, Dragoon, Bard, and White Mage will all be playable.</p>
<p>What's more, all 11 crafting and gathering jobs will be included, as well as side activities like Triple Triad, chocobo racing, and home customisation.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14 has already received over 30 million registered players and has proven a huge success for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>. It's no wonder a mobile version is in development to boost that further.</p>
<p>This mobile version, along with the Tencent collaboration, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">rumoured back in July this year</a>. A month later, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-game-is-approved-in-china">approved in China</a>.</p>
<p>While a release date is unknown, a demo through multiple play tests will soon be available in China, with a global launch planned afterwards. Fans can pre-register now.</p>
<p>The expansion to mobile is part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's "aggressive" push to multiplatform releases</a> to "diversify earnings opportunities".</p>
<p>For current players of Final Fantasy 14, the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9b42b2425f3a680caea3281ccd65c99677cb00e2/">latest Patch 7.1</a> was released earlier this month, bringing the Final Fantasy 11 themed raid series as well as new story content.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300975/niantic-pokemon-go-data-large-geospatial-model<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Niantic has <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmodel?hl=en&amp;_bhlid=4528b8205f253061720f30633407d8060dc88335">announced</a> that it’s building a new “Large Geospatial Model” (LGM) that combines millions of scans taken from the smartphones of players of <em>Pokémon Go </em>and other Niantic products. This AI model could allow computers and robots to understand and interact with the world in new ways, the company said in a blog post <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/right-wing-social-networks-don-t-work">spotted by <em>Garbage Day</em></a>.</p><p>The LGM’s “spatial intelligence” is built on the neural networks developed as part of Niantic’s Visual Positioning System. The blog post explains that “Over the past five years, Niantic has focused on building our Visual Positioning System (VPS), which uses a single image from a phone to determine its position and orientation using a 3D map built from people scanning interesting locations in our games and Scaniverse,” and “This data is unique because it is taken from a pedestrian perspective and includes places inaccessible to cars.”</p><p>Niantic Chief Scientist Victor Prisacariu was more explicit in a <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/q-and-a-with-victor-prisacariu?hl=en">2022 Q&amp;A</a>, saying, “Using the data our users upload when playing games like <em>Ingress</em> and<em> Pokémon Go</em>, we built high-fidelity 3D maps of the world, which include both 3D geometry (or the shape of things) and semantic understanding (what stuff in the map is, such as the ground, sky, trees, etc).”</p><p>As <em>404 Media</em> points out, nobody who downloaded <em>Pokémon Go</em> in 2016 could have predicted their data would “one day fuel this type of AI product.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's update time for the PlayStation Portal, and Sony's latest release offers something markedly more exciting than usual: cloud streaming is coming to the handheld device if you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus Premium</a> member, albeit initially as a beta.
</p>
<p>
Since its launch last year, the £200 PlayStation Portal - a PS5 peripheral rather than a standalone device - has enabled owners to stream games from their console to the smaller 1080p screen, with Sony pitching it as a way to share a living room TV or play PS5 games in another room of the house. Its uses were somewhat limited then, but Sony's latest update marks the great untethering, enabling PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to play "select PS5 games" from the PS Plus Game Catalogue via the cloud, even without a PS5.

"Since Cloud Streaming (Beta) on PS Portal is still an experimental offering," Sony notes, "the features available during the beta period may change over time and may not reflect the final experience." Game Trials, the ability to stream games purchased on the PS Store, system features such as Party voice chat and game invites for select games, the Create button, 3D audio, and in-game commerce are all unavailable at these "beginning stages of publicly testing", for instance. Furthermore, players will initially only have access to PS5 games, with PS4 and PS3 games remaining unsupported for the time being. 
</p><p>
Once the beta is available, it can be accessed via an updated PS Portal by going to Quick Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Cloud Streaming (Beta), and then turning the toggle to 'on'. And if that all goes as planned, players should then see a new option on their PS Portal home screen enabling them to access games via cloud streaming. Alongside cloud streaming, Sony's latest PlayStation Portal update - which is available from today - introduces various "refinements in the audio experience", as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">detailed on the PlayStation Blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">called the PlayStation Portal</a> an "interesting gadget" when it launched last year, despite the sense "Remote Play itself isn't as good as it should be." Richard also explicitly called out the lack of cloud streaming support on the device, so it'll be interesting to see Digital Foundry's response to Sony's latest news.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/towers-of-aghasba/" data-ref-id="5000-589437">Towers of Aghasba</a> launches today on PC and PS5 as an early access game. Though that means the game isn't complete yet, it very quickly wears its Zelda inspiraitons on its sleeve thanks to the way you explore its fantastical open world often with a glider, can climb any surface, manage your stamina, and fight enemies with weapons that degrade. It's also inspired by Ghibli movies and features a former Ghibli artist on the development team. But it uses those major touchstones to present its big idea: a survival-crafting game that operates <em>in reverse</em>.</p><p>Most games of this sort--tree-punchers, I affectionately call them--task players with tearing down a local ecosystem to convert flora and fauna into homes and meals, eventually wiping out the natural landscape in favor of something that may be beautiful in its own way, but definitely paves over the world that was once on display.</p><p>Towers of Aghasba <em>does </em>ask you to pick apart some local resources to improve your own conditions, like making tools from trees and stones early on, but it's all done in service of nature, as you restore a brownish, barren landscape to a lush, healthy world full of critters and immaculate natural landmarks. In that way, it's almost like Spore, too, as you bring life to what is essentially a blank slate when you arrive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j76LZRBEQ4I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j76LZRBEQ4I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If the typical survival-crafting gameplay loop has you ready for something different, you can check out Towers of Aghasba for yourself in the launch trailer or find it on PC and PS5 starting today.</p><p>As it's an early access game, the developers have already laid out a lengthy roadmap planned well into the future, so players jumping in now can come to expect these future updates. You can check out those updates below, which include features such as new regions to explore, photo mode, more quests and NPCs, and weather effects with which you'll need to contend. The game is currently planned to be in early access until at least sometime in 2026, and playing a game early often affords early adopters a chance to help shape it in ways big or small.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4402363-unnamed%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402363" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4402363-unnamed%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402363"></a><figcaption>Towers of Aghasba roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4402363-unnamed%2810%29.jpg"></figure><p>Towers of Aghasba is available now on PC and PS5. </p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/ajax-badge-crest-logo-new</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reject-modernity-embrace-tradition-in-football.1040187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ajax-badge-crest-logo-new<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ajax, the most famous and successful club in Dutch football, have this week changed their logo (usually called a badge or crest in football) for the first time since 1991. The old one--a stylised depiction of the Greek hero Ajax made up of 11 individual lines to symbolise the 11 players on the field, and which you can see above--was great, so the news that the club was replacing it was enough to send a chill through the spines of fans the world over.</p><p>Why? Because over the last decade or two a number of proud, old football clubs across Europe have changed their badges, <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/why-football-logos-changing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swapping out storied and traditional branding for minimalist logos that look more like insurance companies</a>. I'm not here to armchair the entire field of graphic design; companies and organisations and even countries always need a new look from time to time. But in the world of football, nearly every single one of these rebrands has ended up being a downgrade for reasons far beyond the visual.</p><figure><figcaption>Juventus' old badge (left) looked like an Italian football club. Their new one, on the right, looks like someone asked an AI to draw them a picture of a failed esports league.</figcaption></figure><p>This creates problems! Fans are often unhappy at <em>any </em>change to their traditions, let alone ones inspired by things like "modernity" and "commercial interests", but some of these attempts--<a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/01/17/juventus-football-club-faces-fan-uprising-after-minimalist-new-logo-graphics-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juventus' in particular</a>--made people <em>really </em>unhappy. Sometimes fans get so unhappy that, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/01/30/leeds-united-scrap-redesigned-crest-launch-search-new-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in cases like Leeds in 2018</a>, the club is forced to scarp the redesign altogether.</p><p>For another example <a href="https://aftermath.site/aston-villa-fifa-pes-pro-evo-efootball-avfc-ecl-champions-league" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closer to my own heart</a>, Aston Villa have been through three badges in three seasons (below) after the one on the left was replaced by the one in the middle, supposedly after fan consultation, but fans didn't really like it (and everyone else said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/14g6zbv/new_aston_villa_badge_looks_a_bit_familiar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it looked too much like Chelsea</a>), so for this season it was changed <em>again </em>by...basically reverting to the older one and just making a few border changes.</p><figure></figure><p>So you can't blame other clubs, like Bayern Munich (below), from being so adverse to any radical changes that when it comes time to modernise their badge they simply make the slightest tweak imaginable (in this case just a few colour changes, which depending on the screen you're reading this on might not even be visible).</p><figure></figure><p>Thankfully, Ajax have decided to buck this trend, introducing a new badge (below) that instead of being less detailed is significantly more so, fleshing out our tragic hero and son of King Telamon in a way that makes the crest look like a coin that has just been uncovered by a team of archaeologists. Which is fitting, because the badge <em>is </em>old; it's essentially a rebirth of Ajax's branding from 1928-1991, less of an exercise in reinventing the club, more about going back to their roots. </p><figure></figure><p>I love it! And more importantly, their fans seem to love it too; for a club based on a classical hero, that's over 100 years old and has a long legacy of success, a classical badge makes sense! This has been a great and rare triumph in modern football branding, and is something that other fields--<a href="https://paradise.london/journal/fashion-shot-the-serif-homogeneous-logos-and-luxury-branding-intertwine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I'm looking at you, fashion, with your endemic "blanding"</a>--might do well to remember as well.</p><p>Modernising and simplifying a logo might sound like a great idea across a boardroom table, but when the thing you're rebranding isn't just old as hell, but also means a great deal to average people, you don't always need to look forwards to find a fresh look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It'd be fair to say the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">live-action Minecraft movie's first trailer</a> didn't exactly arrive to rapturous applause. But now Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures are back for a second try, this time unleashing the deep Steve lore, tree punching, teleporting Ender Pearls, an unfortunate incident involving a chicken, and even an adorable square bee.
</p>
<p>
It all kicks off with some backstory for Jack Black's gloriously bejumpered Steve, detailing how he chiselled his way to a "wonderland where anything you can imagine is possible, as long as what you imagine can be built out of blocks". One brisk dance sequence later, and we're reintroduced to our cast of more recent newcomers to this strange world: Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (played by Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks). Sadly, there's still no sign of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-adds-jennifer-coolidge-to-its-star-studded-cast">Jennifer Coolidge</a>, which is where my primary interest in this whole endeavour lies, but I can wait.
</p>
<p>
But even without everybody's favourite yacht evacuator, it all looks like a harmless bit of enjoyable fluff, featuring Jack Black as his usual effervescent self, some energetic CGI (although the art style is still a little jarring), and - in this second trailer at least - enough Minecraft easter eggs to sate even the most militant eight-year-old fan. It even finds time for a bit of ye olde mild peril - complete with zombies and arrow-launching skeletons - when night falls at the end.

<p>
"Four misfits," explains the official blurb if you're looking for more context, "find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve."
</p><p>
"Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world." And if we can somehow ignore that second paragraph until it pops right out of existence, it doesn't actually sound that bad.
</p>
<p>
The Minecraft movie arrives in cinemas on 4th April next year, and there's also an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">animated Minecraft series on the way</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>, if the whole live-action thing doesn't appeal.

Everybody brings their own special personal connection to the game.”</p><p>One of the big questions was why the<em> Minecraft </em>movie is live-action with tons of VFX instead of just being completely CGI-animated as fans may have expected a movie based on the hit survival crafting game to be. A fan-made trailer that was basically a shot-for-shot remake of the official one, only in <em>Minecraft</em> itself, seemed designed to provoke this question and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Alumio_/status/1832765840925880633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832765840925880633%7Ctwgr%5Ecbd372b14163693df74e0e787bdb42aa4565b322%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fdivisive-minecraft-movie-trailer-remade-in-animated-style-and-fans-love-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Alumio_/status/1832765840925880633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832765840925880633%7Ctwgr%5Ecbd372b14163693df74e0e787bdb42aa4565b322%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fdivisive-minecraft-movie-trailer-remade-in-animated-style-and-fans-love-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly went viral</a></span>. </p><p> “I mean, that was one of the things [fans were saying in response to the trailer]: ‘Why is it live action? Why isn’t it animated?’ I think a lot of people were expecting that, and just the fact that there was live action and directly real-life characters and physical sets didn’t feel right with them, because in their imagination, they’ve been playing it for a very long time,” Olafsson told <em>IGN</em>. “And they’ve kind of projected and seen a bunch of content obviously that’s been made both by us, the community, we’ve made a story mode. We made animated content before, and there’s a lot of it out there.”</p><p> Olafsson explained that one of the reasons to do a live-action adaptation was precisely because it was different and hadn’t already been done before. It was also something that had been put in motion long ago. Warner Bros. began working with <em>Minecraft</em> maker Mojang to produce a movie as far back as 2014, and the current version set to release in 2025 is the result of a long and messy process, with the project changing creative hands several times. </p><p> “This movie’s been in development for a very, very long time,” Olafsson said. “A lot of the people who will see it were not born when the first contracts and the first discussions were had, and there was always going to be live action.” </p><p>According to Hess, there were also a lot of things, like Momoa using the crafting table, that just didn’t come across right in the rapidly edited context of the initial trailer. The duo seem confident that the way those gameplay elements are communicated and fleshed out in the movie itself will make a lot more sense to long-time fans. </p><p>Apparently, early test audiences agree. The pair say early screenings of the <em>Minecraft </em>movie, even without completed VFX, have garnered positive feedback, unlike that first trailer. “People are like, ‘This is nothing like the trailer. This movie is awesome,’” Olafsson said. The movie is set to release on April 4 of next year. A second trailer, released today, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319">looks a lot better</a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadokawa_Corporation#Group_companies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goes on</a>. Hoovering up the Japanese mega-conglomerate is definitely an idea, but here’s another: Don’t!&nbsp;</p><p>Mergers and acquisitions haven’t been so great for the people who make games in recent times – both in the increasingly un-hallowed halls of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s rivals</a> and specifically at Sony. This year alone, it <a href="https://aftermath.site/playstation-laying-off-900-people-8-of-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off 900 people</a> – or eight percent of its workforce – across beloved, successful studios like Insomniac, Naughty Dog, and Guerrilla. Bungie, a relatively recent addition to Sony’s portfolio, was also <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to lay off</a> 220 people and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/sony-carves-off-more-of-bungie-the-creative-studios-team-is-now-officially-a-part-of-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beam up into the Sony mothership</a> to churn out live service games. Most recently, Sony <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down <em>Concord </em>developer Firewalk Studios</a>, another recent acquisition, after its costly debut game failed to gain immediate traction.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony’s reputation in the anime and manga space has also taken some recent hits. The Japanese giant owns Funimation, which acquired near-ubiquitous anime streaming service Crunchyroll in 2021, after which Funimation shut down its own streaming service, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065940/funimation-shutdown-crunchyroll-digital-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wiping users’ digital libraries and subjecting them to significant price hikes</a>. Crunchyroll management has also recently come under fire for allegedly <a href="https://animesuperhero.com/voice-actor-david-wald-leaves-crunchyroll-over-companys-alleged-mail-tampering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tampering with a voice actor’s private mail</a>, causing the actor, David Wald, to drop his roles with the company. Other actors have accused Crunchyroll of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mob-psycho-100-crunchyroll-kyle-mccarley-sag-aftra-1849559684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-union behavior</a>.</p><p>What if we <em>didn’t </em>feed the aforementioned Kadokawa subsidiaries into the mashing maw of that infernal machine? What if, instead, we broke up both Sony and Kadokawa? Wouldn’t that be fun? More fun, perhaps, than even a sequel to <em>Bloodborne</em>? Alas, this deal will probably sail through without issue, but I can dream.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

More people are happy about that—people love those daggone <em>Equalizers</em>.”</p><p>Yes, we do love those daggone <em>Equalizer</em> films. That’s why each of the three films in the franchise has averaged a hefty $190 million at the box office. Typically, when actors of Washington’s esteemed pedigree do these wildly successful but artistically unchallenging films, it’s to fund projects they actually want to make. Do you think Robert Downey Jr. spent a decade inside a red fake robot suit in hopes of winning an Oscar? Washington subscribed to this same thinking, until he realized the impact of films like <em>The Equalizer</em>.</p><p>“I’ll sometimes say to myself, ‘One’s for me, one’s for them.’ So, for example, <em>Othello</em>: We’re doing it on Broadway and then a movie. That’s for me. But I’ve come to realize that the <em>Equalizer</em> films are for me, too, because they’re for the people,” he explains. “They want me to go get the bad guys. ‘We can’t get them, so you go get them.’ And I say, ‘Okay, I’ll get them! Just wait right there. I’ll be right back!’”</p><p>Is it irrational to have such an emotional attachment to a movie character that you yearn for them to fight bad guys who don’t exist? Sure, somewhat. Is that attachment the core reason why putting moving images on screens is a multi-million dollar business in America? Absolutely! And Denzel understands that.</p><p>This revelation from Washington all but ensures that he’ll be a leading man in an action film in his 70s. It’s not unheard of. Heck, Charles Bronson was 72 years old and still playing a similar vigilante in another long-standing action film franchise when he starred in <em>Death Wish V: The Face of Death</em>. Antoine Fuqua, director of every <em>Equalizer</em> film, even said in 2023 that he’s tossed around the idea of using <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/movies/the-equalizer-3-director-denzel-washington-de-aging-for-origin-story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/movies/the-equalizer-3-director-denzel-washington-de-aging-for-origin-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de-aging technology</a></span> on Washington for an <em>Equalizer</em> origin story.</p><p>If these are possibly some of the final action films for Washington, who said he will scale back his output significantly, they should do anything and everything to make sure one of the greatest actors of all time goes out looking like a badass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I don’t play bingo, so I didn’t have a bingo card available specifically for this situation (sorry!), but it appears Sony wants you to play more video games within its ecosystem, so the company’s pushing a new update for the PlayStation Portal today. The update includes cloud streaming, which is still in beta, with support for 120 PlayStation 5 titles available via the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog.
