			<p>fYesterday, Polish developer People Can Fly <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it is co-developing the upcoming prequel Gears of War: E-Day with The Coalition. People Can Fly has a long history with the franchise, having ported the first installment to PC and having led the development of Gears of War: Judgment, so it's a return home in a way for them.</p>
<p>PCF CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski stated:</p>
<p><em>Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.</em></p>
<p>Guillaume Barry, Development Director at PCF, said:</p>
<p><em>Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations. While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on.</em></p>
<p>Mike Crump, Studio Head at The Coalition, added:</p>
<p><em>Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic. We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, Gears of War: E-Day will take fans back fourteen years before the events of the first entry, to Emergence Day, when the Locust Horde first emerged from the underground of the planet Sera to wreak havoc among humans. This will provide the chance to explore the beginning of the narrative as well as the birth of the close friendship between Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago.</p>
<p>No&nbsp;<span>official release window has been provided yet, although rumors&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">point</a> to a launch sometime this year—and a PlayStation 5 port <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also be on the cards</a></span>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-vegas-mod-fallout-nuevo-mexico-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lead developer on ambitious-looking <i>Fallout: New Vegas&nbsp;</i>mod<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has canceled the project in order to prioritize his "mental health" and to "face reality".</p>

<p>In a message shared on the mod's Discord server (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-cancelled-prioritize-mental-health/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), developer Zapshock says that while&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has been his "passion" and "obsession" for years, the project's workload and costs are "too great".</p>

<p>As such, continuing with&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>'s development "simply isn't sustainable for [Zapshock] and everyone involved, including voice actors", and so the decision was made to cancel the project. Zapshock says the decision was "painful", but "necessary".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=1SqRHiLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=EcpTjdIf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ambitious&nbsp;<em>New Vegas&nbsp;</em>mod&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has sadly been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Before its cancellation,&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>was set to be a mod roughly the size of one of the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series' DLC packs, and it would have taken you to the US state of New Mexico, as the name suggests.</p>

<p>The mod was to be set five years after the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, putting it several decades before the events of&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>, both of which take place as humanity is beginning to rebuild something resembling a coherent society.</p>

<p>Per a Game Rant <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-new-vegas-mods-good-nuevo-mexico-scripting/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> from February last year, the modders were planning to include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>-style origins for characters in&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, including one for a ghoul character, which would have fundamentally changed the mod's gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Honestly, it sounds to me like it's no wonder the mod was canceled; Zapshock and his team clearly had an insane level of ambition for&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, and with just four people working on the project, they were bound to burn out sooner or later.</p>




<p><em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod to have been canceled in recent months; back in October, the developers of&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, a mod that attempted to remake the entirety of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>in the fourth game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended" rel="nofollow">shut down their mod</a> due to "a combination of factors".</p>

<p>If you are looking for a DLC-sized&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod experience, however, all is not lost. There's still&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now" rel="nofollow">launched in July last year</a>&nbsp;and which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow">attracted a million downloads</a> by October. It's a&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod, though, so you'll need the base game to play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/598008/atari-nubeo-asteroids-watch-retro-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Atari has released a collection of new watches with a unique design that celebrates the 45th anniversary of <em>Asteroids</em>. In the original version of the game that debuted in 1979, spotting and shooting a passing UFO would earn you extra points. On the Asteroids watch, a pair of orbiting UFOs are less of a threat and are instead used to represent the hour and minute hands — no numbers needed.</p><p>Created in collaboration with watchmaker Nubeo (which previously released a collection of <a href="https://nubeowatches.com/collections/space-invaders-limited-edition"><em>Space Invaders</em>-themed timepieces</a>) the new Asteroids collection features five styles, each with a differently colored band — nebula blue, plasma pumpkin, supernova red, nova nightfall, and celestial citrine — and varying colors for the watchface elements. They’re <a href="https://nubeowatches.com/collections/atari-limited-edition">available through Nubeo’s website</a>, which lists each watch’s price as being discounted to $499 from $1,650. You can also <a href="https://atari.com/collections/atari-x-nubeo-watches">order them through Atari’s website</a>, which just lists the price as $499 each, although some have already sold out. Each style is limited to just 125 pieces.</p><p>The watch uses a Japanese automatic movement that powers three spinning discs. The smallest features a recreation of the game’s simple triangular spaceship in the center that serves as the watch’s second hand, while two larger discs, rotating at different speeds, portray asteroids drifting through space and the UFOs that function as the hour and minute hands.</p><p>All of the graphical elements on the Asteroids watch’s face are printed with glow-in-the-dark “Swiss Super-LumiNova” pigments and are protected beneath a durable sapphire lens and a stainless steel case. The watch is water resistant with a 21 ATM (atmosphere) rating and a screw-down crown, making it durable enough for recreational diving. It comes in a protective case with an interior that borrows design elements from the Atari Video Computer System (VCS) that launched in 1977.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Did you have a tamagotchi as a kid? I did, and yes, I too let it die. I am thankful that the handheld LCD graphics of the era did not allow me to witness my companion blob's amiable decline into shit-caked starvation. I am also thankful that my tamagotchi did not itself have a tamagotchi, because the only life principle I ever taught my tamagotchi was neglect. This is also the reason I may never play the reportedly pretty decent virtual pet game Yoke Heroes: A Long Tamago, whose developers 14 Hours Productions are defying God and Man by developing another virtual pet sim inside it.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Before I peel back the metafictional layers I guess I should tell you briefly about Yolk Heroes itself, which featured in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yolk-heroes-a-long-tamago">one of Alice0's (RPS in peace) screenshot round-ups</a>, many moons ago. The gist: some Dark Lord is causing a nuisance. The Fairy Queen has tasked you with hatching out and nurturing an Elf hero to take the villain down. I'm not as familiar with elf reproduction as I should be but I've played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and I'm 75% sure elves don't come from eggs. Still, I like the looks of the game's "idle RPG" malarkey. It sounds like I'll have plenty of time to get the laundry done while my chickelf is busy grinding level-1 rats.
</p>
<p>
"Part digital pet game, part RPG adventure, and part casual idle game, Yolk Heroes is a charming blend of many different elements," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417850/Yolk_Heroes_A_Long_Tamago/">Steam page</a> explains. "Quest and grind to protect the citizens of the realm, or simply enjoy your digital friend!" Here be tray-tray to wash that down. Game Boy Color-flavoured art direction = good.

Hearty, innocent fun, you might think. The user reviews certainly paint a rosy picture. But now for the horrifying twist: the devs are making another virtual pet game called Poke Place, rendered in simpler monochrome pixelart. It fits snugly inside Yolk Heroes, "so your Virtual Pet can have Virtual Pets". 
</p><p>
"You know you've always wanted this!" explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2417850/view/547851035326023072?l=english">a new Steam post</a>, with an air of jovial malice so concentrated I can feel my skin exfoliating as I read. "Poke place is pronounced to rhyme with yolk. Poke being slang for little buddy and all that. It won't have any plot importance, but it will have the importance of getting to raise a little fairy thing! Also, some of the best pixel art we did for the project but ended up being cut from the main game is being re-used to give it some real pizzazz!"
</p>
<p>
While games-within-the-game aren't unusual - even Call Of Duty likes to Nolan it up now and then - the disturbing element here is that Poke Place is billed as a game for your Virtual Pet, not you. Will your chickelf treat the "little fairy thing" as they themselves were treated? Is this where our fond technological ambitions have led us, to a place where tamagotchis are smart enough to let their own tamagotchis perish in a cascade of doleful emojis and poop?</p>
<p>Ah, but perhaps the tamagotchis will learn different lessons from our colossal frivolity and apathy. Perhaps your chickelf will strive to be a better custodian and mentor for their fairy sprog than you ever were for them. Honestly, this sounds worse: your virtual pet is going to make you feel bad about yourself. It's a facet of the AI utopia/dystopia debate I hadn't considered.
</p>
<p>
It's not clear when Poke Place will be added to Yolk Heroes, but 14 Hours Productions are hoping to release the update later this year. No guarantees, though, because "the lead developer on it also has a full time job NOT working on cute games like this, so it's a bit slow going! Bills are hard!" Fair play. I will end this with the thought that while I've played many a game-within-the-game, I've yet to play a game-within-the-game-within-the-game. I suspect this idea has probably occurred to 14 Hours Productions. I hope they give that "little fairy thing" a virtual pet game too, so that my chickelf can experience the terrible vertigo I'm feeling right now.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft%E2%80%99s-internal-memo-says-recent-layoffs-is-due-to-%E2%80%9Cmore-efficient-operating-models%E2%80%9D.1093887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-layoffs-memo-to-staff/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<div><p>Following 185 layoffs and a studio shutdown, Ubisoft has sent an internal memo to staff via its Agoro Newsroom about the recent layoffs, saying that the decision was made due to “finding more efficient operating models and to ensure our long-term success.”</p><p>The internal memo confirms that approximately 65 positions where eliminated at Ubisoft Dusseldorf, approximately 100 roles are effected at Ubisoft Leamington and Ubisoft Reflections, and approximately 20 roles at Ubisoft Stockholm, taking the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-another-studio-185-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total to 185 people laid off</a>. In addition, Ubisoft’s Leamington site would be shut down.</p></div>



<p>The update reads,</p>



<p>“Jeff Combos, Studio Manager of Ubisoft Dusseldorf, informed the studio yesterday about a plan to reduce its headcount by approximately 65 positions. Most of these reductions would affect production roles currently not assigned to active development for a prolonged period of time. The studios in Berlin and Mainz are not affected.</p>



<p>Also yesterday, Lisa Opie, Managing Director of the UK studios informed the teams about planned restructuring measures aimed at ensuring Reflections’ long-term stability and meeting its financial targets. Approximately 100 roles could be made redundant across Ubisoft Leamington and Ubisoft Reflections. Additionally, this proposal also includes the decision to close the Leamington site.</p>



<p>“I understand the uncertainty these changes will bring. We are committed to supporting everyone who may be impacted during this transition. Let me assure you, these decisions were not made lightly. We believe they are essential to improve our operational efficiency and ensure the long-term sustainability of our studios, the zone and the company,” says Benedikt Grindel, Production Zone 4 Managing Director.</p>



<p>In parallel, Ubisoft Stockholm announced yesterday its plan to reduce approximately 20 roles. This step is necessary to secure the studio’s long-term success and refine the studio strategy.</p>



<p>Individual meetings were held with affected employees yesterday.</p>



<p>“We know that this decision impacts more than just the studio and its projects; it impacts people-our colleagues, teammates, and friends. We deeply understand how difficult this is, and supporting everyone through this transition is our utmost priority,” Thomas Andren, Production Zone 3 and Stockholm studio Managing Director, said yesterday in his message to the team.</p>



<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>



<p>All the team members that are affected have already been informed, and necessary processes are underway depending on the labor laws in each country.</p>



<p>While difficult, the changes announced yesterday are targeted at us finding more efficient operating models and to ensure our long-term success. This is driven by a strong conviction: our ability to keep creating and operating unique, powerful, and popular brands that extend beyond video games.”</p>



<p>Speaking with both current and former employee’s at Ubisoft, it’s currently unclear on if any Ubisoft projects where effected with the recent layoffs. It’s understood that Ubisoft Reflections are primarily developing an unannounced WW2 live-service extraction shooter named CREST, which was supported by some staff at Ubisoft Leamington. Ubisoft Leamington staff where working on Avatar content.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft is currently in the process of exploring its options to stay afloat, including a potential deal with&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese company Tencent</a>, where both companies are in talks for a new venture centered around Ubisoft’s current assets.</p>



<p>When asked for comment on whether or not any projects were cancelled, a Ubisoft spokesperson declined to comment.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is one of the largest and most well-known video game companies in the world. Known for franchises such as EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Battlefield, and more, EA’s presence in the industry is felt almost everywhere. Because of that, EA’s earnings reports are closely watched by analysts, investors, and consumers alike. </p>



<p>That makes it important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into EA’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and general outlooks for the months ahead.</p>

Lastly, the company prepared investors for lower-than-expected net bookings after it revealed that both EA Sports FC 25 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed</a> to meet internal revenue expectations.</p>



<p>With the lower results, EA adjusted its expected net bookings for the quarter from $2.4-$2.5 billion to $2.21 billion.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-ea-earnings-report">The Last EA Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When EA announced its earnings for Q2 FY2025 last October, it was revealed that the company broke a record for Q2 net bookings of $2.08 billion. It was also mentioned that the company expected American Football to generate over $1 billion alone in net bookings for FY2025. Lastly, EA said that 74% of all net bookings for the prior 12 months came via Live Services.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-earnings-calls">What Are Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

Meanwhile, when actual sniping starts, Sniper at Work promises "realistic ballistics, wind physics, and breathing control."

If you registered through the Xbox Insider Programme, the Baldur’s Gate 3 Stress Test application is now live in the Xbox Insider Hub for you to download.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you were one of the PS5 players who downloaded Patch 8 early, Larian said you can roll back to Patch 7 by deleting and reinstalling the game. “Think of it as a time-travel mechanic,” the developer said in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/539969735985464667" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an update on Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Patch 8 stress test, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC players will be able to test out cross-play by either creating or joining a lobby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 8 also adds split-screen to Xbox Series S. Split-screen on Microsoft’s less powerful console was cited as the cause of Baldur’s Gate 3’s delay on Xbox, given the company’s commitment to parity between Xbox Series S and X for all games. Microsoft ultimately made an exception for Baldur's Gate 3 so it could launch later in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there’s photo mode and 12 new subclasses to get stuck into. Larian hasn’t said when Patch 8 will be made available generally, but it’s expected later in 2025.

The update adds new, gruesome cinematics for some of the game’s evil endings, new legendary actions for Honor Mode encounters, and official in-game mod support.</p><p>However, with Patch 7 comes a big ole asterisk from the game’s maker, Larian Studios. The patch is currently only available for PC, meaning that players will be unable to load cross-platform save files from PC on their console versions. PC / Mac multiplayer is also disabled. Larian says that it intends to launch Patch 7 on consoles and Mac sometime in October, so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827343/baldurs-gate-3-reactivates-ps5-cross-saves">if you like to hop between desktop and console to play <em>BG3</em></a>, you’ll have to wait about a month.

According to Larian, the toolkit supports the creation of new items, classes and subclasses, races, and more.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjU4ODk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Baldur’s Gate 3 mod support is coming in September</a></h2><div><p>It’s gonna get pretty funky in Faerûn with official mod support coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Larian Studios announced that official mod support will roll out in phases, starting today with a closed alpha, before a closed beta test in July, culminating with the official release of Patch 7 in September. According to Larian, the staggered testing phases will give the community ample time to test the new mod tools before making them available across PC and consoles.</p><p>If you have experience with official mod support in games like <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>Fallout</em>, Larian’s approach will sound similar. On PC, mods will be tested to ensure terms of service compatibility and overall stability before approval. Those mods will then undergo additional approvals before coming to console. While PC players will have access to the full suite of mod creation tools, and mods can still be made, downloaded, and played without using the official mod browser, console players will only be able to browse and install mods officially approved by Larian.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzIzMDU=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">Baldur’s Gate 3 developer is moving on from Dungeons and Dragons</a></h2><div><p>With the sheer popularity surrounding <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the game is ripe for an expansion — but if it ever happens, it won’t be made by its developer Larian Studios.

I’m reminded of this by the utterly bizarre reaction to the most recent <em>Superman</em> TV spot, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1883606788249206932&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1883606788249206932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared by James Gunn</a></span> and responded to by those who purport to be the movie’s future audience as if he’s committed a war crime. Stop it! Everyone just stop it! You’re liking things all wrong, and it’s ruining it for everyone.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>So, by “fans” I mean the word very literally, “fanatics.” I don’t mean those who engage with media by playing, watching, or reading with a desire to find enjoyment: I mean those who believe they are in a relationship with the work, that there’s some sort of two-way communication going on. These inverted parasocial relationships, where the audience believes itself in authority over the subject, are having a grim effect on culture. We’ve reached a position where a director is immediately defending himself against an onslaught of wildly inaccurate and frankly concerning criticism from those who believe themselves in charge of how an unreleased film is supposed to be. And, as a consequence, those with the money are starting to believe this madding crowd needs to be heard.</p><p>On January 26, James Gunn—the director of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> movies, and the person now in charge of DC’s cinematic universe—shared via X a new teaser for his forthcoming <em>Superman</em>.</p><p>I am a Superman skeptic. Not a <em>Superman</em> skeptic, because I’ve yet to see the movie that hasn’t been released, so have no rational basis on which to form an opinion. But boy do I have Superman opinions. I dislike how people making films or TV shows never seem to know how to cope with this specific character, seeing his innate, all-powerful nature as an issue that needs to be removed. That’s a fascinating problem to solve! You have this essentially immortal god, a being of absolute power to tell stories about, but no one seems to know how to portray him without instantly resorting to reducing him to mortality, whether by weakening him or opposing him with an equally powerful enemy. I have a “Time to Kryptonite” meter on which all Superman fiction is judged, and almost all of it fails miserably. (I know nothing about comics, including <em>Superman </em>comics, and expect this has all been far more interestingly investigated there.)</p><p>I must make an aside for the recently concluded <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, that repeatedly failed on Time to Kryptonite in every one of its arcs, but actually handled the challenge better than everything else. It showed Superman’s genuine, consequential vulnerabilities: his love for his family, his grief for his parents, his terror at his wife’s cancer, his panic at his son’s crippling anxiety disorder. All of this made an immortal figure meaningful, albeit constantly undermined by yet another weaker enemy using various colors of Kryptonite to punch him in the face.</p><p>I worry James Gunn’s movie could do the same but less effectively, taking this fascinating dilemma and rendering it moot by saying some green rocks make it go away. That would be disappointing. However, I’m not organizing a campaign to demand he not do this, nor declaring the film will be obsolete should he do so. I’m not under any delusion that I’m in any form of dialogue with this piece of art: I will be its supplicant viewer.</p><figure id="" data-id="d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-recommend-id="image://d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1791" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-recommend-id="image://d001153c787c3fd5758739cc25ee9082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1791" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fire-breathing lizard beast in the streets of Metropolis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not so for those who responded to Gunn’s short clip. The 30 seconds of context-less images includes three seconds of Superman flying through some ice, presumably near his Fortress of Solitude. I watched it and thought this: “There’s Superman, flying past some ice. Ooh, he rolled over.” I had no further thoughts about that moment, more interested in other aspects like the role of the yellow flag and the potential silliness of a Godzilla-like creature rampaging through Metropolis.</p><p>But this, I have since learned, is not how the film’s “fans” responded. They are <em>furious</em> about those three seconds of flying. Livid. Their reaction has become “viral.” It has offended vast numbers of people who believe themselves the movie’s core audience, and they’re explaining to Gunn in their thousands about how he’s misused CGI, the ways in which he’s messed up some face-replacement technology, and how actor David Corenswet’s eye is millimeters out of line and thus the film is a disaster. (I wish any of this was an exaggeration.)</p><p>This reached such a pitch that Gunn felt the need to respond (nooooo!) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DFVZvy0A1sd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/DFVZvy0A1sd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Threads</a></span>, calmly stating that the entire furor over his CG-based crime exists only in the imaginations of the angry mob.</p><p>“There is absolutely zero CG in his face,” Gunn explains. “People’s faces can look different when you put a wide angle lens up close. The background plate in Svalbard is 100% real as is David.”</p><p>So yeah, the criticisms were conspiracies, entire mobs built around this unforgiveable faux pas that hadn’t taken place. They needed to find <em>something</em> wrong, something that couldn’t pass their perfection test, grabbed hold of this (despite the damned Godzilla), and were utterly wrong. It was only ever a cool, practical flying effect, like it looked.</p><p>The endless criticisms about Corenswet’s eyes gets to me more than anything else. Firstly, it’s something people spotted by pausing a three second clip on a monitor in front of their face, forgetting that this is a movie intended to be watched in a theater and no rational person would even study the exact positions of his eyeballs in those circumstances. It’s a fuss about <em>nothing</em>. And what if those are just his eyes?! For God’s sake, the actor who plays Lois in <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, Elizabeth Tulloch, has strabismus, meaning her eyes point in slightly different directions at all times. It’s a normal thing. God,  you awful people.</p><figure id="" data-id="0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-recommend-id="image://0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1700" data-height="956" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-recommend-id="image://0afd57c7072077cfb6b536a453cdfd0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1700" data-height="956" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman, bruised and cut, lying in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I can’t tell you the number of podcasts and YouTube channels I’ve given up on, because the creators spend their entire time worrying about, or directly responding to, the loudest voices in their audience. I struggle to think of any I’ve stuck with that aren’t plagued by this issue. A constant, spoken concern about the portion of their audience who doesn’t like, or doesn’t accept, or doesn’t tolerate, some small aspect of what they do. It’s mostly delivered jokingly, “Ooh, don’t say that, you know what our DMs will be like!” but it’s never with any humor. It’s fear. A show’s fans can cause its creators fear.</p><p>And the mistake is the two-way engagement. Before the internet, the movies, TV shows, books, games, plays, whatever, were the authority. They defiantly existed, and the audience either liked them or disliked them in futile near-privacy. Their means of affecting their existence lay purely in choosing whether to continue being the audience. If they didn’t like the show, they didn’t tune in. If they hated the book, they didn’t buy the next one. They could tell their friends to join or not join the audience, and that was effective, but based on their own real-life relationships. Sure, critics had some influence too, but this again was a one-way communication with an audience that mutely chose whether to engage.</p><p>And movies and TV shows and games weren’t worse for it back then! It turns out, they didn’t need to be told what to do by an audience that hadn’t yet watched or read or played them in order to create excellent art. Based on the thousands of years of evidence, it’s perhaps reasonable to conclude it’s not a vital part of the creative process. Yet, today, a piece of media’s purported audience sees itself as so utterly crucial that without its constant input, only terrible things can result.</p><p>“Thank goodness we were there to tell James Gunn not to use bad CG on Superman’s face in that one flying scene!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXuDCDE7vmg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXuDCDE7vmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they tell themselves</a></span>, likely never bothering to listen to the response that there was no CG, good or bad. Almost definitely not replying to say, “Oh, I’m sorry, I was completely wrong.” (I checked. They didn’t.)</p><p>Instead, when their fury is contradicted by regular people saying, “Ooh, I enjoyed that teaser! Can’t wait to see the movie!” their reaction is to create even more elaborate, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa79mQ9tpKs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa79mQ9tpKs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deranged theories</a></span> that explain these normal people as evil agents.</p><figure id="" data-id="414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-recommend-id="image://414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1750" data-height="984" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-recommend-id="image://414a25f8fde78b1b0dd69cd95a7fd891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1750" data-height="984" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman protects a small child from an explosion of cannisters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But this obviously isn’t unique to this incident. It’s everything, all of the time, this irrationally entitled belief that the media you consume owes you something. That you are the authority now, that the subject must bend to your whim, and deviance from this is terrible customer service that must be punished. It’s horrible.</p><p>Everyone’s liking everything wrong, and it’s spoiling it! For god’s sake, all creators, you have to stop responding to these voices, too. They aren’t your audience, and when you listen to them, you misrepresent the vast majority of people who are waiting to enjoy your output. Whether it’s a podcast constantly falling over itself to avoid an email, or a movie studio panicking because some loud group of dumbasses made a bunch of YouTube videos, just ignore them. They will never be satisfied, it will never be good enough, and their motivations are suspect and unspecific. </p><p>If only our artists would re-establish and reinforce the one-way relationship, reclaim the authority. And then once something exists, listen to curated, informed voices whose goal is to see something be the best it can be, not to tear it down to bathe in its entrails.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new extremely handy Steam Deck mod is now available for download, allowing users to use AMD FSR 3 Frame Generations in games that support NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation for significantly improved performance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decky Framegen Plugin</a> is a Steam Deck plugin that replaces the NVIDIA DLSS DLL with the FSR 3.1 DLL, allowing users to use Frame Generation in Steam Deck in games that do not natively support AMD's tech, such as Black Myth Wukong, Final Fantasy XVI, Hogwarts Legacy and The Witcher 3, as showcased in a very informative video put together by Deck Wizard which also provides detailed installation instructions. While the end results aren't always perfect, as there are some visual issues such as ghosting in Final Fantasy XVI, for example, the mod definitely helps make more games playable with acceptable performance on Steam Deck, although games running below 30 FPS won't benefit too much from it due to the input lag caused by the low base framerate.</p>

<p>Since its release back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>, the Steam Deck has become an incredibly popular gaming system, essentially bringing forth the age of handheld PCs that doesn't seem will end anytime soon. Following the launch of the original model, Valve released a slightly upgraded model featuring a gorgeous <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-679-usd-an-all-white-exterior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OLED screen</a> and a few other improvements, but the company doesn't seem interested in doing <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-wont-be-doing-yearly-steam-deck-releases/">yearly releases</a>, despite the demand. Earlier this month, it was rumored that a new version of the system powered by the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-amd-ryzen-2-not-works/">AMD Ryzen Z2 APU</a> was in the works, but Valve quickly squashed the rumors, so it will definitely be a while until we will be able to get a proper Steam Deck 2 in our hands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has delayed the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>story DLC out of the game's sixth year, but it looks like the third season will remain on the cards for February.</p>

<p>In an X <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884255116636705006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Ubisoft says that it wants to "deliver the best possible experience" for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC, and so it "will not ship during Year 6". That likely means it won't be released until at least summer this year, although it could be even longer.</p>

<p>The DLC was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-heartland-division-2-resurgence-news" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2023</a>&nbsp;and was initially intended to be part of the game's fifth year of content, adding new zones, main missions, and "a whole new endgame structure" towards the end of 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=UDvPwOZ5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=TnDQ-HoP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC has been delayed again.</figcaption></figure><p>However, in December 2023, the game's story DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-launches-project-resolve-to-improve" rel="nofollow">was delayed</a>&nbsp;beyond 2024, making this the second time the DLC has been pushed back. Perhaps appropriately, that first delay was revealed alongside "Project Resolve", an initiative that aimed to improve&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>across the board.</p>

<p>Ubisoft hasn't revealed a new release date for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC. Honestly, at this stage, I don't think I'd be surprised if the expansion was canned altogether, although perhaps the game still enjoys a sizable enough player base for these delays not to spell the end.</p>

<p>The pushback of this DLC comes after what has been a pretty horrendous year for Ubisoft. The studio has endured multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">high-profile failures</a>, including&nbsp;pirate game&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, open-world adventure&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and first-person shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow"><em>XDefiant</em></a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Ubisoft has&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> its upcoming flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">twice</a>, faced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">investor unrest</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy" rel="nofollow">legal action</a>, and closed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three of its studios</a>, with several more undergoing downsizing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws.jpg?itok=CanXzuiy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws.jpg?itok=xuTsrXLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It hasn't exactly been a great year for Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC&nbsp;may not exactly be the flagship release Ubisoft has been banking on to turn its fortunes around, but this delay won't exactly come as a balm to shareholders who are already concerned the company has no clue what it's doing.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you'd like to catch up on&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>before the DLC launches (a pursuit for which it seems you'll have plenty of time), you can grab it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2221490/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-2/9nc944t50735" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, as well as on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility.</p>

                <p>The modding community can give older games a much-needed overhaul, or add an extra challenge to maybe an oversimplistic one. In recent years, we've seen everything from Resident Evil demakes to GTA upgrades--not to mention the vast landscape of Baldur's Gate 3 mods--but a new mod for 1991's Sonic the Hedgehog adjusts the game's visuals in real-time, going back and forth depending on the player's blast processing in the game.</p><p>Brandon Sheffield of Necrosoft Games showed how the mod worked on his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3lgr543otmc2n" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> account and did a quick demo.</p><p>"Vladikcomper on the SGDK Discord has created an amazing and ridiculous mod for Sonic the Hedgehog (MD) in which quality degrades to different resolutions/numbers of colors unless you fill your blast processing meter up," he said, as the game switched from widescreen to smaller size as the gameplay went on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434400-sonicdegrade2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434400-sonicdegrade2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434400"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434400-sonicdegrade2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434392-sonicdegrade2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434393-sonicdegrade3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434394-sonicdegrade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434392,1300-4434393,1300-4434394" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4434392-sonicdegrade2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4434393-sonicdegrade3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4434394-sonicdegrade.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434392-sonicdegrade2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434393-sonicdegrade3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434394-sonicdegrade.jpg"></figure><p>"Blast Processing" was the marketing term used by Sega of America to describe the processing capabilities of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive that didn't really have any technological explanation, but sounded cool.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios' chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt is to take an extended "sabbatical" from work, and when he returns, he'll be working on a new Arrowhead game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884015181895983223" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Pilestedt says that while fans have been enjoying&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>for almost a year, he's been "living it since early 2016", and if the first <i>Helldivers&nbsp;</i>is included, "since 2013".</p>

<p>He says that eleven years of working on the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>games have caused him to neglect his family, his friends, his wife, and himself, and so he wants to take some time to "redeem what was lost from all of those that supported [him] for over a decade".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical-omens-of-tyranny.jpg?itok=d_Ad7Gc7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical-omens-of-tyranny.jpg?itok=IjcaBny3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s creative lead Johan Pilestedt is taking some time out from work.</figcaption></figure><p>Expressing faith in his Arrowhead colleagues to continue doing "their utmost" to deliver "amazing stuff" for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>while he's off, Pilestedt says that on his return, he will "start working on the next Arrowhead game".</p>

<p>Whether that means he won't be involved in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>anymore going forward isn't clear, but at the very least, it seems his focus will be elsewhere for a while, so major showstopping creative updates for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>may be few and far between in future.</p>

<p>Well-wishers flocked to X to express their hope that Pilestedt enjoyed his break, with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">recent PlayStation leaver</a> Shuhei Yoshida and Kinda Funny's Greg Miller sending their best wishes to Pilestedt.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Pilestedt, he served as the CEO and chief creative officer of Arrowhead Game Studios between 2009 and last year before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo" rel="nofollow">stepping down and appointing a new CEO</a> in order to focus on his creative work.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/24350444/mythic-quest-season-4-review-apple-tv-plus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Mythic Quest</em>’s ability to spin some of the gaming industry’s ugliest aspects into genuinely funny comedy was what made it such <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv">a surprising delight when it first hit Apple TV Plus back in 2020</a>. Even when it was joking about chaotic streamers or Nazi server takeovers, you could feel the respect <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s creative team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177373/ashly-burch-interview-mythic-quest">has for video games as an art form</a>. And by keeping its focus on the lives of people who actually dream up and build games, the series put itself in a position to tell poignant stories about the costs that come with chasing one’s dreams.</p><p><em>Mythic Quest</em>’s new fourth season still gets in its fair share of solid digs at gaming culture. But the show feels like even more of a character-driven narrative that’s trying to show you how every member of the MQ crew is evolving as they move deeper into their careers. <em>Mythic Quest </em>has always had a knack for switching up its relationships and power dynamics just enough to keep its office drama element feeling fresh yet familiar. This time around, though, the shuffling is all in service of giving everyone at Mythic Quest HQ a new (but not necessarily healthier) work-life balance.</p><p>While an unhealthy amount of dysfunction has always been part of Ian Grimm’s (Rob McElhenney) creative process, <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s fourth season finds him trying to be a better colleague and friend to all of the people who have helped bring his ideas to life. It’s still a little hard for Ian to remember that Poppy Li’s (Charlotte Nicdao) return to Mythic Quest Studios with him hinged on his respecting her personal boundaries and acknowledging her as an equal in their professional relationship. Ian also can’t stand how much time Poppy wants to spend with her new artist boyfriend Storm (Chase Yi). But everyone working on Mythic Quest (the fictional game) can feel how, after years of blowing up at one another, Poppy and Ian are in a new headspace where they can genuinely appreciate how they make each other stronger. </p><p>With Mythic Quest gearing up to launch a new Playpen update giving players the ability to create their own in-game content, executive producer David Hornsby (David Brittlesbee) and monetization head Rachel Meyee (Ashly Burch) are all too happy to have Ian and Poppy onboard cooking up ideas to make the feature shine. As the creator of <em>Cozy Galaxy</em>, the most popular game on the Playpen platform, former-tester-turned-developer Dana Bryant (Imani Hakim) can’t help feeling ticked at the way she’s being cut out of all the revenue Mythic Quest is raking in. But to money shark Brad Bakshi (Danny Pudi) and cutthroat assistant Jo (Jessie Ennis), Dana’s feelings about working at Mythic Quest Studios are a sign that it’s time for them to reconsider whose team they want to play for.</p><p>Like previous seasons, <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s new episodes use the fictional in-show game to dunk on uglier aspects of the real-world gaming industry with a specificity that makes it feel like the writers room has been keeping up with the news. Playpen’s popularity is a financial boon to the Mythic Quest team because of how it presents an opportunity to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346862/genshin-impact-developer-20-million-fine-ftc-data-lootboxes">roll out more in-game currencies</a>. It also raises serious questions about whether platforms like Playpen are built with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121420/roblox-child-exploitation-robux-child-labor">the intention of capitalizing on child labor</a>.</p><p>Those questions become even thornier as players start coming up with ways to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-thinks-mods-breathe-l%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dus-request-to-please-not-give-cait-sith-a-dump-truck-ass">bring sex into their Playpen creations</a>. But even though this season of <em>Mythic Quest </em>gets its dunks in on the larger gaming industry, the show spends more time focusing on the growing pains that come when interpersonal relationships start to change for the better.</p><p>You can see it most clearly in Ian and Poppy’s arc this season as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339070/mythic-quest-season-4-trailer">the two turn to AI assistants</a> to help work through their complicated feelings about one another, but it’s also highlighted in some of the season’s episodes — one of which is an excellent <em>Clue </em>riff — that take you outside of the Mythic Quest office. We see more of what David gets up to in his free time and how the evolution of Dana and Rachel’s careers has brought new tensions into their romance. And with so many of his colleagues (who are really his only friends) pairing off, this season underscores how Ian’s prickliness with other people stems from the fact that he doesn’t have anyone to come home to.</p><p>Though digging deeper into everyone’s personal lives and easing up on the workplace shenanigans doesn’t quite move <em>Mythic Quest </em>into straight dramatic territory, it does make this season feel like you’re meant to appreciate how far these characters (and a few other surprise cameos) have come since we first met them. This season’s video game jokes aren’t <em>quite </em>as scathing as some viewers might like, but they reinforce how Mythic Quest (the game) has become something much more than another fantasy MMORPG for both its players and creators — just as Apple seems intent on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296445/mythic-quest-season-4-premiere-date-side-quest">growing the show in similar ways</a>.</p><p><em>Mythic Quest </em>also stars Naomi Ekperigin, Andrew Friedman, and Michael Naughton. Season 4 hits Apple TV Plus on January 29th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-stone-of-madness-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The stony halls and ancient walls of an old monastery are fertile ground for all kinds of horror and intrigue. The Stone of Madness is certainly filled with both, painting an eye-catching portrait of secrets and skullduggery as you sneak around, searching for an escape. As the days and nights drag on, though, the cracks in its facade show, and the initially intriguing tactical stealth falls prey to too many technical issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stone of Madness comes from developers Teku Studios and The Game Kitchen, the latter of which is best known for Blasphemous, a series of action games similarly laden with religious imagery. There are still overt religious themes and visuals here, but instead of striking down giant bosses, The Stone of Madness is all about quietly finding a way out of the 18th-century Spanish monastery that acts as your jail.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Stone of Madness Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Five prisoners make up the core of your party, hoping to escape after a brutal encounter that binds them all together. The halls are patrolled by guards, priests, nuns, and soldiers, but the motley crew of would-be escapees have plenty of ways to get around them. It's a really compelling mood to set, heightened by the interesting characters that make up this team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The holy man Alfredo, for instance, can put on priest's robes and blend in with the clergy. Old lady Agnes has witchcraft up her sleeves, casting curses on unsuspecting guards. Eduardo, the silent giant, moves boxes and breaks down walls, while the tiny Amelia can sneak through tunnels, lay down mousetraps, and pick pockets. Leonora was my go-to for most days; she can climb walls, pick locks, and drop ropes, opening up new routes for characters in the process. She can also knockout guards or even kill them, though she will harm herself out of remorse in the process.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gaining mastery over the monastery feels incredibly rewarding.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Days in The Stone of Madness alternate between daytime excursions and night-time planning. Stealing resources, uncovering clues, and completing objectives all take place in real-time during the day as you explore different areas of the monastery. At night, you can use your time and crew's skills to recuperate and scheme. Time also passes during the day, with patrol routes changing and malevolent spirits emerging as afternoon turns to evening and on to nighttime. Staying out late can mean new, rewarding opportunities, but also more dangers, which makes for some exciting thrills as you try to push your luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your characters have health, suspicion ratings, and sanity to manage, so keeping them healthy and stocked with tools for their particular skill sets is crucial. Managing the tasks you need to complete each day against your deteriorating well-being and limited night-time activities makes it feel like every victory is won against the ticking clocks of doom and entropy. Overcoming those odds, gaining mastery over the resources available, and thriving inside the walls of the monastery feels incredibly rewarding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flipping between these characters can feel a bit cumbersome while playing with a controller, but tinkering around with different combinations of abilities and options is enjoyable. Having Amelia mock an enemy and lead them into a quiet room where Leonora can knock them out, for example, captures the feeling of helming the crew of a well-planned heist. Each excursion from the team's shared cell only lets you pick three members, so you're pushed to constantly think ahead, considering who can collaborate to open the pathways or accomplish the tasks for each day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters also have their drawbacks, too. Each of the five prisoners has their own fears to cope with or cleverly work around, and forcing them into certain situations will drain their sanity. Eduardo fears the dark, for instance, while Leonora cannot bear the sight of a blazing pyre. Amelia's fear of the gargoyle statues looming throughout the halls is a constant concern when you're trying to navigate new areas or evade capture. Finding ways to avoid these problems, like lighting up darkened rooms or shooting down gargoyles with a pistol, adds more satisfying wrinkles to iron out on the way to your objective.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I ran into a ton of different control issues, bugs, and glitches.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Lose enough sanity, and a character will develop a new affliction, like claustrophobia. It's an interesting system, and I actually found it to add some compelling friction. These conditions would force me to be mindful of where I left characters standing or how I moved them through a space. If I need Eduardo to drag a big box around, I better make sure the area is well-lit, which then isn't great for sneaking around. That combination of team skills and dangers smartly encourages a lot of risky decision-making. Who can work well in this area, and what skills do you need on-hand? And who can salvage the operation when it all falls apart?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frustratingly, things can fall apart, and not always because of your own mistakes. Across the roughly 25 hours it took me to finish The Stone of Madness’ two separate campaigns, I ran into a ton of different issues, bugs, and glitches. A guard got stuck on a random piece of geometry; a character disappeared out-of-bounds while moving through a tunnel; a cutscene would pop Alfredo out of his priest robes in the middle of a populated area; and in one case, opening a chest with Eduardo caused him to "zip" through the ceiling and onto the roof… in front of a waiting patrolman.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These frequent issues are tedious enough in isolation, but in a tactical stealth game where health and resources are at a premium, it can mean a full reset of the current day (upwards of 10 minutes at a time) and any progress lost. I even started avoiding certain areas or routes because I knew I could potentially run into a day-ending issue there, stamping out plans I had laid in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Repeating these encounters also makes the control issues stand out even worse. Getting a character to lock onto the right target, interact with the right object, or even sometimes maneuver around certain obstacles always feels too finicky and unresponsive. Little annoyances compound, and it's certainly frustrating when, say, a ghost is chasing you down and you can't exorcise it because your character keeps locking onto something else nearby. The isometric camera angle doesn't always help here either, and navigating certain areas took some trial-and-error to understand just where certain hiding spots and shaded corners even were. Tack on some weird graphical issues, like characters popping up through the environment or objective markers appearing in the way of prompts, and it can all wear on you pretty fast.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The graphical issues are a shame when the art is so fantastic overall.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s particularly a shame because the art and animations are simply fantastic overall, with absolutely gorgeous models and areas on display across each campaign. Running along the tall ramparts of the monastery for the first time looked amazing. An 18th-century monastery is already a great setting choice, and The Game Kitchen uses the subject material well to create a memorable art style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each task within the monastery is a bread-crumb trail leading the five prisoners closer to freedom, while also sending them teetering down into the darker secrets hidden within its walls. The Stone of Madness is a dark story, all about the corruption and rampant abuse within a supposed asylum. Through its two campaigns, the prisoners uncover many hidden horrors, with plenty of wrinkles to force stubborn players to change up their approaches; certain areas might be difficult for your preferred characters to navigate until you've unlocked alternate pathways, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Opening these areas up and mastering them over the course of a campaign is the greatest sense of achievement The Stone of Madness has to offer. Daily objectives help guide you along, but each new zone is really a puzzle to solve on its own. Distracting a guard with one of Alfredo's sermons can let Eduardo lay down a plank, creating a bridge for Leonora to cross so she can lockpick a chest and uncover new treasure. These moments of carefully coordinated sneaking, puzzle solving, and thieving are when The Stone of Madness stands out the most.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Eric's Supreme Sneaking Missions</h3><p>Some of the best stealth games you can find... if you can find them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual stories told throughout both campaigns serve their purposes well enough. Several well-animated cutscenes make the high points resonate, but it’s mostly told through text-only dialogue windows otherwise. The named characters are certainly memorable, like Tía del Nido, the egg-collecting elderly woman who gathers gossip, or the merchant Panecillo, who wears a loaf of bread for a hat. I wish some objectives were a little more overt about where to go next, but the intrigue compelled me enough to keep checking and rechecking old haunts to track it all down, and the tips and hints are extremely generous if you want them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though there are two branching campaigns, each with their own areas to explore and stories to tell, they play out pretty similarly in terms of what you’re actually doing. Additional characters to meet, stories to uncover, and areas to sneak around can add quite a bit to the total runtime, but the twin campaigns mostly offer two distinct flavors of the same idea. Still, I enjoyed the new challenges a second route offered, especially since each campaign's final objective is a tense, thrilling challenge that lets every character shine in their own way.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The first demo of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unforgiving-fantasy-extraction-shooter-dark-and-darker-has-its-steam-next-fest-playtest-extended/1100-6511474/" data-ref-id="1100-6511474">Dark and Darker</a> debuted almost two years ago, just a few months before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-and-darker-is-getting-a-mobile-version-from-the-creators-of-pubg-mobile/1100-6517182/" data-ref-id="1100-6517182">the mobile version of the game was announced</a>. Now, Dark and Darker Mobile's North American soft launch is just a few days away, and the global launch is expected to arrive in the first half of this year.</p><p>PUBG Mobile publisher Krafton and Bluehole Studio have revealed that Dark and Darker Mobile will be available for American and Canadian players on February 4. The soft launch was originally going to be only for Canada before the decision was made to expand the early access.</p><p>"We are thrilled to expand our soft launch beyond Canada and bring Dark and Darker Mobile to even more players across North America," said Bluehole Studio's Joonseok Ahn in a statement. "The strong enthusiasm from the community encouraged us to accelerate our plans, and we look forward to gathering more feedback as we prepare for the global release."</p><p>Like the original Dark and Darker, the mobile incarnation of the game thrusts players into a fantasy-inspired dungeon-crawler where they must contend with monsters and creatures while searching for loot and treasures. Players also compete against each other inside of the dungeons, with the victor taking the spoils. It's a high-risk/high-reward scenario that can leave one side bereft of everything that they had before entering a dungeon.</p><p>Although Krafton and Bluehole Studio haven't set a date for Dark and Darker Mobile's global rollout, pre-registration is currently taking place <a href="https://dndm.krafton.com/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the game's official site</a>. Krafton has already laid out some of the other features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-dark-and-darker-mobile-will-differ-from-the-original/1100-6522381/" data-ref-id="1100-6522381">that distinguish the mobile version from its PC counterpart</a>. For example, players can recruit AI sidekicks to accompany them into either PvE or PvP dungeons. Players can also equip several buffs to increase the odds of their characters' survival.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">First a hello, then sent to hell. That's the scenario the actor behind Grand Theft Auto V's Trevor would like to see for the character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. While Steven Ogg hasn't reportedly done any work on the next entry in the franchise, he'd love to see Trevor "pass the torch" to new leads in a way that sees his brains turning into pink goo.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-6-trevor-steven-ogg-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ScreenRant</a>, Ogg explained that his wish for GTA VI is "if Trevor appeared in it just to be killed at the beginning." This would be a full-circle moment for Trevor if Rockstar followed along with Ogg's suggestion. That's because Trevor kills GTA IV: The Lost and the Damned protagonist Johnny Klebitz in GTA V. "Pass the torch, stomp Trevor's head in, and sort of put an end to that and allow a new generation to take over," Ogg said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1623257351" data-promo-id="0"
