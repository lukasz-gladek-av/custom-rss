		<p>Sassy Chap Games and Team17 have confirmed that the bonkers dating game Date Everything! will be launching on June 17th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch. When the title says Date Everything! it means you can date any object in the house you are in. Ever wanted to become closer for your sofa? You can do that. Your toilet has already seen everything, so why not treat it to a conversation?</p>
<p><iframe title="Date Everything! Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRZe30oSy9A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Date Everything you will build up different relationships depending on how your conversations go, and how your stats stack up. Those will lead to three relationship outcomes; love, hate, or friendship. Whatever one you end up on will give you points to improve your own stats, opening up more avenues to explore with your household furniture. All you have to do is put on your special glasses and shoot love beams at the object of your desire. There are over 100 characters to date all of which are fully voiced by the likes of Felicia Day,&nbsp; Ben Starr,&nbsp; Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, Neil Newbon, Troy Baker, and Ashley Burch plus a few others. Between them there are 70,000 lines of dialogue to hear as you get to know the objects in your house on a deeper level.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-faces-lawsuit-for-allegedly-misleading-players-by-shutting-down-the-crew">November 2024</a>, two gamers from California sued <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-executive-says-gamers-have-been-slow-in-getting-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-titles/">Ubisoft</a> over the company's decision to shut down servers for <a href="http://wccftech.com/ubisofts-open-ended-racing-game-the-crew/">The Crew</a>. The two argued that Ubisoft shutting down the servers was equivalent to buying a pinball machine, then years later, the pinball manufacturer storms into your house, removes the pinball paddles, bumpers, balls, everything that makes it playable and leaves an empty shell.</p>
<p>They <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-faces-lawsuit-for-allegedly-misleading-players-by-shutting-down-the-crew">alleged</a> that Ubisoft "<em>misled consumers by telling them they were buying a game, when in fact, all they were renting was a limited license to access the game." </em>The plaintiff's pinball comparison also came from one of them having bought a physical disc for The Crew, which was rendered useless plastic once the servers shut down.</p>
<p>Following player backlash, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">announced</a> that The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest would receive an update that added offline modes for each game. This would allow players to continue to enjoy both games even after the servers for each were shut down in early 2024. The same effort has not been extended to The Crew, which was taken offline entirely in March 2024, another point of issue the prosecuting players took up with Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>, Ubisoft has responded to the lawsuit, firmly telling the prosecuting players that they should have known they were never buying a game to own when they each purchased a copy of The Crew and that it was clear they were buying a license.</p>
<p>"<em>Frustrated with Ubisoft's recent decision to retire the game following a notice period delineated on the product's packaging, Plaintiffs apply a kitchen sink approach on behalf of a putative class of nationwide customers,</em>" Ubisoft wrote in its response.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also argued that the plaintiffs had gotten more than their fair share of use out of The Crew, playing the game for years before the announcement of its shutdown in December 2023 and the actual closure in March 2024.</p>
<p>"<em>After making their purchases, Plaintiffs enjoyed access to The Crew for years before Ubisoft decided in late 2023 to retire and shut down the servers of the ten-year-old video game. Plaintiffs received the benefit of their bargain and cannot complain now that they were deceived simply because Ubisoft did not then create an offline version of the discontinued video game.</em>"</p>
<p>Following Ubisoft's response to the lawsuit, the prosecution amended several of their complaints, including a particular rebuttal against the claim that the players got their fill of The Crew. The plaintiffs claimed they had no reason to believe the servers would ever be shut down.</p>
<p>Late last year, before this lawsuit was filed, Valve <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-warns-players-theyre-only-buying-a-license-to-a-game-at-checkout/">issued a new warning</a> on Steam telling players that they were only purchasing a license for the games they bought and did not directly own the game. This was the first time a digital storefront had been directly clear about players purchasing a license to play the game, not the game itself.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-review.1160463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <em>Infinity</em> universe,&nbsp;PanOceania is the most powerful faction in the Human Sphere, boasting the most planets, a thriving economy, and cutting-edge technology. Standing against them are the combined nations of Yu Jing, united under the powers of the ruling Party and the Emperor, each backed up with their own military force. The Incincible Army makes sure the designs of the Party are adhered to, and the Imperial Service does whatever it takes to see that the desires of the Emperor are met. In this article, we'll take a look at the new <em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service Action Pack, and what lengths this determined group of enforcers will go to.</p>

<p><em>Infinity N5 </em>launched last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Operation Sandtrap</a> box, and those who've been reading my articles for a while will know that I started my own <em>Infinity</em> journey with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power" rel="nofollow">JSA launch box</a> back in 2018 when the JSA broke away from Yu Jing and became a non-aligned army, before finally becoming their own standalone faction in <em>Infinity N5</em>.</p>




<h2>The Dragon's Claws</h2>

<p>The Imperial Service is made up of&nbsp;tactical units of Judicial and Military Police, criminal regiments, units transferred as reinforcements by the State Empire Army, and special troops in direct service to the Emperor. Its outward-facing mission is to preserve the rule of law and order and defend Yu Jing from any internal or external enemy. The rule of law and order they follow is that directed by the Emperor, and if that ever comes into conflict with anyone else, even the Party, they will do whatever is required to see their goals met.</p>

<p>This means that the Imperial Service is made up of empowered bad guys, given free rein to see that the wills of the Emperor are enforced, and their playstyle shows this. The Imperial Service has a combination of infiltration and camouflaged troops, as well as solid attacks when they need to eliminate their target.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=M12RYUR5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=hZmMp_CH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service Action Pack includes some brand new and redesigned miniatures for <em>Infinity</em> N5.</figcaption></figure><h2>By Any Means Necessary</h2>

<p>The Imperial Service Action pack includes 9 Imperial Service units, some of them unique to the Imperial Service sectorial, and others can be used in other sectorials, and the wider Yu Jing faction. The action pack contains:</p>

<ul><li>3x Celestial Guards - The core line troops of the Imperial Service, armed with combi rifles.</li>
	<li>1x Imperial Agent Crane Rank - Armed with a heavy machine gun, this is the Lieutenant of the set, but I would look at replacing them with Sun Tze (who is an absolute beast).</li>
	<li>1x Imperial Agent Pheasant Rank - The backup Lieutenant armed with a red fury. They also have tactical awareness which gives them&nbsp;an extra order token each turn.</li>
	<li>1x Bayara with Light Shotgun - This unit is actually 2 units on the same base. Their purpose is to hunt down intruders into the palace, so their profile comes armed with several ways of discovering hidden foes.</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Wu Ming - This profile comes armed in this set with a submachine gun, and has its own Fireteam named after it. It can join&nbsp;up with a Zangying and the Imperial Agents if required for the fireteam bonuses they provide.</li>
	<li>1x Koga Ninja - I'm a huge fan of the ninjas in JSA, and this Imperial Service ninja doesn't disappoint. With all the usual sneakiness of ninja units, the Koga&nbsp;is armed with all kinds of electro-magnetic weapons, the target of their attacks has to make 2 saving throws per hit and half their usual saving throw bonus.</li>
	<li>1x Jinyao Drop Unit - This assault unit can super-jump for maximum board mobility and comes armed&nbsp;with a boarding shotgun and para mines, which can immobilize units that set them off.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=Wt1J6tU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=hk5U31gA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Also avvialble as part of the Imperial Service revivial for&nbsp;<em>Infinity N5&nbsp;</em>are the Longwang TAG and specialist Dragon Lord.</figcaption></figure><h2>His Will</h2>

<p>Realising alongside the Imperial Service action pack are the Longwang, Imperial TAG police, and a special launch miniature, the Dragon Lord, Imperial Service Judges. The Longwang is an armored TAG unit, accurate at range with its heavy machine gun and its immobilizing adhesive launcher, and deadly up close with its para close combat weapon. It also gets a bonus order token to get things done. The Dragon Lord is a specialist troop to help you complete mission objectives, they're decent in close combat, and their ranged nanopulser is a template weapon for anyone trying to close with them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=Vrbx2wOt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=3bFgtFiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Our recomended <em>Infinity</em> units to bolster&nbsp;your Imperial Service force are Sun Tze and Su-Jian.</figcaption></figure><p>If I were looking to play into the Imperial Service more, I'd pick up Sun Tze as mentioned above, who if made your Lieutenant, gains an additional order ontop of their Lieutentant order, and also has the ability to deploy 2 decoys, so your opponent will have to guess where they actually are. I'd also look to pick up a Su-Jian, who can fireteam up with another Su-Jian or the Longwang, and has 2 forms. Using a movement action to change between them, the Su-Jian has a high-mobility form, which allows them to close the distance quickly, and then change into the combat form when they're ready to bring the pain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-2.jpg?itok=lSooVl44 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-2.jpg?itok=WwkSbH14 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The full list of Imperial Service units avialable in <em>Infinity N5</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>Infinity Imperial Service Action Pack Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service action pack is a decent box, with some fantastic-looking miniatures. It goes some way to showing what the Imperial Service is capable of and combined with the Longwang, gives them some presence on the table. You will need to add some units to get the most out of them though, and they're not a super straight-forward faction to pilot if you're a brand new <em>Infinity</em> player. But they are fun, and have a lot of tricks and ways to hunt down hidden enemies, plus this box has the new Koga Ninja, who is pretty awesome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Romantic dating sim&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has a brand new release date, and Team17 and Sassy Chap's "star-studded" adventure is arriving on PC and current-gen consoles just in time for summer.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on June 17th. The game was due to launch on what would have been the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">ideal date for its arrival</a>, but it was delayed (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">not for the first time</a>) in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, you're equipped with a pair of "Dateviators", glasses that essentially allow you to see objects in your home as dateable people. It's probably best if you don't think about the implications of that too much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-release-date-summer-keyes.jpg?itok=ZNzcEnaP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-release-date-summer-keyes.jpg?itok=MIlY9Vg0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has a new, and hopefully final, release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Equipped with said Dateviators, you'll be able to romance over 100 characters, with inanimate objects like laundry baskets, pianos, and vacuum cleaners available for romantic relationships. You can even date concepts like existential dread.</p>

<p>Not only can you date lots of characters, but you can also explore a "fully interactive 3D overworld", as Sassy Chap says, and the world of the game will change based on choices you make throughout your run.</p>

<p>Sassy Chap is also promising lots of branching dialogue and multiple endings for each character (not just for the game itself), as well as full voice acting for the game's romanceable roster.</p>

<p>The voice cast is pretty impressive, too; actors include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Supernatural</em>'s Felicia Day (with whom you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-is-new-guest-at-twenty-sided-tavern-key-to-improv-and-dungeons" rel="nofollow">check out our&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed interview here</a>),&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s Ben Starr, and&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Neil Newbon, also known as Astarion.</p>




<p>With over a million words in its script,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>might not be quite on the same level as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>for sheer volume</a>, but it promises to keep you busy nonetheless.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on June 17th. No Nintendo Switch 2 version has yet been confirmed.</p>

But this is no ordinary manor. Its rooms--from twisting hallways and garden courtyards to sports facilities and curious dead ends--all reset at the start of each day. This leads to a fascinating roguelike mechanic, one where you need to create the best path to reach the fabled Room 46.

We focused on individual puzzle rooms, followed by boons that you can unlock permanently.

Naturally, these articles contain <strong>spoilers</strong>, so read them at your own risk.</p><h3 id="The_basics">The basics</h3><p>These Blue Prince guides are all about the basics, such as the items that you might want for your runs and the resources that you need for continued exploration.

Today, the development team announced the first seasonal event of that roadmap, Cursed Hollow, which will run for three weeks starting April 17.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cursed Hollow event will bring Easter-themed decor--with a spooky twist, of course--to nine of the game's maps--with one of them being Bleasdale Farmhouse, which is one of the reworked maps from the roadmap. Jackalope totems will be available for collection during each run, but interacting with them will alter the rest of the run in both positive and negative ways.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png" data-ref-id="1300-4473638" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png" data-ref-id="1300-4473638"></a><figcaption>A jackalope totem from the new Cursed Hollow update.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cursed Hollow will also bring a revamped reward system, as objectives and rewards will come in both Community and Personal categories. Completing Community tasks will contribute toward the Community goal, while Personal objectives are player-specific and will unlock after the first Community threshold is met.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first of three seasonal events specified on the 2025 roadmap, with "Halloween" and "Holiday" also listed. Other updates on the roadmap include an overhaul of the player character options, a revamped evidence gathering system, and a new map along with the multiple reworks.</p><p dir="ltr">Kinetic Games's Phasmophobia first launched in 2020, when it rose to viral stardom after content creators picked up the game.

                <p>Onibi Studio--a newly founded game studio featuring industry veterans who worked on titles such as World of Warcraft, Baldur’s Gate 3, Fortnite, and League of Legends--has announced its first game. Tomo: Endless Sea is an anime-inspired, open-world action-RPG in which players will get the chance to tame mysterious creatures named Tomo, craft various contraptions, and explore a procedurally generated oceanic world known as Endless Blue. The game will also support online multiplayer, and is labeled as an MMO, in addition to its other genres. Tomo: Endless Blue is currently scheduled to release sometime in 2026.</p><p>Alongside its announcement, Onibi Studio shared a first-look at Tomo: Endless Blue in an adorable trailer that turns shockingly dark in its final moments. In it, two characters approach an island aboard a flying whale-like creature that is seemingly an island itself. The pair catch their first Tomo before delving into the ocean below, swimming to shore, and starting off on their own adventure on the voxel island. Throughout the entire trailer, an original song composed by Cécile Corbel--best known for her work on Arrietty--and sung by Ai Higuchi of Attack on Titan fame, plays. As for what happens next, well... you can see for yourself:</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Tomo: Endless Blue - Official Reveal Trailer (ft. Ai Higuchi and Cécile Corbel)</p>
      </div>
<p>Though Minecraft-meets-Pokemon is an apt comparison for Tomo: Endless Sea, the studio has also expressed great emphasis on what sets it apart, such as the game's physics. On Tomo's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3301510/Tomo_Endless_Blue/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, Onibi Studio wrote, "Blocks have physics and can be used to create vehicles and contraptions. Whether it's a boat, crane, or airship, build your own machines block by block--with your creativity, the possibilities are endless." Additionally, the Endless Blue will include other features, such as arenas, ancient ruins, and "vibrant, bustling worlds that feel truly alive." Villages, their architecture, culture, stories, quests, dialogues, and people are all dynamically generated, according to Onibi, in an attempt to ensure no two locations are the same.</p><p>"When worlds end, fragments of their civilizations become islands adrift in the Endless Blue. As players embark on a journey to uncover the story of each procedurally generated island, they discover vibrant villages filled with characters and Tomo living their lives, every island and village a microcosm of a unique culture," Onibi Studio wrote in the game's press release. "The trailer peeks into just one story of many in the Endless Blue, giving us a slice of life in this infinite world where one may uncover unexpected secrets lying in darkness."</p><p>Tomo: Endless Blue is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3301510/Tomo_Endless_Blue/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a> but does not currently have a release date.

                <p>When Palworld was first released in early 2024, one of the criticisms levied against the game in some circles pertained to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-palworld-and-its-massive-success/1100-6520490/" data-ref-id="1100-6520490">allegations of the developer using generative AI</a>. Palworld communications director and publishing manager, John "Bucky" Buckley, has now responded, discussing how these claims hurt the people at the studio. He also said the allegations are "complete nonsense."</p><p>Asked by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN </a>how the allegations of "AI slop" impacted the workers at Pocketpair, Buckley said, "Massively, massively, massively, massively."</p><p>"That is by far I would say the biggest kind of thing that was ever against us, still to this day. Go to any Palworld posts or any news article about Palworld, or Reddit post, you'll see someone say, 'I hate this company. They use AI,' and it's complete nonsense. It's upsetting," he added.</p><p>Everyone at Pocketpair was affected by these claims, Buckley said, especially the concept artists. "We have a few Pal concept artists, and two of them in particular who've been there since day one. They're not big fans of this kind of stuff, but it's very hard to counter this, which we did learn," Buckley said.</p><p>To counter these claims, Buckley said the studio considered asking its workers to make a video and discuss the matter, but "none of our people want to be on camera."</p><p>"The vast majority of our artists are female, and in Japan, it's not the way to go about things right now. So they don't want to be on camera, they don't want to be public, they don't want to have their names out there. And yeah, it's upsetting for them, still today it's very upsetting to hear these things," he said.</p><p>Buckley said that Pocketpair releasing an official Palworld art book "definitely made a big impact" to push back against the AI claims, but "not as much as we would've hoped, perhaps."</p><p>People connected Pocketpair with AI in part because its CEO responded positively to a post about AI years ago, Buckley said. Pocketpair also released a party game called AI: Art Imposter, in which players generate AI images and then the other people try to deduce what's real and what was made using AI. People took this to mean Pocketpair as a studio loves generative AI, but Buckley said this misses essential context.</p><p>Palworld has been steadily supported since release with ongoing updates, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-cross-play-update-officially-confirmed-for-late-march/1100-6530069/" data-ref-id="1100-6530069">latest of which arrived in mid-March and added cross-play.</a> Palworld is available now on PC and console. It's included with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>

            <p>
Sandbox matchmaking sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/date-everything">Date Everything!</a> has a final release date, after previously pushing back its earlier (and more romantic) 14th February launch plans.
</p>
<p>
Date Everything! will now arrive for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch and Xbox Series X/S on 17th June, publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a> confirmed today.
</p>
<p>
A romance game where you can hook up with anthropomorphic versions of pretty much anything in your flat - chairs, toilets, washing machines and more - Date Everything! tasks you with cosying up to as many things/people as possible to fill your Date-A-Dex (just don't tell The Pokémon Company).

<p>
There's more detail, from Felicia Day, on how the game's "Dateviator" glasses work in the release date trailer above.
</p>
<p>
A key draw to the game is its star-studded cast of video game voice actors being roped in for cameos, including Felicia Day as well as Laura Bailey, Ashley Johnson, Ashly Burch, Matt Mercer, Troy Baker, Roger Craig Smith, Ben Starr and dozens more.
</p>
<p>
If all of that sounds like your cup of tea, well, there's only two more months to wait. And if you really love cups of tea, you can probably date those too.

			<p>If you're looking to squeeze out every bit of story in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight,</a> then you'll want to make sure to find and read every single note.</p>
<p>These guides will take you through where to find them all across the 14 chapters. Here's where to find all four notes in Chapter 2.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 2</h2>
<p>You won't be near the first of the four notes until you've followed the ghosts to the area with the row of houses. So just follow the linear path the level takes you through until you get to that point.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Weaver's Call</strong> - You'll find this note in the first house on the left, by interacting with the symbol on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Spirits, Speak to Me!</strong> - This note is in the barn, where you'll learn the Strand Pull ability. Once you get up to the ledge to head out of the barn, look to your left before leaping and you'll see a barrel with a note on it. Make sure to grab this one when you get to it, otherwise you'll have to play through the level again if you miss it the first time around.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Please, speak to me...</strong> - After jumping out of the barn where you learn Strand Pull and defeating the enemies you'll run into, there's a note in a hidden area to your left. Before following the ghosts into the cave, look for a bundle of branches beyond the dilapidated wooden fence that will light up when you go near them, indicating that you can use Strand Push to knock them aside. There's a note on a tree stump and a Floof knot waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Stigma and Sorrow</strong> - Once you've entered the cave after the ghosts, this note can be found immediately on your left by interacting with the symbol on the cave wall.</p>
<p>That's where you'll find all the notes in Chapter 2 in South of Midnight. Only 96 more to go from here.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-dev-promises-tons-of-changes-as-steam-reviews-turn-sour.1160352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has announced a sweeping set of changes which appear to be aimed at tackling the game's plummeting Steam review rating.</p>

<p>Right now, the&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-esque action RPG is sitting at a rather uncomfortable <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> on Steam, with players bemoaning what appears to be a significant drop in the game's pacing. Players refer to the pace as "extremely slow and boring" and "a total slog", among other complaints.</p>

<p>The changes were apparently introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-hunts-new-huntress-and-ascendancy-classes-look-sick" rel="nofollow">recent Dawn of the Hunt update</a>, which introduced new classes and gameplay elements, as well as some of the gameplay changes that appear to have proven controversial among players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-mostly-negative-changes-jamanra.jpg?itok=h_GfefW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-mostly-negative-changes-jamanra.jpg?itok=ORYIH8dQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s latest update hasn't exactly proven popular.</figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Grinding Gear Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490/view/497192510562500616" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a sweeping set of changes ostensibly aimed at addressing much of players' criticism. The changes, which the developer says "do not represent a full list" of players' grievances, include buffs to various classes, as well as a number of other gameplay tweaks.</p>

<p>Several more changes were also announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490/view/640181878351986722" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earlier today</a>, including many changes to monsters to make them less overwhelming, as well as alterations to bosses, player minions, and more.</p>

<p>Whether or not these changes do anything to alleviate players' ire regarding Dawn of the Hunt remains to be seen, but&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>'s next update drops tomorrow at about 3pm Pacific (that's about 6pm Eastern and around 11pm GMT).</p>




<p>Grinding Gear will doubtless hope that these changes mollify players, especially given that it's put all of its eggs in the&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>basket, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-updates-paused-poe-2" rel="nofollow">paused updates to the original game</a> back in January to focus on the sequel.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Full patch notes for the above changes will be available when the update lands tomorrow.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode-pve</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-and-darker-season-6-brings-brand-new-pve-mode-and-more.1160349/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode-pve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ironmace has released the Season 6 update for PvPvE dungeon-crawler&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, and if you're the kind of player who prefers the PvE part of that equation to the PvP part, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>Previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-4" rel="nofollow">seasons</a> of&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>have focused on adding features like reworked maps, new bosses, and other tweaks, but this one's bringing a whole new mode in the form of Adventure, which Ironmace describes as "an exciting co-op dungeon-crawling experience".</p>

<p>Essentially, it sounds like Adventure mode removes the PvP component from&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, leaving you and your friends free only to worry about the monsters trying to kill you rather than your fellow adventurers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode.jpg?itok=RZd36rMn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode.jpg?itok=FMp5xByE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark and Darker</em>'s Adventure Mode is perfect for conflict-averse players.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just Adventure Mode. Ironmace has also added a number of new monsters and sub-bosses to&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, as well as new monster patterns for certain Nightmare enemies.</p>

<p>You'll also find new items in the shop, as well as a whole host of other quality-of-life improvements and gameplay tweaks designed to make the&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>experience a little smoother for everyone.</p>

<p>The full list of changes to&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>as part of Season 6 is pretty extensive, but if you'd like to read everything that's new, you can check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2016590/view/587264582368624660" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, it's a multiplayer dungeon-crawler with a focus on both player-versus-player and player-versus-environment combat (although the Adventure Mode removes one part of that gameplay makeup entirely).</p>

<p>The game has been subject to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-developers-respond-to-dmca-takedown-from-nexon-after-removal-from-steam" rel="nofollow">protracted legal battle</a> between developer Ironmace and Korean publisher Nexon, with the latter alleging that Ironmace essentially stole company secrets for an upcoming game Nexon was working on.</p>

<p>A Korean court recently ruled that Ironmace <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-lawsuit-trade-secret-infringement" rel="nofollow">infringed on Nexon's secrets</a> when making&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, although that ruling also means Ironmace hasn't been found guilty of copyright infringement.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016590/Dark_and_Darker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Along with a new season of <em>Black Mirror</em>, Netflix might have just released its most interesting licensed game today. Season 7 of the sc-fi anthology includes an episode called “Plaything,” in which a genius coder in the ‘90s — the same one from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing">interactive “Bandersnatch” episode</a> — creates a new game that’s a little bit like <em>The Sims</em> and a Tamagotchi. The difference is the little creatures you take care of are actually alive, which leads the episode down some dark and surprising paths. And as part of its fledgling gaming initiative, Netflix has released a version of the game from the show for subscribers.</p><p>It’s called <em>Thronglets</em>, and it works like a companion to the episode. You take care of little yellow creatures, known collectively as the throng, by providing food and entertainment, as well as helping out with hygiene. Keep up and they’ll thrive. Don’t and, well, things can get dark. The throng will quickly replicate, and soon you’ll have a huge group to look after. At its core, <em>Thronglets</em> plays like a typical mobile building game. The throng will mine for resources, develop new technologies, and open up new areas for exploration over time. As you progress, you’ll unlock new tools and buildings to speed things up and keep the growing throng happy.</p><p>What makes <em>Thronglets</em> interesting is the meta layer. The creatures are sentient and self-aware, and they will frequently speak directly to you, the player. Sometimes it will be for advice on how to proceed; other times, they will ask existential questions, like what it means to die. This extends to the push notifications, which will often feel threatening or guilt-inducing if you haven’t played for a while. Eventually, <em>Thronglets</em>, like the episode it’s based on, gets pretty dark and surreal.</p><p>Last month, Netflix revealed a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">new, seemingly more focused plan for its gaming efforts</a>, and one of the pillars was mainstream titles based on some of its biggest properties. To date, that hasn’t yielded the most exciting results — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game">see <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, for example</a> — but <em>Thronglets</em> represents something more thoughtful. It’s not just a game based on a show, it’s one that extends that show’s world in interesting ways. As Netflix continues to figure out its place in gaming, <em>Thronglets</em> and its tiny critters could represent a welcome path.</p><div><p>The game is available now for free for subscribers <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Fgame%2F81767501" rel="sponsored">on both iOS and Android</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Switch 2 Edition Carts Will Contain Games and Upgrades, Nintendo Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-edition-carts-games-upgrades</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-edition-carts-will-contain-games-and-upgrades-nintendo-says.1160328/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-edition-carts-games-upgrades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has clarified that Switch 2 Edition cartridges will contain both the original Switch version of the game in question and the Switch 2 upgrade, meaning you won't have to download anything extra to play them.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to Australian Nintendo news platform <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vooks</a>, Nintendo said that physical Switch 2 Edition games will "include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card".</p>

<p>Nintendo goes on to say that "no download code" will be included in Switch 2 Edition packs and that the cartridges therein will be "exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards". Good news if you were hoping to resell your Switch 2 Edition games at some point, or if your internet connection is spotty.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-edition-carts-download-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=__wNfzGO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-edition-carts-download-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=2EilFBrg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several games, like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, will be getting Switch 2 Edition versions with console-specific upgrades.</figcaption></figure><p>Frustratingly, however, Nintendo then says that "some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging" if they choose, and that such releases would contain "no game card".</p>

<p>In essence, then, first-party Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will always contain both the original game and the upgrade code, but that might not be the case for third-party publishers. Caveat emptor, I suppose.</p>

<p>Just in case you've somehow missed the hubbub, the Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced in full last week</a>, with a worldwide release date of June 5th and a US price (for now, at least) of $449.99, jumping to $499.99 with a copy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>Though the console is still on track to launch on June 5th, pre-orders have been delayed in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">the US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a> due to President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs. Nintendo also appears to be weighing up whether releasing the Switch 2 in China <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand" rel="nofollow">will be worth its while</a>.</p>




<p>Games confirmed to be getting Switch 2 Editions so far include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. Not all of them are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launching alongside the console</a>, though.</p>

But that hasn’t stopped Hollywood or big tech before. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/meta-second-screen-theater-tech-m3gan-rerelease-1236364712/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/meta-second-screen-theater-tech-m3gan-rerelease-1236364712/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On April 9, as reported by <em>Variety</em></a></span>, Meta is launching its new “Movie Mate” technology during a special April 30 screening of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/megan-2-first-trailer-teaser-release-date-scifi-horror-1851774585?_gl=1*1xmi06t*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDIzMTM4My43NS4xLjE3NDQyMzQxNTcuNDguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/megan-2-first-trailer-teaser-release-date-scifi-horror-1851774585?_gl=1*1xmi06t*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDIzMTM4My43NS4xLjE3NDQyMzQxNTcuNDguMC4w"><em>Megan</em></a></span>—the original film, not its forthcoming sequel—as part of horror movie studio Blumhouse’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.creepykingdom.com/post/blumhouse-halfway-to-halloween-2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.creepykingdom.com/post/blumhouse-halfway-to-halloween-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halfway to Halloween Film Festival</a></span>.” The new tech will let moviegoers use their mobile phones as a “second screen” while watching <em>Megan </em>in a theater. The idea is that people in the theater will be able to use their phone to chat with a <em>Megan</em>-themed AI chatbot, answer trivia questions, and read behind-the-scenes tidbits. </p><p> I don’t care how much of a boomer this makes me: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wicked-singing-theater-phone-taking-pictures-screen-1851708935&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-singing-theater-phone-taking-pictures-screen-1851708935">don’t use your phone in a movie theater</a></span>. If you are worried about an emergency, leave it on buzz and exit the theater before checking your device. Otherwise, mute that shit and enjoy two hours in a dark room separated from the nightmare that is the internet in 2025. </p><p> “The question we always ask ourselves is why can’t every day be Halloween? So Halfway to Halloween brings us one step closer, and I couldn’t be happier that this year we are going nationwide,” said Jason Blum, founder and CEO of Blumhouse, in a statement. “In that same spirit of trying new things, we’re excited to give <em>Megan</em> fans an all-new experience in theaters from the team at Meta.” </p><p>I do find it very funny that Meta and Blumhouse are pitching this tech as “new” despite second screen experiences being a thing that companies tried over a decade ago. Remember Xbox SmartGlass? That was an app you’d open on your tablet or phone and then use while playing games or watching movies on your Xbox One. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsofts-smartglass-is-great-and-i-dont-even-use-it-5961690&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsofts-smartglass-is-great-and-i-dont-even-use-it-5961690">It had some uses</a></span>, but wasn’t really a thing anybody cared about. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/majornelson/status/998790240377565184?s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/majornelson/status/998790240377565184?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So Xbox killed it and moved on</a></span>. Yet, here’s Meta bringing the concept back, while making it <em>more</em> annoying than before by cramming in AI and encouraging people to use their phones while in a movie theater. </p><p>I can only hope that, like most new ideas big tech has these days, this Movie Mate thing quietly fails and is never mentioned again. If not, then going to the movies is going to get a lot worse, and that would make me really sad. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/megan-2-first-trailer-teaser-release-date-scifi-horror-1851774585&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/megan-2-first-trailer-teaser-release-date-scifi-horror-1851774585">Oh and speaking of <em>Megan</em>, the sequel looks bonkers</a></span>. I hope when I watch it in a movie theater later this year I don’t have to deal with 20 random people on their phones the whole time. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
