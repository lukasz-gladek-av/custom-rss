            <p>Y'know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> bug where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/further-testing-seems-to-confirm-monster-hunter-wilds-dlc-performance-improvement-theory-to-an-extent">close proximity to a talking DLC vendor cat would drop your framerate</a>? Gone. Dead. Done like a kipper. Do kippers exist in the Monster Hunter universe? Maybe not, but then neither does this bug, following a new PC patch for the troubled RPG and confirmed by my testing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Curiously, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?l=english">Capcom’s patch notes</a> claim that the FPS drop – which could previously be 'fixed' by splurging on MHW’s many, many add-on cosmetics – was more specifically triggered by the game’s content status checks flagging <em>unclaimed</em> DLC or items, with the total number of owned DLCs having no effect.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that aligns entirely with my pre-patch testing experience, as I still got a substantial performance boost on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a> after adding all 190 cosmetics, and after manually combing through all of the DLC cat’s menus to check they were all installed. But at least whatever the cause, it does appear to have been properly addressed. Before this patch, and without any DLC, that RTX 5080 averaged 66fps around the camp area where the offending feline resides; with all the DLC, that rose to 73fps. After the patch, the same test rig produced 74fps with the DLC and 75fps without. Success!</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Not today, frame thief. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This particular fixin’ does little to help Wilds’ notoriously stuttery performance outside of camps, though the update does also include "optimisation improvements" and a couple of new graphics settings that can be lowered for a smidge of extra frames. Several denizens of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1qoyzdi/guys_the_game_runs_on_pc_now/">the game’s subreddit</a> are reporting noticeably improved smoothness after installing the patch, and while the upgrades I’ve seen myself haven’t been so dramatic – dropping the new foliage density from High to Low, for example, only gave the RTX 5080 another 2fps on average – they do sound like they might benefit lower- and mid-range PCs more acutely.</p>
<p>"To further improve stability and performance across all platforms," the patch notes continue, "additional improvements will be implemented in the Ver. 1.041 update on February 18.</p>
<p>"For example, we are currently verifying measures to reduce GPU processing load by adding quality levels (LOD) to the polygon mesh for 3D models. This may help to reduce processing load by swapping to low-resolution models for objects farther away from the camera."</p>
<p>Reminds me of when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> devs denied that the citybuilder ran so badly because it was rendering entire urban populations’ worth of individual, high-definition, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-blaming-teeth-for-cities-skylines-2-performance-problems-say-devs">dynamically growing teeth</a>. God, games are weird.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-steam-deck-docking-station-was-already-a-value-pick-now-its-at-its-lowest-price-ever-after-another-discount-2000663623</link>
            <guid>1418311</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Valve released the Steam Deck, it reset expectations for what portable PC gaming could look like. I mean, they did just copy Nintendo’s homework with the Switch design, but that misses the bigger point. The Steam Deck didn’t ask players to rebuild their libraries or buy special versions of games. Gamers can take their existing Steam collections on the road. That single decision helped create an entirely new class of hardware: handheld gaming PCs. Sure, we’ve always had gaming laptops, but the appeal of being able to easily pick-up and play on a dedicated piece of gaming hardware is undeniable.</p>
<p>As impressive as the Steam Deck is in handheld form, its screen can feel limiting in certain situations. A 7.4-inch display works great on a commute or during travel, but it doesn’t always suit relaxed couch gaming. Sometimes you want to stretch out and play on a large television, the same way consoles have done for years. Thanks to docking solutions, the Steam Deck can handle that role with ease. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6915/">One suitable option comes from Anker, and it’s currently discounted by 10%.</a> The dock usually sells for $33, but a $3 price cut brings it down to a clean $30 for a short time. Sure, it’s not the greatest discount ever, but $30 for a Steam Deck docking station is an absolutely fair value.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6915/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>See Every Detail</h2>
<p>Once connected, the Steam Deck can output to an external display at up to 4K resolution and 60Hz over its HDMI port, a major step up from its native 1280 × 800 handheld resolution. That extra clarity makes a noticeable difference on large TVs and monitors. The dock also works with other devices, including other handheld PCs like the ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and even tablets such as the iPad.</p>
<p>The dock supports up to 100W USB-C Power Delivery, keeping the Steam Deck charged while it’s connected to a display. Then when you’re ready to take it on the road, it’ll be at full charge.</p>



<p>It comes with a few built-in USB-A and USB-C ports which allow for wired controllers, keyboards, or other accessories. An integrated Ethernet port supports speeds up to 1,000Mbps, offering a more stable connection for online games and faster downloads compared to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The compact design makes the dock easy to pack, great for traveling. You can play handheld on the way to your destination, then dock it to a hotel or Airbnb TV later. The open-face design also allows tabletop use, letting the screen sit at a comfortable angle while you play with a controller, no TV required.</p>

<p>Big releases continue to come thick and fast in 2026, and fans of the strategy genre should have their eyes cast towards the release date of MENACE.</p>



<p>The title from Hooded Horse will be available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> only on release, and the game has been compared to the likes of XCOM, which is sure to ignite further excitement in the passionate strategy playerbase. </p>



<p>With over 50k followers on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, MENACE looks set to make a big impact on its arrival, and Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date and the exact time you will be able to jump in and play.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-menace-release">When Does MENACE Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strategy. Image via Hooded Horse</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>MENACE has an official release date of February 5, 2026, though this may change based on the region where you are located.</strong></p>



<p>While the majority of players will be able to jump in on that date, others will have to wait until the early hours of the morning on the following day before the doors open to them.</p>



<p>This is because MENACE has a global release structure, becoming available simultaneously to players across the world, and not a staggered release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-menace-release">What Time Does MENACE Release?</h2>



<p><strong>MENACE will be released at 6 AM PT on February 5, with the release taking place later in the morning for those elsewhere in the United States.</strong></p>



<p>For those in Europe, MENACE releases in the afternoon, while those in Australia and nearby regions will have to stay up late to jump in immediately. Details of the release time come via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2432860/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for players on console, there’s no news on a MENACE release on other platforms yet, so PC will be the only way to play at launch.</p>



<p>The table below highlights the release time of MENACE in major regions across the world, so you can count down exactly how long remains until the game is accessible.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Feb. 6</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has confirmed that Rebirth and Part 3 are coming to Xbox. </p>



<p>Square Enix just released the first instalment of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series on new platforms, Xbox and Switch 2, and now players are waiting to see when the next instalments will release. We have already received reports that Rebirth is coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-arrive-for-switch-2-this-summer-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> in 2026, and now the director has confirmed that Xbox ports do exist. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-director-confirms-xbox-ports-for-parts-2-and-3">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Series Director Confirms Xbox Ports for Parts 2 and 3</h2>



<p>In a new post on <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/2016312724599472214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed that the next instalment will have Xbox ports. The director stated that he was happy that Xbox players were enjoying FF7 Remake, followed by confirmation that Square Enix will bring “REBIRTH and the last part of the trilogy” to Xbox as well. The director also thanked Sarah Bond and Phil Spencer for supporting the Final Fantasy series. </p>



<p>Back in September 2025, the director had stated that Final Fantasy will expand to “major platforms moving forward”, which includes PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. This week, the director also confirmed in a new interview that Rebirth and the third instalment are in development for the Switch 2, and the Switch 2 version’s gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other&nbsp;platforms.”</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-for-xbox">When Will Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Release For Xbox </h2>



<p>Even though we have received official confirmation on Rebirth and Part 3 coming to Xbox, we still do not have a release window. A recent report claims the Switch 2 version could arrive this summer, and a reliable source says Switch 2 and the Xbox version of Rebirth should arrive together. So players could expect the Xbox version of FF7 Rebirth to arrive in the summer of 2026 if this report is accurate. </p>







<p>In other news, the Final Fantasy 6 Remake series&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should be led by someone else</a>,&nbsp;according to the FF7 Remake director. Additionally, the game experience for part three is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>.” What are your thoughts on Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth featuring the same gameplay experience on Switch 2 as other platforms?

            <p>A lot has transpired during this first month of 2026, but Ubisoft can't escape the news cycle with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">layoffs, studio closures, project cancellations</a> (including the long-in-development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-actor-reacts-to-cancellation">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">countless hints</a> the still-unannounced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake is coming sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>A new week, a new leak or finding on Edward Kenway's return being a real, impending thing. Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-an-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-just-leaked-via-vinted">IGN</a>, we've learned an all-new statue of the iconic pirate-turned-assassin was spotted on 27th January. While the figure itself doesn't say anything about it pertaining to the Resynced remake we've been hearing about for months now, it joins other promotional materials and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/es-es/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/28oWzWFPvQgskv6cgLGBMG/the-division-2-x-assassins-creed-collaboration">big collaborations</a> that are highlighting Kenway in recent times.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="fr"><p>⚠️ LEAK BLACK FLAG REMAKE ?</p><p>Un gars sur Vinted vend une toute nouvelle figurine de Edward Kenway et prétend qu'elle sortirait cette année. </p><p>En sachant que le remake de Black Flag était censé sortir dans moins de 2 mois, serait-ce la figurine officielle du jeu ? <a href="https://t.co/ctVWiavA6c">pic.twitter.com/ctVWiavA6c</a></p></div>— j0nathan (@xj0nathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The statue itself is pretty cool, with Kenway sitting on a treasure chest full of gold coins and leaning back against a ship's wheel, pistol and iconic cutlass in each hand. The titular Black Flag is also present, with both the traditional pirate skull and the Assassin's Creed sigil that so many longtime fans love mixed together.</p>
<p>The figure's origins are unknown, and its appearance is a bit baffling; it popped up via the clothing resale app Vinted. Leakers like <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan">j0nathan</a> are sure this isn't a previously released statue, and the listing states the 35cm-tall statue won't be officially out until later in 2026. IGN's report states "a detailed close-up of the statue's base shows logos for Ubisoft and PureArts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026."</p><p>This would line up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">PureArts' teases last summer</a> that "something" was happening with Black Flag in the near future. At this point, and following so many hints across very different brands and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">even Ubisoft drumming up excitement</a> for the fourth mainline Assassin's Creed, it's mostly safe to theorize a release was maybe planned for early 2026 before the delays and reorganization that were announced last week.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake now out of the picture and Ubisoft going more selective with its output moving forward, more expectations are being placed on this next major Assassin's Creed release, so let's hope it's all smooth sailing once Kenway and his crew go out into the seas again.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-mod-looks-even-better-new-pbr-textures/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few months after <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-compatibility-mod-publicly-available-enjoy-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the public release of the <strong>GTA 4 RTX Remix mod</strong></a>, modder <strong>xoxor4d</strong> has now released an add-on mod that injects approximately <strong>18K PBR (physically based rendering) textures</strong>, mostly roughness/normal maps and a few height maps, into the game, further improving its visuals.</p>



<p>The modder explained that the textures were not manually created. Instead, xoxor4d used a custom build of the GTA 4 RTX Remix mod (<a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/dxvk-remix/tree/feat/AutoPBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available here</a> and called AutoPBR) to <strong>dump textures at runtime</strong> whenever they were used for rendering. The compatibility mod provided additional information about each texture via the RTX Remix API. Then, texture associations were built, and a USDA file with overwrites was generated. Further processing of the dumped textures was carried out to convert DX9 normal maps to Remix-compatible normal maps, and specular maps were converted to roughness maps using Python scripts.</p>



<p>Because of the automatic process behind the PBR conversion, the modder clarified that <strong>some textures 'here and there' might look broken</strong>. Still, in most cases, it's a noticeable improvement over the game's original textures.</p>

<p>Physically Based Rendering was not yet a thing in the games industry when <strong>Rockstar</strong> released <strong>Grand Theft Auto 4</strong> in 2008. The first games to use PBR were launched in 2013: <strong>Dontnod</strong>'s sci-fi action game <strong>Remember Me</strong> (made in Unreal Engine 3), <strong>Crytek</strong>'s <strong>Ryse: Son of Rome</strong> (made in CryEngine), and <strong>Guerrilla</strong>'s <strong>Killzone: Shadow Fall</strong> (made in Decima Engine). The big difference is that, with PBR, <strong>materials respond realistically to lighting.</strong> </p>



<p>This is all the more important for the GTA 4 RTX Remix mod, which <strong>enables path tracing and thus benefits immensely from PBR textures</strong>. Of course, it's not quite the same thing as if a Rockstar artist had handcrafted them.</p>



<p>In other RTX Remix news, NVIDIA <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-out-now-dynamic-fx-classic-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released the new Logic system yesterday</a></strong>. Modders can now add dynamic visual effects to their mods that are triggered based on in-game events. We'll see if xoxor4d decides to introduce it to this GTA 4 RTX Remix mod.</p>

            <p>
Fresh from the trenches of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">the Divinity generative AI debate</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has taken to the Twitterverse with some moderately spicy thoughts on video game critics and reviewers. Broadly, he feels that we need to work harder to be “critical” without being “hurtful”. He also suggests that the industry could do with a Metacritic-style system for evaluating and scoring reviewers, to “encourage a bit more restraint”, so that "sensitive" creatives don't "lose their idealism and love of players.”
</p>
<p>
Picture me over here, huffing and snorting like a bull eyeing the red-trousered bottom of an atypically fleshy matador browsing the inside of a just-opened china shop. By gawd! A chance to pontificate about my own navel, while bagging a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> headline in the bargain. I have some notes on Vincke’s notes, but before I start throwing my toys around, maybe <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974">read the Xitter thread in full</a>, from late last night on the 27th. For those who do not partake of Musky products, here's a transcript:
</p><!--more-->
<blockquote><p>I don’t like people shitting on things others have created. Putting something out into the world makes you vulnerable, and that alone deserves respect, even if you dislike the creation. It’s easy to destroy things, it’s a lot harder to build them. The best critics understand this. Even when they’re being critical, they do their best not to be hurtful.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think it'd be a good idea for critics to be scored, Metacritic-style, based on how others evaluate their criticism. I like to imagine it would encourage a bit more restraint. The harsh words do real damage. You shouldn't have to grow callus on your soul just because you want to publish something.</p>
<p>There's plenty of games I genuinely don't like playing and there are many I know are made for the wrong reasons. However - it's incredibly rare for one to be made without there being someone behind it that truly cared about what they were making, putting a part of themselves in it.</p>
<p>One of the best reviewers I ever knew refused to review games he considered failures. He believed that developers deserved the chance to try again. He knew that every failed attempt could be what enabled the next great one.</p>
<p>I know this because I was one of those developers that failed. And he only told me many years later.</p>
<p>So yeah - be nice to people that create things is what I'm trying to say. You need them.</p>
<p>And yes - I get that if people are charging money, you want to know if it's good or not. But reviewers can just say - I didn't enjoy it or I don't think it's well made or I don't think it's worth the money they are charging. That's enough.  No need to get personal for the sake of some likes.</p>
<p>Or headlines if you're press.</p>
<p>Going to step down from my soapbox now. It's been on my mind for a while and just opening my feed today just pushed it all to the surface.</p>
<p>Think of the time you had to recite something in front of the class and how nervous you were. And how much any negative comment hurt.</p>
<p>Be nice to one another, be nice to the people creating stuff to entertain you. Treat them like you would like to be treated if you made something.  </p>
<p>Consider it a strategic investment in the quality of your future entertainment. You won't regret it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Following responses to his thread, Vincke wrote a postscript spelling out that devs shouldn’t indulge in personal attacks either, nor should they “milk players who love their game”. Rather, “what I'm trying to say is that most creative souls are sensitive souls and those sensitive souls are the ones that care the most.
</p><p>
“When they check out because they can't handle the vitriol, we all lose because what's left are those that don't care," he went on. "The effect the words have on those sensitive souls may not be underestimated. You don't want them to lose their idealism and love of players." Vincke suggests that “not playing the games is probably the best [way]” to reproach developers “that don’t respect players”.
</p>
<p>
I’ll keep my own thoughts brief-ish. I have some sympathy for the idea that critics should avoid personal attacks, inasmuch as there is a tendency with videogames to hang the work of many on the antics of just one, prominent figure, which means that both feats of collaboration and wider, structural problems may go overlooked. You could argue that making it personal also feeds an online culture of dogpiling individuals, and especially marginalised people who make for ‘easier’ scapegoats.</p>
<p>Still, it’s utterly ambiguous here where Vincke is drawing the line between “critical” and “hurtful” or "personal". And in any case, it can be appropriate to direct some outright vitriol at the people making a game, inasmuch as art expresses the values of its creators. You don’t get a pass for making poison just because you poured your heart into it. Sometimes, utter scorn is justifiable. If Vincke is serious about this conversation, I would encourage him to actually cite some reviews, games and game developers and discuss the finer workings.</p>
<p>I also have some sympathy for the idea that people trying to make art deserve a break, inasmuch as “creative” work under capitalism is often disparaged for being economically unproductive and "frivolous". But I think the making of art or other “creative” work is mythologised to the point that it encourages people to see any critique as an assault on their very being - and the conceit of artmaking as inherently brave, valuable and worth nurturing may be wielded to silence those who challenge the mantra that the creation of another product is an automatic good.</p><p>That fucking restaurant reviewer from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratatouille">Ratatouille</a> is wrong, in other words. One of criticism's most valuable functions - just as valuable as "discovering and defending the new" - is simply to say no in the face of structural pressure to rubber-stamp the next round of releases. This does actually have its risks: I've received plenty of death threats for scoring things 8/10 or lower, and in a media sphere that depends on traffic volume, there is continual ambient goading to approve of, or at least acknowledge games that already have some kind of mass following.
</p>
<p>
Some quick closing notes: a lot of the toxicity and personality politics of online criticism reflects the workings of particular communication platforms, like Twitter, which reward dunking and hot takes. The idea that a reviewer should avoid commenting on something they consider a failure is ridiculous, on paper. If you’re that reviewer, I’d like to read a defence of your decision not to write about Vincke's prior project. Oh, and as it happens, there are some halfway 'official' systems for evaluating and scoring critics. Go look up Rock Paper Shotgun’s TrustPilot page, if you can bear it.

<p>According to a new report, it seems that Square Enix is planning to release the Switch 2 port for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in the Summer of 2026. </p>



<p>A reliable insider recently claimed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still scheduled to release for Xbox</a> in 2026, and the director of the series also spoke about both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-will-be-similar-to-other-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 2 and Part 3 being in development</a> for the Switch 2. Now, the new development indicates that the port could be released sooner than expected. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-release-window-reportedly-revealed-for-2026">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Switch 2 Release Window Reportedly Revealed for 2026</h2>



<p>The Summer release window for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s Switch 2 port comes through a report by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-summer-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>. According to their sources, that’s the launch window Square Enix is planning for part 2 of the series. However, the schedule may change or be delayed due to additional development time. However, as of now, it seems like they aim to release it this summer. </p>



<p>If that is indeed true, then it is exciting news for Final Fantasy 7 Remake series fans across other platforms, considering Intergrade was released for Xbox Series X/S just over a week ago. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-also-release-for-xbox-this-summer">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Could Also Release for Xbox This Summer </h2>



<p>Additionally, it seems Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth might also release for Xbox Series X/S this Summer, along with the Switch 2 port. Reliable source, NateTheHate, stated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-gamer-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-switch-2-port-could-release-this-summer.1418122/#post-150602587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> that the Xbox and Switch 2 ports “should release at the same time just as Remake did.” So, fans on other platforms might be getting the second part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series very soon. </p>







<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sticking to Unreal Engine 4 </a>for development. Additionally, Part 3 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-bring-back-the-snowboarding-mini-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring back the snowboarding minigame</a> and enhance Queen’s Blood.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite a rather <strong>successful launch</strong> last year, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> hasn't been as big a success as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/"><strong><em>Monster Hunter World</em> </strong></a>and<em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></a></em>. The <strong>low challenge level and massive performance issues</strong> across all formats prevented the game from capitalizing on its <strong>launch momentum</strong>, with sales dwindling so much that it became <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-pretty-damning-lapsed-players-may-not-be-coming-back-to-monster-hunter-wilds-after-all-as-monster-hunter-rise-continues-to-outsell-the-game/">CAPCOM's worst-selling game</a></strong> in the past few months, soundly outsold by games that had been on the market much longer.</p>



<p>While the <span><strong>low-challenge issues were fixed last year</strong>&nbsp;with Title Updat</span>ed, introducing new&nbsp;<strong>challenging monsters&nbsp;</strong>and more&nbsp;<strong>powerful variants</strong>&nbsp;of already available ones, the <strong>performance issues weren't</strong>. December's update was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/">a small step in the right direction</a></strong>, but all eyes were on the<strong> January PC performance update</strong>, which promised to deliver the<strong> performance improvements the game desperately needed.</strong></p>



<p>And, against all odds, the new Monster Hunter Wilds patch <strong>delivered its promises</strong>, significantly<strong> improving performance</strong> on various PC configurations and even on the Steam Deck.</p>



<p>The <strong>1.040.03.01 PC performance patch</strong> went live earlier today, alongside the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?snr=1_5_9_"><strong>official patch notes</strong></a> outlining some of the changes, which include:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Improved CPU/GPU processing specific to the Steam version.</em></li>



<li><em>Reduced shader warming processes performed outside the shader compilation screen to lower CPU load.</em></li>



<li><em>Adjusted texture streaming to improve visual quality while reducing VRAM usage.</em></li>



<li><em>Adjusted the High Resolution Texture Pack to reduce VRAM usage and overall package size.</em></li>



<li><em>Added a CPU tab to the Options menu, allowing players to adjust settings related to CPU load.</em></li>



<li><em>Added new categories to the graphics settings, along with new settings for existing options.</em></li>



<li><em>Adjusted graphic presets and added a confirmation window to automatically update your settings on first launch after updating.</em></li>



<li><em>Expanded the Volumetric Fog setting in the graphics options from two levels to five. The previous "High" setting has been renamed to "Highest," and "Low" to "High," with three new lower options—"Medium," "Low," and "Lowest"—now available.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where a warning dialogue incorrectly indicated that the AMD Radeon driver was outdated when using driver version 26.1.1 or later.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>On paper, these changes sound <strong>promising</strong>, but do they actually improve performance? It seems <strong>they do</strong>, looking at online reports. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Game doesn't stutter with highest textures anymore, very good,"</em> reported <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-released-ver-1-040-03-01.1418182/post-150606088"><strong>moqz on the ResetERA forums</strong></a>. While the user reports that on an RTX 4070 Ti at 4K resolution and NVIDIA DLSS in Performance Mode, the framerate still drops below 60 FPS in certain areas, it seems to be <strong>generally more stable.</strong></p>



<p><em>"Significant uplift. I have a 4070 Ti Super and I'm currently running with everything cranked (including the high res texture pack), DLAA and 2X framegen. 100-120 fps. </em><span><em>Image quality also feels sharper,"</em>&nbsp;said another ResetERA user, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-released-ver-1-040-03-01.1418182/post-150606220"><strong>jrx8080</strong></a>, who's running the game on an RTX 4070 Ti GPU at max set</span>tings, DLAA, and 2X Frame Generation, hitting 100-120 FPS, though the user didn't specify at which resolution.</p>



<p>The first <strong>comparison videos</strong> shared on YouTube by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VideoGamePerformance"><strong>Video Game Performance</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Pandapa"><strong>Pandapa</strong></a>, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@WreckitRai"><strong>WreckitRai</strong> </a>offer a clearer view of what the patch does. While the average framerate isn't significantly higher than the previous version of the game, <strong>frametimes are far more stable</strong>, which contributes to the game feeling generally smoother than before.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new Monster Hunter Wilds patch also brought significant performance improvements on <strong>Steam Deck</strong>. A new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard"><strong>Deck Wizard</strong></a> shows the game running on Valve's system with the patch, <strong>hitting a relatively stable 30 FPS at low settings</strong>, finally making the game somewhat playable on it. </p>



<p>As more performance improvements are expected to come next month, on February 18th, things are definitely looking up for those who wish to play the game on the go and don't want to wait for the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/potato-mode-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-the-communitys-reaction-doesnt-disappoint/">inevitable Nintendo Switch 2 port</a></strong>, which is all but <a href="https://wccftech.com/think-monster-hunter-wilds-on-nintendo-switch-2-will-be-an-impossible-port-new-screenshot-and-information-suggest-otherwise/"><strong>confirmed to be in the works.</strong></a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides introducing these performance fixes, the new Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance patch also addresses the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/">DLC checks issue that came to light earlier this month</a></strong> and impacted <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-can-reportedly-double-removing-dlc-check/"><strong>performance in the Base Camp and Grand Hub.</strong></a></p>



<p>With a lot more online reports mentioning performance improvements with this new Monster Hunter Wilds patch, it feels like the game may finally be in the perfect spot to <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>bring players back </strong></a><strong>ahead</strong> of the yet-to-be-revealed Master Rank expansion. Hopefully, it will build on the solid game mechanics of the base game to deliver the definitive Monster Hunter experience it has always had the potential to be, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>in my opinion.</strong></a></p>

Unboxed and with no mention of its origins, the item was reportedly listed via used clothing resale app Vinted. Numerous fans spotted the item pop up, including notorious Assassin's Creed leaker <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">j0nathon</a>, who quickly realized this was not a statue that had been publicly released already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The item's listing states that it is 35cm tall and features a 20cm width, and due for release in 2026. A detailed close-up of the statue's base shows logos for Ubisoft and Pure Arts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">Pure Arts hinted it had something in the works for Black Flag</a>, and suggested this would surface in the not-too-distant future as "there is something going on." Reports detailing the remake have  since suggested that the game has gone through substantial changes to modernize its visuals and gear system in line with more recent franchise instalments. Another report has also claimed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">the game will also no longer feature any content outside the Animus</a>, with extra pirate missions added instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most notable confirmation of the project came from Edward Kenway's own voice actor, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake">initially teased the project</a> before later suggesting he'd been told by Ubisoft in no uncertain terms to stop talking. Finally, last month, the game popped up on the PEGI European ratings board website revealing what looks to be its final title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft itself previously said it would release an unannounced game before the end of its current financial year on March 31, though this launch has now been delayed into the coming financial year (ending March 31, 2027) due to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">company's major recent reshuffle of teams, projects and studios</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's no secret <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' optimisation, especially in its PC version, has been a bit cheeks even if updates have slowly tried to bite through its many technical issues. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">has been good fun</a> otherwise, but even at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/monster-hunter-wilds-sells-11-million-in-just-under-a-year-but-may-lack-worlds-momentum">11m copies sold</a>, its momentum slowed quite a bit following a huge launch.</p>
<p>January is now almost over and the game's first anniversary is near. True to its word, the Monster Hunter developer has now deployed a Steam-exclusive patch which marks the second chapter in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-finally-gets-pc-optimisation-roadmap-to-coincide-with-title-update-4-but-players-still-arent-really-happy">performance improvements roadmap</a> set in late 2025 by Capcom.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?l=english">patch notes</a> for Ver.1.040.03.01 were shared on 28th January alongside the big update, which also targets the <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained">unintended FPS drops in the Base Camp and Grand Hub</a> oddly tied to unclaimed content <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">discovered by a Reddit user</a> a couple of weeks ago. "To further improve stability and performance across all platforms, additional improvements will be implemented in the Ver. 1.041 update on February 18," the post added.</p>
<p>The major additions and changes target the CPU/GPU load, with shader processes outside the initial one now reduced to lower CPU load during normal play, improved streaming of textures to reduce VRAM usage, and a reworked High Resolution Texture Pack (optional download) which uses less VRAM and takes up less space.</p><p>Players will now also find a chunky CPU tab if they go to the crowded Options menu, with extra non-graphical settings tied to CPU load now available; these include frame skips and limited numbers of smaller creatures, among other things. They might not make much of a difference for beefy builds, but those with slower CPUs could claw some performance back.</p>

</figure>
<p>Graphic settings have also gained a few new categories and extra quality levels. Moreover, the typically heavy Volumetric Fog setting has received three lower options and renamed its "High" setting to "Highest" in case you don't need top-notch fog rendering.</p>
<p>In my own post-patch experience, performance has seen improvements across the board even if RE Engine's limitations when it comes to open levels (something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> also suffered from) are still there. Two particularly taxing locations, the main camp located at the Windward Plains and the more watery Scarlet Forest area, have seen a welcome bump of up to 20 FPS on average. Mind you, my PC rig isn't a low-tier one, but without using the Frame Generation option (on top of DLSS), those zones usually were sub-60 FPS. Now they're well above that mark and much higher with the FG x2 boost enabled. Overall, the game seems more stable and less stuttery to boot.</p><p>On the game's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/">Steam forums</a>, the early sentiment is positive so far, with players reporting FPS gains and a less hiccup-y experience overall. A few users are even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/729154531022090103/">pushing for more positive reviews</a> following the update (the game currently sits at Mixed), but it'll take a while before the community's thoughts coalesce. On the other hand, some veterans are remaining unimpressed by the tweaks.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this is just the second phase of Capcom's ongoing efforts to improve the game's health ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">rumoured Switch 2 port</a> and a potential large expansion which adds to the game's free endgame content updates, which appear to be done now. Hunters on consoles needn't download this PC-only patch.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> developers Paradox have decided now's the time for the medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> to take a leaf out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-2-now-has-a-subscription-service-for-all-the-dlc">its predecessor's book</a> - as well as fellow strategians <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron IV</a> and Europa Universalis 4 - by getting its own DLC subscription service. Starting today, you'll have the option to pay a monthly fee for access to all nine billion or so CK3 expansions and add-ons, if you don't fancy paying to own them outright in the usual fashion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>By taking out a monthly Crusader Kings 3 subscription via the marry your cousin to keep the crown sim's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">Steam page</a>, you'll be granted all all of its major expansions, plus the truckload of smaller add-ons Paradox have put out for it. The price is £8.49 / €9.99/ $9.99 per month, though Paradox do note there'll be "discounts for longer term subscriptions".</p>
<p>The idea behind offering this alongside the existing DLC buying options is catering to "players who’d prefer to play for a limited time or in a more budget-conscious manner". It's a chance for folks who only own the base game to try out all of the add-ons for a month, with Paradox's coffers hoping the end result will be said people opting to keep their subscription running or opt to permanently pick up some DLC they've enjoyed. As someone who got into CK3 as a newbie last year, I can see the appeal. Coming to a game that already has half a decade worth of pretty pricey DLC (even if you wait for a sale) out and discerning which bits add enough stuff you'll use that they're worth committing to isn't the easiest, even if there's plenty of reading you can do to help you judge.</p>
<p>As of writing, a subscription opens up all 25 bits of CK3 DLC included in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/36586/Crusader_Kings_III_Collection/">Crusader Kings 3 collection</a>, which Steam tells me - a person who already owns the base game plus major expansions Royal Court, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sorry-for-all-the-dead-bodies-i-left-behind-while-walking-from-ireland-to-china-in-crusader-kings-3s-brilliant-new-dlc">Roads to Power</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-largest-ever-crusader-kings-3-expansion-takes-us-to-china-japan-and-southeast-asia-this-october">All Under Heaven</a> - would set me back just over £100 to buy right now. There are three other major expansions out right now - Tours and Tournaments, Legends of the Dead, and Khans of the Steppe. The rest are either cosmetics, or event/flavour packs designed to add more royal strategising scenarios you can take on/flesh them out with more choices.</p><p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-launch-dlc-subscription-service-for-hearts-of-iron-iv-today">Hearts of Iron</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/now-paradox-offer-a-dlc-subscription-for-europa-universalis-4-too">Europa Universalis</a>' subscriptions, this CK3 one looks as though it'll expand to include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-show-off-their-mysterious-ass-to-tease-crusader-kings-3s-2026-expansions">future DLC Paradox put out</a> going forwards too. It also shares a need to pay for the subscription on top of the base game, which makes this less appealing than it might otherwise be. There's also the fact that a good portion of the strategy game's add-ons <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-not-being-up-to-the-standard-you-deserve">aren't necessarily things you'll miss greatly</a> if you've not got them. My three expansions plus base game setup's still got tons of scope to steal away hours of my life in the coming years, regardless of not having the likes of coronations or in-depth Genghis Khan simulation.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/</link>
            <guid>1418242</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sometimes, you do have to wonder what’s wrong with people on the internet. Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard sure has come in for a cavalcade of online hate, because… erm… it was the final trailer shown at The Game Awards? Or was it because it wasn’t Half Life 3? Maybe because it was just a bit different? It’s hard to tell sometimes.</p>
<p>This free-to-play hero shooter comes from former Apex Legends devs, drawing on a whole host of random bits of MOBA, Capture the Flag, Overwatch, and Rainbow Six Siege before taking them in a slightly weird He-Man/Thundercats direction. It also gives you a mount to gallop across the map on, setting it quite clearly apart from both its developer’s past work, and its key competitors like Overwatch 2 and Marvel Rivals. Personally, I think it’s a mix that works.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gameplay Launch Trailer | Highguard" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqFccBZyTaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re a Warden, a hero set on protecting the lands from ne’er-do-wells who’d use it for nefarious purposes. I think. You’re equipped with an odd mix of real-world styled armaments – hello sniper rifles and shotguns – and magical Warden abilities, with a limited use ‘tactical’ move, as well as an underpowered Ultimate that builds as you play, with some capable of altering the outcome of a round.</p>
<p>You start off in your own base. There’s six options to choose from, each with different looks, layouts and pros and cons, and you’ll need to work out which works best for you and your squad’s abilities. Each round you’re recommended a particular layout based on your team make-up, but it’s entirely up to you and your teammates. So far, everyone seems quite happy to follow the game’s recommendation, but I can see people settling on preferred options that provide the best opportunities for defense.</p>


<p>Your first task in any round of Highguard is the defensive phase. During this you’re able to reinforce the walls against attack if you’ve got iron, and it’s best to focus on protecting the central areas. Once that’s done, you set out to upgrade your arsenal, either farming from crystals to buy upgrades from the various stalls, or looting guns, ammo, armour, upgrades and special Raid devices from the chests positioned all over the map. The only frustration here is when you’re looking for very specific weaponry, having to make do at points with whatever the highest level thing you’ve found is. You rush around through these two periods, and it feels just about the right length not to drag.</p>
<p>Key to your offense is the Shieldbreaker. Once this sword appears, all hell lets loose as you and every other player on the map attempt to grab it. This is because, not only does it give you a He-Man “I have the power” moment, but it’ll spawn a giant Thundercats-esque tank to break down the shields wrapped around the opposition’s base.</p>

<p>This then segues into the best part of any round, the Capture the Flag-like race to the enemy base while riding your mount. You and your teammates saddle up, and try to find the best route across the map, with attackers hot on your heels, or teleporting back to their base to set up a perimeter. The Shieldbreaker gives off a massive electrical charge, so there’s no hiding here, and it can be super rewarding to set an ambush, or to ride through, scoring kills from horseback.</p>
<p>Once you’re in, you need to destroy the generators that are squirrelled away inside. You plant bombs on each of these, and then guard them until they detonate. Take out both generators, and the game is yours. You can go straight for the heart of the base if you’d prefer, with the Anchor Stone basically a one-shot kill to their stronghold. It takes longer to detonate your explosion, so you’ll have to hold off the enemy team in a tight, exhilarating gun battle, but if you’ve got a group that’s working well together, then it’s the fastest way to victory.</p>

<p>I found it really interesting just how much variation there can be through rounds of Highguard. I’ve won rounds in a few minutes, grabbing the Shieldbreaker and then instantly taking out the Anchor Stone. I’ve also played for well over half an hour, going through multiple rounds of push and pull, driving back siege weapons and attackers, before launching a counter-offensive. Each time you make it through a siege section, you drop back into the tooling-up phase, with the loot and weaponry steadily increasing in level. You can also repair your base against future assault, or go back to reinforcing all the walls, and it all feels rather good.</p>
<p>The 3v3 team size certainly works, though I wouldn’t complain about a few more bodies to bolster your team with. Limiting things to only six players at once, the maps can seem a touch too expansive, but when you’re riding around on your mounts, it suddenly makes much more sense to be covering swathes of ground while astride a bear. I mean, what can be better than that?</p>

<p>The gunplay is enjoyable, reactive and relatively tight, and you can feel the Apex Legends heritage running through each encounter with another player. There’s a fairly short time to kill, but I didn’t feel like I was instantaneously in and out. Respawns are quite slow as a punishment for falling, though, giving you a chunk of time to think about why you didn’t pull the trigger a fraction faster.</p>
<p>This is a game that lives and dies on you and your team playing the objective. It’s also the kind of game where you can’t just wander off on your own – apart from when you’re looking for loot during the interludes. So far, I’ve won most of the rounds where my team actually played together, and lost every one where they didn’t. I guess that will be most people’s experience.</p>
<p>So, the gunplay is good, and the systems all come together in a way that actually feels fresh and relatively new. Where’s the hitch? Well, for me it’s in the characters. There are currently eight Wardens, with five different classes, but within that eight, there’s already a few who are clearly less useful than others. Atticus, Scarlet, Kai and Slade are already becoming popular choices for dealing damage, though I truly hate Slade’s frat-boy visual design, and everyone else is undeniably generic. </p>

<p>My personal pick so far is Mara, the only Support character, though given that I play Moira in Overwatch, and Wildfire has used her design, abilities and personality as ‘inspiration’, it’s an easy fit for me.</p>
<p>The other three are currently much less useful. Falcon can give your team a boost with her Recon abilities, but can be easily evaded, while Una’s Wisps are just annoyances rather than the turret-like minions I would hope for. Her Ultimate is also a thoroughly underwhelming riff on Overwatch’s Ashe. Redmane, meanwhile, feels pretty great, but he’s only really any use when you’re attacking the enemy base, with his destructive abilities more of a liability on defence.</p>
<p>This is where Wildfire need to spend their time. If there’s only five truly viable characters, that’s a very constricted pool to draw from, and it will quickly lead to stagnation in team makeup and tactics. The roster needs a bump – I’m certain that there’s a bunch of characters waiting in the wings – and some of the Wardens need to be rebalanced and retuned.</p>

<p>Few games have ever elicited the kind of online vitriol Highguard has, and you know what? It doesn’t deserve it. There’s something both unique and familiar about it, and as a free-to-play title, it’s not asking anything of you, especially here at the start with its first free battle pass.</p>
<p>There are, of course, microtransactions lurking in the wings, and if you find your eye caught by one of the premium skins for a character, or your mount, they’re not the cheapest out there. There’s a few right now that I’d be tempted by, but after years of Overwatch, I do try not to get too caught up in it. Still, all it takes right now is a little resolve, and you can quite happily play for free. Really, it’s quite safe. Highguard can’t hurt you.</p>
<p>Performance on PS5 is good, with no noticeable hitches or frame drops. At times, it can feel like the image isn’t as clear as you’re expecting, but there’s nothing to hamper the moment-to-moment gameplay. Reports show that this isn’t the case on PC unless you’re running a massive rig, and hopefully, Wildlight can get on top of those issues quickly. </p>
<p>Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony is Quietly Suggesting PS4 Players Upgrade to PS5 Consoles]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-quietly-suggesting-ps4-upgrade-to-ps5-consoles/</link>
            <guid>1418230</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, images surfaced online of a system message apparently sent by PlayStation direct to users on PlayStation <strong>4 </strong>consoles. The message was suggesting they take a look at the latest deals on PlayStation 5 consoles to upgrade and avoid missing out on some of the biggest games set to launch in 2026.</p>



<p>Midway through 2024, the split between PS4 and PS5 players was around 50-50, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide still using the 2013 console as their flagship gaming device.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-time-to-give-up-the-playstation-4">It’s Time To Give Up the PlayStation 4</h2>



<p>The PlayStation 5 has been on the market for more than five years, and the first PlayStation 4 console dropped in 2013, so perhaps it’s time to finally bite the bullet and make that upgrade. That is, unless you’re holding out for the launch of the PlayStation 6 and are prepared to skip a generation.</p>



<p>In a recent image that surfaced on social media, one user claimed to have received a message from PlayStation that was quietly encouraging them to upgrade from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5. The <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/2016232719949189348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message read</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Whether you’re catching up with hits from 2025 like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, ARC Raiders, and Ghost of Yotei, or getting ready for the most-anticipated games of 2026, including SAROS, 007 First Light, Nioh 3, and so much more, now’s the perfect time to upgrade to a PS5 console.</em></p>



<p><em>Scan the QR code to see the latest deals on PS5 consoles.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perhaps it’s good guy Sony trying to pull players in the right direction with their gaming hardware, or maybe it’s a method designed to coax players away from a withdrawing platform that they’ve started sunsetting.</p>



<p>In October 2025, it was revealed that some PlayStation 4 titles would have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-is-sunsetting-some-playstation-4-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certain PSN features switched off</a> in 2026. It’s an effort by Sony to start winding down what has fast become legacy hardware and software, especially as eyes turn to whatever comes next in the PlayStation 6.</p>

<p>Wildlight Entertainment is working hard to address player concerns regarding some of the quality-of-life mechanics in Highguard. Or rather, some of the <strong>missing </strong>quality-of-life mechanics. The game came out just two days ago, and players quickly discovered that some settings they expected to be there simply weren’t.</p>



<p>The Highguard team posted a message on social media addressing the issue and stated that player feedback will be addressed with some rapid patching.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-fov-sliders-incoming">Highguard FOV Sliders Incoming</h2>



<p>Highguard has already had a tough time since jumping onto the market on Monday. It was a bold experiment by Wildlight Entertainment to fuse multiple genres in a bid to create something innovative, but a lot of the effort appears to have been lost in the delivery of the thing.</p>



<p>The launch of Highguard followed more than a month of radio silence after the game’s first trailer landed at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley, who is also being burned after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/">promoting the game at length</a>.</p>



<p>In a recent social media post, the team at Wildlight stressed that some quality-of-life improvements are coming to address what players are asking for the most:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been listening to feedback and working to add some highly requested features, including FoV sliders for consoles, toggle settings for ADS &amp; crouch, and more graphics scaling options for PC. We’re targeting to release a patch tomorrow, with full patch notes once it’s live.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For some, it’s bizarre that Highguard was released with some of these options missing. Regardless, Wildlight is going to right that wrong with a patch that promises to be pushed out today.</p>



<p>For those hanging around, Highguard has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/">a year-long roadmap</a> stacked up and waiting to be delivered. Time will tell how many players are present to see all the content drops unravel this year, though.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Nintendo shared an update about its Virtual Boy library coming to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack next month.</p>
<p>Although it seemingly doubles down on the requirement to purchase new headsets, on a more welcoming note, there will be some quality-of-life enhancements. Apart from the usual options, including save states, the ability to rewind gameplay and remap controls - in case you missed it, there'll also be the option to change the colour of the screen.</p>
<p>Yes, users will actually be able to remove the red lens and swap to the following colours to make the whole experience a little easier on the eyes:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f5a3e167c969d"><a title="Colour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f5a3e167c969d/colour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>The one downside is that this colour change option <em>won't</em> actually be available at launch next month. According to Nintendo, it will be coming "later this year", so you'll just have to wait! Once again, this new feature will require users to physically "remove the lens cover" from the headset.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2b04e90836de9"><a title="WWE 2K26" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2b04e90836de9/wwe-2k26.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> delivered an excellent Switch 2 port last July, and if you were hoping for the next entry on Nintendo's new hybrid system, it seems you're in luck.</p>
<p>According to Dealabs' Billbil-kun, who has accurately reported on game announcements ahead of schedule in the past, the next WWE 2K will not only be coming to the Switch 2, but it will also be arriving on the same date as the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 counterparts.</p>
<p>The current date for <strong>WWE 2K26</strong>'s launch is apparently scheduled to take place on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>, with pre-orders expected to open this week, so we'll provide an update if we hear anything. The source has also shared some details about the physical copy of the game, claiming it will be another "code-in-box release", much like last year's entry.</p>
<p>When we find out more, we'll let you know. In some <em>other</em> sports-related news, it seems the next chapter in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_26">MLB The Show</a> series will actually be skipping the Switch 2, as Sony sticks with a Switch release for now.</p>

<p>To hell with these bugs</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="4e1835aa8e7a7"><a title="DOOM" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e1835aa8e7a7/doom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo and developers have been working to make as many Switch games as possible compatible with the new system.</p>
<p>One of the many titles that has experienced issues on this hybrid device is Bethesda's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a> reboot, which launched in 2016 and eventually made its way to the Switch in 2017 with the help of the talented team at Panic Button.</p>
<p>Although issues with the title on the Switch 2 were thought to have been resolved in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/more-switch-games-receive-compatibility-updates-for-switch-2">compatibility update last November</a>, it appears there are still some problems to iron out. While the title is now officially "supported" in terms of Switch 2 compatibility, according to Nintendo, the "game behaviour may vary from Nintendo Switch".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067orhytl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The update posted on Nintendo's compatibility site earlier this week on 27th January 2026 mentions how "the game sometimes force closes after autosaving at specific points". For now, it's simply a matter of reopening the title when this happens and to continue playing using the same save data.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b83d434af1971"><a title="DOOM" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b83d434af1971/doom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, it's not a major problem, but it's something that's being investigated and will hopefully be resolved sooner rather later. Despite this issue when playing DOOM on the Switch 2, this title, in general, is still a hell of a shooter and a fantastic port from Panic Button.</p>

<p>A week before the title launches on the Switch 2, players can expect an eShop demo on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>. There are no details about the demo just yet, but it will allow save data to be carried over to the full game.</p>
<p>There will also be a special collaboration with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f"><strong>Silent Hill f</strong></a>. This will include a free costume available as DLC. There'll be more details shared about this in the future.</p>

Additionally, a special collaboration with <em><a title="Games > Silent Hill f [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a></em> is planned in the form of free costume downloadable content for each game. <span id="more-1021604"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>In <em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em>, twin sisters wander into an abandoned village infested with vengeful spirits, and use the Camera Obscura, a device that can capture and seal away the impossible, as their only weapon. This complete remake of the second title in the <em>FATAL FRAME</em> franchise introduces new gameplay elements, including a brand-new ending featuring the song “Utsushie”, composed by Tsuki Amano, along with new side stories and new locations to explore.</p><p>During their haunted journey, players will be able to use Broken Spirit Stones to delve into the past of various characters and discover new side stories, expanding the lore of Crimson Butterfly. Players will also explore new locations such as the Umbral Mound, an ominous burial site tightly bound with ropes and hidden within dense bamboo groves, and the candlelit hall of Eikado Temple, with its pair of twin statues tied together by sacred cords.</p><p>The deeper players delve into the mystery of the haunted village, the more danger they encounter. Evil spirits grow more desperate to attack, sprouting wings. In this state, spirits are shrouded in crimson malice, rapidly regenerating health while attacking more frequently and with even greater strength.</p><p>To help defeat the spirits lurking in the shadows, players can use Prayer Beads to enhance the Camera Obscura in battle, increasing the number of focus points and improving the reload speed. Players can also find Reversion Beads as they explore to reset all unlocked upgrades.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1021660"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Using the Camera Obscura, players can take new Special Shots to fight vengeful spirits. Equipping different filters applies unique effects to Special Shots, allowing players to adapt their strategy to any situation. For example, the Paraceptual Filter allows players to activate the Special Shot “Blinding,” which temporarily blinds their target, allowing the player to escape. Another filter, the Radiant Filter, allows players to use the Special Shot “Purging,” which sacrifices Mio’s willpower to inflict increased damage.</p><p>﻿The Camera Obscura is more than a spiritual weapon: it can also be used to capture photographs of Twin Dolls scattered across Minakami Village. These dolls modelled after the Twin Maidens are guardians against calamity. Players can purify them by photographing them together in the same frame, finally putting them and the emotions trapped within them to rest. With each set of Twin Dolls purified, more items will unlock in the Point Exchange.</p><p>In addition to these new mechanics, <em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> also introduces a new Photo Mode that players can use to capture in-game moments. Players can use frames, stickers, and visual effects to create their own terrifying souvenirs and, maybe, capture an unexpected spirit or two.</p><p>The terrifying gameplay gets even scarier with a newly-announced collaboration with SILENT HILL f, the latest title of the renowned psychological horror franchise SILENT HILL that has sold over 13 million copies worldwide. Collaboration costumes will be added as free downloadable content at a later date. More details about this future update will be announced in the coming weeks.</p></blockquote><p><em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,274 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,631 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [908 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,359 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3920610" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 12.</p><p><em>Silent Hill f</em> is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/silent-hill-f-714aed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/silent-hill-f/9n5nfrqv2hqq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Employee Claims He’s Placed on Unpaid Suspension for Criticising Return-to-Office Policy]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A long-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> employee has taken to social media to claim that he has been placed on an unpaid disciplinary suspension for comments regarding the recent return-to-office mandates.</p>







<p>Posting on LinkedIn, David Michaud-Cromp, who has worked at Ubisoft for more than 13 years, says the company notified him that he would receive a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension.</p>



<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, the suspension, which is set to start tomorrow, was issued in response to public comments he made about Ubisoft’s return-to-office policy and an “alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p>



<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-forcing-full-return-office-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-day return-to-office mandate</a>, which Insider Gaming understands has proven to be an extremely unpopular move with employees, David took to LinkedIn to say:</p>



<p>“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they “believe in collaboration”… but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…”</p>



<p>Michaud-Cromp alleges that these comments led to the three-day suspension.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and should one be received, we will update this article.</p>
