            <link>https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-falling-asleep-to-let%E2%80%99s-plays-medically-approved-gamer-melatonin-or-nah.1244448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For about seven years now, the only way I’ve been able to lull myself to sleep is by watching YouTube Let’s Plays. This isn’t a jab at YouTube gamers being boring. As a kid, I would routinely fall asleep to the smooth voice of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpovAmh0blw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA commentator Michael Breen</a>, and this is a similar vibe. It’s comfy shit.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not the only person who uses this very millennial sleep method. There are countless YouTube channels with thousands of subscribers who make content to fall asleep to. And there are plenty of Reddit threads asking for content creators with a chill vibe and a comforting voice, or if there are good playlists to fall asleep to.</p><p>However, there’s always been this nagging question in my mind over whether my self-made, undiagnosed insomnia remedy is just new-age snake oil or if there’s some actual medical benefit to falling asleep to video game commentary. So I decided to ask a sleep expert about it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Ghost in the Shell<span></span><span>Production I.G</span></figcaption></figure><p>A week ago, I sent out a broad message to neurologists in Chicago. Neurologists are medical professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating disorders of the nervous system. A key part of their work involves brain activity and sleep. After reaching out across the Chicagoland area, I connected with <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/kenneth-lee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kenneth Lee</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago and the medical and clinical director at the University of Chicago Sleep Center.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee was quite excited to talk with me because he is a gamer himself. Among his colleagues at UIC, Northwestern, and Loyola, he’s the only gaming professional in the field. (Nice). He provided his gamer credentials, saying that he’s been a gamer his entire life, owns a gaming PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and mainly plays a lot of <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors</em>, and <em>Skate 3</em>, along with RPGs like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> whenever he isn’t playing <em>Mario Kart</em> <em>World</em> with his boys. In short, I wasn’t speaking gibberish when I asked him about Let’s Plays to fall asleep to from a medical standpoint.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a career where patients of all age groups approach him with questions about sleep problems, Lee told me that falling asleep to Let’s Plays isn’t new territory for him.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is a phenomenon that we have noticed. It's not exclusive to just Let's Plays. We oftentimes see this just with people being in bed on TikTok. And then, in the older populations, it's like needing the TV on to go to sleep,” Lee said. “Let's Plays is almost kind of an extension of that behavior in the past. I see that as the Gen Z version, so to speak. But I think that the premise is very similar to what a lot of people have done throughout the ages.”</p><figure><figcaption>Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door<span></span><span>Bones</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Lee admits it's hard to measure, sleep studies haven’t previously determined how many people identify with the Let's Play community for sleep. He notes that a significant number use “some sort of device” as a distraction or noise to help them fall asleep. Lee estimates this accounts for about 20 to 30 percent of the population. However, as the saying goes, just because many people do something doesn’t mean it's beneficial. Regarding whether Let’s Plays help or hinder the process of falling asleep, from a neurological perspective, the answer varies. But Lee did explain the medical science behind what this process has done for people like me as a solution to insomnia.&nbsp;</p><p>“What it really does is that [Let’s Plays] kind of help relax the brain,” Lee said. “It's kind of like your winding down process, essentially, in terms of just kind of your relaxation state.”</p><p>In neurology, Lee says he and his colleagues emphasize to their patients struggling with insomnia that having a routine is important. One suggestion is to set aside a worry time before you go to sleep—maybe two to three hours beforehand, during which you take stock of or inventory the things you need to do or what's worrying you. That way, when the time comes to greet Mr. Sandman, you can dedicate the last hour of worry time to relaxing. Or, in anime speak, Nazuna Nanakuza in <em>Call of the Night</em> saying, “Stay up until you feel satisfied about your day.”</p><figure><figcaption>Call of the Night <span></span><span>Lidenfilms</span></figcaption></figure><p>“These Let's Plays and so forth, really can be an extension of that—[doing] this kind of routine,” Lee said. “The other thing that it does is it gives you something to focus on, to some extent, which can also help relax things, focus in terms of shutting things down.”</p><p>Another aspect of falling asleep to Let’s Plays, which Lee mentioned as a tip for people seeking a good routine, is practicing what’s called sleep hygiene. This essentially means ensuring your environment is as conducive to sleep as possible, such as by making sure your bed is optimized for you to fall asleep.</p><figure><figcaption>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End<span></span><span>Madhouse </span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking anecdotally, my sleeping environment over the past decade has involved cozying up on my Casper mattress and memory foam pillow, putting on my Bose headphones, queueing up hours-long Let’s Plays, and drifting off. A problem with this, however, is that it isn’t good sleep hygiene, because I’m trying to fall asleep to a screen emitting bright light. Lee said he recommends patients try to avoid screens. Although he concedes that his refrain is a boilerplate medical statement, he does acknowledge that for some people, allotting some screen light in their sleep routine can be helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>While in the past, I would turn to YouTube playlists from creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGQkbwm0yHk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Best Friends Play</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-QgmqAlQTgwWi5Jr3sB0d6oRcgWjNaLU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snapcube’s Real-Time Fan Dub</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6EC7B047181AD013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Four Star’s Dragon Ball Z Abridged Series</a> to listen to and fall asleep, I encountered the screen issue Lee mentioned when trying to reset my circadian rhythm: all the flashing lights would wake me up. It wasn’t until I grew tired of modifying familiar comfort playlists by keeping my laptop lid almost closed or flipping over my dimmed phone and started exploring videos specifically made for sleep that I saw a noticeable difference in my sleep quality.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Oneyplays Fall Asleep to Zach (Part 16) [Fan Edit]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PikjT7IJ2qc?start=14434&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>One of the channels I frequent, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SleepyTimeEdits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SleepyTime Edits</a>, which posts <a href="https://youtu.be/PikjT7IJ2qc?si=b1iRjJit3RbruHWr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos of 10+ hours of Oneyplays</a>, sets its videos to a dim, still image, creating a calmer visual ambiance. This transforms video game compilations into a podcast-like experience, as well as providing me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGoLnyMHnD4&amp;t=664s&amp;pp=ygUac21pbGluZyBmcmllbmRzIGFkdWx0IHN3aW0%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Smiling Friends</em></a>-adjacent content to laugh myself to sleep to.&nbsp;</p><p>In describing SleepyTime Edits’ makeshift solution to Lee—asking whether this kind of media engagement supported or interfered with the brain’s transition into sleep—he said that it’s “a bit of a double-edged sword.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Say that you're watching a Let's Play that is super intense, like an EVO event or something that you're really into, that's not the best thing that's going to help you quiet your brain. If it's more relaxing, that can calm your mind down. Even if it's something you’ve seen, like a Let's Play that [you’ve] watched before,” Lee said.</p><figure><figcaption>Neon Genesis Evangelion<span></span><span>Gainax</span></figcaption></figure><p>He continued, “You do have to be careful about things such as light. I recommend to my patients that you use a dimmer setting— a lot of devices now have blue light settings. But really, I also recommend a light setting itself, because a lot of bright light can interfere with your sleep onset, and dim lights as well. It really varies. But it can be paradoxical in that it can be relaxing, but it can also be activating, too.”</p><p>Regarding whether there are any medically recognized videos to help with insomnia, Lee mentioned a treatment he and his colleagues use called <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/conditions-services/psychiatry-and-psychology/cognitive-behavioral-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CBT for Insomnia" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYnudJrod8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“The way I like to think of this is retraining your brain how to sleep. What happens with more chronic insomnia—insomnia that's been there for several months—is that your brain loses the ability of how to sleep,” Lee said. “What [cognitive behavioral therapy] does is help guide you with meditation techniques&nbsp; [and], a lot of times, things that can help, like white noise.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lee said that much of the CBT video content is easily accessible on YouTube, featuring videos that demonstrate breathing and progressive muscle relaxation techniques to help calm the mind and promote sleep. This can be especially helpful when finances are tight and people can’t afford a sleep prescription from a doctor or sleep expert. One point Lee emphasized was the University of Chicago business center's insomnia treatment, <a href="https://www.drlullaby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DrLullaby</a>. During this virtual session, patients, guided by a sleep-trained clinical psychologist, work together to find ways to improve their nighttime sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Lee acknowledged that using Let’s Plays to sleep shares a similar functional approach to cognitive behavioral therapy as a layman’s solution to insomnia-focused sleep medicine, he also issued a warning for individuals who find it helpful in falling asleep or relaxing.</p><p>“During the nighttime, things like noises, even though they’re low-lights and so forth, something flashing can actually disrupt your sleep,” Lee said. “Try to recognize that as well, and try to limit the stimuli that’s around you.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Game Grumps MEGA COMPILATION !!! 8+ HOURS - Sleep Aid - Best of 2021" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mS1tzv_rJYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Which naturally leads into the next reason not to fall asleep to Let’s Plays: random loud noises. When I first reached out to Lee to start that conversation and sighed with relief at my mention of the Game Grumps not making him burst into dust, he noted that LPers you find comfort listening to, while adding to the soothing process of falling asleep, can just as easily break your rhythm if they’re prone to having a shouting match in the middle of playing.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everybody's a little bit different. Some people are going to be more susceptible when you're watching a Game Grumps Let's Play if somebody yells or shouts out something,” Lee said, adding that folks do run that risk of having their sleep cycle interrupted.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to whether Lee considers Let’s Plays a medically sound way to fall asleep or a workaround with its own risks, he says he’s somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;</p><p>“It can be helpful if that's part of your routine to relax and help make it so that you know your mind and your body are in a place that can easily fall asleep. I think that it can be helpful,” Lee said. “I don't think that there's been any evidence to suggest specifically Let's Plays and so forth, or any studies, which would be an interesting area to explore.”&nbsp;</p><p>“That being said, [Let’s Plays] can also backfire on you so you have to be cautious with that. It could backfire for a single night, where, say, you have a Game Grumps Let's Play and then they start screaming [and] that wakes you up, and now you have trouble falling back asleep. And then it could potentially develop into more of a chronic insomnia, where it helps you kind of acutely, but then, over time, because of those things, you're actually developing more problems. That's where it is a little bit of a double-edged sword, and you do have to be cautious taking a stock of your own individualized approach to it.”</p><figure><figcaption>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners <span></span><span>Trigger </span></figcaption></figure><p>I, ever the rebel, have ignored the warning signs because they've also led to a fun result in my sleep, where whatever Dan and Arin are babbling about ends up influencing my dreams. This creates a pretty fun <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BdhmLanXjU&amp;pp=ygUpZ2FtZSBncnVtcHMgdG8gZmFsbCBhc2xlZXAgdG8gcGFwZXIgbWFyaW8%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery box </a>phenomenon every night, where I look forward to seeing how these videos influence my otherwise dreamless sleep. When asked whether there is an explanation for how sleeping with Let’s Play channels ends up scripting my dreams, Lee says medical science has yet to fully explain that phenomenon.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wish we knew more about that or why that happens, but there's so much about the subconscious that we just don't know. As you're going into transition sleep, or even just when you're going into sleep, your brain is not shut off to what's around you. If you think about just kind of why we have that evolutionarily, if there's a threat, you wake up. So you're still absorbing things, you're just not recognizing it. How the subconscious kind of interprets that into dreams, that's a great question. And one I don't really have an answer for, but it has been explored throughout the ages,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>While Lee couldn’t provide an explanation for why Let’s Plays might influence sleep or if they are similar to brain dances in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, he did give a polite send-off to people like myself who use Let’s Plays to fall asleep. It’s the most courteous way a medical professional can suggest to a gamer to touch grass while counting virtual sheep.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you are using Let’s Plays, we recommend that the bed should only be used for sleep and intimacy,” Lee said. “So trying to do those things outside of bed and then, when you're feeling tired, going to bed, is the best approach.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime"><h3>Pretty Girl Horse Racing Game ‘Uma Musume’ Is Engrossing And Weird As Hell</h3></a><p>Breed horse girls to create even better horse girls, so that they can achieve their dream of winning races and performing a concert literally right after</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza"><h3>Why Disability Journalism In Games Needs To Evolve Beyond Marketing</h3></a><p>"We’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Xbox developer Rare, which today is best known for Sea of Thieves, has commented on the recent mass layoffs at Microsoft that led to the cancellation of the studio's long-in-development project Everwild.</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCzbo9xxo4Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves developer update video for July</a>, Rare production director Drew Stevens started off by addressing the layoffs. "It would be strange to jump straight into our usual updates without acknowledging the news that we've ended development on Everwild here at Rare," Stevens said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/another-xbox-studio-reacts-to-the-layoffs-exploding-around-it-with-rares-everwild-dead-sea-of-thieves-dev-says-its-impossible-for-something-like-this-not-to-ripple-through-the-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>The game was formally revealed all the way back in November 2019, but beyond a trailer for it in 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-was-missing-all-these-major-games/2900-6657/">updates on it have been almost non-existent</a>. Sources said Rare was unable to find the right direction for Everwild, and now it's no longer in development.</p><p>The cancellation of Everwild didn't "directly impact" Sea of Thieves, Stevens added, mentioning that development is continuing as planned. "Our focus as a team and a studio is on supporting our friends and colleagues whose roles are at risk," Stevens said.</p><p>The developer went on to say that it's "impossible for something like this not to ripple through the studio and affect all of us in some way or another, so please bear with us."</p><p>"I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who's reached out to check in on us and share their kind words of support. Genuinely, thank you, it really means a lot," Stevens said.</p><p>It wasn't just Everwild that got canned as part of the Xbox cutbacks, as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6726">also canceled</a> a new MMO from The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, as well as the new Perfect Dark. Microsoft also laid off numerous developers across its network of studios.</p><p>The cuts came as part of a wider downsizing effort at Microsoft that affected more than 9,000 people and against the backdrop of Microsoft investing billions into artificial intelligence projects. Some of the laid-off developers at the Microsoft-owned Candy Crush studio King say <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they are set to be replaced by AI systems they helped create.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion from Bungie for Destiny 2 and the first major expansion to kick off a new era of Destiny, the Fate Saga, is out now on all platforms. </p>



<p>The Edge of Fate sees the Guardians getting some help from a new ally, Lodi, as the story centers once again on the Nine, and sees the Guardians dealing with a threat to the universe that goes back even before the Traveler came into the picture. Set in a new location, Kepler, there's plenty of mystery and changes to Destiny 2 coming in this update.</p>



<p>Edge of Fate introduces an overhaul to the armor system with Armor 3.0, a new UI system that's supposed to streamline the experience for players. It also marks the removal of the paywall for seasonal content, and the addition of a new permanent shooting range. </p>



<p>While the expansion is out today for players to check out, the new raid, The Desert Perpetual, will launch this weekend on July 19, 2025.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's been no secret that Bungie has been struggling recently. While this new expansion offers a chance for the studio to experience a bright spot in their calendar this year, the delay for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">massive plagiarism scandal around it</a>, and reports of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">studio's internal troubles all pointing to leadership;</a> it's clear that the studio desperately needs a win. If only for those developers who have been working overtime to fix the mistakes of their bosses. </p>



<p>Hopefully, Edge of Fate is the beginning of Bungie taking a turn for the better. It's the sign of a healthy industry when a storied studio like Bungie can grow in strength over its many years, instead of dwindling into what many long-time fans fear to be the inevitable, that the studio shuts its doors for good within a few years time.</p>

            <p>
Santa Ragione - the acclaimed indie studio and publisher behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-review-a-horrible-nightmare-in-all-the-right-ways">Saturnalia</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mirrormoon-ep-review">Mirror Moon EP</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mediterranea-inferno-review-a-bruising-intensely-stylish-post-covid-nightmare">Mediterranea Inferno</a> - has accused Apple of yanking one of its titles from the App Store without "clear justification".
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Eurogamer, Santa Ragione co-founder and director Pietro Righi Riva revealed the studio's 2016 visual novel Wheels of Aurelia will be delisted from the App Store on 25th July following a number of unsuccessful appeals to Apple.
</p>
<p>
According to Riva, Apple's reasoning for Wheels of Aurelia's removal has remained vague, with the company only citing its "policy to remove apps deemed 'obsolete' or 'outdated'" during correspondence. Riva insists the game remains "fully functional and compliant with current technical standards" and that no "clear justification" for the removal has been provided "despite multiple appeals and sincere efforts to seek clarification." We've contacted Apple for comment.
</p>
<p>
Riva added that "enforced and unnecessary" updates "represent a substantial financial burden" for developers, and "negatively [impacts] their ability to sustain existent projects and to pursue new creative endeavours."
</p>
<p>
"We firmly believe that removing fully functional artistic works simply due to infrequent updates undermines the value and sustainability of games as cultural and artistic products," he continued. "Like books, films, and music albums, video games represent complete creative works that do not inherently require continual updates beyond maintaining basic functionality."

<p>
Riva called Apple's practices "especially troubling" given the tech company's "dominant position in digital distribution", adding they reinforce the "importance of diversified ecosystems". He also applauded the European Union's recent efforts at "fostering more fairness and plurality in the digital marketplace." Apple, of course, has repeatedly expressed its discontent over EU decisions stemming from the Digital Markets Act legislation Riva appears to be referencing, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-appeals-eus-500m-fine-for-app-store-anti-steering-practices-says-its-far-beyond-what-the-law-requires">currently appealing a €500m fine</a> it received in April over the restrictions it places on app developers wishing to use alternative purchase methods.
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione is far from the only developer to take issue with Apple's approach. Studios described creating games for the company's platforms as being "like an abusive relationship" in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-games-for-apple-platforms-like-an-abusive-relationship-say-developers">report last year</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> developer Epic Games has been heavily involved in legal efforts to curtail Apple's much-criticised practices following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">significant falling out</a> in 2020.
</p>
<p>
As for Wheels of Aurelia, Santa Ragione is making the game - a "narrative road trip... set in the roaring Italian 70s" - <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wheels-of-aurelia/id1198170026">free on the App Store</a> until its delisting on 25th July, to ensure "as many people as possible can experience this work before its removal".

                <p>Players anticipating the co-op horror shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killing-floor-3/" data-ref-id="5000-599968">Killing Floor 3</a> are a little concerned about the state of the game ahead of its launch on July 24, as a recent play test a little over a week before launch required players sign a five-year non-disclosure agreement in order to participate.</p><p dir="ltr">The stress test occurred on Sunday during two, two-hour sessions, during which players could request access through Steam. However, the fine-print of an NDA required in order to play raised some eyebrows. As revealed in a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/killingfloor/comments/1lyxr4w/a_5_year_nda_for_2_hours/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, in addition to agreeing to not take screenshots or record gameplay of developer Tripwire Interactive's upcoming shooter, players had to agree to not discuss the test for five years.</p><p dir="ltr">While NDAs are not unusual when playing early builds of games, the fact that the test required one when the full game is slated to launch close to a week later caught many players by surprise. It's possible the five years-distinction was legal verbiage copied and pasted from previous, older playtests, but it still doesn't inspire confidence.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-delayed-post-launch-update-to-undo-a-controversial-change/1100-6529977/" data-ref-id="1100-6529977">Killing Floor 3 was originally supposed to arrive earlier this year</a> on March 25, but was delayed just a few weeks before release. The requiring of a lengthy NDA for a playtest so close to launch has fans worried another delay could be on the way, but in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190?emclan=103582791474057313&amp;emgid=496075125142061061" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> about the stress test, Tripwire said it has been focused on optimizations and enacting player feedback so it can "ship a great game to fans on July 24."</p><p dir="ltr">"This test is designed to help our team and partners ensure that the multiplayer environment stays as stable as possible at launch," Tripwire states.</p><p dir="ltr">Tripwire has already laid out some of its post-launch plans for Killing Floor 3, which include improved animations, the ability for playable characters to be able to pick any perk, and the implementation of text chat.</p><p dir="ltr">Killing Floor 3 supports six-player co-op and features cross-play across platforms. In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-looks-like-2025s-killer-co-op-game/1100-6529407/" data-ref-id="1100-6529407">hands-on preview, we said Killing Floor 3</a> "paints a terrific first impression" and "looks like a killer co-op package," though only "time will tell if it can sustain itself in the long-term."</p>

This is likely the lengthy kissing scene that happens in Lois Lane’s kitchen earlier in the movie. </p><p>The news that kissing scenes were removed from <em>Superman</em> led to reported backlash online from members of India’s movie industry.</p><p><em>Variety</em> spotted Actor Shreya Dhanwanthary <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shreyadhan13/status/1943602667890078128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shreyadhan13/status/1943602667890078128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacting negatively to the reports of Superman’s censorshi</a></span>p: “If this is true, this is RIDICULOUS!!!

Now, studios’ only option to dispute such rulings is through India’s courts, which is expensive and takes forever, and doesn’t work for most movie release schedules.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-big-kiss-cut-india-censored-dc-lois-lane-cbfc-1851786333]]></content:encoded>

Unlike most other modern retro consoles, they are designed to work with original cartridges and controllers. <br></p><p>The hardware was originally supposed to get into customers’ hands in Q1 of 2025, then Q2, and now early Q3.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> next major update is coming August 5, and now Blizzard has revealed two surprise quality-of-life changes that will arrive alongside the new content and season--a bank overhaul and a major update to Valorstones.</p><p dir="ltr">As announced in a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/player-character-bank-updates/2132208" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>, in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a>, banks are getting a significant facelift. For as long as Blizzard's MMORPG has existed (that is, over 20 years), players have had to purchase additional bag bank slots and then place bags within them to get more storage. That will no longer be the case come update 11.2, which will replace bag slots with purchasable storage tabs more similar to stash tabs from Blizzard's Diablo series.</p><p dir="ltr">The update will additionally remove the reagent bank and Void Storage, two bank-adjacent storage options that were more restrictive. While some players were initially concerned they might be losing storage space when hearing that news, as broken down in a post by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1m06ypv/read_this_if_youre_concernedconfused_about_the/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/is-the-11-2-bank-rework-good-the-numbers-and-player-concerns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user SpartanG01</a> (and highlighted by <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/is-the-11-2-bank-rework-good-the-numbers-and-player-concerns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Icy Veins</a>), the new bank system seems to be a straight upgrade.</p><p dir="ltr">Purchasing bank tabs is cheaper than buying bag slots and users are overall gaining an additional 50 slots without any of the restrictions previously associated with Void Storage or the reagent bank. Any bank tab can now be a reagent tab if one chooses, but with the added benefit of not having to use it exclusively for reagents. It's also less confusing, as all banking can now be done with one system as opposed to also using void storage, which was accessed via a completely different NPC and only for certain items. Funnily enough, this new bank overhaul that removes Void Storage is the first major change to item banking since the addition of Void Storage back in 2011 as part of WoW's Cataclysm expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">That, however, isn't the only surprise Blizzard had in store. Blizzard also unceremoniously announced in the game's <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/ghosts-of-k%E2%80%99aresh-development-notes/2119874/10" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">11.2 public-test-realm patch notes</a> that WoW's main gear upgrade currencies, Valorstones, will no longer reset between seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard didn't elaborate on the change in philosophy, but it's a huge change, as previously at the start of each new season players would need to grind Valorstones in order to start upgrading their gear. With this change, players can now stock up on Valorstones ahead of time without having to worry about them being erased in a few months, allowing players to more easily prepare for future updates.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's a great change that will allow players to get a headstart on gear upgrades, it appears Valorstones are still capped at 2,000, meaning players can only stockpile so much. Maybe that will change in the future, but for now, Blizzard is at least making Valorstones a non-seasonal currency.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's Ghosts of K'aresh update will take players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals to stop the Void Lord Dimensius. In addition to new content and the quality-of-life features outlined above, the update will also finally add a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-getting-a-new-highly-requested-emote-for-the-first-time-in-17-years/1100-6532592/" data-ref-id="1100-6532592">highly-requested emote</a>. Meanwhile, Blizzard continues to share more information about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">WoW's upcoming housing system</a> and is gearing up to fully reveal the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">next expansion, Midnight, at Gamescom</a> in August.</p>

            <p>Free-to-play MOBA Predecessor is doing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> as it returns to its original map, in tribute to its Epic Games-developed predecessor (pun intended).</p>
<p>Epic Games previously released a MOBA called Paragon, but in 2018 it shut down the servers. However, content creator Robbie Singh refused to let it die and so, using public assets from Paragon, formed Omeda Studios to develop spiritual successor Predecessor.</p>
<p>A year after its launch in August 2024, Predecessor will now return to Paragon's map, called Agora, following demand from its community. It's a move similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite's OG map</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-original-verdansk-map-return-dated">Call of Duty Warzone's return to Verdansk</a>.</p>

<p>"The Agora map holds a special place in the hearts of OG Paragon players because it was their first introduction to that world, a world that felt vast, immersive, and alive in a way other MOBAs, constrained by isometric perspectives, simply couldn't replicate," Singh told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"The sense of verticality, scale, and atmosphere gave players an unprecedented level of immersion, making them feel not like detached commanders but as true heroes fighting for control of a living, breathing world."</p>
<p>Predecessor plays similarly to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> as a lane-based strategic MOBA with over 40 heroes to play as, but with a third-person perspective and map verticality.</p>
<p>The Agora map will be playable for a limited time in Predecessor's new Legacy Mode, which arrives in the game's patch 1.7. This will also include a new hero, Renna (pictured above) - a powerful dark magic wielder.</p>
<p>Patch 1.7 will be available from 22nd July, and will also include new skins and gameplay fixes.</p>
<p>"There has never been a better time to play Predecessor," said Singh. "The game has evolved thanks to our incredible community, who constantly engage and share their feedback. We believe we've found a great blend of fast-paced action and deep strategy, doubling down on the things players care about most, like increased verticality and fluid combat, while introducing an augment system that gives players unprecedented freedom to shape their playstyle."</p>
<p>Singh also pointed to the regular addition of new heroes and the thriving competitive scene as key reasons for players to stick with the game.</p>
<p>Predecessor launched in August 2024 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic). It's hoped the game will not only outlast Paragon, but will continue to compete against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-service-games-continue-to-dominate-accounting-for-40-of-time-spent-on-ps5-and-xbox-in-us-last-month">other popular live-service games</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-moba-predecessor-follows-fortnite-with-return-to-original-map]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the project that CD Projekt RED just can't put down, as the studio has <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1945136315705467297">announced</a> that it is releasing yet another significant update for the game, with Patch 2.3, that'll be revealed in full tomorrow, Wednesday, July 16, 2025, in one of the studio's RED Streams livestream presentations. </p>



<p>It'll premiere at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST / 5pm CEST, and you'll be able to tune in either on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cdprojektred">Twitch</a> or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/aFLKoZaHak8">YouTube</a>. The stream will feature Paweł Sasko, the associate game director on the upcoming sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and Adrien Jouannet, the lead designer at Virtuos. </p>



<p>While we don't know exactly what this new update will include, the announcement post on the game's official X account includes a few hints that point to the update specifically dealing with cars in Cyberpunk 2077. "<em>We're driving into Patch 2.3 of Cyberpunk 2077 to check what's under the hood of the newest update</em>," the post reads. It then calls Sasko and Jouannet <em>"passengers," </em>and adds an emoji of a tire to cap everything off. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Beyond this new update, it's already a big week for Cyberpunk 2077, since the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-arriving-for-macs-this-week/">officially coming to Apple Silicon Mac users this week, on July 17, 2025</a>. Which is the second new platform for Cyberpunk 2077 this year, after it also arrived on <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> at launch.</p>



<p>The last time CD Projekt RED reported sales numbers for Cyberpunk, it had sold more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/">30 million copies</a>. It'll be interesting to see how many more copies it adds to that milestone, with two new platforms in the mix.</p>

Eager fans swarmed the site, and now, scalpers are already selling some of the product online at a mark-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Secret Lair is Magic: The Gathering's special collection of rare and unique cards, with either brand-new designs or special reprints of classic cards. For Sonic, the Blue Blur <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-magic-the-gathering-crossover-spoilers-secret-lair">got three different sets of cards</a>. The Friends &amp; Foes collection featured new cards that could, presumably, be Commanders for Sonic-focused Commander decks, like Knuckles, Amy, Dr. Eggman, and Shadow. Turbo Gear and Chasing Adventure, meanwhile, were reprints of cards like Lightning Greaves and Unexpected Windfall with Sonic-styled card art.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering – Secret Lair x Sonic: Turbo Gear</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When the set went live at 9am PT yesterday, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sonic-x-magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-drop-saw-eager-fans-running-headfirst-into-long-waits-and-queues">queue formed and quickly ramped up</a>.

Still, it shouldn't be a surprise that a few card sets have found their way onto eBay already, at a marked-up price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Turbo Gear Foil Edition, for example, is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/317084478781?_skw=sonic+secret+lair" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being listed at $70 (or best offer) on eBay</a> with a preorder/presale marker, as the actual Secret Lair cards have not shipped yet. For comparison, the Secret Lair shop price for this foil set is $39.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=sonic+secret+lair" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive options</a>, like the entire Sonic collection sans foil, are going <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/197530527514?_skw=sonic+secret+lair" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for $349.99 (or best offer)</a>, and some listings put individual collections like the Friends &amp; Foes at $80 or more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The strange part is that while the Secret Lair vault will eventually run dry, and some parts of the collection have already gone down to low or no stock, other card sets are still available. As of this writing, the Friends &amp; Foes Foil Edition is <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/product/1161305/secret-lair-x-sonic-friends-foes-foil-edition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still available for $49.99</a>. It won't <em>always </em>be available, but it's somehow both surprising and not surprising these sets are already getting flipped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who'd rather chase after other cards, the next <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preview-everything-announced">Magic: The Gathering set Edge of Eternities</a> is officially out on August 1, with pre-release starting on July 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-scalpers-are-already-selling-the-sonic-secret-lair-at-a-mark-up]]></content:encoded>

It's being published by HypeTrain Digital, and it's due out on PC in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bizarre occult city is ruled by the Traum Family, whom you'll need to go undercover with and infiltrate after these overconfident aristocrats were foolish enough to open the Forbidden Red Door, after which they weren't the same when they returned. Sever says you can play as a "spy, saboteur, charlatan, revolutionary, loyalist — or something far darker. No path is fixed. No mask is permanent."

                <p>A collection of Mario games received a surprise patch, but it mostly serves as a rude reminder that Nintendo stopped selling it over four years ago. The version 1.1.3 software update for Super Mario 3D All-Stars is specifically for its performance on Nintendo Switch 2, with the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/50552/kw/super%20mario%203d%20all%20stars" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo support website</a> saying that the update addresses "several issues" to "improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>The update notes do not detail what these issues were or how gameplay is improved when playing on Switch 2. 3D All-Stars also received an update on June 3, shortly before the Switch 2's launch, but Nintendo's website used identical language then, offering no specifics. 3D All-Stars is not on Nintendo's list of Switch 1 games that received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-switch-1-games-will-get-free-updates-on-switch-2/1100-6530570/" data-ref-id="1100-6530570">Switch 2 enhancements via free updates</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Super Mario 3D All-Stars Review</p>
      </div>
<p>An observer on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1m04l1y/super_mario_3d_all_stars_version_113_is_now/n36qdon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> who booted up 3D All-Stars after the Switch 2 update claims that it still runs at 1080p in docked mode, adding that the UI may have received a resolution upscale. Other users note that Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine still run at 30fps post-update.</p><p>Originally released in September 2020 for Nintendo Switch to celebrate Mario's 35th anniversary, Super Mario 3D All-Stars includes Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. Infamously, the game was only<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-limited-time-availability-for-super-mario-3d-all-stars-other-games/1100-6485623/" data-ref-id="1100-6485623"> available for purchase for about six months</a> before being pulled from stores and delisted on the Nintendo eShop. Nintendo also gave the same treatment to a battle royale title called Super Mario Bros. 35, ending access to it after the company's 35th anniversary celebrations for Mario concluded at the end of March 2021.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-shoot-for-the-stars/1900-6417564/" data-ref-id="1900-6417564">8/10 review</a> of Super Mario 3D All-Stars called the compilation "a worthwhile collection" while admitting that it had "presentational shortcomings."</p><p>With the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. approaching in September of this year, fans are crossing their fingers that Super Mario 3D All-Stars will get a re-release, preferably with Switch 2 enhancements and the inclusion of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-2-is-mia-so-everybodys-sad/1100-6481777/" data-ref-id="1100-6481777">Super Mario Galaxy 2, which was oddly snubbed</a>.</p><p>But Nintendo is a strange and unpredictable company that could go in any direction without warning. Maybe Nintendo has something bigger planned for the 40th--or maybe it has nothing planned at all. If <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-next-nintendo-direct-it-could-be-coming-in-july/1100-6533149/" data-ref-id="1100-6533149">rumors about a Nintendo Direct this month</a> are true, that would be the next place to look out for any Mario news on that front.</p>

<figure><a title="savage raven neogrip review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4aeadfc5a44a8/savage-raven-neogrip-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Skull &amp; Co. released a very nice NeoGrip for the OLED Switch back in 2021, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-skull-and-co-neogrip-for-switch-oled-review">we reviewed at the time</a>, coming away with the impression that, beyond a fiddly holding tab that could potentially get lost, the grips helped make long portable sessions much more comfortable.</p>
<p>With this Switch 2 update, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/Savage%20Raven%20by%20Skull%20&amp;%20Co.%20NeoGrip%20for%20Nintendo%20Switch%202">Savage Raven by Skull &amp; Co. NeoGrip for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which falls under the same 'Savage Raven' banner as the company's excellent Switch 2 carry case (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/savage-raven-edc-switch-2-carry-case-a-sleek-alternative-to-nintendos-official-offering">which we've also reviewed!</a>), not much has really changed.</p>
<p>Once again, you're treated to a well-made, high-quality plastic sheath which the console slides securely into, before being fixed in place with a little tab. Your choice from three sets of grip styles are then clicked into place to complete the deal.</p>
<p>The design here, whilst almost entirely the same as the OLED accessory, has seen a little bit of clever revision with how its fixing tab now clicks into place using a switch that should see it stay secure at all times. You could still lose the little tab, mind, if you take it off then misplace it, however the older design also had the potential to clip off when it hit against things, so at least that issue has been solved this time out.</p>

<p>There are also no separate screws or screw holes for the OG Switch across the back of the plastic brace for this revision either, so it's a cleaner overall product design - albeit one that'll only fit your Switch 2. You can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>As mentioned, this NeoGrip pack comes with the console brace/sheath itself and three different types of grip. The middle-ground grip, which is fitted as default on the accessory, has ended up being the one that I am now using most of the time, as its angular top gives me somewhere to rest my fingers comfortably.</p>
<p>However, both the larger grips and the smallest flat ones are absolutely improvements on the default Joy Con's little grip bumps. I always end up either slipping off those or getting cramp, so I'm happy with the upgrade, thanks.</p>
<p>Indeed, I'm currently mid-review of a game, and for reviews I naturally tend to try to play as much on TV as possible, because I have stupid adult hands that get cramped up and sore in portable mode on Switch, Switch OLED, Switch 2...and a bunch of other handheld consoles. The mid-grips here have my hands feeling fine, with zero pins and needles or cramps detected, and that's after a full-on morning of playing without stops. Result!</p>

<p>As you can see from the pics, the colour used for the grips and brace is also a very, very close match for the console's stylish finish, so you aren't ruining your new tech's vibe at all, and even the bigger grip, with its bulbously rounded tops, looks fairly slim and slick from a side profile. One of my pet hates, no matter how nice an accessory feels, is when it cheapens the look of the console overall by being an off-colour that doesn't quite match, and that's not an issue here. I'd leave it on permanently if it weren't for the fact the Joy Con need to come off so often.</p>
<p>Luckily, it's so easy to take on and off — yes, even for a genuinely ancient moron such as myself — that I can see myself sliding this on every time I'm relaxing on the sofa for some Nintendo time. Which happens about 17 times a day, you understand.</p>

<p>And with regards to the console's dock, with the grips and brace attached, there's no issue for the Switch 2 sliding smoothly in and out, so you can leave it on when playing on the TV.</p>
<p>Overall, then, this one's an easy recommendation if you are looking for a little more purchase on your Switch 2 Joy Con in handheld mode, and an upgrade that's genuinely got my console feeling more like a nice fancy controller when I'm playing on the go.</p>
