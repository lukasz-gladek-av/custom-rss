			<p>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is a football game that feels, almost wholeheartedly, like it’s not really about football. This is a sports drama through and through, focusing on the interpersonal relationships, the individual journeys, and the yearning for acceptance that epitomises our teenage years, rather than sporting glory. You play as Destin Bellows, a young man with a heart condition, who appears to hate football and attends South Cirrus Academy, a school where football is banned. None of this really screams the word ‘football’ – or ‘soccer’ if you’re so inclined – and yet, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road also revels in the joy, the purity, and the companionship that football can bring. This juxtaposition also makes it one of the best sports RPGs you’ll find.</p>
<p><iframe title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road – Final Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8MDQRe5b7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’m a sucker for sports dramas. Maybe it started with The Mighty Ducks, a movie that took a rag-tag team of unlikely players who went from being woeful nobodies to the best team in the league. With Emilio Estevez! While there’s no Young Guns alumni here, there’s that same sense of camaraderie and overcoming adversity throughout Victory Road, starting from incredibly meagre beginnings, before working your way towards rebuilding the school’s football club and setting forth on a path to sporting greatness. It’s the characters that pull you through this drama though, rather than the extraneous bumps in the road, and you’ll quickly embrace Destin and his myriad teammates wholeheartedly.</p>


<p>Level-5 have made this character focus easy, because you won’t be playing football any time soon, at least not in the central story mode. My save file had clocked up an oddly impressive 4 hours before I played my first 5-a-side game against an ageing group of shopkeepers, and I kind of love the investment that’s been built into Victory Road’s narrative. To a certain extent, you won’t care that there’s no football, and when it does arrive, with its quirky stop-and-start gameplay, special moves and occasionally clunky controls, you’ll want to persevere, learn and get a grasp of it so you can lead the team you’ve built to victory. It’s something that wasn’t ably captured in Victory Road’s early beta testing, and it feels a lot more natural within its proper context.</p>


<p>The original Inazuma games were mostly exclusive to Nintendo’s DS and 3DS, using the stylus to move your players around the pitch, and selecting special moves as you went. It was a system that I loved across multiple games, and I was sad to see it go, but Victory Road’s updated take does a good job of replicating and replacing it, with more action and reaction than you needed before.</p>
<p>It’s best to think of Victory Road’s matches as a series of RPG encounters, strung together in quick succession, rather than a football match. Every time your player meets an opposing player, whether you’re playing offence or defence, it begins an encounter. Depending on the player, you’ll have basic options like passing, shooting, or dashing past, but you may also have special moves available to you, each wilder and more unbelievable than the last. That can mean creating clones of yourself to confuse defenders, or unleashing a shot that’s the result of a thousand kicks, but, with the level of variety on offer, it makes matches continually action-packed and exciting. It’s definitely not regular football, but it’s a hell of a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Destin’s tale is easy-going, and occasionally a little slow, but it’s all so amiable, and the characters are so likeable, that I found I didn’t mind all too much. Destin loves to investigate and collect data, so there’s a fair bit of running back and forth, and that’s interspersed with funny turn-based RPG battles/conversations that use rock-paper-scissors mechanics as you try to argue your way to victory. I preferred the original Japanese voices over the English dub, but only marginally so, and if you prefer to play in your native language, it’s perfectly satisfactory.</p>
<p>While the central story mode strings you along without any matches, there’s a secondary story that gets you into the action much quicker. Chronicle Mode brings a time-travelling tale to the Inazuma timeline, sending you back in time to form the ultimate eleven, in the hope of preventing a world-ending apocalypse. Newcomers might raise an eyebrow at first, but returning fans have been here before. Chronicle Mode manages to perform a whole bunch of functions at once: introducing people to the series’ extensive history, getting into the football sections quicker, and bringing an Ultimate Team-like experience to the game to boot. It’s a winning formula, and one that shows how strong the revised gameplay formula is.</p>

<p>Level-5 have given players an absolute avalanche of places to play in Victory Road. From the two story modes, you can then set forth with your created team into a tournament, in either single player, multiplayer or online modes, or there’s another mode where you can play with full-powered historical teams from each of the previous games. If you need a break from all that, you can even create your own Inazuma Bond Town where you can meet up with friends online, filling them with all sorts of decorations, buildings, people, cats or giant statues of Mark Evans. To be fair, it’s probably the weirdest inclusion here, and yet, it feels thoroughly Inazuma.</p>
<p>All of this is wrapped up in a lovely 3D anime aesthetic that ties really well with the traditional cartoon cutscenes. It often feels like you’re playing an interactive cartoon – a fact heightened by the story modes’ many cutscenes, and chapter-by-chapter framing – with Level-5’s design department clearly working at the height of its powers. It definitely bodes extremely well for this year’s Professor Layton and the New World of Steam.</p>

			<p>While heavy hitters like <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/"><strong>Tekken 8</strong></a></em>, and <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> will continue to be updated with new characters and balance changes, which should be even more interesting for the <strong>Bandai Namco</strong> game following series creator Katsuhiro Harada's departure, 2026 will also see the release of some major fighting games. This is set to make it a landmark year for the fighting game community, particularly for those interested in <strong>tag fighting games</strong>.</p>



<p>Luckily, <strong>2026 will also offer plenty to those who prefer traditional 1-versus-1 fighting games</strong> with the launch of a new game based on a successful franchise and a massive overhaul of one of the best fighting games of the current console generation.</p>



<p>Here are our <strong>five most anticipated fighting games</strong> launching in 2026.</p>

However, there's a good reason why the tag fighter set in the world of League of Legends is also one of the most anticipated fighting games launching in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-steam-deck-docking-station-hits-its-lowest-price-compatible-with-rog-xbox-ally-legion-go-and-more-2000657269</link>
            <guid>1399312</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A few years back, Valve changed the way we think about portable PC gaming with the launch of the Steam Deck. While comparisons to the Nintendo Switch were inevitable, the real game-changer was the ability to play your existing Steam library on a handheld device. That innovation sparked an entirely new category of gaming hardware: PC gaming handhelds. Being able to take full PC games on the go was something gamers could only imagine a decade ago (I’m ignoring laptops for the sake of this argument), and it’s a level of flexibility that’s hard to beat.</p>
<p>Handheld gaming is what the Steam Deck does best, but sometimes a 7.4-inch display just isn’t enough. You might want to kick back on the couch and play on a massive 65-inch TV instead. The Nintendo Switch has made this concept familiar—but can the Steam Deck do the same? With the right dock, absolutely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6686/">One superior option comes from UGREEN, and it’s currently available at a 33% discount</a>. Normally priced at $60, the dock is reduced by $20, bringing the cost down to just $40 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6686/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Extensive Connectivity for Gaming</h2>
<p>The UGREEN docking station lets you connect your Steam Deck to an external monitor or smart TV, supporting 4K output at up to 120Hz. That level of visual performance simply isn’t possible in handheld mode, where the Steam Deck tops out at a 1280 × 800 resolution and up to 90Hz. It’s also worth noting that this dock isn’t limited to the Steam Deck—it’s compatible with other handheld PCs like the Lenovo Legion Go and various versions of the ASUS ROG Ally.</p>
<p>The dock charges your Steam Deck via USB-C using 100W PD fast charging, ensuring your device stays powered while docked. It essentially becomes a home base for your Steam Deck, keeping it fully charged and ready to go whenever you pick it up.</p>



<p>In terms of ports, the dock includes two USB-C and two USB-A ports for wired controllers or accessories, though Bluetooth controllers work just as well. HDMI handles video output, and there’s also a built-in Ethernet port capable of speeds up to 1,000Mbps, making it suitable for stable online play or fast game downloads.</p>
<p>The thoughtful design of the UGREEN dock allows it to fold up for easy storage—ideal for travel. You can game in handheld mode on a flight, then dock the Steam Deck to a TV when you arrive at your hotel or Airbnb. The adjustable viewing angle also allows you to use the Steam Deck in a tabletop-style setup, similar to the Nintendo Switch’s Tabletop Mode, while keeping it charged.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders CEO reveals that games like Helldivers 2 inspired them to move away from free-to-play to a more traditional model. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ new extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, has cemented itself as one of the top dogs in the multiplayer shooter genre, doing so without pursuing a free-to-play model. The title’s success is apparent, with the game recently hitting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million sales</a> within 2 months of release. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-wanted-to-make-the-game-feel-like-it-s-totally-worth-40-bucks">ARC Raiders Devs Wanted to Make the Game “Feel Like It’s Totally Worth 40 Bucks”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBeat’s Dean Takahashi</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-boss-says-arc-raiders-usd40-price-was-inspired-by-the-likes-of-helldivers-2-wed-rather-make-people-feel-like-its-totally-worth-40-bucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Patrick Söderlund, Embark Studios CEO, revealed why they ditched the free-to-play model for ARC Raiders. Söderlund stated that they “looked at games like Helldivers” and realised that’s the same space they want to be in, rather than releasing a free-to-play game. Söderlund adds that he is unsure whether this was the right or wrong decision, but is happy about the fact that the game is “relatively affordable”. </p>



<p>Söderlund then spoke about how they arrived at $40 as the game’s price point. The dev team knew that the game didn’t have a campaign, so they didn’t want the price to be a “offender for someone”. Therefore, they decided to “rather make people feel like it’s totally worth 40 bucks.” The hope is that players feel that they got value for their money, “given how much time they seem to spend in the game.”</p>







<p>In other news, the CEO of Embark Studios has stated they don’t want to promote PvP because “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceo-the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game isn’t about shooting other players</a>”. Additionally, ARC Raiders&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-tv-show-and-movie-ideas-being-pitched-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV show and movie ideas</a>&nbsp;are being pitched to the developers.

                <p>More than a decade after its last release, Carmageddon is returning with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/carmageddon-rogue-shift/" data-ref-id="5000-705080">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a>. Developed by Redout studio 34BigThings, this spin-off casts players as a faceless driver in a world wrecked by war, disasters, and an inconvenient zombie apocalypse triggered by megacorporations.</p><p>Zombies--called the Wasted in this universe--overwhelm humans while players clash in deadly races for power, prestige, and a chance to escape the chaos by catching a rocket off Earth. While this sounds par for the Carmageddon course, the catch here is that Rogue Shift leans heavily into roguelite gameplay. Players drive through randomly generated paths and tackle events to seize upgrade credits, and even if you crash out, permanent bonuses unlocked with beatcoins grant you an edge for your next run.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mFmSbChgC8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each run will require you to carefully plot your destination, as your ride will require repairs along the way. Difficulty also increases dynamically, but finding the right synergies between vehicles, perks, and weapons will help you build the ultimate killing machine that can be used against the Wasted hordes or other drivers roaming the streets.</p><p>34BigThings says there are 13 weapon classes and over 80 perks to choose from, and each of the 15 unlockable vehicles has unique handling characteristics related to their drivetrain, weight, center of mass, suspensions, tire friction, and pressure.</p><p>"We made Carmageddon: Rogue Shift to challenge you in a way that keeps you coming back. Our goal is to get you into that flow, firing-on-all-cylinders flow state we fondly remember from the original Carmageddon games and, more in general, the combat racing games that defined the genre," head of design Giuseppe Enrico Franchi wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/06/carmageddon-rogue-shift-new-gameplay-details-on-the-roguelike-racer/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will launch in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Arc Raiders was one of 2025's biggest success stories in gaming, and it's keeping up the momentum in 2026, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">January 4 becoming the game's biggest day ever in terms of daily users</a>. The game was originally going to be a free-to-play title, but it changed to $40 ahead of launch. Why $40? Embark Studios boss Patrick Soderlund said in an interview that the decision to switch from free to premium came after the team saw the success of Helldivers 2, which was also priced at $40.</p><p>"We basically looked at games like Helldivers and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'" he told <a href="https://youtu.be/vY3u7wOmm4w?si=NXyvhtFgKyZ2B6nb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesBeat</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-arc-raiders-cheaper-than-most-triple-a-games-thanks-to-helldivers-2-mostly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>). "We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."</p><p>The executive added that $40 was the right price for Arc Raiders also because it helped the game avoid being an "offender" for players. The game has no campaign and is 100% multiplayer.</p><p>"We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be," he explained.</p><p>Arc Raiders has now reportedly sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">12 million copies across all platforms</a>, driving more than $350 million in revenue.</p><p>Arc Raiders and developer Embark are owned by South Korean game giant Nexon. The studio's previous game, The Finals, was not as successful, but it "laid the foundation for Arc Raiders' explosive success," a spokesperson for Nexon told <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10620485#:~:text=Nexon%20said%20the%20game's%20rapid,in%20annual%20sales%20by%202027." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Korea Herald.</a></p><p>Another high-profile game will adopt a $40 price as well, as Bungie will charge that rate for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-release-timing-and-price-announced/1100-6536971/" data-ref-id="1100-6536971">PvPvE shooter Marathon</a> when it launches in March.</p><p>Given the immense success of Arc Raiders, it's unsurprising to learn that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-received-movie-and-tv-offers/1100-6537191/" data-ref-id="1100-6537191">Hollywood has come calling</a>, inquiring about movie or TV show deals. None have materialized as of yet, however.</p><p>Arc Raiders is a big success, but it also has its critics who took issue with the game's use of artificial intelligence systems for its voice lines. Developer Embark <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">recently defended the use of AI</a>, with Soderlund saying, "People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players."</p>

              <p>At the time of writing, just as the United States of Games Players are beginning to wake up,&nbsp;<em>ARC Raiders</em> has 159,483 people playing.&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> has 597,408. Meanwhile, the free <em>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</em> has 556. In fairness, a few hours back, that peaked at 1,070, the best numbers it’s seen since Christmas Day. For a game that only officially (re)launched on December 4, that’s…it’s not good. It’s very, very bad. But developers 1047 Games are trying to put a positive spin on things.</p> <p>The game once known as&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em> has had a self-inflicted rough time. Originally launched June last year, the sequel to 2019’s free-to-play multiplayer shooter was <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-maga-refunds-reboot-beta-season-3-servers-1851786742">then un-launched in July</a> in response to a cacophony of negative reaction, the game’s lack of basic features like leaderboards, and its <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-skin-bundle-prices-call-duty-maga-hat-1851784073">grim microtransaction prices</a>. None of this was helped by 1047’s CEO Ian Proulx <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-trump-hat-summer-game-fest-1851783949">wearing a MAGA-meme hat in a Summer Games Fest</a> set in the middle of LA’s disgraceful ICE raids, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">then trying to milk the impotent controversy for as long as possible</a>.</p>

 <p>After five months away, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-arena-shooter-beta-1047-games-2000650903">the game was re-released early last month</a>, and you’d be forgiven for not having noticed. While&nbsp;<em>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</em> saw a half-decent 27,000 people show up on Steam soon after its original June 6 launch, that number had plummeted to under 2,000 by the time the game wriggled back into beta July 22. So its relaunch last month to a peak of 2,297 players on PC is <em>catastrophically</em> bad. And that was its peak, meaning the number of people simultaneously playing the game on Steam over the last month is failing to beat the worst of the tail-off from before the game was pulled.</p>

 <p>We must remember, Steam is but one of the ways people can play <em>Splitgate</em>, and doesn’t account for console numbers at all. Of course, an online, free-to-play multiplayer shooter would traditionally tend to find a good portion of its audience on PC, but we don’t have the data to show otherwise. As 1047 puts it in a brief, extremely defensive statement <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982">posted to its official X account</a>, Steam numbers “show one number, on one platform, at one given moment.” Which is partially true. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max">SteamDB, the source of all these PC figures</a>, show the numbers at&nbsp;<em>all</em> given moments, and maps them to a graph. Yes, they don’t show how many copies have sold, but they do tell you how many people are playing at any given point. And it’s barely any. Right now, seven times more people are playing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4147820/charts/"><em>Your Mom</em></a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations <a href="https://t.co/ir9W0BjFHo">pic.twitter.com/ir9W0BjFHo</a></p> <p>— SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The statement begins with an unimpeachably true statement, however. “Steam Charts don’t measure fun.” There’s no denying this, and if the 1,000 people who are persisting with the game a month after its re-release are having a great time, then all power to them. We all know excellent games that unfairly failed to find an audience, and 1047 absolutely should be defending a game its proud of and boasting about its community. It also remains the case that when those games are based on a freemium model where income comes from players buying in-game items, then its long-term potential is somewhat limited.</p>

 <p>The statement is defiant, maintaining “The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of&nbsp;<em>Spligate</em> possible,” and thanking the players the game does have. It also implores people to give the game a try, arguing “the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion.” But what the post <em>doesn’t</em> do is provide any data for console sales to bolster the opening point that people only know how it’s performing on PC.</p>

 <p>It must be so awful, to have worked&nbsp;<em>so</em> hard on a game, and then to have had the enormous setback of a failed launch, only to re-emerge after months more effort and for no one to show up despite the game being free. I can’t even imagine. Yet, I really don’t know if putting out a statement responding to Redditors being rude about SteamDB numbers is the most professional look. Still, it’s working—we’re writing about the game as a consequence, and perhaps that’ll inspire a few more people to give the game a look. I kinda hope it works.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn the playercount is lower than your studio name. <a href="https://t.co/kgdyGxs4vu">pic.twitter.com/kgdyGxs4vu</a></p> <p>— DANNYonPC (@DANNYonPC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DANNYonPC/status/2008628012611158306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Oof.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceo-the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players/</link>
            <guid>1399258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The CEO of Embark Studios has revealed that they don’t wish to promote PvP systems, as they don’t want to foster that type of gameplay. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is undoubtedly one of the standout titles of 2025, and it shows no signs of slowing anytime soon, having recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new milestone of 12 million units sold</a>. At the same time, it seems the developers aren’t looking to go all-in on PvP to keep the fire burning, since the game wasn’t designed with that as a focus.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-don-t-want-to-foster-pvp-type-gameplay">ARC Raiders Devs Don’t Want to Foster PvP-Type Gameplay</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBeat’s</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dean Takahashi</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/arc-raiders/250358/news/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund revealed why they aren’t looking to promote PvP systems. The CEO first mentioned discussions about adding Nemesis systems; however, they don’t know where the team is at right now and are also happy that the game doesn’t have a leaderboard and “it’s not competitive.”</p>



<p>Söderlund adds that the dev team “doesn’t want to necessarily foster that type of gameplay” as “the game isn’t about shooting other players”. Of course, the game allows you to be aggressive and fight other players, “but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players.” The PvP element was added to craft tension. </p>



<p>The Embark CEO then spoke about the game being designed to be played “without other players for a long time,” and noted that this worked quite well in some instances. However, as soon as other players were added, the dev team had to resort to subtle ways of signalling, rather than telling you how many players are on the server, how many have died, etc. </p>



<p>Hence, ARC Raiders is all about players using audio and visual cues when engaging in PvP situations. Players need to hear other players shooting and see raider flares go up to see where the action is. Not providing all the information at once creates tension, forcing players to decide whether exploring the area where the action is a risk worth taking. </p>



<p>However, the CEO also said that private servers in ARC Raiders are “absolutely something we could consider,” and that could be an excellent addition for players looking for more PvP action. </p>

On it are locations in the Fallout map style which, when accessed, lead you to behind-the-scenes information on the show. For example, The Vault 33 outer door, from which Lucy first steps foot into the wasteland, is on the south of the map. The Caswennan, the airship that serves as a soaring fortress for the Brotherhood of Steel, is to the east. And up there in the top right is the locked point of interest alongside the timer, which points to February 4.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/07/fallout-main-1767786059781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The countdown on Amazon's Fallout website.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the day the Season 2 finale airs. So, it could just be pointing to a behind-the-scenes hub for the final episode. Perhaps it will reveal a teaser for Season 3, which is already confirmed. Or, as some Fallout fans hope, it will point to a Fallout video game remaster release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Bethesda follow The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and release a remaster of Fallout 3 or New Vegas? In a recent interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5"><u>Howard remained coy on the possibility</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked Howard if the success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has seen over 4 million players since it shadowdropped last year, was a repeatable trick for a Fallout 3 Remastered. Howard kept his cards close to his chest, and reiterated a point he’s been making a lot in interviews lately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will just say that the Oblivion Remaster, we're really, really pleased with how well it did, it was a very long project too, and not just in how it was received, the ability to shadowdrop it, and the response to doing that,” he said. “I like to do that with games as much as possible. I love the moment that you find out about a game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention made during the recent Fallout Day broadcast of a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, which some (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remaster-new-vegas-boss-danny-trejo-calls-on-bethesda-to-give-fallout-fans-what-they-really-want"><u>including Danny Trejo!</u></a>) had called on Bethesda to develop. Indeed, there were no new Fallout games announced at all. Find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-2025-everything-announced-live"><u>everything announced during the Fallout Day broadcast here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2, Episode 1 Video Game Details - Items and Iconography</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There’s nothing to tease / preview they haven’t even begun filming yet," one fan said, discounting a Season 3 reveal for the countdown. "I know you guys are being cynical to avoid getting let down but there’s a chance this is actually something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Please be at least a Fallout 3 remaster as beautiful as Oblivion," added another fan. "Give us something please. I know it will be 20 years before we see another new Fallout."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG over time (and after a rocky launch), it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

The final battle involves our heroes taking on the Mind Flayer from various positions and using various weapons, while a smaller strike team heads inside to face off against Vecna himself and rescue the kidnapped children.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out Matt Duffer, co-creator and co-showrunner of Stranger Things, was playing Baldur’s Gate 3 when he and his brother, Ross Duffer, were working out how the final battle would go down, and Larian’s much-loved party-based role-playing game influenced how it would play out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with Variety, Matt Duffer pointed to D&amp;D and Baldur’s Gate 3 (Baldur’s Gate 3 is of course an official D&amp;D video game, using its rules for combat and set in its universe).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We were thinking about D&amp;D, and I was playing Baldur’s Gate 3 at the time, and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together,” Matt Duffer explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everyone had fully realized — either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and something like Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stranger Things Season 5 Finale Trailer Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Baldur’s Gate 3, players control not only their created character, but its now-famous companion characters in combat. The likes of Shadowheart, the half-elf Cleric, Astarion, the high elven Rogue, and Karlach, the Tiefling Barbarian, all bring different skills to the table, and finding ways to make the most of them in tough boss fights is part of the fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, the heroes of Stranger Things bring their own skills to bear in the final battle. Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) uses her powers to carve a path inside the Mind Flayer and battle Vecna. Meanwhile, Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) suggests the others spread out, flank it on all sides, “Just chip away at its hit points.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), doing her best Rambo impression, uses her gun skills to get the Mind Flayer’s attention, while the rest of the team ambush it from above.

            <p>Filming for the third season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation is kicking off sooner that we first expected.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks ago (ok, possibly slightly longer than that), the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">series' executive producer Jonathan Nolan said the Fallout crew hoped to start filming sometime this summer</a>, however we now know that filming is actually going to start this May. To be more specific, filming is scheduled for 1st May, in Santa Clarita.</p>

<p>Frederick E.O. Toye is once again going to be handling director duties during Fallout's third season, which according to a <a href="https://productionlist.com/filming-may-frederick-e-o-toye-direct-upcoming-series-fallout-season-3-santa-clarita-ca-united-states/">production post on Film and Television Industry Alliance</a> will bring "continuity and seasoned genre expertise" to the new episodes.</p>
<p>"Toye's contributions behind the camera have been notable across seasons one and two, providing a consistent visual and narrative rhythm that anchors the show's sprawling world," the post reads.</p>
<p>As for the California location, this is the "logical return point" for Fallout season three, as the team has already built a number of set pieces and such there, after filming moved from New York to The Golden State for the second season.</p><p>"The early May shoot date gives department heads and crew ample time to position themselves for hiring. Set builders and art departments should prepare to expand practical landscapes and terrain builds that reflect the saga's continuation through the Classic Wasteland and into new territory," the production post for Fallout season three adds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">Fallout was renewed for a third season back in May of last year</a>, months before season two made its debut. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">Bethesda's Todd Howard confirmed the third season was already being written</a>.</p>
<p>As for season two, its episodes are currently airing weekly over on Amazon Prime. Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Cast n Chill - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161349/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a> is one of those games that, the instant I clapped eyes on it, and even with other people telling me that it's real good, I got the feeling I'd just never get around to it.</p>
<p>That's not to say fishing isn't for me or anything. I have fished in real life. Oh yes. My dad used to take me when I was a kid, back in the 1850s, and I even have some very fond memories of fishing-related stuff as a result; sticking hooks through squirming maggots and watching the pus run out of 'em, pouring soapy water on the back lawn to get some worms, and the stink of a fish that I'd taken home to eat (Victorian times just hit different) but forgot about and left in my bag. Yeah, that stank.</p>
<p>Now, though, that I've been sat playing Cast n Chill obsessively for the past couple of days, I'm here to report that it's a very worthwhile experience that you should go get stuck into immediately. The reasons for this are several-fold. Firstly, this is <em>easily</em> one of the nicest-looking things I've had light up my Switch 2's LCD screen thus far, and one of the most effective uses of this retro pixel art style I've yet encountered.</p>

<p>Which feeds straight into the next reason: the atmosphere is immaculate <em>at all times.</em> This is a game about the joy of finding a little pocket of time to go somewhere still and serene, somewhere so still and serene (and Canadian, by the looks of things, though the small Wombat Brawler team hails from Australia) that water turns to glass, time comes to a standstill, and you're left with your thoughts and the fish. And the perfect soundtrack. Lots of things, but the fish are the next main reason.</p>
<p>Fishing here, you see, is actually way more engrossing than I'd expected. Each beautiful little pixelated region you unlock to visit comes with its own unique fish below its waterline. Fish types all behave differently, and so there's actually a tight gameplay loop under all the vibes. Catch fish, add them to your encyclopaedia, sell them for coin, shop for lures, rods, and other upgrades — even new boats! — and then head out to catch the trickier devils, right up to some big old rod-breaking legendary sea beasties who you'll need to tip the shopkeeper to drop rumours about!</p>
<figure><a title="Cast n Chill - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161342/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It all comes together so nicely, the devs have nailed little details such as the plop and pull of your float, the gentle rumble of your controller as you rake a spinner across a shoal of fish to attract them, the weight and heft of everything, really. Oh and you've got a dog with you to pet. It's perfect!</p>
<p>Also, with only two buttons controlling everything you do (and even an idle mode, if that's your thing), there's nothing standing in your way. Heck, there's even a local co-op mode for a friend to join you in the same boat, so you can cast and chill together. Blissful!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although the <strong>PC market</strong> has significantly gotten bigger over the years, consoles like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/">PlayStation 5</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/">Nintendo Switch</a></strong>, and its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">successor</a></strong> released last year continue to dominate the video games market as a whole in many regions of the world.</p>



<p>However, the increased number of releases on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC storefronts</strong> of the past few years indicates that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">something is shifting</strong>. So much so that some celebrated game creators believe that the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC market has become dominant</strong> at this point.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19255-the-hundred-line-interview-kodaka-dlc-new-characters-routes-uchikoshi-switch-2">RPG Site</a></em></strong> focused on his latest game, <strong><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></strong>, <strong><em>Danganronpa</em></strong> series creator <strong>Kazutaka Kodaka</strong> was asked about the game's excellent PC port. His reply leaves no room for interpretation: <strong><em>"The market is dominated by PC now,"</em></strong> he said. <strong><em>"Releasing worldwide on Steam is essential."</em></strong></p>



<p>While <strong>Kodaka-san</strong> didn't add more about the matter, his confirmation that the team is <strong>not considering PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ports</strong> of <strong><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></strong> makes it clear how much the market seems to be leaving traditional home consoles behind, <strong>shifting towards PC</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pc-become-the-unified-gaming-platform">Will PC Become the Unified Gaming Platform?</h2>



<p>Following the heights of the early 2020s, when people spent more time at home playing video games due to the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, the video game market has been experiencing some <strong>turbulent times</strong>, putting the traditional business model that has held so far in question.</p>



<p>A few days ago, former Chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios <strong>Shawn Layden</strong> highlighted in an interview how the <strong>total install base of console users hasn't changed much</strong> in the past few generations, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-trapped-in-this-containment-field-former-sony-exec-proposes-single-gaming-format-to-expand-console-market/"><strong>proposing the creation of a consortium</strong></a> in the vein of those which pushed for unified formats like the <strong>VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray</strong> to make the video games industry move towards a <strong>single gaming format</strong> that could be licensed out.</p>



<p>With releasing games on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Steam for PC</strong> seemingly having become <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">essential</strong>, and both <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Microsoft and Sony</strong> increasing their focus on this market, it definitely feels like the industry may already be moving towards a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unified gaming format centered on the platform</strong>, whose appeal has further increased with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">handheld gaming systems</strong> like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck</a></strong> and <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbo</a></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">x</a></strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/"> Ally</a></strong>.</p>



<p>With the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-ram-prices-could-be-the-next-big-problem-for-pc-gamers/">massive price spike for RAM</a></strong> due to the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-cost-increase-allegedly-behind-microsofts-rumored-new-massive-round-of-job-cuts/">AI craze</a></strong>, which is set to increase the price of almost every electronic device significantly, however, this move could be <strong>considerably delayed</strong>, as the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-industry-as-a-whole-is-concerned-about-ram-availability-heres-why-the-playstation-6-and-xbox-next-could-be-delayed-past-2027-2028/">current console generation could be extended</a></strong> until the situation normalizes.</p>

			<p>Like in the past few years, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA</strong> took advantage of this year's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Consumer Electronics Show</strong> to make some important announcements. While the company is not launching any new <span>GPUs in the near future, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/"><strong>it has </strong></a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/">announced</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/">&nbsp;<strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong></a>, which features a new iteration of the&nbsp;<strong>Transformer model,</strong>&nbsp;as well as new&nbsp;<strong>Multi-Frame</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Generation</strong> features exclusive to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 50 series</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-591-74-driver-now-available-with-dlss-4-5-support/"><strong>With new drivers</strong></a> and update to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">NVIDIA App</strong>, it is now possible to use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution</strong> thanks to new drivers with every game that supports <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS</strong>, delivering even <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">better image quality than native resolution</strong> in some cases, such as in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong>.</p>



<p>A new comparison video <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">created by&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmarkPC</strong>&nbsp;showcases the game running with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5,</strong>&nbsp;featuring the second-generation transformer model, side by side at&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1440p and 4K resolutions</strong>, with&nbsp;</span>ultra settings in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Quality, Balanced, and Performance</strong> modes on an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 5080</strong> GPU.</p>



<p>The considerable image quality improvements over <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong> are evident in the side-by-side comparison at <strong>1440p resolution</strong> in <strong>Quality mode</strong>, but even more impressive is how the new transformer model delivers <strong>better image quality than native resolution</strong>. This is easily noticeable with the <strong>terrain and grass</strong>, which look considerably sharper with <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the new <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Super Resolution transformer model</strong> isn't perfect, as it seems to have some trouble <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">rendering leaves on trees</strong> correctly.

This performance impact, however, remains small on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 50 and 40 series</strong> thanks to the use of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">FP8</strong> in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blackwell and Ada GPUs</strong>.</p>

This is to be expected, considering this is the new model's first release, which is only going to get improved in the future.</p>

Often moments are punctuated by music to inform how a character feels, or tip us off subconsciously the gravitas of what is happening on scene. All of 2025's nominees are incredible at heightening the experience of their games.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Best Soundtrack Award for for outstanding overall score.</p><ul><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Doom: The Dark Ages</li><li>Hades II</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2><p>Developer: Kojima Productions | Release Date: June 26th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> features a pretty eclectic soundtrack, mixing some cinematic orchestra scores with what I like to call "sadboi" music (gender neutral). The more contemporary, personal tracks from Woodkid juxtapose nicely with the grand scale that Ludvig Forssell brings to the soundscape, which reflects the overall vibe of the game pretty well.</p><p>Forssell's scores feels like something out of a movie, where each track really fits the scene or character it's used for. "Higgs" is eerie, menacing, and just a little off-kilter, using violins, a choir, and an electric guitar later (which is deeply funny).</p><p>Conversely, "Neil Vana" feels simultaneously hopeful as it does tragic, mirroring his overall character arc. And if you're looking for bombastic epic action set pieces, Forssell delivers in songs like "One Last Fight" and "Good Old Fashioned Boss Fight."</p><p>Woodkid brings a different energy to <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, filling the space that Low Roar occupied in the prequel. If Forssell perfectly fit the cutscenes and the action gameplay, Woodkid was the soundtrack to everything else. You'll spend hours roaming the landscape of Australia, and when you finally crest that hill or cross that canyon as the rain lets up, the soothing tones of Woodkid's relaxed vibe feels like the perfect reward as you cruise to your destination.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s soundtrack is as pretty as it is depressing. It's tragic and operatic, opting for soaring strings and pensive pianos to underscore a lone woman's voice for many songs.</p><p>"Lumiére" sets the tone very well for the early part of the game, underscoring this melancholic scene as people dissolve into nothingness. There's a bustling movement to the melody that brings the city to life a bit, but the timbre of singer Alice Duport-Percier's voice carries more sorrow than it does joy.</p><p>When it comes to fights and action though, <em>Clair Obscur</em> brings in thunderous drums, triumphant horns, a powerful choir, and some electric oomph carry the energy. The songs "Paintress" and "Une vie à peindre" both play at pivotal boss fights in the second half of the game, and their energy ups the stakes while providing moments of solemn contemplation. Even better, they're fitting for what those boss fights symbolize in the story, too.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Hades II</h2><p>Developer: Supergiant Games | Release Date: September 25th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Once again, Darren Korb spearheads a fantastic soundtrack for Supergiant Games.<em> Hades II </em>feels both familiar and fresh, building on its predecessor while carving out a unique sound for itself. In some ways, this soundtrack comes off like an alternate-universe version of the one we heard with Zagreus.</p><p>Much like the previous game, many tracks come with two sort of "modes," the second of which tends to amp things up with more gain and a harder energy. It's what you hear when you find a room with a guardian, making each level's songs flexibly switch between exploration and serious combat.</p><p>Where <em>Hades II</em> really differs, however, is how its music is both familiar but eerily different. Occasional hits of glitchy sounds and extra distortion punctuate familiar melodies, delivering on the idea that Melinoe is returning to a home she never had.</p><p>Time-like motifs also come through in the music, as you might expect for a game all about killing Chronos. You'll hear the use of bells throughout the soundtrack, which evokes a feeling of nostalgia and longing for a time gone past. Additionally, in the song "The Titan of Time," you hear what sounds like a clock ticking throughout the track, perfect for while you're fighting time itself.</p><p>And of course, it's hard to talk about the music in <em>Hades II </em>without mentioning Scylla and the Sirens, the bosses who play the boss fight music as you cut them down one by one. When you knock one down, their respective part in the song stops until they're all down. It's a clever way to make the music feel like part of the world, and it's only made better by the fact there isn't a single bad track on the OST.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

            <p>“Weird spiderwebs appearing at odd hours of the night in Rockstar’s open world game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>?” you chortle. “That sounds like the testimony of crazy old Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, the guy who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-is-back-with-new-god-sim-masters-of-albion-which-looks-like-a-stripped-down-black-white">writes about new Molyneux projects</a> like a pauper child returning from market with a handful of magic beans”. Mates, I promise I haven’t fallen victim to a scam of some kind. There <em>are</em> weird spiderwebs in RDR2. I read about it on the internet! </p>
<p>The spiderwebs appear to be part of a huge Easter egg puzzle the community (aka Youtubers, <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/2007812677452632245">Xitter users</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/1pqpqup/gonna_try_to_find_the_spider_dream_mystery/">redditors</a>) are now attempting to solve – an Easter egg that has allegedly lain uncracked since the game’s initial release in 2018. Spoilers to follow, of course.</p><!--more-->
<p>The webs are referred to in the game’s files as “spiderdreams”, which invites association with the dreamcatchers from the Wisdom of the Elders side missions. They appear on telegraph poles throughout the landscape – the first to be discovered by users goldenplaysterraria, pariah87, and FL4VA-01 is found on a pole by the side of the railway between Citadel Rock and Heartland Oil Fields, at 3 to 4am in the morning. </p>
<p>There’s a feather dangling from the spiderweb you’ll seemingly need to shoot to advance the puzzle. There is also a rough carving of a spider on the pole, which is actually a secret map. </p>
<p>“Spidermaps on poles?” you sneer. “That sounds like the affidavit of crazy old Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, the guy who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dr-robotniks-ring-racers-is-a-gorgeous-free-snes-style-arcade-racer-built-using-doom-legacy">calls Sonic games ‘SNES-style’</a>.” Friend, I assure you that I am on the level. Slide that carving over the game’s mapscreen to find the locations of several more spiderwebs, all of which spawn at certain times.</p><p>Head to the spidermap’s heart, and you’ll find a bigger spiderweb pointing you north to yet more poles, and yet more webs and other objects with occult spawning or activation criteria. Here’s a video from Strange Man to show you how. Commenters on the video claim the spiderwebs have been spawning since the game's release, way back in 2018.</p>

<p>There was an Easter egg mystery similar to this in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>. Rockstar are in the habit of them. All told, you can see why some people work themselves up into an absolute froth over the possibility of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-vi-will-be-revealed-this-week-if-you-believe-the-fans">GTA 6 release information squirrelled away in the phases of the Moon</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/after-8-years-red-dead-redemption-2-players-are-scrambling-to-solve-a-newly-unearthered-mystery/">VGC</a> for bundling up the latest speculations. Any thoughts/hopes about what might lie at the end of the trail? As per my headline, I'm hoping for something comparable to Link's Awakening.</p>

		<p>PUBG has been updated to version 39.2 on PC today, with consoles getting the update on January 15th, and this update has intensified the environmental conditions that were first introduced as part of Erangel: Subzero.

Users younger than 9 must have parental consent to use chat.</p><p>“Tens of millions of daily active users have already completed an age check, and we expect<br>many more to follow,” Roblox says. “In Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, where age checks have been required to chat since early December, more than 50% of daily active users have completed the process.”</p><div><p>Multiple states filed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">lawsuits</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/793711/another-state-is-suing-roblox">last</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/816549/texas-roblox-lawsuit-child-safety">year</a> against Roblox over child safety issues.

            <p>That <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-launch-with-native-linux-support-though-the-steam-deck-is-not-officially-recommended">poll I posted the other day</a> suggests that over half of you RPS reader types play games on Linux, either in part or exclusively. And if a poll says it, I’m in no position to argue, so boy do I have just the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2026">CES 2026</a> story for you: Lenovo are making a SteamOS version of their premium Legion Go 2 portable, joining the lower-end <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/m">Legion Go S</a> in spreading the Linux-based SteamOS beyond the confines of Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Decks</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Vanquishing the evils of Windows on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">handheld PCs</a> – with its nefarious bloatware and user interface designed by Beelzebub himself – is more vital than ever, given the cheapest LCD Decks’ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lcd-steam-decks-days-are-coming-to-an-end-as-valve-wind-down-production-of-the-og-model">recent discontinuation</a>. The SteamOS Legion Go 2, mind, isn’t exactly a like for like alternative. It shares specs with 2025’s Windows version, meaning a honking 8.8in, 1200p, 144Hz OLED display, up to 2TB of SSD storage, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU. Like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Legion Go</a>, it also gets all Switch-like with removable controllers, one of which transforms into a dinky upright mouse.</p>
<p>It's also going to be rather un-Steam Deckish on price. I’m still waiting on its UK ticket but the SteamOS Legion Go 2 will apparently start at $1199/€1049, keeping it even costlier than the famously expensive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. Also, roughly double that of the Legion Go S, Lenovo’s first crack at an official SteamOS handheld.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Lenovo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All the same, I’m pretty keen to try out the big’un. Mainly because it appears to fix a lot of what held the first Legion Go back: the display rez is a far more sensible 1920x1200, reducing power draw versus the original’s pointlessly high 2560x1440 pixel plate, and the battery itself has ballooned from a 49Whr to 74Whr capacity. After the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>, it’s also hard not to feel like OLED is just the outright superior panel tech for handhelds; it’s brighter, more colourful, more efficient, and physically thinner than IPS/LCD. All that, plus a better operating system, sounds like something that’s at least worth investigating.</p><p>Not that you can’t wrangle SteamOS onto an existing, Windows-fuelled Legion Go 2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbHDHzYw3KE">This cheerful man surrounded by toys</a> manages it in a trifle. There’s still plenty of technofaff involved, though, so waiting a few months for a fully preinstalled and certified SteamOS model will remain the simpler, potentially safer play.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s at its best during your first trip into the war-torn ruins of downtown DC. Rather than an open and desolate expanse, you're navigating tight underground passageways by Pip-Boy light, occasionally emerging into the daylight to fight through patches of ruined city often littered with battered landmarks. Bethesda had initially envisioned this urban jungle to be even more of an expansive labyrinth, and a group of modders have now had a crack at resurrecting the cut areas to create their own version of that more expansive DC.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The creation of the group - who go by the DC Anniversary Project team - dropped over the festive period. It's called 'Fallout 3 Anniversary - District of Columbia' and principally adds back in 13 areas Bethesda elected to pull the plug on when they ditched an initial plan for Fallout 3's DC area to be made up of 26 neighbourhoods - as outlined in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o93pnsgWWkI">lengthy video</a> on the game's cut content which the modders have handily linked.</p>
<p>"While very little remains of the actual exterior areas of these missing worldspaces, there is just enough cut content and information left over in the final game to piece together what was cut, where they were, and, in some cases, what dungeons they might have originally had within them," the modders wrote, also noting that some bits of these cut areas were repurposed by Bethesda as locations in the wasteland outside of downtown DC itself.</p>
<p>So, having reached out to Fallout 3 level designer Jesse Tucker and drawn inspiration from <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/landing/adam">Adam Adamowicz</a>'s concept art for the game, the group have had a go at revamping and rejigging the DC ruins into "a labyrinthian maze of unique worldspaces that try to stay true not only to what the Fallout 3 developers might have originally made, but also to the urban and suburban environments of real-life DC and Virginia that these cut worlds were based on." In the process, they say they've more than doubled the area's size and moved around an <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/articles/56886">entire article</a>'s worth of vanilla locations like Arlington Library and Temple of the Union compound to fit that reimagining.</p>



<p>As for the 13 resurrected areas, five are categorised by the modders as belonging to the District of Columbia, while eight are classed as part of Virginia. Taking the revamped network of metro tunnel arteries to reach them, you'll find the likes of cut NPCs and dungeons brought back alongside vanilla locations which've been moved. For example, there are buildings belonging to corps West Tek, Poseidon Energy, and Red Rocket to explore. Annandale Armory and Alexandria City Hall are a couple of other new interiors listed by the modders in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/articles/56887">another article</a> and/or shown off in screenshots to have caught my eye.</p><p>As you might expect with a mod this ambitious, District of Columbia looks to have had a number of early bugs and teething issues its creators have had to work through. If you fancy giving it a go, there's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/27168?tab=description">a version</a> for regular Fallout 3, plus <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/95276?tab=description">one</a> designed to work with the <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/">Tale of Two Wastelands</a> mod which allows you to travel between the Capital Wasteland and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>' Mojave. There aren't any other hard requirements listed, through installation via Mod Organiser 2's recommended and you'll need to use either <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/21174">FO3LODGen</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58562">FNVLODGen</a> to avoid pop-in.</p>

<p data-start="394" data-end="948">While Sony has continually evolved its DualShock controllers each generation with new features like touchpads and adaptive triggers, Microsoft has taken a more conservative approach. The company pretty much nailed it with the Xbox 360 design. When the Xbox One controller launched in 2013, its ergonomics had been updated a bit. Now, more than a decade later, the design remains nearly identical, with only minor tweaks to keep up with modern standards. These include Bluetooth support, a switch to USB-C, and improvements in material quality. But overall, it’s the same controller that debuted alongside the console generation that first saw <em data-start="927" data-end="947">Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p data-start="950" data-end="1047">The Xbox Core controller has stuck to its tried-and-true formula because, quite simply, it works. Its super comfortable to play with, especially during long gaming sessions. I recently played <em data-start="1229" data-end="1244">Hollow Knight</em> on my PlayStation 5 in the lead up to <em data-start="1283" data-end="1293">Silksong</em>‘s launch. I decided to play the sequel upon release on PC and gifted myself a my first new Xbox controller in years. I hadn’t updated my Xbox controllers since the first couple years of the Xbox One, sticking mainly to PlayStation or third-party controllers like those from 8BitDo. It was a real “welcome home” moment. The comfort and ergonomics just feel so natural compared to other gamepads on the market.</p>


<p data-start="1655" data-end="2132">A standout but often underrated feature of the controller is its super precise D-pad. You’re in complete control as you guide Hornet throughout the world of Pharloom. The textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case are a thoughtful addition, making the controller feel secure and comfortable, especially during heated moments. It’s a small touch, but when my hands start to sweat during tough boss battles, it’s something I really appreciate.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2634">Microsoft has embraced customization options over the last decade. With the Xbox Accessories app, players can remap buttons to suit their preferences, adding a layer of accessibility that’s welcome for many. This feature is a great boon for those with specific needs to allow them to play at all, but it’s also useful for players who just want to personalize their setup. For example, someone who grew up with Nintendo consoles might struggle with the A and B button positions, and remapping can make all the difference.</p>
<p data-start="2636" data-end="3049" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Overall, the Xbox Core controller is a masterclass in simple, effective design. It may not have the flashy additions that PlayStation has introduced, but its comfort, precision, and customization options make it a gamepad that just works—no gimmicks necessary. That also keep the price down. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6684/">At just $50 for a limited time, this Ice Breaker Xbox core controller is a no brainer.</a></p>

                <p>This year's first <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> (AGDQ) charity livestream has shown players a side of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> that they may not have been aware of before. Free Roam mode lets fans explore the open world of the game, but someone at AGDQ has demonstrated how to turn that into your personal playground.</p><p>A speedrunner named Helix went through Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode to complete the All ? Panels category in under 30 minutes. The goal is to activate every single question mark block in the game. To pull that off, Helix needed to pull off a lot of tricks, as well as some lucky breaks, and judicious use of the game's rewind feature.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ATxMOTKWzg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9ATxMOTKWzg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Helix clearly has a mastery of Mario Kart World's open world, as some of the question marks aren't easily accessible without knowing where they are or how to reach them with your chosen character. For this speedrun, Helix went with Para-Biddybud because his light weight and ability to stay in the air longer than most of the other racers. Helix also explained that this is best attempted with a fresh save file, or else Free Roam mode will drop players near the last course they completed.</p><p>Earlier this week at AGDQ, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> content creator DThaiPome <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/someone-dressed-up-as-pac-man-to-play-pac-man-during-agdq-livestream/1100-6537187/" data-ref-id="1100-6537187">came dressed up as Pac-Man</a> to perform a speedrun of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pac-man-world-2/" data-ref-id="5000-3987">Pac-Man World 2</a> in about 30 minutes.

<p>Fully compatible with Switch and Switch 2</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Accessory manufacturers GameSir and Hyperkin have joined forces to produce a fully modular controller that's compatible with the Switch and Switch 2: the <strong>GameSir x Hyperkin X5 Alteron</strong>.</p>
<p>Ignoring the terrible name for a moment, this thing actually looks pretty neat. Utilising an extendable telescopic arm design, you can clip it onto your Switch, Switch 2, iPhone, iPad, or Android devices for instant handheld play. It also comes with Bluetooth technology to allow for PC gaming, if you wish.</p>
<p>The biggest draw, however, is the modular design. You can swap out the front modules to completely customise your controller's layout, with options ranging from a fight pad design to faithful (ish) recreations of the GameCube and N64 controllers.</p>
<p>It also comes with a host of modern features that you'd come to expect from controllers these days, including triggers that can swap between tactile, micro-switch functionality to full Hall Effect analogue functionality. Similarly, the capacitive sticks come with the ability to alter their height to ensure maximum comfort for each individual player.</p>
<p>It all sounds lovely on paper, but we do wonder if this 'Jack of all Trades' approach will work out for Gamesir and Hyperkin. CES 2026 attendees can get an in-person view of an early model of the X5 Alteron, but we'll have to wait and see if this thing can be a legitimate contender in a world jam-packed with third-party controllers.</p>

<p>There's no word on when the X5 Alteron will launch, but we'll keep you posted as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>StarRupture has officially launched into early access, with the Creepy Jar title putting players on a hostile planet tasked with survival, and controller support is a feature players have raised questions about.</p>



<p>Early access to StarRupture launched on January 7, giving players the first opportunity to dive into the game, but there’s still a lot to come in development before the full release.</p>



<p>If you want to know all the details on the status of controller support in StarRupture, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-starrupture-have-controller-support">Does StarRupture Have Controller Support?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Creepy Jar</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, StarRupture does not include controller support following the launch of early access on January 6, with only mouse and keyboard support.</strong></p>



<p>While it is possible to map out controller inputs using Steam, the process can be complicated if you don’t know what you’re doing, and there’s a chance that you will miss some crucial inputs, particularly for features that might not be immediately clear at launch.</p>



<p>Steam does provide the option to download controller input profiles created by other players, so it’s worth keeping an eye on the Reddit and Discord pages for any creations.</p>



<p>The door is not closed to controller support entirely, however, as StarRupture launched in an early access stage and development of the title continues.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-starrupture-add-controller-support">Will StarRupture Add Controller Support?</h2>



<p><strong>StarRupture will add official controller support in the future, but there is no timeframe of when it will be added.</strong></p>



<p>The early access roadmap overview shared by the developers specifies plans for controller support, along with plans for additional accessibility support, including improved keybinds, subtitle options, and adjustable text size.</p>



<p>Controller support’s inclusion in the early access roadmap indicates there are plans to add it before the full release, an approach that varies froma a previous release by Creepy Jar, Green Hell.</p>



<p>Initially launched in early access in August 2018, the 1.0 release of Green Hell followed in September 2019, with controller support then added in December of the same year.</p>



<p>No timeline has been stated yet for the duration of early access and the full launch, but, although planned, controller support may still be a way off.</p>
