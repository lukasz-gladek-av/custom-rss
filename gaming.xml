            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-battle-of-hoth-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-battle-of-hoth-board-game-review.1304820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s difficult to say what’s more exciting, a new game with a fresh setting and approach, or one built upon the gleaming DNA of a predecessor. Star Wars: Battle of Hoth certainly owes much of its appeal to Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, but it also bears an obligation to the classic World War II board game <a href="https://www.daysofwonder.com/game/memoir44/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memoir '44</a>. Publisher Days of Wonder has effectively taken that 20-year-old design and used it as a retrofitted vehicle to facilitate the most iconic Star Wars land battle on film. The results of this experiment are a lithe and approachable board game focused on dramatic action and brisk play.</p><div catalogid="bd7dc246-295d-44bb-b335-3884b5990eae" id="228251"><div id="228251" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Battle of Hoth Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitching this as Memoir '44 reskinned to Star Wars is accurate. Original designer Richard Borg returns, enlisting the help of Adrien Martinot to adapt the hex-and-miniatures <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> to this beloved sci-fi series. This uses the same back-and-forth system where players take turns playing cards and then activating units. The framework is simple to grasp and it’s effective in establishing constraints, limiting which troops you can maneuver and attack with each turn. This models the chaos and uncertainty of control and command during conflict, but it also forces tough tactical decisions. All in all, it’s a smart system that elicits drama with minimal overhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has their own dedicated faction deck. On your turn, you play a single card from your hand which denotes one section of the board. The map is divided into thirds, including the left flank, center, and right flank. In addition to indicating one of these areas, it also lists a certain number of units in that area you can activate. Activated units move and then activate by chucking small pools of dice. It’s exceedingly straightforward and intuitive. What’s delightful is in how it restricts you at inopportune times, such as not allowing you to act on the right flank when your infantry squads are getting pounded and need support. Furthermore, you don’t know what cards your opponent is holding, mimicking a fog of war element, so it’s difficult to gauge where the counterattack and aggression will come from next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a scenario-driven game with a hefty 17 total missions. Victory is decided by whoever hits a certain victory point threshold first, with the bulk often coming from destroying opposing units. One quirk of this system is that units do not lose combat effectiveness as they degrade, and a victory point is not scored until they're entirely vanquished. This abstraction may annoy those seeking realism, but it’s an effective device for stoking drama. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the most interesting moments in the game are when you’re forced to decide whether it’s worth it to play a less efficient card but one which allows you to activate that Snowspeeder squad as it’s hanging on by a thread. If you wait another round or for a more potent option, it may be too late and your unit could be gone. This works both ways, as you will often want to target portions of the battlefield that are weak, especially if you believe your foe will retreat one of their softened units and seek cover. Timing is important. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All in all, it’s a smart system that elicits drama with minimal overhead.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The dice system is smooth. You chuck a certain amount based on your unit and the range to the target. Generally, attackers hit harder the closer they are to the enemy. When rolling, you’re looking for either the symbol of the unit type you are attacking – such as infantry and vehicle – or a universal hit which affects all units. Damage is tracked by removing miniatures, allowing for quick upkeep and only a modicum of maintenance that is mostly frontloaded during setup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asymmetry between the factions only just crosses the threshold of meaning. Empire infantry has an extra health, showing their increased numbers in the assault on Hoth. Snowspeeders move fast but they only hit hard if they're close. Probe droids are difficult to hit but fragile. AT-ATs are menacing, laying down a substantial three die attack up to three hexes away, and also requiring a special confirmation roll when receiving damage to destroy them. This highlights one of the games' both positive and weak traits in that it’s extraordinarily swingy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there is a certain level of decision making, randomness has a large effect on the game’s outcome. The cards you draw and rolls you make are very important. There are precious few ways to mitigate the die rolls, such as seeking cover for defensive bonuses, so much of the experience is determined by the fickleness of luck. This aspect is even more prominent than in Memoir '44 and its other spinoffs, as the battlefield here is shrunken. While this is a positive in that you are in the action immediately, it’s also a concern in that it limits your ability to maneuver and outposition your foe. Instead, it seems like you're side-to-side, ready to unload your cannons immediately. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s obvious this experience was carefully crafted with intention. The smaller board and limited unit variation allows for a very quick experience with a suggested age range of 8+. Battle of Hoth absolutely is a hit with the younger crowd, and it will succeed at introducing those younglings into the genre of wargaming. This doesn’t mean it’s a failure for those wanting something more robust. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As has become trendy lately, this game includes what feels like a few small expansions. Each side has three leaders that may optionally be included in any scenario. You choose one of your three leader options, such as Han Solo or Vader, and then shuffle their trio of special cards into your activation deck. These add some neat effects and desired variance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the scenarios are somewhat diverse, they often feel as though they’re just modified setups of a standard pitched battle. Occasionally you have to control certain positions or focus on different areas of the board, leading to few surprises. However, there is an expanded option which adds a substantial amount of richness to the experience. Included in this base game are two full-blown campaigns which feature branching scenarios based on which side wins, as well as incremental upgrades that influence future sessions. There is also an abbreviated narrative which follows along with the prescribed Hoth storyline. As a method of play, this is actually a pretty neat framework that adds some oomph while not detracting from any of the core systems. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As has become trendy lately, this game includes what feels like a few small expansions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This penchant for including expanded content is an approach that can be directly correlated to similar behavior found in crowdfunded titles. Tossing in expansion content immediately to add perceived value is a common philosophy now, and we are seeing it occur in direct-to-retail games with increasing frequency. This works particularly well here, as it enhances the game’s replayability and fills out the experience for long-term engagement.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s important to note that this is primarily a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player experience</a> with one person fielding the Rebels and another the Imperials. As it says on the box, it can go up to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a>, but this mode of play is unsatisfying and best ignored. It accomplishes this by splitting each side and dividing it between two players. There’s simply not enough there for a meaningful tactical game to emerge, and it ends up feeling more staid and sluggish than the standard duel format. I could see this serving the purpose of teaching a small group of inexperienced gamers, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">young children</a>, but that use-case is limited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While designer Richard Borg has used the core system of Memoir '44 across numerous titles from various publishers, there’s an interesting aspect to Days of Wonder taking this classic game and reshaping it with the Star Wars property. It’s a signal of this game transitioning to a younger pop culture focused audience. The infatuation with World War II is primarily found in older generations, with Star Wars existing as a more universal influence. The popularity of this setting is the biggest weight behind the design, and it’s a cultural nod towards something more omnipresent and attractive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Battle of Hoth is ultimately, exactly what I expected. It’s a solid design built upon a sturdy pre-existing foundation. Care and attention to detail is evident, as the setting comes alive despite the game’s simplicity and high level of abstraction. This will certainly garner a large number of fans, and they should be excited to see that this is listed as the first in the Galactic Battles series. This indicates there will be more titles coming. There are plenty of options such as the battle of Endor, the skirmish on Naboo, and even perhaps heading to space with the large-scale assault on the Death Star II. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aRMXk8?object_uuid=0288fe86-b92d-4be9-bc8e-085c1b0d32ae&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FGDFQW6G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWElL7?object_uuid=0288fe86-b92d-4be9-bc8e-085c1b0d32ae&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Asmodee</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 22, 2025 7:58 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">I’m not sure Battle of Hoth will cause anyone’s head to explode like the Echo base shield generator, but it is a very successful design that is deserving of praise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming, at its core, is just a series of puzzles: some <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-save-room-attache-case-puzzle-inventory-1848875111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meditative</a>, some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/533198/split-fiction-review-pc-ps5-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maddening</a>. <a href="https://neal.fun/not-a-robot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I'm Not A Robot</em> </a>splits the difference, turning the mundane act of proving your humanity into a spiraling test of pattern recognition that quickly escalates from a simple checkbox task into esoteric brain teasers that feel less like website security and more like psychological warfare.&nbsp;</p><p>Created by <a href="https://neal.fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neal Agarwal</a>, <em>I'm Not A Robot</em> is a free-to-play riff on the CAPTCHA format, where players are tasked with completing randomized puzzles that include typing distorted text, clicking on traffic signs, spotting Waldo in a mural, or playing Simon Says on a soundboard. Streamers, ever the masochists, have turned it into a speedrunning meta to flex their cognitive prowess in front of their thousands of viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>But I am no streamer. I’m a casual gamer with bills to pay and sleep to chase. So I played <em>I'm Not A Robot</em> the way any normal person should: not testing speed, but my mental fortitude. I kept playing, advancing past each level until I either “won” or gave up. Spoiler alert: the latter came first. Yet, somewhere during the funky image text and pattern test to vibe check my humanity, I learned a few things about myself, namely, that I am a fallible human being and not nearly as good at logic puzzles as I’d hoped.&nbsp;</p><p>Glass half full, here’s a quick rundown of some positive things I learned about myself before we get to my unmaking.&nbsp;</p><p>Numerous puzzles where I was tasked with driving a car into a parking space had me discover that the tips I remembered from a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@autoclara/video/7217442900559269163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video</a> about parking translated perfectly to pulling off a parallel parking job, even through the directional keys on my keyboard. Having a touchable laptop screen also came in handy with drawing a perfect circle with my fingers on the screen. My eyes aren’t a slouch either, leading me to breeze past a puzzle where I was asked to single out which green square wasn’t like the others. Another challenge that surprised me was a test to accumulate and dump enough stocks, which I guess I can attribute to half paying attention to the brain-numbing parts of HBO’s <em>Industry</em>. Other challenges that stumped me in the early going simply boiled down to me reading instructions too quickly and missing the “not” part of its tasks or the “only” part of a specific row—a human error, making me not a robot.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But the cracks in my gamer facade began to show. The first logic test that stumped me was a sliding tile puzzle asking me to assemble a stop sign; these always stumped me for a bit before fiddling with them and coming up with my own logic. What I wasn’t expecting was a CAPTCHA knowledge check for <em>Minecraft</em>, asking me to make a diamond pickaxe. Reader, I’ve only played the game once in high school, so I was out of my depth. This took a while, something I’m not proud to admit as a games journalist. In so doing, I discovered that left and right clicks do different things in <em>Minecraft</em> with relation to sorting and splitting up inventory, which helped me stumble upon what I’m sure every five-year-old with an iPad already knew about how many sticks and diamonds a diamond pickaxe makes. Et viola, I forged myself a diamond pickaxe. <em>I'm Not A Robot </em>proved to be a slow boiling frog challenge at this point, but one where the count supporting that I am not a robot was still going strong.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm in danger. <span></span><span>Neal.Fun</span></figcaption></figure><p>But by level 34, I hit a wall—a math puzzle. In it, <em>I'm Not A Robot </em>tasked me with selecting all nine squares of algebra-ass equations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9NkW8MoJ6g&amp;pp=ygUeaSdtIGJhY2sgaW4gdGhlIGJ1aWxkaW5nIGFnYWlu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I haven’t seen since high school</a> and ordering them from least to greatest. Both the angel and devil on my shoulder noped out on this one. So, out of desperation, I pulled out a tactic any cornered gamer would desperately deploy in this situation: I started guessing. Clicking at random like a scrub who penciled in C on an SAT because “I haven’t selected that in a while,” I prayed that brute forcing my way through the math puzzle would carry me through. Obviously, the infinity symbol would be the last choice (I’m not that dense). Still failed. And with that, my journey to prove I wasn’t a robot came to an end.&nbsp;</p><h2>However</h2><p>I’d reckon my inability to solve such a fucked up math question while blinking away sleep proved exactly what this whole sisyphean charade sought to answer: I am still human. I am not a robot. So jokes on you, Agarwal. You didn’t best me, my friend. I won by the human act of quitting while I was ahead and throwing the double bird to a gaggle of math equations.&nbsp;</p><p><em>I'm Not A Robot</em> didn’t just test my logic skills, it also challenged my resolve. Along the way, the game presented some clever and inventive puzzles to break up its stumpers. My favorite were out-of-the-box CAPTCHA puzzles (one literally) where I herded ducks back into their square grid or played whack-a-mole. While I didn’t beat it, I was reminded that being human can mean failing creatively, overlooking a crucial detail in instructions, and telling math problems to fuck off forever. The last of which might be the most CAPTCHA-proof trait of all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Correction 9/22/25, 4:30pm:&nbsp;</strong>A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the title of the game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-charlie-kirk-recreations"><h3>Why Major Events Like Charlie Kirk’s Death End Up On Roblox</h3></a><p>'It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-killer-steam-discord"><h3>What A Shock, The Government Is Scapegoating Video Games Again</h3></a><p>"That nihilism isn’t really reflected or addressed in either political party"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jimmy-kimmel-live-is-back-following-disney-boycott.1304796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tomorrow, Jimmy Kimmel will return to host his late-night show after it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">“indefinitely” put on hold on September 17</a> by Disney following remarks he made about Charlie Kirk in the wake of the conservative commentator’s assassination earlier this month. The decision prompted a large amount of backlash from fans, actors, and comedians, and led to calls for a Disney boycott.</p> <p>On September 22, Disney and ABC confirmed <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-live-return-abc-1236374942/">via a statement shared with the press</a> that <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> will return to the air following a near-weeklong hiatus that came after the comedian spoke about Kirk’s assassination and his thoughts on how some Republican politicians, including President Trump, and other conservative commentators acted in the days that followed the shooting.</p> <p>“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” said Disney and ABC in a statement. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”</p>

 <p>Since last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-mark-hamill-pedro-pascal-marvel-star-wars-2000627564">Marvel and<em> Star Wars</em> actors like Pedro Pascal and Mark Hamill have spoken out publicly</a> against Disney and ABC’s decision to suspend production on Kimmel’s popular late-night talk show after he joked that many members of the “MAGA gang” hit a new “low” after many of them tried to “score political points” from Kirk’s assassination. He also directly called out Trump’s awkward and cold reaction to Kirk’s death when responding to reporters’ questions about how he was holding up. At no point, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-jimmy-kimmel-said-late-night-show-charlie-kirk-2025-9">as documented extensively</a>, did Kimmel joke about Kirk’s death. Yet that didn’t matter. FCC Chairman and Trump loyalist Brendan Carr threatened to investigate ABC and pull its broadcast licenses over Kimmel’s comments. So Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden and CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/jimmy-kimmel-decision-disney-dana-walden-bob-iger-1236547651/">capitulated instantly and shut the show down</a>.</p>

 <p>“Giving a bully your lunch money is only a temporary down payment for future bullying,” said Hamill.&nbsp; “We ALL need to step up for the First Amendment. By-the-way, for the record, this ex-Disney employee finds Jimmy Kimmel very talented and funny.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363">Even former Disney CEO Michael Eisner</a> condemned Iger and Disney’s handling of the Kimmel situation, posting on Twitter: “The ‘suspending indefinitely’ of Jimmy Kimmel immediately after the Chairman of the FCC’s aggressive yet hollow threatening of the Disney Company is yet another example of out-of-control intimidation.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, thousands of people shared screenshots of them canceling their Disney+ subscriptions and threatening to boycott future Marvel and <em>Star Wars</em> movies and shows. In response, Disney seemingly tried to use a trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542"><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>&nbsp;to distract people</a> and change the online conversation. But that didn’t seem to work. Now, after all that, Disney has reversed course and is, for the time being, not letting Carr and Trump push them around. We’ll see how long that lasts and if Kimmel is forced to apologize on air or not when his show return’s Tuesday night on ABC.</p>

			<p>EA Sports FC 26 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">due out at the end of the week</a> at the time of this writing, and its incoming arrival had former professional footballer Wayne Rooney talking on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0lwvsnc">his 'The Wayne Rooney Show' podcast</a> about the series and his experiences with EA's football series and videogames in general, which came with an interesting revelation. Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-big-part-of-our-success-was-playing-the-psp-wayne-rooney-credits-sonys-handheld-for-man-uniteds-performances/">VGC</a>, Rooney credits part of the success he and his Manchester United club enjoyed during his time with the squad to game sessions he and teammates would have playing SOCOM on their PSP consoles.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Portable (PSP) featured four SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs titles: SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo, SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo 2, SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Tactical Strike, and SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo 3. All four were released over the course of Rooney's tenure with Manchester United, which lasted between 2004 and 2017, during which he and Man United won five Premier League titles, the Champions League, the Europa League, the FA Cup, four Community Shields, and three League Cups.</p>



<p>After a fun conversation about what Rooney's rating in EA Sports FC 26 is now that he's moved on to being part of the Legends roster of players, Kelly Somers asks Rooney about his own gaming history, to which he begins by saying, "<em>I used to play a lot of FIFA and Call of Duty. Of late, I've not played much obviously,</em>" say for the odd time he says he's played with YouTubers and influencers, and of course his own kids.</p>



<p>When Somers asks what else, beyond FIFA, he used to play, Rooney says, "<em>Do you know what we used to play, not FIFA. True story, this, at Man United, I really believe</em> <em>a big part of our success was playing the PSP. Honestly, it got us communicating more; we used to play on the plane, on the team bus. We'd play 5v5 on a game on called SOCOM on the PSP, army game. You have to talk, you have to tactically be right, go revive people when they got killed. It was a massive part of our success I believe. You can ask any of the players who played at the same time, it was brilliant.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Another example of how games can bring people together and have real-world impact on how you interact with others in your life. It's also another example of the impact of SOCOM, a series that many PlayStation fans, and likely some Manchester United fans, would love to see make a comeback.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I see so much slop on my </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-us-ban-supreme-court-date-bytedance-china-1851715772"><span>TikTok</span></a><span> feed these days that most of it doesn’t faze me. However, for the past week or so, I’ve seen ads promoting what are very clearly AI-generated Christmas ornaments featuring famous characters in situations that their respective IP holders would probably never approve of. I can’t unsee these horrors, so now, I’m making it your problem. You ever seen Belle from </span><i><span>Beauty and the Beast</span></i><span> making an ahegao face as she gets spanked over Beast’s knee? Do you know what the Grinch looks like on his knees, worshipping a mystery Grinch lady’s uncomfortably caked-up rear-end? Well, it’s too late to turn back now. Look at it:</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000627642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627642"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627642">©Homacus</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These monstrosities come courtesy of </span><a href="https://homacus.com/collections/couple-ornaments"><span>Homacus</span></a><span>, a personalized gift shop that lets you print the names of yourself and your significant other on a “naughty” Christmas ornament featuring beloved characters like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809"><span>Mickey and Minnie Mouse</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/shrek-5-first-teaser-cast-zendaya-myers-diaz-trailer-1851766800"><span>Shrek and Fiona</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>Batman and Catwoman</span></a><span>, and many more that I doubt Disney, DC, and the numerous other rights holders signed off on. But hey, I’m open to being wrong, so I did reach out to Homacus for comment on the matter and will update the story if we hear back. Whatever the case, the company is very boldly paying for ads to make innocent bystanders like me very, very aware these ornaments exist. Think of all the poor bastards trying to scroll TikTok in peace who saw Jack Skellington tossing Sally’s salad. We already get enough psychic damage on the internet, and now we’re dealing with this?</span></p>   <p><span>The whole thing reeks of Facebook ad core shit that sites sell to boomers who think referencing anything sexual outside the bedroom is scandalous. It’s the type of pent-up sexual frustration that reminds you there are couples out there who rarely see each other naked, so having things like this hanging off their Christmas tree is as raunchy as it gets. I don’t care what debauchery is happening behind closed doors; just don’t make me look at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-lava-chicken-jockey-easter-egg-game-1851786345"><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>creepers</span></a><span> smacking each other’s dumpies.&nbsp;</span></p>

He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Autumn Sale starts next Monday, but Valve dropped an early treat in the form of a rare <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck" rel="sponsored">Steam Deck LCD discount</a>. The 256GB model that normally sells for $399.99 is $319.20 through October 6th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. I, for one, thank Valve for dropping this deal now instead of when the servers inevitably hiccup at the start of the game sale.</p><p>For anyone out there deciding between the Steam Deck LCD, the pricier OLED, and perhaps other handhelds, it’s tough to beat the value of this discounted model. The Deck will be four years old in February, but it’s still a contender when it comes to good, reliable performance in PC games, especially considering how power-efficient it is. Another perk: it runs SteamOS, not Windows 11.</p><p>Also, game compatibility across Steam is generally great (more and more developers are building games with the Steam Deck’s specs in mind ahead of launch), and Valve has patched the Steam Deck frequently throughout the years with new features. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">It didn’t start out great</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">it eventually got there</a>.</p><p>Sure, the $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> boasts some nice perks that some will be willing to pay extra for, like a bigger battery, a 90Hz refresh rate OLED, faster Wi-Fi 6E. But at just over $200 less, you’re getting a pretty similar gaming experience in the Steam Deck LCD.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->319</span></p><div><p>The Steam Deck is a portable handheld console you can use to play PC games.</p></div></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782737/the-steam-deck-lcd-is-20-percent-off-through-october-6th#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/782737/the-steam-deck-lcd-is-20-percent-off-through-october-6th]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-deck-just-went-on-sale-and-is-killing-the-competition-on-price.1304721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite a trade war and rising inflation, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">three-year-old Steam Deck</a> hasn’t gone up in price yet. In fact, it just got a pretty major discount. The $400 LCD model will be 20 percent off for the 2025 fall Steam sale. That makes it significantly cheaper than just about every other current-gen gaming device on the market right now, including the 8-year-old Nintendo Switch. It also puts some needed pressure on new PC gaming handhelds launching this holiday.</p> <p>The Steam Deck 256GB LCD model will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">$320 starting September 22</a>. That’s essentially what the refurbished model, currently out of stock, usually costs. The 512GB OLED model is still $550 and the 1TB OLED is still $650 (they come with slightly bigger screens, a higher refresh rate, and better battery life). This week-long discount leads into the Steam Autumn Sale which will kick off next week on September 29 and run until October 6.</p> <p>It’s not a bad deal at all for one of the most versatile gaming handhelds around. It might just be Valve clearing out old inventory as it phases out the older LCD models entirely, but it comes as every other platform squeezes players more and more at the checkout line. The Xbox Series X/S just got its second price hike this year, the PS5 all-digital is now $100 more than it was at launch, and even the original Switch recently went from $300 to $330. At this rate, it’s hard not to feel like the $450 Switch 2 might not be far behind.</p> <p>Then there’s the Steam Deck’s competition in the PC gaming handheld race. We still don’t know how much the new <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">Xbox Ally Rog</a> will be, even though it’s less than a month away from launch. And the Legion Go 2, which costs <a href="https://kotaku.com/legion-go-2-price-specs-madden-curse-eagles-2000623447">up to $1350 at the high end</a> ($1,479 for the 2TB model), is both incredibly expensive and incredibly hard-to-get. Lenovo took so many pre-orders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nl3vxj/now_there_cancelling_preorders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it’s already canceling some</a>. That all might be great for “<a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2045631.html">enthusiast gamers</a>” but it’s not likely to actually help grow the overall market for PC gaming or handhelds. There’s only an estimated <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d49e77d2-93bb-48ce-b01b-168e092a9257?j=eyJ1IjoiN293Z2UifQ.yUVZMKoNk2BqBF9tq3iEKEd7X3capQ_E9zpEziCzGhc">5 to 7 million Steam Decks</a> out there in the world right now, and it’s by far the best-selling portable not made by Nintendo.</p>

As detailed in a Fatshark <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/bound-by-duty-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a>, the bulk of the new content is for Mortis Trials, Darktide's wave-based roguelike mode. There will be a new arena, the Theatre of Rectitude, where players can test their mettle, as well as new Indulgence archetypes that will offer new combat styles for players to experiment with. Additional Memory Echoes added to the mode will expand on NPC backstories to reveal more about the game's cast of characters and the history of the ship that serves as the game's hub, the Mourningstar.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpOvbThhZe0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GpOvbThhZe0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the Mortis Trial additions make up a large chunk of the update, there's plenty new for players who prefer the game's mission-based gameplay. A new weapon for the Veteran, the Power Falchion, will work similarly to the Zealot's Relic Blade, allowing players to empower the weapon until it overheats. There will also be new Mark variants of the Bolt Pistol and Boltgun, both of which emphasize explosive damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Those new weapons will be put to the test against a new enemy type, the Scab Plasma Gunner. Wielding a powerful Plasma weapon that deals high damage, players will want to focus on these enemies whenever possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Fatshark completely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-darktide-getting-revamped-class-system-with-skill-trees-and-new-abilities/1100-6517003/" data-ref-id="1100-6517003">revamped Darktide's classes in 2023</a>, adding greatly expanded talent trees and new abilities for each of the game's four (now five with the addition of the DLC Arbites) classes. In Bound by Duty, Fatshark takes another swing at balancing the talent trees. The Veteran, Zealot, and Psyker trees have been reworked to be more open and allow for "more flexibility and player agency," according to Fatshark, while the Ogryn and Arbites talents have also seen a "light touch-up."</p><p dir="ltr">Rounding out the update is the addition of a dodge counter that informs players of how many dodge charges they have remaining, as well as a new event called Smuggled Munitions that will see players taking on squads of the game's new Plasma Gun enemies while in low visibility conditions. For those looking to snag some free cosmetics, Twitch Drops for Darktide will be live from September 23 through October 13.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Warhammer 40K game news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-is-getting-a-new-long-awaited-class-next-year/1100-6534355/" data-ref-id="1100-6534355">Space Marine 2 will receive a long-awaited class next year</a> in a free update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new battleforce box has been announced for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>. Games Workshop is putting the spotlight on the enforcers of the Imperium of Man, the Space Marines, in their new <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus Battleforce</em> box, bringing new takes on a certain brutal unit.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/wr9feecy/assault-terminators-are-an-unstoppable-force-and-an-immovable-object-in-one-indomitable-package/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop provided a sneak peek at what the <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus</em> Battleforce box contains. The post opens by discussing the direct power of the Assault Terminators units of the Space Marines. Bolters and Melta guns are great, but sometimes just crushing the enemies of the God Emperor with thunder hammers and shields works just as well.</p>

Units either sport devastating thunder hammers and a shield, providing them with an additional Wound. Alternatively, other units sport a pair of lightning claws, helping them cut through waves or Orks, Tyranids, or Chaos Daemons.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus</em> Battleforce box contains custom options for your miniatures. Each squad of five minatures includes six unhelmeted heads, five helmets, five tilting plates, and 15 different accessories. In addition, the box will contain 500 decals representing the Ultramarines, Imperial Fists, Salamanders, White Scars, and Raven Guard chapters, respectively.</p>

<p>The battlebox will contain the following units:</p>

<ul><li>10 Assault Terminators</li>
	<li>5 Regular Terminators</li>
	<li>1 Ancient in Terminator Armor</li>
	<li>1 Chaplain in Terminator Armor</li>
	<li>1 Captain in Terminator Armor</li>
</ul><p>Overall, this Battleforce box appears to be a solid start for anyone's First Company or for veteran Space Marine players who want to get up close and personal against xenos and heretics alike. Given the Drukhari's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-drukhari-codex-brings-long-awaited-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">long-awaited codex</a> is on the horizon, this extra firepower may be warranted.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus Battleforce</em> box will be available for pre-orders soon. Individual new kit releases will arrive shortly afterwards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sometimes, in this line of work, a game’s name will pass over your feeds multiple times before you ever actually see a frame of footage from it. That is what happened to me with </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>, Papergames’ 2024 dating sim, which apparently has over </span><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/virtual-romance-real-money-why-some-sporeans-spend-up-to-4-figures-to-find-love-in-deepspace"><span>50 million players worldwide</span></a><span>. The otome game has always been a massive success, but with each update, another wave of buckwild clips starts spreading around the internet. Finally, this morning, I had my first run-in with </span><a href="https://x.com/micheogyal21/status/1969965447274717448"><span>a </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>scene</span></a><span> so confounding and horny that I had to look into it further.</span></p> <p><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span> has a surprisingly complex science fiction story in which the main character, a woman named and customized by the player, is a “deepspace hunter” who fights creatures called Wanderers, but she also, unbeknownst to her, has been reincarnated multiple times. In all these previous lives, she has met the game’s five love interests, and unlocking memories from those past iterations is one of the biggest draws of the game because they not only delve into the game’s broader mysteries, but they’re also, well, interactive.</span></p>  <p><span>Just taking a cursory look at some of the romance scenes, it’s easy to see why </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>has taken off the way it has. It’s angsty, sexy (if a bit awkward), and it has the same tendency toward melodrama that you might find in a soap opera or a romance novel. People love to date digital men who fulfill an otherworldly fantasy that real men can’t. It’s why </span><i><span>Twilight </span></i><span>still has the cultural cache it does, despite having been out of the limelight for over a decade. That being said, even as a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-shadowheart-gale-1850771533"><span>well-documented lover of digital men</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-sex-romance-scene-neve-taash-1851696476"><span>romance</span></a><span>, I don’t think I have the patience for some of </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>’s gacha nonsense, which seems even more convoluted than that in your average gacha game. But even if I’m not playing it, I can still go snooping around YouTube and TikTok to see what all 50 million people who are playing this game are fawning over. Specifically, I needed to find out what the hell was up with this sex scene in which one of the lover boys, Zayne, says, “Feel this and remember what I’m giving you” as he’s on top of the player character.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FEEL THIS POWER OF ANNIHILATION HE SAID, ANNIHILATE MA KITTY [zayne new myth god of annihilation] <a href="https://t.co/ATSKlGpwaY">pic.twitter.com/ATSKlGpwaY</a></p> <p>— 𝒔𝒖𝒛𝒖 (@pinkcrispss) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinkcrispss/status/1969964067986268598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The scene is from a new trailer for the “Edge of Continuum” event that will begin on September 25. Edge of Continuum features new scenes with a “God of Annihilation” version of Zayne, depicting one of the protagonist’s many lives alongside him. And damn, the trailer is enough to get someone hot and bothered.</span></p>  <p><span>I’m surprised at how much story the trailer gives away, but nobody in the comments seems to be that mad about it, considering what they also get to see, which is basically the beginnings of a fantasy-themed softcore porn starring Zayne. Happy for y’all, and I have nothing but respect for those of you who can fight your way through the gacha nonsense to reach these scenes. Hopefully, I’ve done enough research for writing this that the algorithm starts showing me more of this shit so I can enjoy the fruits of your labor.</span></p>

Ogg has, he says, never been a fan of video games. Still, while speaking to YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TY9FVFeOgKk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HarrisonShippp</a>, it is surprising to see the actor speak quite so bluntly about the franchise that has earned him worldwide adoration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel nothing inside. I'm not a gamer," Ogg said, standing in front of GTA 5 artwork at a recent convention where he appeared alongside fellow GTA 5 co-stars Ned Luke (Michael) and Shawn "Solo" Fonteno (Franklin) to meet fans. "I've never played a video game, so I feel absolutely nothing," he continued.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think someone said yesterday at one point, 'You should play GTA 5,'" Ogg continued. "I said, 'Why?' They said, 'Because it's so great.' And I said, 'Well one day you should read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment' and he went completely blank."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do you know Dostoevsky? [Who] Fyodor Dostoevsky is?" Ogg continued, turning from interviewee to interviewer, as he attempted to discover HarrisonShippp's knowledge of world literature. (Alas, HarrisonShippp did not know who Dostoevsky was.) "So there you go," Ogg continued, pressing the alleged equivalence. "'Why don't you read that? Are you excited about that book coming out?' See? It's the same thing. Books are my thing."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not a gamer himself, Ogg has previously discussed his work on GTA in detail — including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-had-trevor-dlc-before-rockstar-scrapped-it-voice-actor-steven-ogg-says">Rockstar's canceled Trevor-centric story DLC</a> that was ditched in favor of more GTA Online content.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-looter-shooter-games-ranked.1304655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being one of the more recognisable sub-genres in gaming, you may be surprised by just how precious few looter shooters there actually are. Putting together a list of the best of them revealed how rare a truly brilliant one is, presumably a result of how incredibly hard they are to make,  and their unfortunate tendency to go the way of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anthem">Anthem</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> – cut short after failing to grab an audience. But what they lack in quantity, they more than make up for in just how many hours you can lose to them, and over the past nearly two decades I’ve spent more time with this genre than I’d care to admit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what qualifies as a looter shooter for the purposes of this list? Well, as the name implies they’ve got to have shooting (either first or third-person) as the primary way you interact with the world, and all those shell casings and/or laser bolts need to reward loot (almost always including randomized drops) that keeps you playing and lures you into a hard-to-resist endgame. Ongoing games like Destiny and more traditional, non-live-service games like Outriders are both eligible, so long as there’s some kind of ongoing endgame or hook to keep you playing. In essence, we’re looking for games that, one way or another, adhere to the original premise of the looter shooter genre: what if we took an ARPG like Diablo and turned it into a shooter?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If, like me, you can’t seem to get enough of shooting monsters in the face to claim glorious gear, here are our top 14 looter shooter recommendations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">14. Crab Champions</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/crab-champions-1756909970204.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the weirder looter shooters you can play right now is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crab-champions">Crab Champions</a>, a roguelike where you play as a gun-toting crab facing off against fellow crustaceans and mean-looking floating heads, claiming badass loot in the process. The fast-paced, over-the-top combat might not be as technically advanced as its peers, but what it lacks in bells and whistles it more than makes up for in pure dopey charm. Plus, it's missing the usual add-ons and microtransactions you often find in other looter shooters, and thus comes as a complete package with no hidden costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This one is still in active development and currently available through Steam’s early access program, but at just $10 it’s absolutely worth checking out, especially since it’s such an obvious breath of fresh air from the usual looter shooter aesthetic. I’m a sucker for goofy takes on genres I love and you’d be hard-pressed to find a sillier option out there than this one. It’s also developed by a single person, which is pretty impressive given how much fun I’ve managed to squeeze out of this one in the past year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Shadow Warrior 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/shadow-warrior-2-1756910027001.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the more underrated shooters I’ve played is the Shadow Warrior series, specifically the reboot that kicked off in 2013, which continues to experiment and reinvent itself (for better or worse) with each iteration. While the first and third games are linear, story-focused adventures, the second game in the trilogy took a detour into the world of looter shooters, with semi-open-world, procedurally generated areas and an emphasis on randomized loot that puts it squarely in the same category as Borderlands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a> is very tongue-in-cheek, despite the fact that you spend most of your time tearing demons into pink chunks like something out of Doom, and my friends and I spent over a hundred hours giggling as we grinded for loot and enjoyed the series’ unique brand of lowbrow humor. Gunplay is nothing to write home about and the buildcrafting is definitely on the more simplistic side that makes it feel like less of an RPG than many of its peers, but it’s still quite a good time, and one of my favorite turn-you-brain-off games when I just want to whale on some ugly looking monsters.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Borderlands 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-3-1756910090091.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> did a whole lot to improve the Borderlands series’ gunplay and graphics when it launched in 2019, it also exists in a very weird spot in the franchise’s history, where it felt like developer Gearbox had allowed itself to be left in the dust in a genre it itself pioneered. The gunplay was solid, but easily outclassed by games like Destiny, and the loot was awesome, but buildcrafting among its peers had already evolved beyond Borderlands 3’s somewhat shallow options. Throw in some pretty questionable decisions where comedy writing and antagonists are concerned, and you’ve got what I consider to be the weakest entry in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this is still a Borderlands game and that means even on a bad day it’s damn fun to play. With a really neat interplanetary campaign and an irresponsible number of weapons to hunt, I spent quite a few evenings playing this one. And thanks to that improved gunplay, if you’re looking for the Borderlands game that feels better than most of the others (excepting Borderlands 4), then this is your port of call.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Outriders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/outriders-1756910151315.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">People Can Fly’s foray into the looter shooter space may not have been the most original iteration, notably taking quite a few queues from the likes of The Division, but it remains one of the more memorable looter shooters on this list. As supernaturally powered warriors, you’ll run around turning raiders into gobs of meat while claiming loads of loot. One thing that sets <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a> apart from the rest of the pack is just how great its buildcrafting is, especially with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outriders-worldslayer-review">Worldslayer expansion</a> upping its game pretty significantly. I spent a ton of time optimizing my various characters’ builds for the procedurally generated raid activity, and geeking out over various stat numbers. Looter shooters aren’t always the best at embracing the RPG side of their mechanics, but Outriders really excels in this area – it rules.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also a big fan of the fact that the developers decided not to make Outriders a live-service game, instead supporting it with a single (and pretty awesome) expansion. Don’t get me wrong: I’m quite a big fan of games-as-a-service projects, but not every looter shooter needs to go down that path, and Outriders never made me feel the pressure to play more than I ever wanted to play – I got in, had a great time, and then moved on to the next game. I really appreciated that. For that reason, this is an excellent option to play with your friend group if you’re looking for more good times in the genre, but you don’t want to get wrapped up in hundreds of hours of content that threatens to devour your life.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-1756910207457.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, Borderlands’ detour to the moon after the phenomenal Borderlands 2 was mostly an excuse to secure more screentime for everyone’s favorite baddie, Handsome Jack, and keep the franchise warm while we waited for a proper sequel, but it’s also a very solid shooter with a surprising amount of meat on its bones where story is concerned. The unique setting of Pandora’s moon and the low-gravity, oxygen-juggling implications of that choice are certainly controversial, but I for one never stopped loving those glorious buttslams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Really, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel">The Pre-Sequel</a>’s biggest sin is that it does almost nothing to evolve the series, instead feeling more like an elaborate expansion of Borderlands 2 with low-gravity environments. But more Borderlands 2 really isn’t such a bad thing, and this one still holds up to this day.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-1756910264733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A spinoff of the Borderlands series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a> is the only (sorta, kinda) fantasy game on a list that’s dominated by sci-fi games. Taking place within a D&amp;D-like tabletop RPG called Bunkers &amp; Badasses (which has since become <a href="https://tinytinagames.com/products/bunkers-badasses-science-fantasy-role-playing-game-system-sourcebook" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an actual tabletop RPG</a>,) this deeply inappropriate shooter is basically Borderlands dressed in wizard robes, featuring many of the iconic characters and mechanics for which Gearbox’s looter shooter series is known. It takes a few risks here and there with things like the overworld map that helps your journey feel a bit more like a proper tabletop adventure, but otherwise plays it extremely close to the blueprint established by the mainline series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review-pc-xbox-playstation">I really enjoyed my time with Tiny Tina’s Wonderland</a>, but it ultimately sits quite a bit below the best entries of the original series just based on how much it borrows, as well as the fact that it fails to live up to the comedy chops of the likes of Borderlands 2 (more on that later). Still, if you’re looking to sink a ton of time into a wonderfully silly shooter that sets itself apart from the rest of the pack with a unique fantasy skin, this one’s very easy to enthusiastically recommend.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Destiny</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/destiny-1756910382690.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Say what you want about the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/fireteamchat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">God knows I have</a>), but it changed the looter shooter genre in too many ways to count. That might irk those who aren’t a fan of live-service games, but the idea that looter shooters were going to be big-budget, ongoing adventures that spanned years was a massive step forward for the genre. With beautiful worlds to explore, one of the best game soundtracks of all time, and first-person action that still eclipses most of its peers this one deserves its kudos, even if it’s no longer receiving new content. It also introduced World of Warcraft-like raids that have since become the gold standard for its peers, inspiring those that followed, like The Division or Outriders, to do the same. On top of all that, it’s got some fantastic PvP modes that I’ve lost thousands of hours to over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah, you’ve got to deal with one of the most convoluted, almost nonsensical stories in the world, plus some really questionable grinds that nearly drove me to madness of more than one occasion, but Bungie makes all that worth it with some of the best gunplay looter shooters have ever had.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Borderlands</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-1756910461839.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the progenitor for many of the ideas that came after, the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands">Borderlands</a> game deserves its roses for being the first of its kind (or at least the first massively successful one). Now over 15 years old, it definitely has its rough edges where gameplay, environment diversity, and other bells and whistles are concerned, but Gearbox managed to pull off what no one had before: turning a first-person shooter into a Diablo-like ARPG that was actually fun to play. The four vault hunters are iconic (having passed into legend at this point) and are a lot of fun to build into, and their quaint adventure through the deserts of Pandora is one I’ll always remember fondly despite its hilariously bad ending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And though Borderlands definitely felt like a prototype of better games to come, it also had some surprisingly good comedy writing and DLC support that kept me playing with friends years after its debut. In 2009, when expansions of this kind were rare and the looter shooter genre didn’t exist, Borderlands paved the way for everything that came after.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Tom Clancy's The Division 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/the-division-2-1756910519899.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we’re getting to the real heavy hitters, starting off with one of the greats of the live-service shooter. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2">The Division 2</a> is one of the best experiences to be had in this space. With tons of great loot, some of the toughest raid activities ever devised, awesome buildcrafting, and the absolutely stellar “dark zone” mechanics that add a mini extraction shooter right in the middle of your co-op game, The Division 2 built on just about everything its predecessor did well and then some.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also fills a niche of more realistic looter shooters with its dark, post-apocalyptic world where you’re fighting other humans instead of aliens or monsters. Sometimes this results in odd things, like a guy in a hoodie surviving a dozen shotgun blasts to the head, but if you’re able to put aside just how weird that is, you’re in for a good time. Best of all, both the games in this series have a whole lot of content to dive into, much of which still has an active playerbase to engage with.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Destiny 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/destiny-2-1756910584724.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After its predecessor pioneered the live-service model, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expanded on those ideas and is fast approaching a decade of content. It hasn’t always been consistent in being a fun game to play, and swings wildly from incredibly compelling expansions to absolute duds that make me want to put my head through a stained glass window. That’s bound to happen when you’re developing a game for this long and putting out thousands upon thousands of hours of content though, and when Destiny 2 pulls it off it’s without question one of the best looter shooters out there by a country mile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s due in no small part to its absolutely fantastic gunplay, which has kept me playing even through the numerous dark times and content droughts. Campaigns like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review">The Witch Queen</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review">The Final Shape</a> are some of the better stories looter shooters have told, the abilities and buildcrafting options have been built up over the course of years to the point where they feel quite good and have a ton of options to choose from. Best of all, it just has so much dang content that you could play every day for a year straight and still not run out of compelling things to do. It hasn’t always excelled in its loot, is often painfully grindy (including with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review">its most recent expansion</a>), and is incredibly inconsistent in the quality of its storytelling, but man, you’ve gotta hand it to Bungie for keeping this game relevant for as long as they have. The industry simply wouldn’t be the same without it!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Warframe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/warframe-1756910633727.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, okay, technically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> is more of a looter slasher than a shooter, but it would feel downright weird to not include it in this list given its influence on the genre and incredible amount of overlap. Taking on the role of a space ninja that’s absolutely dripping with swagger, Warframe has eaten up a ton of my time over the years with its never-ending grind and good times with friends. It also manages to pull off the free-to-play model quite well (or at least has a fairly consistent record), which makes it a pretty easy sell to your frugal co-op teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also impressive just how long this thing has been going on – it actually predates even Destiny –  with the caveat that to this very day Warframe’s developers still claim the game remains in open beta (yes, really). I don’t play Warframe consistently, but every time I’ve logged on in the past decade it’s had mechanics added to it that make it feel like a completely different animal, including space combat, roguelike zones, and even a time-traveling DLC with motorcycle riding and romance mechanics. I dunno, man. This game is just…insanely good.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Borderlands 4</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-4-1756910697289.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven’t yet heard the news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is out now and is one of my favorite looter shooters of all time. Even this early into its lifespan, with plenty of bugs, performance issues, and general wonkiness going on, this massive, open-world reimagining of the series represents a massive leap forward from Borderlands 3 that takes some interesting risks that overwhelmingly pay off, like a more grounded story and an entirely new setting in Kairos that steps quite far away from the familiarity and nostalgia of Pandora. It also makes some pretty stellar improvements to gunplay, specifically where mobility is concerned, and gliding and grapple hooking around with friends as you blow things up with the most ridiculous arsenal imaginable has been (and likely will continue to be) one of my favorite experiences in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 might very well go on to be even higher on this list, possibly even taking the top slot once various patches and content drops address some of my nitpicks with it, but even now it’s already stolen my heart and over 60 hours of my time. The future for the Borderlands series is looking quite bright – especially considering there’s already a whole roadmap charting out the next six months of content, which includes a new playable vault hunter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Remnant 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/remnant-2-1756910761610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Often described as “Dark Souls with guns,” the Remnant series has an incredibly unique take by combining a smattering of soulslike mechanics and roguelike features with looter shooter goodness, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/remnant-ii">Remnant 2</a> absolutely nails combining the ideas of all three. I should caveat this by saying that me categorizing Remnant 2 as a looter shooter will be controversial, primarily because this is the only game on this list that doesn’t have randomized loot or a grind that requires completing the same activities a bunch of times – both hallmarks of what makes the genre what it is. Instead, you take on significantly challenging activities and once you manage to beat them once, you get guaranteed loot that removes any need to replay it again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it takes so many other cues from looter shooters, from gameplay, to buildcrafting, to working together with a co-op team to take down some horrifying boss to get that piece of equipment or weapon you’ve been dying to add to your build, plus has plenty of reasons to keep playing long after you’ve beaten the campaign. The fact that it bucks some of the trends found in most other looter shooters, specifically the need to grind, might actually be one of the reasons this one ranks so highly for me (Remnant 2 was one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remnant-2-review">my favorite games of 2023</a>, after all). If you haven’t played it yet and you’re a fan of looter shooters, I cannot recommend it enough.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Borderlands 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-2-1756910828347.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As much as I adore the hot, newness of Borderlands 4, it’s quite hard to contend with the series’ magnum opus: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a>. It is still hands down the best looter shooter we’ve got. With an almost unbelievable number of weapons, some of the best comedy writing in gaming history (tip of the hat to good ol’ Handsome Jack), and a story that’s surprisingly emotional right when you expect it to be silly and shallow, I spent more than a thousand hours in Borderlands 2 back when that wasn’t really a thing people ever did with games that didn’t have competitive multiplayer matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously this game is over a decade old and so doesn’t quite hold up in certain areas like gunplay, movement, or buildcrafting, but after replaying it fairly recently I was shocked to see how well it still holds up. And where the original Borderlands game was the one that spawned all the looter shooters to come, Borderlands 2 was arguably even more influential in its impact on the genre, refining the concepts from the original and implementing new ideas that would later be iterated on by its peers, like how its endgame treadmill went on to inspire Destiny, Warframe, Outriders, and others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it!
