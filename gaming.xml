But beyond that, right now, we’re seeing four particular decks getting the most play and the most success.</p><p>It’s fair to say that Mewtwo’s is the deck that’s causing most consternation, given that it really does feel a little too over-powered, although others would argue Charizard’s build is the most dangerous. But all four of these builds are winners, and all capable of taking on each other. So, read on for the strengths, weaknesses, and best ways to play each of these four decks.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-recommend-id="image://165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mewtwo ex / Gardevoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mewtwo ex / Gardevoir." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-recommend-id="image://165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mewtwo ex / Gardevoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every online card game sees a deck develop that has everyone just want to quit. For <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, it’s Mewtwo/Gardevoir. And I <em>love</em> playing it.</p><p>There are so few drawbacks, too. Occasionally you’ll get plain unlucky, and the game will just refuse to give you a Ralts or a Mewtwo, which leaves you with a pile of mediocre cards that’ll fall to any other solid deck. But that happens far less often than you’d think.</p><p>It’s outrageously easy to win with this, to the degree where you start wondering if The Pokémon Company is going to be forced to issue a nerf. If they did, it would make sense to prevent it from attacking two turns in a row. But please don’t, because it’s too fun right now.</p><h3 id="h14411"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>All-dominating</li><li>Hard to mess up</li><li>Hard to counter</li></ul><h3 id="h14412"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can be tricky to evolve Gardevoir</li><li>People quitting on you</li></ul><h3 id="h14413"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>The essential cards for this deck are two of Ralts, Kirlia, and Gardevoir, and at least one Mewtwo ex. I’ve not been fortunate enough to pull a second of those, so back it up with a standard Mewtwo that lacks the two-energy 50 damage attack but otherwise works the same. Then, you’re going to want two Poké Balls, two Professor’s Research, and at least one X Speed. After that, you can experiment. My setup is:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Jynx x2</li><li>Ralts x2</li><li>Kirlia x2</li><li>Gardevoir x2</li><li>Clefairy</li><li>Clefable</li><li>Mewtwo ex</li><li>Mewtwo</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>X Speed x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li></ul><h3 id="h14414"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The trick here is that Mewtwo ex (and even the regular Mewtwo) has a devastating 150 attack, which the game attempts to temper by having you require four energy to use it and discard two of them every time you do. Except, along comes Gardevoir, evolved from Ralts and Kirlia, with the Ability to add an energy to your Active Pokémon every turn. That means, along with the energy you get per turn anyway, you can replenish back up to four every single turn. It’s unrelenting.</p><p>The two key things are to get Mewtwo in the Active Spot and Gardevoir evolved. So, you want Ralts on deck ASAP, and then put Jynx or Clefairy into play from the start. They can absorb early attacks while you prime Mewtwo with energy and get Ralts into Kirlia, then Kirlia into Gardevoir. When the cards fall right, this can happen in just two turns. Otherwise, hold your nerve, let your starting card take a dive if you need to, and then put Mewtwo in when you’re ready.</p><p>The Professor’s Research and Poké Ball cards should help you get any missing Pokémon out of the deck, and it’s worth having those X Speeds so you can pull out Jynx or Clefairy for free when you’re ready to move in Mewtwo—otherwise you’ll end up an energy behind, spent on the retreat cost. Then, blast, replenish, blast, replenish, and your opponent is likely going to be dependent upon unlikely coin flips to outdo it.</p><p>If anything, the main failing with this deck is that when people see you setting it up, they concede before you even get going. They lack spirit. Although, it’s hard to blame them, given there’s very little that can stand up to it.</p><p>I think, eventually, people are going to start countering with decks featuring Aerodactyl, given every attack has a 50 percent chance of the opponent having to shuffle their Active Pokémon into their deck. That’d be a devastating blow against Mewtwo, so shhhh, don’t tell anyone else.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-recommend-id="image://8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard ex / Moltres ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charizard ex / Moltres ex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-recommend-id="image://8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard ex / Moltres ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Depending on your vantage point, there are those who would argue it’s Charizard that may have a slight edge on every other deck out there at the moment. While it takes some time to get online, and once again relies on coin-flip energy accrual, the ex variant of Charizard guarantees a one-hit kill on everything, and can start attacking as early as three energy. It’s also just a lot of fun for any old Pokéheads out there for whom a holographic Charizard was the de facto all-star of the trading card game’s early years.</p><h3 id="h14415"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Strongest attack in the game</li><li>Simple strategy</li><li>Edges out every other ex card in an equal race</li></ul><h3 id="h14416"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Takes a while to come online</li><li>At the mercy of Moltres Inferno Dance coin flips</li></ul><h3 id="h14417"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>There are two options for the Charizard ex deck. One is to focus just on Charizard and Moltres and fill up on items to insulate you in the early game. The other is to swap in Ponyta and Rapidash for Red Cards and Sabrina to give you more flexibility and early game options.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Charizard ex x2</li><li>Charmeleon x2</li><li>Charmander x2</li><li>Moltres ex x2</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>X Speed x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li><li>Sabrina x2</li><li>Red Card x2</li></ul><h3 id="h14418"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The number one goal is to get Moltres ex out as soon as possible, with a Charmander on the bench, and start loading the latter up with fire energy. From there, all you need is to evolve it to Charizard in a timely manner and start unloading Crimson Storm attacks for 200 damage each.</p><p>If you don’t luck out with the coin tosses, or it’s taking longer than desired to get Charizard up and running, your best bet is buying time with item cards and making sure Charizard has at least five energy before bringing him out to fight. That way, he can use back-to-back Crimson Storms. And at 180 HP, it’s very likely he’ll be able to at least get both off before getting killed.</p><p>Red Cards and Sabrinas, meanwhile, should help you disrupt your opponent’s flow to buy you time to bring Charizard online and prevent them  getting a Starmie ex, Mewtoo ex, or Pikachu ex into position and loaded up with energy first. An extra 10 damage from Giovanni will be useless in most cases, which is why that card isn’t in the deck.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-recommend-id="image://ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Starmie ex / Articuno ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Starmie ex / Articuno ex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-recommend-id="image://ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Starmie ex / Articuno ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s one deck that’s received more prominence than any other, and that’s Lapras and Starmie. Star of the game’s first big event, it’s the deck absolutely everyone’s been battling in order to win those Lapras ex cards to start building their own. <em>Don’t use it</em>. There’s a better variant.</p><p>That’s not least because the Lapras version is also the deck absolutely everyone’s learned how to beat. The real star here is Starmie, teamed up with Articuno ex and the mercurial Misty, for a risky deck that dishes big damage</p><h3 id="h14419"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Low-cost, powerful attacks</li><li>Very quick to set up</li><li>Devastating to Fire decks like Charizard</li></ul><h3 id="h14420"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Misty is unreliable for energy</li><li>Weak to Electric decks</li><li>Needs a fast setup to work</li></ul><h3 id="h14421"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>There’s less room for improvisation here, given that there’s really no better back-up choice than Psyduck and Golduck, and the deck absolutely depends on both Misty and the cards to pull Pokémon from your deck. Articuno ex is your best second-runner to Starmie, too, as alternatives like Blastoise would require a three-step evolution and take over the deck.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Staryu x2</li><li>Starmie ex x2</li><li>Articuno ex x2</li><li>Psyduck x2</li><li>Golduck x2</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>Red Card x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li><li>Misty x2</li></ul><h3 id="h14422"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The key here is speed. This is all about getting Starmie ex in play before your opponent has had a chance to get their deck rolling. The brutal Mewtwo/Gardevoir deck is tough to beat, but a lot easier if you’re already taking chunks out of your opponent while Mewtwo is still tying his shoes.</p><p>The ideal situation is getting Staryu in the Active Spot before the game even starts, then evolving as quickly as possible, which is why you need two of each to improve the odds of this working. If Staryu is AWOL, putting Psyduck in is an excellent delay, as while its one-energy hit only does a paltry 10 damage, it also prevents the other player from using any Supporter cards on their next turn, and that means they can’t use Professor’s Research to dig out cards they need from their deck. It also blocks all the specialist supporters, like Blaine, Koga, Lt. Surge, and Brock from helping get Pokémon ready, and indeed the infuriating Sabrine from making you swap out your active Pokémon.</p><p>Once you’ve got Starmie ex evolved, you’re flying. You can now do 90 damage a turn, for just two energy. That’s not the 200 a Charizard ex can deliver (although it’d be 110 against Charizard thanks to its weakness!), but the idea here is to be dishing out those 90s to Charmander and Charmeleon before the ‘Zard has ever evolved. Also, Starmie ex has no retreat cost, so you can pull it when it’s getting weak, preventing the opponent taking those two points, and you don’t need to waste space in your deck with X Speeds. (Other setups for this deck keep the X Speed cards in, but we’ve subbed them for hand-wrecking Red Cards, because it’s such an excellent dick move to annoy your opponent.)</p><p>Articuno ex is there to sub in, in case Starmie is a no-show or is weakening. It’s a poorer option—doing 80 damage for three energy, with the bonus of a further 10 to opposing benched Pokémon—but it’s a Basic card, requiring no evolution, and its 140 HP will hold off enemies for a while. It’s really for Articuno that you want Misty in your deck, as should the coin-flips fall your way, you could get it loaded with energy to fight on turn 2.</p><p>Hopefully, when the cards fall your way, this means you can demolish your opponent long before they’re ready to fight back.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-recommend-id="image://8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu ex / Zapdos ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pikachu ex / Zapdos ex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-recommend-id="image://8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu ex / Zapdos ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Pikachu ex is another straightforward deck to play, but unlike Charizard ex it goes a lot faster. While Zapdos ex can’t quickly fill up the energy reserves of your bench, you don’t need it too, since most cards in this deck only require two electric energy to be off to the races. The goal is to move fast and break things with Voltorb and Electrode before later retreating at no cost, thanks to the latter’s built-in speed X perk.</p><p>Pikachu ex and Zapdos ex then provide the heavy hits, with advantages against other legendary birds and water decks. And because of the low retreat costs, you should be able to rotate your bench aggressively and snag kills without losing anyone in return. And unless you’re getting lucky with Zapdos’ Thundering Hurricane coin flips, you’ll need to be retreating since most attacks in this deck aren’t hitting for over 100 damage.</p><h3 id="h14423"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Comes online fast</li><li>Very efficient</li><li>Lots of maneuverability</li></ul><h3 id="h14424"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lower ceiling on single-turn damage output</li><li>Must utilize electric Pokémon to maximize Pikachu ex’s Circle Circuit effectiveness</li><li>Weak to water decks</li></ul><h3 id="h14425"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>While Pikachu ex and Zapdos ex take time and luck to acquire, even newer players will quickly be swimming in Voltorb and Electrode. There’s also a lot of versatility outside of the two stars, with options for variants that mix in Raichu, Zebstrika, and Magneton. Lt. Surge is a must for Raichu and Magneton builds, since he makes it easy to quickly reroute energy from retreating Pokémon to those on the bench taking their place.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pikachu ex x2</li><li>Zapdos ex x2</li><li>Electrode x2</li><li>Voltorb ex x2</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>X Speed x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li><li>Sabrina x2</li><li>Red Card x2</li><li>Giovanni x2</li></ul><h3 id="h14426"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The name of the game with Pikachu ex is speed. You want to hit the ground running, filling up your bench with electric Pokémon—though always saving an open spot for Pikachu ex if it hasn’t already been deployed. Voltorb is a great starting Pokémon because its Electrode evolution does a guaranteed 70 damage for just two energy, and it can retreat at no cost anytime, leaving room to bring Pikachu ex or Zapdos ex out and start wreaking havoc.</p><p>A mix of Giovanni and Potion can help you get a pick off early without giving any ground, while Red Card and Sabrina hopefully scramble your opponent before they can get a Mewtoo, Charizard, or other heavy-hitters that will kill your Pikachu ex or Zapdos ex in one hit.</p><p>If your opponent is able to establish that foothold, this deck will struggle to wrest back control of the board. That’s why it’s all about dictating the pace of the match early, and finishing things before one of those decks can come online.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As with every new entry in the Farming Simulator franchise, this year’s launch, Farming Simulator 25, includes a rather large selection of new and returning crops that give virtual farmers a chance to sow their seed and make some money in a cutthroat industry. Of course, you won’t plant everything, at least not all at once, so knowing your options beforehand gives you time to plan your harvest for the foreseeable future. Here’s a look at all of the crops in Farming Simulator 25!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-crop-available-to-you-in-farming-simulator-25">Every Crop Available to You in Farming Simulator 25</h2>



<p>When you kick off your farming adventure in Farming Simulator 25, following along with the tutorial will teach you the basics of preparing fields, planting, and harvesting crops. You’ll start slow and simple with canola and wheat. But as you better grasp the gameplay mechanics, you’ll expand your harvest to include potatoes, sugarcane, beans, and so much more! It’s a lot to learn, especially for newcomers to the series.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Farming Simulator 25 Crops</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Wheat</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Barley</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Canola</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Oat</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sorghum</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Corn</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sunflowers</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Soybeans</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Potatoes</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sugar Beet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sugarcane</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Cotton</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Grapes</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Olives</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Grass</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Red Beet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Carrots</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Parsnips</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Green Beans</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Peas</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Spinach</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Long Grain Rice</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Rice</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>Alongside these crops, you can also plant, grow, and harvest Grass, Hay, and Straw. You’ll find uses for everything in the game, as nothing goes to waste here. Every crop and item in the game serves a purpose: improving crop yield, feeding livestock, selling wholesale, or being a component in one of the many production chains.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite crop in Farming Simulator? I think I’ll specialize in my first playthrough and focus on rice.

It has been translated into English.]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to reflecting the characteristics of "Marvel Heroes" in-game and making Marvel Rivals stand out among other hero-based PvP games on the market, recreating their signature appearances and actions are of course important, but so is coming up with recognizable features in terms of both gameplay and character characteristics, as this is what will leave a deep impression on players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Environmental destruction and hero team-ups are two very prominent features of Marvel Rivals at the system level. Although their focus is different, at their core, they are both meant to represent the unique presence and abilities of "Marvel Heroes." If heroes canonically capable of destroying entire worlds can't even break a wall in-game, or if "ride or die" partners like Rocket Raccoon and Groot have no interactions with each other, it would create a sense of disharmony within the game and leave players with the impression that the creators do not understand Marvel heroes, let alone the Marvel universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN China was recently invited to interview Zhiyong, the lead combat designer of the Marvel Rivals team, and we asked him to introduce a lot of settings and information related to environmental destruction and hero team-ups, which he believes will help players better understand and become immersed in the game's content and atmosphere.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Rivals - Team-Up Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How different would the game be with and without destructible environments?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: The difference is very significant. As a game built around superhero battles, our goal in adding destruction effects is to showcase just how powerful they are beyond the conventional sound effects, special effects, and actions. This is the most basic design expectation for this feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But beyond that, we hope to use it to introduce dynamic changes within maps, such as knocking down a high platform to hinder enemy snipers, or creating a whole new path for a sneak attack. These effects all have the potential to turn the tide in battle. This helps ensure no two battles are alike even on the same map, which is the second level of consideration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we will also integrate themed environmental destruction into different maps. For example, in Yggsgard, some broken things can be restored, and the transition between destruction and restoration will bring new variables to players' strategies. Another example is the Tokyo 2099 map, where even if players destroy walls and pillars, part of the roof will still be suspended by spider webs. This kind of aerial cover can also lead to changes in tactics and operations. These are our basic expectations regarding the design of destructible environments. Their presence is sure to make a large difference in gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: During our hands-on experience, we noticed that the total area of the destructible environment and the locations of objects that can be destroyed, such as platforms and potential passages, are often fixed. Do you anticipate players seeing the destruction effects as fixed parts of the map after playing several rounds, and thus not feeling there is anything special about them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Indeed, we did not make the scene completely destructible. This is because certain static features, such as obstacles, key firing line-blocking structures, and crucial points of cover, are the glue that holds the map together. If these are completely removed, the map's design will lose its meaning. All the destruction effects are designed on this basis. But despite this, we've still managed to include a high proportion of destructible elements in each map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During battle, players can quickly see which areas can and can't be destroyed by pressing B. This is introduced through and integrated into the setting through "Chrono Vision," making it more than a feature simply added out of thin air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ensuring there are enough destructible parts of the environment to feel satisfying, we've still ensured that it's sufficiently difficult to completely tear down the map. For example, a single round on a Domination map may only take about four minutes, but if it's a Convoy or Convergence map, a single non-Competitive round may take eight to ten minutes. Players need to fight and carry forward at the same time. If you don't deliberately tear down a building, it's really difficult to take into account all the destruction points. In this way, there will be a more obvious difference between each round.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do all the abilities of all heroes have the ability to destroy the environment, or do only some of the abilities of some heroes have this ability?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: All the abilities of all heroes have the ability to destroy scenes. In fact, each ability in the game has two types of damage: damage to characters (the more conventional type of damage), and damage to destructible buildings and objects. Each character's abilities have both attributes, with only a few exceptions, such as some control abilities that specifically target heroes and may have no effect on buildings. Most abilities do have a destructive effect, though. For example, Hulk's fists can break walls, as can Rocket Raccoon's machine gun when he shoots specific locations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Over the past two days, I've experienced three new heroes, such as Moon Knight with his darts. These darts may look too small to do any real damage, yet they too are capable of breaking down buildings. What is the standard for configuring destructive power?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: To a certain extent, a building is treated like a "character" with a certain HP value, such as 500 HP or 1,000 HP. When a hero uses their abilities on it, part of the building's HP will be deducted, and once its HP is depleted, the building will be destroyed. We do indeed adapt the destructiveness of different abilities according to their power.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the most important thing for us is certain buildings collapsing after the battle reaches a certain stage or has progressed for a certain length of time, as it plays into a match's flow. In order to control this rhythm, we will reverse the calculation based on damage data. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, we expect that at a certain location and under normal circumstances, two players who have engaged in one to two waves of combat will switch between offense and defense. Either a certain foothold will be shot down, or a car will be occupied, etc. Then, the fight will progress to the next location. Based on such a rhythm expectation, we will reverse the calculation of the approximate amount of damage that can be caused. With this sort of basic scale, we can infer how much destructive power each hero's abilities should have, and there is a complete set of formulas and logic behind it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: For example, characters like Spider-Man and Venom rely heavily on pulling themselves up to high places for maneuvering or attacking, so they may struggle once a high-rise building is destroyed.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Exactly. This is, to a certain extent, the concrete manifestation of the changes we hope scene destruction will bring to the battle. Including buildings, platforms, cover, and other elements will affect players' strategies and how they choose to advance through the map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Here are some questions about hero team-up abilities: First of all, I'd like to ask whether this feature will be designed and developed based around existing teams of heroes in the original comics, or whether there will be some original team-ups?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: We actually have both kinds. For example, the combination of Groot and Rocket Raccoon is directly lifted from classic scenes in the MCU and comics, while Hulk enhancing Iron Man and Doctor Strange with his Gamma Boost is more of along the lines of our exploration of the possibility of interactions between heroes and their abilities. In addition, Venom's enhancement effect on Peni Parker and Spider-Man is also our original creation to a certain extent. In the game, Venom can separate part of the symbiote from his body and give it to his teammates, thereby enhancing the abilities of Peni Parker and Spider-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In addition to enhancing an ability's power or expanding its range, are there some special or unique team-up abilities?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: There are many types of team-up abilities. For example, the group of Hulk, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange mentioned earlier provides an enhancement to the heroes' existing abilities, without changing their form. But the team-up of Magneto and Scarlet Witch essentially grants Magneto a new long-ranged ability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team-up group of Venom, Peni Parker, and Spider-Man I mentioned earlier is also one that adds new abilities. There are also some special team-up abilities in our game, such as Hela, Loki, and Thor. Hela is the queen of Hel, and based on that concept and thorough exploration, she was designed with the ability to revive Loki and Thor, which is completely out of the scope of numerical enhancement or expansion of the three characters' original abilities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: After several rounds of large-scale close testing, have you made any new discoveries when it comes to balancing these team-up abilities? For example, were there any team-up effects that you originally thought to be unpopular but turned out to be used by many players?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Overall, it is generally within our expectations, but the strength of some combinations may be slightly over-tuned. For example, the team-up combination of Magneto and Scarlet Witch is indeed quite direct, and many players can use it easily. It has a high floor as well, making it relatively powerful in both ranked and competitive situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also "Easter egg"-type combinations like Rocket Raccoon and Groot. It's not particularly powerful, but players actually like it very much. Maybe it's because this combination and being able to fight while riding Groot is just fun in and of itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preferences and tendencies of players are generally within our expectations, but some team-up effects that fall under personal preferences have become popular, which is indeed slightly beyond our expectations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You're likely continuing to observe the effects and usage frequency of these team-up abilities to make balance adjustments, right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Absolutely. This continues to be a focus of ours. In addition, we will continue to introduce new characters, and with new characters comes new team-up abilities. At the same time, we have previously announced that there will be a concept of dynamic team-up in the game. Simply put, this "dynamic team-up" will make introduce adjustments to some team-up combinations on a seasonal basis. Of course, the ultimate goal is to introduce more variety to the team-up combinations and keep things fresh, as team-ups are a crucial part of our lineup diversity. Thus, we put it in a larger dimension for overall consideration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: If a player encounters a team without any hero team-up abilities when queuing up solo, will there be a big gap in overall strength compared to teams with team-up abilities?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: We have actually considered this issue very carefully and have plans to avoid such situations. First of all, the existing team-up framework generally includes a combination of two to three heroes, but we do not require that all three heroes must be present to activate the enhancement effect. For example, if a team includes only Hela and Thor, those two players can still activate the resurrection ability. Smaller unit design is obviously conducive to the triggering of team-up effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, there is a concept called "team-up core" in the game. Some characters, which account for about one-third of the roster, can enjoy some special effect enhancements throughout the season. Even if the hero team-up is not activated—for example, if I choose Hela but no one in the team chooses Thor or Loki, Hela will still enjoy the season gain effect as a "team-up core" character, which guarantees the strength of the character to a certain extent.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Under this premise, only in extreme and rare cases in which players deliberately choose to do so would a team of six players wants to choose a combination that ha s neither the buffed "team-up core" nor any team-up combinations. Based on the aforementioned design, generally speaking, teams with team-up effects are competing against each other. In addition, looking at our data from many rounds of testing, there were almost no teams that lacked any sort of team-up effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, from the experience of our developers—because we almost always play ranked—through our own observations in the ranking environment, players are gradually getting used to the team-up system. When I choose Scarlet Witch, my teammates will naturally choose Magneto to cooperate with me. When I choose Iron Man, there is a high probability that my teammates will choose Hulk, or when they see me choose Hulk, my teammates will select Doctor Strange, etc. This situation is becoming more and more common.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After all, most players will not limit themselves to just one hero. Rather, they will be good at at least three or four characters in different roles. As long as they reach this level, they will certainly have the know-how needed to cooperate with teammates to activate team-up effects, even when matching with strangers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are there more active effects or passive effects in hero team-up skills?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Generally speaking, there are more active abilities. If a character's inherent abilities are more complex, however, we may tend to use passive methods to trigger the team-up effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: If it's an active ability though, you may need to tell the player how to use it and what effects it has.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Indeed. Our current tutorial is not quite complete, but we are already working on a new tutorial program. In it, we will select some heroes and explain how to trigger and use team-up effects through the hero's introduction. Of course, we also hope to continue making additions to our beginner tutorial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the perspective of regular battles in the game, after an active team-up ability is activated, an animation will play. Generally speaking, it will be bound to a certain key/button, prompting the player to actively use it. There is no key/button prompt for passive types, such as Hela and Thor, which directly prompt resurrection.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is the ultimate development goal of the hero team-up system to allow any hero to have a team-up effect with any other character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Frankly speaking, we don't want just any hero, or any two heroes, to be able to activate team-up abilities, as this would make the game overly complicated. After all, this is not a card game—players do not have an overview of the entire match available at all times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our players are more like six individuals joining forces to defeat their six opponents. They need to communicate and cooperate with each other. Therefore, we should not make the hero team-up design too complex. In principle, we should try to keep it to the current two to three heroes in a group, with a dozen or so team-ups available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the continuous addition of new characters, we will also introduce new team-up abilities, and the old team-ups will also be changed and adjusted to adapt to the new meta. But in general, we still want to continue exploring in this direction. In doing so, we can better help players to learn and master various character combinations, and the overall context will appear clearer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It sees a small blacksmith's hammer appear between Geralt's ankles and stay there perpetually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1goiiut/i_got_infected_by_the_sledgehammer_bug_is_it/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Idratherhikeout</a> brought it to fans' attention once again this week when they posted an image of Geralt with the infamous hammer. "I got infected by the sledgehammer bug," they said. "Is it still not fixable?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am playing Witcher 3 for the Nth time and I now have a sledgehammer between my legs," they continued. "It’s always there. Walking. Under roach. Under me swimming. Weirdly it switched to Uma during their scenes at Kaer Morhen. Any known fix?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The short answer is no. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-entering-full-production-very-soon">CD Projekt is now deep in development on the next Witcher game</a> so has long since moved on from The Witcher 3, and told IGN there are no plans to address the hammer bug. Some infected players have allegedly found success by shifting back a few saves and deleting all the infected ones, but there's no guaranteed fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every player who does come across the bug seemingly spawns a few dozen who simply find it hilarious though. "Why is this so funny," said one user in the comments. "I quite enjoy this," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes despite the hammer bug being around for years. "Help. Why is there a hammer under Geralt?" asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1dsiv76/help_why_is_there_a_hammer_under_geralt_its_been/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zelter7</a> in July.

"There is a constant floating hammer between my Geralt's feet," said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/73bmwt/help_there_is_a_constant_floating_hammer_between/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divexz</a> in 2017.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was even there at launch, evidenced by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/38iqah/whats_the_floating_hammer_under_geralt/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tgat's</a> post on June 4, 2015, barely two weeks after The Witcher 3 launched. "What's the floating hammer under Geralt?" they asked, innocently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, for a couple game hours now I haven't been able to figure out what this thing is. It looks like a small sledgehammer or blacksmiths hammer and its standing upright on the ground between Geralt's legs, and it moves with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even in cutscenes, it'll be in the shot, but not under Geralt, it's always where he eventually ends up. So it seems like some sort of character mark. Anyone have any idea?" But no one did then, and no one does now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This little bug has thankfully not impacted the overall reception of The Witcher 3, which has otherwise gone down as one of the most beloved video games of all time.

			<p>Embark Studios has finally shared the debut gameplay trailer for ARC Raiders. The game was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021 as a free-to-play cooperative shooter. However, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-the-latest-game-to-be-delayed-to-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> several delays that led Embark to <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-discovery-team-fps-embark-studios-first-game-before-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus</a> on The Finals (formerly known as Project Discovery), their competitive shooter, first.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the developer finally re-<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> ARC Raiders as a third-person PvPvE extraction shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-pc-playtesting-begins-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playtesting</a> took place last month. Today, Executive Producer Aleksander Grøndal said about the playtest:</p>
<p><em>This was a really encouraging playtest for us. We now have lots of data and feedback to sift through. We know that players appreciate the atmosphere of the world we've created and the immersion we bring to the table. We also know there's a lot we can do to continue to optimize and balance the experience. We're keen to deliver on a much expanded late-game experience, with deeper progression and extensive quests that take players across new locations, as well as a larger variety of ARC machines and other world-encounters.</em></p>

<p>In ARC Raiders, players scavenge the surface of the world for vital supplies and materials through quests and raids assigned by the merchants of Speranza. While scavenging the surface, they will encounter enemy ARC machines and other raiders competing for resources.</p>
<p>Engaging in firefights may be the only way out of a tight spot, but it's also risky. Sometimes, being cautious and staying out of sight is a better option to stay alive. To keep the hard-earned loot, players must reach extraction points and risk being ambushed. Success means getting their hands on vital materials for crafting and upgrading, or items to sell to the merchants for currency.</p>
<p>According to the developers, ARC Raiders mixes high-intensity, time-sensitive extraction challenges on the surface with strategic survival elements underground, where progress is closely tied to the player's workshop. Building and upgrading various crafting stations allows users to craft new equipment, such as advanced weapon mods or unique gadgets.</p>
<p>The merchants in Speranza will give quests in exchange for extra currency and experience, as well as the occasional item. The vendors offer different items and equipment, depending on their specialty. Players may also spend experience in a skill tree to customize their playstyle.</p>
<p>ARC Raiders will be released next year on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store, with support for NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>Payload Studios is laying off even more staff, just months after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payload-studios-lays-off-25-percent-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letting go of 25%</a> of the company. The developer of TerraTech has confirmed to GamesIndustry.biz (GIBiz) that it is letting go a number of employees after being put in a “very difficult position”.</p>



<p>“It’s true that last week we announced another redundancy round,” CEO and co-founder Russell Clarke told GIBiz. “This has come out of the blue after a project that we were relying on did not materialise, and placed us in a very difficult position. </p>



<p>“The details, including the handling of the notice period and redundancy payments as well as the number of people who will ultimately lose their jobs, are still to be determined – but we had to notify staff last week, to give as much warning as possible to all those who might be affected.”</p>



<p>While Clarke didn’t confirm the number of people let go, GIBiz claims that eight people were let go this time around. Clarke said that his hope was to “give answers” to the staff sometime this week. It’s also being reported that those let go weren’t receiving any sort of redundancy pay.</p>



<p>Sources also told GIBiz that one of Payload’s co-founders was part of the layoffs, though the company wouldn’t confirm which one.</p>



<p>“We are still figuring out the details, but the team that goes forward will need to be very lean,” Clarke said about the future of Payload Studios.</p>



<p>In 2024, there have been <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly 13,500 jobs lost</a> in the games industry across more than 160 companies. The real total is likely higher, however, as some companies didn’t make public how many people had been laid off. </p>

            <p>
As the season of wild consumer abandon and deep Black Friday discounts descends upon us, Sony has announced it's temporarily slashing the price of the PS5 Slim Digital Edition by $70 in the US, although it's made no indication the offer might be reflected elsewhere in the world.
</p>
<p>
The discount, revealed at the end of Sony's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww">Play Has No Limits commercial</a>, brings the price of the PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition down from its usual $449.99 to $379.99 - meaning the console is officially cheaper than its chunkier predecessor for the first time, given the $50 price increase Sony slapped on the Slim Digital Edition when it launched last year.
</p>
<p>
Sony says the offer - which doesn't yet appear <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim">on the PlayStation website</a> - will run until 24th December (or "while stocks last"), so consider that your starting point if you were planning on picking one up in the US during this year's Black Friday sales. As to whether Sony is planning a similar price reduction in Europe, it hasn't yet said, but it <em>did</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-drops-price-of-the-playstation-5-slim-for-a-limited-time">recently announce a temporary price cut</a> for the standard PS5 Slim across multiple territories.

<p>
Sony's PS5 Slim Digital Edition discount for the US follows last week's confirmation the company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">seen a drop in console sales</a>, down to 6.2m from the 8.2m sold in the same quarter last year. On the plus side, software sales are up - the marvellous Astro Bot even managed to shift 1.5m copies in its first month - and Sony will also be hoping the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-playstation-5-pro-weve-removed-it-from-its-box-and-theres-new-information-to-share">recently launched PlayStation 5 Pro</a> helps give its numbers a boost.
</p><p>
And speaking of Sony's £700 console, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-playstation-5-pro-review-across-the-board-improvements-but-is-it-really-worth-the-money">shared its PlayStation 5 Pro verdict</a> last week. "The truth is, the standard PS5 is still the best choice for most people," Richard Leadbetter wrote, "but for the core enthusiast looking for the best possible experience, the Pro option is there for you, albeit with a substantial premium."

<h2>Revenant expansion adds new content to the iconic space MMO EVE Online, letting capsuleers use new mercenary dens and fearsome deathless ships</h2>
<p>The 21-year-old sci-fi space MMO: EVE Online, developed by CCP Games, has today received the Revenant expansion, bringing new content and enhanced gameplay. The Revenant expansion introduces new powerful ships, mercenary dens, and weapons to battle against enemies but The Deathless adds a new layer of mystery to the game.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: eveonline.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Deathless is seemingly an untrustworthy character who is difficult to trust but can be both a valuable ally and a threat that players must cooperate with as they face the Drifters. The Drifters are a powerful faction that needs to be tackled with the help of Deathless, who will provide powerful ships, weapons, and ammunition in return for encrypted infomorphs.</p>
<p>Bergur Finnbogason, Creative Director for&nbsp;<em>EVE Online says,</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The Deathless…can he be trusted? What are his intentions? An untrustworthy ally is an ally nonetheless, but the clock is ticking. The Drifters will be back,</p></blockquote>
<p>These encrypted infomorphs can be produced using new mercenary dens that are deployed in orbit around temperate planets. The players can form coalitions to protect these dens or raid the enemy structures to disrupt operations in the Nullsec, which is ready to witness massive battles.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: eveonline.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>EVE Online Players will be provided with powerful Deathless ships in the Revenant expansion that can be used to gain strategic advantage in New Eden's power struggles. These are the <em>Tholos Destroyer&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cenotaph Battlecruiser&nbsp;</em>which specialize in close-range combat. These ships bring the cloaking ability to perform SCARAB breaching pods and striker clone weaponry that can tear through shields, armors, and hulls from the inside, giving the corporations and alliances a high-stakes opportunity to reshape territorial control.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: eveonline.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>To further increase the impact of corporations, the Revenant expansion brings enhanced corporation projects to set broader goals for members. Plus, a new Ship Insurance project type enables them to offer insurance-backed compensation.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: eveonline.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>CCP Games is also providing SKINs via 40 new patterns and new nanocoatings for players to experiment with their ships, allowing customizations and letting players make beautiful patterns and unique designs. With customizations, EVE Online players can design exclusive SKINs for their corporations and alliances to represent their identity in both cooperative and competitive contexts.</p>

Typically, that PS5 model costs $449.99, but it will start at $379.99 through December 24th, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww">according to a new ad</a>. </p><p>This holiday deal brings the slim PS5 digital edition just under the original $399.99 price of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21436287/sony-ps5-digital-edition-price-release-date">launch version of the PS5 digital console</a>. The footnote at the end of the ad specifies that this price is only for the disc-free console, so it seems like the model with a disc drive already attached will still start at $499.99. But the holiday pricing also means that by buying a digital PS5 slim and one of Sony’s separate $79.99 PS5 disc drives, you can make your own PS5 with a disc drive and save about $40.</p><p>Another way to save money would be to opt for one of Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241914/sony-refurbished-playstation-5-ps5-dualsense">refurbished PS5s</a>: a digital refurb costs $349.99 while a model with a disc drive costs $399.99. But those refurbished consoles also come in the original design for the PS5 that’s larger (and arguably) uglier than the slimmer model.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, Sony offers the $699.99 PS5 Pro. But that doesn’t come with a disc drive, and whether it’s worth the higher cost might depend on how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">far away you sit from the screen</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To convince people to buy a PlayStation 5, Sony’s new ad announces that the PS5 Slim Digital Edition will be marked down to $380. </p><p>Normally, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition costs $450</a></span>. So this is a discount of $70. (I’m not factoring in things like shipping, tax, etc.) This new temporary discount, which ends on December 24, means that you can now buy a PS5 Slim and a digital game while paying about the same (or less) than you would normally for a game and a new PS5. That’s nice. </p><p>However, keep in mind that this deal is only on the PS5 Slim Digital Edition. So if you want a PS5 with a disc drive, you’ll have to either buy that console or buy a disc drive separately. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-disc-drive-cost-selling-out-where-to-buy-amazon-1851646276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-disc-drive-cost-selling-out-where-to-buy-amazon-1851646276">And uh, good luck with that</a></span>. It should also be noted that the Slim doesn’t come with a vertical stand. You’ll need to buy that separately.</p><p>Finally, let’s not forget that when the digital-only PS5 initially launched, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-out-in-u-s-on-nov-12-costs-500-for-main-model-1845081999&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-out-in-u-s-on-nov-12-costs-500-for-main-model-1845081999">it was just $400.</a></span> Then, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803">Sony raised its price after the launch</a></span>. So when you factor that in, this means the PS5 Slim that Sony is selling during the holidays is only $20 less than it was four years ago. Bleh. </p><p>Also, this deal doesn’t apply to the recently released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-disc-drive-sony-why-1851657354?_gl=1*rhztje*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQyMDM2Mi4xMDMuMS4xNzMxNDMwODY4LjQ2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-disc-drive-sony-why-1851657354?_gl=1*rhztje*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQyMDM2Mi4xMDMuMS4xNzMxNDMwODY4LjQ2LjAuMA..">PS5 Pro, which still costs an eye-watering $700</a></span>. It might be Christmastime, but Sony ain’t discounting its newest and most expensive console anytime soon. Do you want ray tracing this holiday season? You gotta pay up. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547039255696769967">blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Valve admitted the original process was "fairly obscure," but now lets developers "offer players this choice from within the game itself."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These changes, it continued, "give players more clear choices in how they want to engage with the game. Some want to be part of your beta branch where you are testing out the latest updates, while others may want to play on an older stable build that they know works well with their save file."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Previously, players would have to access those beta branches on their own in the 'Settings' tab; now, developers can add a button and text to a game's menu that shows what a build a player has and invite them to join the beta branch. Inside that branch, players will "see new UI immediately next to the play button in Steam that shows the current beta they have set, and easily lets them opt back out if they so choose."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once selected, Steam will reboot and relaunch the game into beta mode and its player-selected build. That build will be further reflected in the game's Steam library page.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for game saves, Valve said the new APIs make it so players are asked if they would like to still use the older version of a title rather than defaulting to the newer one. It noted that "trouble can arise when players with dozens or hundreds of hours of playtime find that their save file no longer works with the latest version of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By "adding some logic" to their game, devs can check what version a player's existing save is linked to, something Valve said is primarily an issue for Early Access games. Alternatively, they could specify version numbers in save files or map a version of their game to a branch ID that "creates a table somewhere in your game that is aware of which versions correspond with each Steam Beta Branch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The onus will fall on devs to plug these four APIs into their games themselves, and more information on them can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamApps">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/somehow-baldurs-gate-3-has-sold-two-copies-in-vatican-city.1033812/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Given how popular&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's no stretch to imagine that the game has been played all around the world, but Larian has revealed that two people in a very unusual place indeed have enjoyed the game.</p>

<p>According to publishing director <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1855995474492207263" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Douse on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, two copies of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>have been sold in Vatican City, and one person there has it on their Steam wishlist as well.</p>

<p>Douse rather amusingly says he likes to imagine the wishlisting person is "the Pope waiting until he has a free minute", expressing a wish to "see their mod list" and suggesting said list is "absolutely gnarly". That seems like an understatement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city-karniss.jpg?itok=q9QxJQxL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city-karniss.jpg?itok=TAhuSMY4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>has somehow sold two copies in the Vatican, of all places.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically speaking, the Vatican is a city-state in its own right, although it does qualify as the smallest state in the world. At <a href="https://www.vaticanstate.va/it/stato-governo/note-generali/popolazione.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, 764 people inhabited Vatican City, with 618 of those people being citizens.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that Vatican City is an intensely religious place, so it's quite amusing to imagine someone living in such a place playing&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, a game that might have been considered heretical by the Catholic Church just a few decades ago.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more amusingly, <a href="https://x.com/samito/status/1856006701259816994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">one person</a> in the replies to Douse's original post suggests that the two Vatican City sales of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>were a "clerical error". Badum, and indeed, tish.</p>

<p>In any case, I hope the two Vatican City players of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it, whoever they happen to be, and I hope whoever has it on their wishlist decides to take the plunge and buy it. You won't regret it!</p>

Larian has already confirmed that this update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-preview-larian" rel="nofollow">won't be the game's last</a>.</p>

They include Switch bundles, $20 to $30 off games ranging from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> to <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and discounted controllers. Here’s the full list so far:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Switch <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> Bundle - $300 (normally $380)</li><li>Switch OLED <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> Bundle - $350 (normally $430)</li><li>Switch Lite Hyrule Edition w/ Online + Expansion Pack - $210 (normally $250) </li></ul><p><strong>Games</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>The Legend of Zeld: Tears of the Kingdom</em> - $50 (normally $70)</li><li><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - </em>$40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Pikmin 4</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Nintendo Switch Sports - </em>$40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>﻿Super Mario Odyssey </em>- $30 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Pikmin 1 + 2 </em>- $30 (normally $60)</li></ul><p><strong>Accessories</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Neon Red and Neon Blue Joy-Con controllers - $60 (normally $80)</li><li>Switch Pro Controller - $50 (normally $70)</li><li><em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> Switch Carrying Case - $15 (normally $25)</li></ul></blockquote><p>As has become something of a seasonal tradition, the <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle is back in pole position, with both base Switch and OLED variants that essentially include the hit party racing game for free as well as a year of Switch Online. The Expansion Pack portion is missing though, which is a shame since that’s what includes access to all of the <em>Mario Kart 8 DLC </em>for free (otherwise it’s $30 extra).</p><p>In fact, Nintendo is pushing Switch Online memberships big-time as part of its Black Friday deals this year. The Hyrule Edition Switch Lite, which looks fantastic, will be bundled with a year of Switch Online + Expansion Pack for $40 off. The subscription includes access to dozens of games from the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis libraries. </p><p>When it comes to games, there’s no noteworthy deals on anything that got released this year or even in late 2023 like <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> or<em> Super Mario RPG</em>. Then again, $20 off <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> isn’t bad by Nintendo’s normally stingy standards. While it never got DLC, the game’s world is so massive, it still essentially feels like a forever game. I have over 100 hours in it and still haven’t seen everything. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-project-u-is-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-5-years-of-development.1033797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft’s Project U returned to the drawing board this year following five years of development.</p>



<p>Project U was officially announced in September 2022 as a revolutionary “new kind of session-based cooperative shooter,” but after over two years since its announcement, nothing publically about the game has yet been announced. That’s because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-project-u-gameplay-details-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project U</a>, internally codenamed Pathfinder, quietly returned to the drawing board in Spring 2024 following issues surrounding the game’s replayability.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with Project U, its premise is that Earth has been invaded by machines that want to mechanize all life. The game would see ten teams of four battle it out in PvE combat against progressively more difficult enemies as they progressed through the map’s zones, which could have thousands of enemy AI robots on the map at any given time. Eventually, players would enter the final zone in the middle of the map, where they’d need to defeat the boss.</p>



<p>Despite initially receiving generally positive feedback from players, one fundamental flaw plagued the game from the start: its replayability. Sources say it was a constant issue for the developers and would see the project’s budget balloon due to continuous reworks. Such reworks included adding more variations to the map with biomes and adding new bosses to change its repetitive nature; however, playtests in February 2024 revealed that the game lacked the replayability needed.</p>



<div><p>In March 2024, Ubisoft Annecy announced that Project U (codenamed Pathfinder) development would cease immediately and that outsourcing studios would move on to different projects. Two of the game Directors, Mathieu Granjon and Damien Kieken left the project among many other developers, with Granjon moving to Assassin’s Creed and Kieken eventually making his way to DICE this month.</p><p>Instead of being canceled, Ubisoft internally noted that PvE games can still be successful, citing the viral launch of Helldivers 2, which sold an estimated million units in its first five weeks. As such, it’s said that Ubisoft still believes in the project and moved Project U back into incubation with a new producer and a small team to explore new ideas. However, after over five years of development, current and past project developers tell me it’s difficult to see how the game would succeed.</p></div>



<p>Will Project U end up being another decade-long project at Ubisoft? Only time will tell.</p>

After spending a day with the team taking a closer look at South of Midnight, it’s clear that innovation streak hasn’t slowed down one bit, and I went from mild curiosity to full-blown hype for this unique action-adventure game. Though I didn’t see anything that blew my socks off in terms of gameplay, it stood out in just about every other way, especially with its striking setting, curious stop motion animation, and stellar original soundtrack. That all left me eager to see more and play it for myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">South of Midnight is set in a part of the world we don’t see too often in games: the American deep south. It isn’t just a backdrop for you to fight monsters, but rather the entire premise on which the adventure sits, with characters, folklore, and mythical creatures all drawn from real-world places and stories. During a hands-off demo, I saw flooded wetlands after a recent storm, mosquito-riddled swamps, and ostentatious Antebellum manors, each infused with elements of fantasy I’d not seen anywhere else.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">South of Midnight Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These exotic places fit nicely with an equally unusual art style that emulates stop motion animation – yet another rarity in games, and one that would be sure to fog up Guillermo del Toro’s glasses. The whole thing looks like it was ripped from the pages of a children’s story book, which I really dug. It definitely took some getting used to at first, as the jerky movement might easily be mistaken for framerate wonkiness to the untrained eye, but it also adds to the otherworldly fantasy charm that South of Midnight oozes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It can sometimes be pretty difficult to understand how exactly a game will feel to play during a hands-off demo, but in the case of South of Midnight touching a controller wasn’t necessary to recognize its best quality: its music. Each level has you facing off against a cryptid from deep south folklore as southern-inspired blues and jazz intensifies and the lyrics help tell the story of whatever beast you’re tracking down. In the case of this demo, it was an enormous alligator called Two-Toed Tom (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Toed_Tom" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>based on an actual legendary creature</u></a>). At first the music started slow with a slick bassline and a choir whispering “Two-Toed Tom,” but by the time we unraveled the mystery of the mythical gator and progressed to the final confrontation, the chorus reached a fevered pitch, the words of which told the tale of poor, old Tom.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The setting, art, and music set South of Midnight apart in a major way and made me extremely excited to get my hands on it."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these components – the setting, art, and music – set South of Midnight apart in a major way and made me extremely excited to get my hands on it. The flipside of that is that what I saw of gameplay offered far less originality. Combat looked like a pretty by-the-numbers system of dodging, striking, and finishing moves that are quite well-trodden, and exploration relied on double jumping, midair dashing, and grappling to distant locations that are pretty standard stuff. The boss fight against Two-Toed Tom, for example, was a very repetitive process of leaping over telegraphed attacks and whaling on the gator when he presented obvious opportunity to do so.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compulsion Games says that while they expect gameplay to be engaging, it isn’t nearly as much of a focus as the story, music, and other elements they’ve clearly put the lion’s share of work into. Instead, they’re keeping levels relatively short for a ten-ish hour story and putting all of their chips into South of Midnight’s exceptional presentation and worldbuilding, and so far I’m convinced they just might pull it off. After all, even without playing it myself, it’s made a great impression on me. Here’s hoping it delivers when we finally get to play it next year.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
