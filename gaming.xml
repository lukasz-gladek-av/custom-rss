		<p>It’s an exciting time to be a fan of Grasshopper Manufacture. With nearly three decades of bewildering punk-personified video games, the studio doesn’t seem to be slowing down at all. The team has spent the last few years celebrating their greatest hits, with the hotly anticipated finale <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/27/no-more-heroes-3-review/">No More Heroes 3</a> and a sharp remaster of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/shadows-of-the-damned">Shadows of the Damned</a>. Now, sights are set on new horizons, new worlds, and a new hero with the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is a Dead Man</a>.</p>
<p>For all the change that Grasshopper Manufacture has gone through over the years, the unorthodox and endlessly inventive vision of studio head Suda51 has seemingly never wavered. We jumped at the chance to sit down with him and check in on how he’s feeling about his upcoming game, and reflect on some of his favourite projects, collaborators, and giant robot anime.</p>

<p><strong>TSA – &nbsp;Well it’s really awesome to be talking to you guys – especially right before Romeo Is a Dead Man, a new game of yours is launching. How are you feeling about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> We’re really happy to be talking to you right now too, and thanks a lot for, you know, for covering us.</p>

<p>It’s kind of like, ‘Wow, it’s really, actually, finally coming out,’ you know? We’ve been really busy. We’re doing this promotional tour right now, we’re also still making final tweaks on everything, making sure everything’s in line. So it’s been really busy and pretty exhausting, but it’s also just super exciting, again, to finally have the game come out!</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I can tell you guys have been putting a lot of work in – Romeo Is a Dead Man looks incredible. It’s definitely the most high-fidelity, graphically detailed game that Grasshopper Manufacture has made up to this point. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] Wow, thank you.</p>
<div id="attachment_468410"><p id="caption-attachment-468410">Romeo Is a Dead Man features a more traditional “AAA” art style to previous Grasshopper games.</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – Was there a specific reason you guys wanted to go for that AAA graphic style for this game, instead of a more stylized or simplified style?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Well, when development really first started kind of getting going, I spoke with our art director, Tanawaki-san [<strong>Kunihiko Taniwaki],</strong> and he had the opinion that this time, we should go with not exactly a photo-realistic style, but more realistic graphics in general. More high-quality graphics, instead of, like, creating a whole new style of art and visuals just for this game.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that is, obviously, it takes a lot of time and brain power and creativity to come up with a whole new style. The other thing is, when you’ve got a whole studio full of people working on the same game, it takes a lot of time and effort to everybody on the same page and get everyone to really understand ‘OK, so this is what everything’s supposed to look like. This is how I should make this.’</p>
<p>That was part of the reason there – it would just take a lot of time, it would take a lot of effort. And also, we kind of just wanted to see what we could do making more high-quality, more realistic graphics than we were used to doing.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – In the game, Romeo Stargazer is an FBI space-time special agent, and it’s the first time Grasshopper Manufacture has made a game about being on that side of the law since The Silver Case and 25th Ward. </strong><strong>Why make a game about an interstellar FBI agent instead of, for example, a demon hunter or assassins?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> This is kind of a weird way to start off the answer to this question, but when I first came up with the idea for the story and the character, as you could probably tell by playing the game, I was mainly inspired by Back to the Future and Rick &amp; Morty. Not only the space-time travel stuff but the relationships and everything.</p>
<p>So when I started thinking about what kind of main character I was going to make, to be honest, even I’m not sure of the <em>exact </em>reason why I decided this, but I thought ‘OK, this time I want to basically portray just a regular young dude, and write the story of how he kind of grows and develops into a grown man. And, you know, gets tough and stronger and really fulfils his own potential and stuff.’</p>
<p>Then came the ideas of him getting the special helmet and becoming Deadman and having to overcome all kinds of challenges and stuff. But yeah, I didn’t really set out with the idea of ‘OK, this time I’m going to go against the grain of Grasshopper titles – I’m going to make the guy somebody on <em>this </em>side of the law!’&nbsp;It just sort of happened, to be honest, and I don’t really have a specific reason why.</p>
<div id="attachment_468411"><p id="caption-attachment-468411">Romeo Stargazer is an FBI space-time special agent.</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – It’s interesting that you talk about the idea for the character kind of being about wanting to see a young man become stronger and grow. It feels like that’s a little different than a lot of your previous characters, where they start already kind of being these rough, mean, weird dudes. Was there a reason why that kind of story really appealed to you this time for Romeo Is a Dead Man?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Up ‘til now, like you said, there’s been a lot of characters who are kind of the exact opposite. For example, Travis Touchdown – you got this guy who, he’s a grown man, but pretty immature and kind of screwed up and, you know, he’s got a pension for being a bit rough and violent.</p>
<p>I think it might have been subconscious – or might have actually been a little bit of a conscious decision and I just didn’t really notice until recently – but I think part of me was probably like, since I’ve been working on characters particularly like Travis Touchdown for so long, I think maybe this time I’m going to go the other way and have the character start out <em>not </em>fully developed yet. And also, you know, not be this kind of… funky asshole, I guess you could say. I think that probably did, at least on a subconscious level, influence my decision to start with this sort of character in this sort of story and how he was portrayed.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – You’ve talked in the past about how your team works collaboratively to share ideas and build them together. Is there an idea that made it into the final version of Romeo Is a Dead Man that surprised you? Like something you didn’t come up with yourself at all, or something you would have never thought of or expected to work in the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] Uhh… oh, there’s a part of the game called [Deadgear Cannonball], where you can use it to power up Romeo and the stuff he can do. And at the beginning [of development], one of the staff members said ‘Hey, I want to put this type of mini-game thing in the game, it’ll become like a Pac-Man style thing, and you just power up, and this is how it would work.’</p>
<p>When they explained it, I was kind of like ‘What the hell are you talking about, like why…’ and they were like, ‘No, I really want to do this, we should try this out.’ And then, you know, it got put in the game, and when we started the debugging phase, bit by bit, I tried it out and I was like ‘Yeah…I still don’t really get it. Like, again, what is this Pac-Man rip-off thing? What’s this really even for?’</p>
<p>But then, when development progressed even further and it got to the point were we could play through the game linearly, I started realising not only does it fit in really well and it kind of flows really well with the rest of the game, but it’s actually a really important element in the game. Yeah, that was a really good idea. I’m really glad we put that in.</p>
<p>To be honest, I haven’t told that person that! [Laughs]
</p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="GhM Direct 30 Seconds: Ep. 14 - Deadgear Cannonball" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6v8ncSULh0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>TSA – In Romeo Is A Dead Man, and a few other Grasshopper Games, you’re credited as “SUDA51” for the Directing and the Story, but Producer gets credited to your real name, Goichi Suda. Why the distinction?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] I feel like Suda51 is more connected to the creative side of things, and naming wise it kind of fits better with that. But using my real name, you know, Goichi Suda, that sounds a bit more serious, like, you know, CEO-ish, than just Suda51. Like a dude wearing a suit with, like, a proper tie and everything. And so I thought it might be best to kind of split the way I use my names in that way.</p>
<p>Also, to be honest, I’m also just trying to look cool.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – You could look cool wearing the leather jacket and the necktie. Could be interesting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Sounds like a pretty bitchin’ style. I might try it out.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I know that your original vision for Shadows of the Damned ended up spawning multiple drafts, and some of those drafts inspired later works like Kurayami Dance and Black Knight Sword. Did any ideas from those drafts end up inspiring Romeo Is A Dead Man?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Nothing from Shadows of the Damned, no. All the different drafts that got made for Shadows of the Damned either just got trashed, or got canned, or turned into something else. But none of them had anything to do with Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – The last few games from Grasshopper Manufacturer almost feel like Avengers movies with how many returning characters there are. You’ve brought back characters from Let it Die, Killer 7, Shadows of the Damned, and even your short story ‘Aka to Ao to Midori to’.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Woah, haha. You did thorough research!</p>
<p><strong>TSA – &nbsp;For Romeo Is a Dead Man, did you have any characters you’ve wanted to bring back, but couldn’t?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Actually, yeah: Fleming from Shadows of the Damned. I believe it was the seventh draft, maybe, that I had him actually appear as one of the bosses in the game. It’s really unfortunate, but things changed and he ended up not being able to make it. It’s a shame.</p>
<p>I actually wanted to put Fleming in No More Heroes 3, as well. That also, as you know, ended up not working out. But in my mind, Fleming is this character that I want to have battle all these other characters in my other games and stuff. I just really don’t want him to be a one-off thing – I want to use him again, you know?</p>
<p>And this is just, like, talking out of my ass here, but if someday, like 20 years from now or something, if we end up doing like a remake of No More Heroes 3, then I’m hoping to be able to kind of shoehorn him in there.</p>
<p>But I really do want to see him head into battle against a lot of the other characters that I make. Actually, for both Romeo Is a Dead Man and No More Heroes 3, it got so far, to the point where I actually wrote the scenario with Fleming in it – both with Romeo and with Travis in the two different games. Again, unfortunately, it just ended up not working out, so, what are you going to do? But it wasn’t just kind of like a one-off idea that I had and said ‘oh no, never mind.’ I actually did put the effort into it.</p>
<div id="attachment_468409"><p id="caption-attachment-468409">Fleming from Shadows of the Damned never quite made it into later games.</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – What was the reason for Fleming not making it, in that case? Was it kind of just that creatively the draft and your vision for the game went in a different direction where it didn’t make sense to have him there for Romeo Is A Dead Man? Or was it some sort of outside reason?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> It’s actually a really simple reason, to be honest. Just scheduling reasons. We have to deal with both scheduling, and someone’s got to pay for this stuff too. When it came down to it, we were like, ‘Okay, we’re gonna end up going way over schedule on this. We have to tweak some stuff, we’re gonna have to cut some stuff.’</p>
<p>And honestly, just one of the parts that happened to be easiest to cut without screwing up other parts of the game would have been the Fleming part. So he got cut because of that.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – You’ve regularly collaborated with surprising multimedia artists for your games, like Boneface for Travis Strikes Again or AC-BU for the Velvet Chair Girl scenes in No More Heroes 3. How do you decide when to bring in outside artists like this to collab with, and how do you pick them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> It really just comes down to the artist, and the art they make, and whether I dig it, and whether I feel like it’d be something that would be a good fit. For example, Boneface, I’ve been aware of his art, I’ve seen it online and in different places and just thought it looked really cool, and reached out and said ‘Hey, would you like to maybe do something with us for this game series that I got going here?’</p>
<p>For AC-BU, I happen to know a guy who had connections with them, and went through with the director named Mizuno and ended up being able to talk to them directly and show them what we were trying to do and the kind of thing we were trying to achieve. And, also, I’ve seen the stuff that they’ve done before, and just thought it was really cool and thought ‘okay, considering what it is we’re trying to achieve now, considering the stuff that these people are obviously able to do – I think this would be a pretty good fit, so let’s try and work it out.’</p>
<p>Sometimes, it’ll be that somebody introduces me to these people and I’ll check their stuff out and be like ‘Oh, yeah, that’s somebody I’d like to work with.’ And sometimes it’ll be somebody that I’ve kind of found on my own and just kind of reached out to on my own and been like ‘Oh, hey, this is who I am. You want to work together?’</p>
<p>But yeah, as far as how I choose the different artists to work with and why? It’s pretty much sort of a case-by-case.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Are there any artists you’d like to collaborate with for the next Grasshopper Manufacture game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> I don’t really have a concrete idea yet for ‘This is the person I want to work with for our next game!’ or ‘This is exactly what our next game is going to be!’. But we do have a couple projects that we’re sort of <em>not</em> working on, as in actually developing, but planning and fleshing out the ideas for and everything. We have a couple of those in the works and I do have a couple ideas for those. Like if we really are going to do this project, then <em>this </em>is somebody that I’d like to work with for this particular one.</p>
<p>Actually, there is one guy that I just thought of who I’d like to work with a little more, in a much more full capacity, you could say. He’s a manga artist name Asano Inio, he did the art for Midori Midorikawa and Kamui in No More Heroes 3. Not only did I really like the art that he did for that game, but I’ve seen the manga he does, I’ve seen the art he does before, and I think it’s awesome.</p>

<p>Instead of just having him be sort of like a guest artist or guest creator on a game, I’d really like to get into a whole game with this guy, do like an actual collaboration where instead of just doing one or two characters, this is the guy who’s doing a whole lot more art for the game. I’d love to do some sort of collaboration with him at some point.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Oh, I’m a big fan of that author. He did that manga, Dead Dead Demon’s Dededede Destruction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Yeah! That one! Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – One of my favorite games of yours is Let It Die, and it’s also the only console game you’ve worked on with online interactions, where you send NPC hunters from your game to other player’s worlds to hunt them. Is there a reason you haven’t returned to that online style for your games since?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> To be honest, as far as Let It Die goes, it’s known to be a Grasshopper Manufacture game, but I don’t really consider that to be the case.</p>
<p>Technically, I did participate, and some of us did participate in development, but it was a GungHo game, basically. And, you know, the online stuff is because GungHo is basically an online game company.</p>
<p>I consider Let It Die to be, not necessarily a Grasshopper Manufacture game, but a Supertrick Games game. They’re the ones who did most development. So yeah, the online elements aren’t exactly our thing, that’s much more of a GungHo thing. Nothing wrong with that – it’s just not really something that we’re into, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Well now I feel embarrassed for saying it’s one of my favorites from you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Don’t worry, it’s cool, technically we were involved in the development and stuff! So it’s not wrong, don’t worry about it.</p>

<p><strong>TSA – Well, <em>another</em> one of my favorites from Grasshopper Manufacture is Travis Strikes Again, and it felt like an incredibly personal video game, where so many of the stories and characters seemed to be reflections of your own history in the world of game development. Did you face any challenges making that game and writing it the way you did?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> For Travis Strikes Again, I wouldn’t say that it was hard or difficult to write the characters and write them the way that I did. It definitely felt different than the way it usually does to write characters. […]
</p><p>Travis Strikes Again was actually done around the 20th anniversary of Grasshopper Manufacture being established, so we wanted to do something special for that, and we got a lot of leeway from companies – for example at Capcom, they were like ‘OK, well seeing as how it’s their 20th anniversary and stuff, you can use stuff from Killer 7,’ and things like this.</p>
<p>I did include a lot of characters that, for most players, probably seemed to be new characters, and a lot of familiar characters from previous games. But the thing is, a lot of the characters that people hadn’t seen before, they weren’t made necessarily for Travis Strikes Again – they were characters that I’d come up with either for other games that ended up not making it into that game, […] or the game itself ended up getting canned for some reason, or just ended up never coming to fruition.</p>

<p>So a lot of the story and the characters that I wrote for Travis Strikes Again, it was almost an elegy to these characters who, you know, they… not necessarily died. I mean, most of them in the game died, but you know, they were kind of stuck in this limbo. By finally being able to get them out there and put them in the game, I was kind of trying to help them to finally just ascend and finally move on, you know what I mean? And not just for the characters, but for myself as well.</p>
<p>So, I did put a lot of my older ideas and past ideas and characters into the game. Again, that was also partly because it was for the 20th anniversary of Grasshopper. I personally wanted to do something special for this game. That’s why you see so many things that kind of feel like they come out of left field. Sometimes they feel a little bit more natural, but they’re clearly, you know, ‘Oh this is this guy from that other game!’</p>
<p>And again, a lot of the stuff that people assumed were new were actually, you know, they may have showed up, or almost showed up in 1, 2, 3, 4 past games, but ended up not. So, yeah, Travis Strikes Again, it was a big sort of jumble of these characters, and me not only trying to help these characters kind of move on and finally, you know, get what I felt they deserved, but also sort of letting myself kind of let them go. Finally being able to say, okay, I was finally able to put them out there. I’ve done for them what I can have done for them, what I owe them. This is their elegy.</p>
<p>That’s kind of what Travis Strikes Again was like writing, for me.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I know batting centers are important to you, so important you made sure to include one in The Silver Case. When you’re travelling abroad for work, is there a place you go to that feels like the overseas version of going to the batting center to be alone with your thoughts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] Yeah, I’m kind of too scared to like, actually go out on my own when I’m overseas to like, find a place where I can just kind of be alone with my thoughts and stuff. That would mean that I have to go out all by myself like a big boy and, you know, find some place to chill and everything. And I can’t really do that.</p>
<p>So, I’d probably say my hotel room. [laughs] I guess that would be my overseas batting center.</p>
<div id="attachment_333568"><p id="caption-attachment-333568">Uh, here’s a screenshot from RBI Baseball 19, which we have handy…</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – I also know that bars and beer have been important to you for a long time, no matter where you are in the world. What is it about drinking at ‘bar plastic model’ in Golden Gai, hunting for Blue Moon when you’re overseas, and going to your old “third meeting room” Motsuyaki Kawakami that you enjoy the most?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interpreter</strong> <strong>–</strong> I mean, have you had beer before?</p>
<p><strong>TSA – [Laughs] I have had beer before. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Have you been to ‘bar plastic model’ before?</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Yeah actually, I was in Japan two years ago and went!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong>&nbsp; To me, it’s kind of like a present to myself, kind of like a reward to myself. I don’t know how people outside of Japan feel about this, but to a lot of Japanese people, that’s kind of what having a beer after work is. So you finished a day, a long day of hard work, and ‘OK, I’m going to reward myself with beer.’ You know?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during Corona I just kind of stopped drinking that much and kind of stopped being able to. Partly because I stopped being able to go out to drink so much, I also stopped being able to drink so much at all. […] I get wasted a lot easier than I used to. So instead of staying out having a bunch of drinks, yeah, usually I just keep it to like one beer or so and that’s enough. I’m like ‘OK, yeah, that was some good work I did today. Just pound one back and that’s cool.’</p>
<p><strong>TSA – I can tell you’re a big fan of beer because you called it Corona instead of Covid.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> [Laughs] that’s just what it’s called in Japan, but that’s a good one!</p>
<p><strong>TSA – What haven’t I asked that you would like to talk about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Hmmmm, I’m not sure. Let’s see… have you beaten the game yet?</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Not yet! I’m on the second boss right now.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Ahhh, okay. When you beat it, there’s gonna be a lot of questions you want to ask, and a lot of things i want to talk about. So let’s save those, and after you beat it let’s talk again.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Alright, I’ll beat it, and we’ll talk about that, and we’ll talk about Char’s Counterattack. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Oh, have you seen GQuuuuuuX? [Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX]
</p><div id="attachment_468407"><p id="caption-attachment-468407">Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</p></div>
<p><strong>TSA – Oh, I <em>loved</em> GQuuuuuuX. </strong><strong>I have the model kit for the GFreD mobile suit!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> Oh. Nice, nice. I was waiting for ‘How much influence did GQuuuuuuX have on Romeo Is a Dead Man?’ – that’s one question that I was hoping you’d ask.</p>
<p><strong>TSA – Well, I definitely wanted to talk about anime. I’d love to know what you thought about GQuuuuuuX, being such a big fan of the original Char story. Did you like GQuuuuuuX?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda51 –</strong> There’s one part of the game where it’s really clear that this part was really, really inspired heavily by GQuuuuuuX. So, yeah, once you’ve cleared the game, once you got to that part, let’s talk about that again!</p>

		<p>Revisiting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/super-mario-bros-wonder-review/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> in 2026 is an experience as full of delights and surprises as it was in 2023. NIntendo absolutely knocked it out of the park with their trippy, transformative levels that just brought so much playfulness back to the 2D platformer… but that was paired with a fairly by-the-numbers multiplayer.</p>
<p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> + Meetup in Bellabel Park improves on this in some ways, but sticks to that classic Nintendo stubbornness in others.</p>
<p><iframe title="More fun is coming to the Flower Kingdom March 26th! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LgNT3oIw6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Meetup in Bellabel Park is all in on multiplayer shenanigans, with multiple areas devoted to different ways to play. Local multiplayer is still the only way to actually share a level together, while any kind of online multiplayer turns everyone into ghosts, so you’re not really playing together. The sneaky way out of this tangle is that Switch 2 has GameShare to let you stream the game to another console, which can be local or via online GameChat. It’s not the same as native online multiplayer (the resolution is lower and there’s a big info bar shrinking the screen), but it will have to do.</p>


<p>So, that’s how you can play the new Local Multiplayer Plaza with people outside of your postcode, but what is it? There’s 17 different stages here, with some co-operative and others competitive, all for up to four players, and all putting a much more inventive spin on the core 2D plaforming.</p>
<p>Phanto Tag takes Prop Hunt and the classic game of Tag and puts them in a blender, as masked players need to track, chase and catch the others within a single screen arena. They can run, of course, but they will also need to hide by disguising themselves as items and props, trying to make use of the shifting objects and shading of the screen. It’s a good bit of competitive fun.</p>
<p>On the complete opposite end of the scale, another stage invokes the spirit of the Wii U Gamepad and New Super Mario Bros. U, tasking some players with drawing donut block platforms across the screen so that others can make it through the level, and also using them to solve puzzles. It’s a great use of the returning idea, not least because you can use the Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode to draw the platforms.</p>

<p>Then there’s Bob-omb Relay, where you need to throw the bomb back and forth when prompted, but also have to get it into the correct player’s hands, or you could each be trying to feed your own Baby Yoshi the apples that spawn all over the screen through a level, while having to deal with the Baby Yoshi getting bigger and fatter and slowing you down.</p>
<p>After sampling a couple of those levels, we then ran around the Bellabel hub to reach the Game Room Plaza, and the six attractions for up to 12 players online (or up to 8 players with local wireless). These take a simple ideas and Wonder Flower effects, like riding on a Propeller Flower or hanging onto a giant bouncy ball, and spin them into competitive modes where you’ll race as ghosts through to the finish. They’re simple fun, but deceptively so. Bouncing the ball and needing to hit the right angled surfaces to bounce yourself forward faster, and avoid the back-tilted ones that would sap all your momentum is something I didn’t quite master, but the shmup-like obstacle dodging of the Propeller Flower races? I was pretty good at those!</p>

<p>There’s more to this expansion and update that we didn’t delve into, such as the Co-Star Luma, using the Assist modes, or how the Koopalings have sprinkled new challenges through the Flower Kingdom of the main game, but if you were wanting just a little bit more spark to the multiplayer of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, then you might want to schedule your meetup… in Bellabel Park.</p>

		<p>It’s easy to think of Nintendo as this unstoppable family-friendly gaming juggernaut, given their most recent track record, but for every golden patch, there’s been struggles and ill-fated projects. The Wii U is the most recent example, and beloved as the GameCube is, it still ended up in third place in its generation. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/virtual-boy">Virtual Boy</a>, though, was on a whole other level, a critical and commercial flop that barely lasted a year.</p>
<p>Perfect, then, for a revival within the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a> + Expansion Pack game library for both Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, with a pricey plastic recreation (or cardboard equivalent) needed in order to play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics – Introducing games and features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QvskekdB9t4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Virtual Boy accessory looks utterly authentic to the original –&nbsp;having only ever been released in Japan and the Americas, it’s sadly not a console I’ve seen in the flesh. It’s a chunky plastic red and black visor mounted onto a pair of angled legs at a fixed height. Where the original had a bespoke red LED display that sought to balance cost, price and usability, that’s now substituted out for a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 to provide the screen, which is then passed through lenses and a red light filter to recreate the original’s stereoscopic effect. The cardboard edition will likely have a lot in common with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/11/labo-vr-is-the-most-creative-use-of-virtual-reality-yet/">the Labo VR kit</a>, from Nintendo’s 2019 cardboard experiments.</p>
<div id="attachment_468403"><p id="caption-attachment-468403">The original Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED and Switch 2 can all be used to provide the screen for the Virtual Boy accessory.</p>
</div>
<p>While we’re much more familiar with VR headsets since 2016, with evangelists for the tech still happily strapping screens to their heads for the latest experiences (or just more Beat Saber), the mid-90s were much, much more cautious. There’s the spectre of eye-strain and headaches that have stuck in the Virtual Boy’s legacy, but I wonder how much of that was down to the way you have to use the headset.</p>
<p>It comes with a set of fixed legs to position the Virtual Boy on a table, and you then have to place your face into the headset. You can’t adjust the height of the headset, though, only tilt it back and forth, so for me that meant leaning forward and arching my back to view inside, which is bound to give you a bad back after too long playing like this. I know I’d be stacking this on boxes and thick textbooks if playing at home. Why didn’t Nintendo take this opportunity to fix this?</p>
<div id="attachment_468398"><p id="caption-attachment-468398">I wish I’d brought a stack of books to preview the Virtual Boy accessory.</p></div>
<p>The other issue is that this means your view is constantly moving when using it, and through the lenses, that can lead to shifting focus and sharpness through the lenses. A big part of modern VR is getting the headset mounted in the sweet spot and then having it stay there, and this can’t manage the same.</p>
<p>All of the Virtual Boy games will be wrapped up in the familiar Switch Online classic game library interface and features, though these are all rendered in red and black, just like the games themselves. You can pause the game at any time to check the controls, set a new suspend point, swap back and forth between games at will – it’s just a solid and to the point emulation wrapper at this point.</p>
<div id="attachment_468399"><p id="caption-attachment-468399">Virtual Boy Wario Land has some nicely layered environments and pioneered the multi-plane 2D platformer trope.</p></div>
<p>So what of the games? Naturally the Virtual Boy’s library is rather small, and seven of these games will appear on day one. Virtual Boy Wario Land is immediately the main attraction, launching a year after his Game Boy game and giving a similar feeling platforming experience. Wario is more brutish in his actions, charging into enemies and slamming into breakable objects, and the levels are more open-ended here as you explore an underground cave. What’s rather nice is the 3D depth to the parallax effect, and I was surprised at how smoothly things could move along the Z-axis of my view. Things like spiked balls swinging in and out of the screen, which you need to dodge with Wario. It’s pretty neat and likely the first game most people will play.</p>
<p>I also gave a few other games a quick go, including Teleroboxer. It’s a fairly straightforward Punch Out! style game, though pitting you against robot boxers, made of layered parallax elements, giving a simple but effective 3D depth as the fists come out towards you. Galactic Pinball, meanwhile, is exactly what you expect from a pinball game, but it’s in a low resolution 3D, making the distant parts of the table feel really rather distant and with a ball that moves rather slowly.</p>
<div id="attachment_468402"><p id="caption-attachment-468402">Teleroboxer layers sprites to create your robotic adversaries.</p></div>
<p>The last title I dipped into with my hands on time was Red Alarm, a 3D rail shooter in the vein of Star Fox, but with a wire-frame 3D instead of shaded surfaces (which would be very difficult to manage with a monochrome screen). The additional quirk was a lack of occlusion, so you can see enemies clearly through the obstacles and walls you fly past.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Virtual Boy library will also feature 3D Tetris, Golf and the formerly Japan exclusive The Mansion of Innsmouth, coming to the West for the first time. A further nine games are then set to release through the rest of 2026, including the previously unreleased titles D-Hopper and Zero Racers. There’s also the upcoming feature to switch from red-only pixel art and change the graphics colour to yellow, green, white and potentially other colours. I really think that an off-white might end up being the best visual colour, balancing brightness with the clarity of a Game Boy Pocket (which was able to do away with the green tint of the original Game Boy screen). I’m also rather curious to see whether the Switch OLED provides a better screen for the Virtual Boy accessory than the LCD-based Switch 2.</p>
<div id="attachment_468401"><p id="caption-attachment-468401">This sure is a pinball game, and it looks 3D…</p></div>
<p>The Virtual Boy accessory and library of games coming to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is both great to see and pretty baffling. It’s great to see Nintendo revisit such a fleeting console and revive and preserve another facet of their legacy like this, but it’s baffling that they haven’t made an effort to tweak the design even slightly to make it more adjustable and comfortable. And it also just leaves me wondering, why didn’t they port these games to Nintendo 3DS? Surely that</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/so-far-super-mario-bros-wonder-on-switch-2-isnt-making-a-great-case-for-itself</link>
            <guid>1423888</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="e0fbf79984e66"><a title="Bellabel Park 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0fbf79984e66/bellabel-park-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> launched in 2023, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief. Finally, after a deluge of perfectly serviceable yet uninspiring ‘<strong>New</strong>’ entries, it felt like 2D Mario had gotten its mojo back. Fast-forward to 2026 and Wonder is making its grand return with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> on <strong>26th March</strong>, but after recently going hands-on with the multiplayer segment, I have to admit that it’s yet to conjure up any excitement within me.</p>
<p>I should caveat this immediately by clarifying that I’m not the biggest fan of multiplayer games in the first place. I’m at my happiest when I’m able to just block out the real world and get lost in a game with no outside distractions, so do keep that in mind when reading my thoughts. If you <em>are</em> partial to some multiplayer mayhem, then you may well feel that the ‘Meetup at Bellabel Park’ additions are worth it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2eb2168b1edbf"><a title="Bellabel Park 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2eb2168b1edbf/bellabel-park-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My session consisted of one co-op mode and three PvP modes (or 'attractions', as the game calls them). The first makes use of the Switch 2’s Mouse Mode, with two players directly controlling characters, and two more creating Donut Blocks on the fly to allow passage across wide gaps and directly manipulate the trajectory of enemy attacks. It was… fine. It kind of hints towards some of the potential for a <strong>Mario Maker</strong> game that utilises mouse controls, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>In practice, having two players create Donut Blocks at the same time makes for a pretty messy, confusing experience, since you’re constantly at odds with one another regarding where to actually place the blocks. In addition, if you accidentally move vertically when placing your blocks, you might find yourself completely blocking the way forward for your player-controlled companions. In this instance, you’ll need to make some more blocks in a random corner of the screen in order to cause your previous creations to eventually disappear. As I said, it's very messy.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e48af1b58e1e6"><a title="Bellabel Park 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e48af1b58e1e6/bellabel-park-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two of the three PvP modes were racers, with one seeing you speed through the air on a flying vehicle, and the other rolling everybody up into balls and subsequently using physics to bounce you across the map. They last for about a minute at a time, tops, and although there’s a brief thrill in witnessing a photo finish and seeing who comes out on top via the results page, it’s all pretty forgettable stuff. I struggle to imagine many people jumping into these modes more than a handful of times.</p>
<p>And finally, the last PvP mode I played was essentially a game of hide and seek. Three players jump into Lakitu Clouds and fly around. When you press ‘A’, you can make your character invisible, effectively blending your Lakitu Cloud with dozens of others dotted around the screen. The person who’s ‘it’ will then try to find you, shooting out puffs of magic to help reveal your location. If you’re caught, you become ‘it’ – simple. The aim of the game is to remain hidden until the time runs out, so there's a frantic rush within the last 20 seconds or so to stay out of reach.</p>
<p>It’s a laugh, but again, if I mentally take myself away from the highly curated environment in which I tested these modes out, am I really going to bother with these in the comfort of my own home? Honestly, probably not.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2f03af36c9c71"><a title="Bellabel Park 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f03af36c9c71/bellabel-park-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might think differently, but all of the modes felt like minigames you might play in a <strong>Mario Party</strong> title. Taken within that context, they could be a lot of fun, but as standalone games that you have to consciously choose from the Bellabel Park overworld, they lack substance and feel throwaway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m struggling to find much of a reason to splash out on the <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> Upgrade Pack for Mario Wonder so far. I did take note of just how sharp, clean, and vibrant the visuals were in the Switch 2 Edition, so that <em>might</em> be just enough to convince me to make a leap. But if the multiplayer modes were meant to tempt me into a purchase, I’m afraid they’ve largely failed in their task.</p>
<p>There's definitely more to the Switch 2 Edition, including challenges via the Toad Brigade, the return of The Koopalings, an Assist mode — something which should help with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-my-daughter-made-me-realise-that-mario-wonders-difficulty-options-need-work">an issue I encountered with my daughter</a> in the base game — and of course, playable Rosalina. Though whether these features warrant an upgrade remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As an aside, I also had a chance to briefly check out the upcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR4W3e-_3zs">Talking Flower</a>, uh... toy? Yeah, let's go with toy. It honestly wasn't the best environment in which to test it out; I really had to strain to hear what it was saying. Regardless, it's a fine little thing if you're after a charming little accessory for your office desk.</p>
<p>Sorry... what do you mean it's meant for kids? Don't be silly.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Offloads 45W Nano USB-C Wall Charger at Record Low on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-offloads-45w-nano-usb-c-wall-charger-at-record-low-on-amazon-2000665169</link>
            <guid>1423864</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Anker Nano USB-C Wall Charger takes a regular single-port brick and transforms it into a 45-watt USB-C fast charger that has brains and flexibility. It provides sufficient power to rapidly charge recent iPhone models, compatible iPads, and a large number of other USB-C devices, and it features a front display that shows you exactly what is happening while your equipment is charging. The very compact body makes it easy to place the charger on a strip with multiple other chargers or to toss it into a bag. Additionally, the folding plug rotates, so it will sit neatly even in an odd-shaped outlet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7012/">You can head to Amazon and grab the Anker Nano USB-C Wall Charger for just $30, reduced from $40.</a> That represents a savings of $10 and 25% off the original retail price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7012/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A fast-charging wall unit that’ll get all your devices to 100%</h2>
<p>The Anker Nano’s output adjusts the power provided as your battery level changes. When a supported phone is low, the charger delivers as much energy as possible to quickly get you out of the red zone, and once it’s nearly fully charged, it slows power delivery to prevent overheating.</p>
<p>The smart display is located on the front of the charger and converts the charging process from a mysterious activity into one you can easily see. A single tap displays real-time power usage and general status; a double tap alternates between modes; and a long press turns the display around when the charger is attached to a strip or wall outlet, so it can be viewed when it’s plugged in upside-down. The display will also automatically shut off after a brief period of non-use, so it won’t disturb you as you sleep.</p>



<p>While Care Mode is engaged, the charging profile is modified to keep the adapter and phone at a lower temperature than a standard high-output 45W brick would. This is particularly beneficial for those who plan to charge their phones overnight on a nightstand. Over time, gentle charging can help maintain long-term battery health. Having this logic built directly into the wall charger itself eliminates the need to manually toggle through individual application settings to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Design and compatibility complete the charger. Both prongs on the charger fold into the housing for travel and can be rotated, allowing them to fit tightly in outlets without blocking nearby sockets. A single USB-C port is located on the top of the charger, keeping the design simple. Also, the Nano supports charging of both iPhone and iPad models, Samsung phones, and many other types of USB-C devices. Included in the package are the 45-watt smart display wall charger and a welcome guide. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7012/">At $30 on sale, down from the usual $40, it’s an easy upgrade over a basic slow cube.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Map Conditions are a crucial aspect of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as each one can shift how you engage with your next raid. Some might encourage you to fight an elite ARC enemy, like the Queen or Matriarch, whilst others lock off certain POIs until you open them.</p>



<p>It’s not just for fun, though, as some Conditions can offer better—or sometimes exclusive—loot. However, you can’t jump into these various Map Conditions whenever you’d like, as they’re on a strict schedule, meaning you’ll need to plan your raids accordingly.</p>







<p>If you’re looking to play a specific Map Condition in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pve-mode/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pve-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, then look no further, as Insider Gaming has all of the timings for each one listed below.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-arc-raiders-map-conditions">All ARC Raiders Map Conditions</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You can’t fight it all the time. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are currently 10 Map Conditions in rotation for ARC Raiders, and these are split into two categories: Minor and Major Map Conditions.</strong></p>



<p>Each Map Condition has its own unique gimmicks that change up gameplay, and Embark Studios is regularly adding new ones or altering pre-existing ones. Additionally, some are exclusive to certain maps, as they’re dependent on the setting; for example, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bird City</a> is exclusive to Buried City, meaning you’ll only find the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-rubber-ducks-in-arc-raiders-how-to-find-all-rubber-ducks/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-rubber-ducks-in-arc-raiders-how-to-find-all-rubber-ducks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare Rubber Ducks</a> when that Minor Map Condition is in rotation.</p>



<p>Here’s the list of every ARC Raiders Minor Map Condition currently in rotation:</p>



<ul>
<li>Uncovered Caches</li>



<li>Husk Graveyard</li>



<li>Matriarch</li>



<li>Launch Tower Loot</li>



<li>Harvester</li>



<li>Bird City</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the list of every ARC Raiders Major Map Condition currently in rotation:</p>



<ul>
<li>Night Raid</li>



<li>Electromagnetic Storm</li>



<li>Hidden Bunker</li>



<li>Locked Gate</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-every-map-event-schedule-in-arc-raiders">Every Map Event Schedule In ARC Raiders</h2>



<p><strong>The ARC Raiders Map Conditions run on a regular schedule, with each map rotating every hour. </strong></p>



<p>Every Map Condition runs for an hour at a time, and once the timer’s up, a new Event will take its place. However, not every map has an Event always running, and there are often downtime periods. It encourages experiencing different maps and working with different strategies, but you’ll need to plan ahead if you’re hoping to play during a specific one.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has the entire ARC Raiders Map Condition schedule listed below, but it’s according to the Pacific time zone. If you live in another time zone, be sure to alter the timings according to the time zone converter below:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Time Zone Converted</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">PT+2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">PT+3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">PT+8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">PT-3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">PT-5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Events Return After Blip Removes Them From The Game]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last night, ARC Raiders players were busying themselves with querying the <strong>disappearance of events </strong>in ARC Raiders. In social circles worldwide, fans of the extraction adventure were asking why there were no ARC Raiders events live, given that they’re a persistent feature that rotate non-stop, keeping things fresh for players.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s Discord server, it was confirmed that an ‘issue with the map conditions schedule’ has been resolved and that events are <strong>back in rotation</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-events-are-back-and-bird-city-has-changed">ARC Raiders Events Are Back, and Bird City Has Changed</h2>



<p>In a post on the ARC Raiders Discord server, the community team confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last night there was an issue with the map conditions schedule. We just pushed an update enabling this week’s schedule while also increasing the frequency of Bird City. No download required, but please restart your game to update. We will keep revising and try to find a schedule for all conditions so that all time zones get a chance to play.</p>



<p>There is no store rotation or patch this week, but keep an eye out for the update coming next week.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That statement refers to the disappointment from fans regarding the rotation for Bird City, a minor map condition introduced in the most recent update. It had an awkward schedule, prompting some to stress that ‘those with jobs’ couldn’t access it.</p>



<p>For several hours last night, ARC Raiders events disappeared from the game, leaving a blank map palette that offered no special conditions under which to explore Embark Studios’ extraction title. That meant no Harvester, no Hidden Bunker, and no Electromagnetic Storm, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Fans began to panic, thinking it was an indication of something awful happening at Embark Studios, but it was little more than a momentary blip that was rectified by the team.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is High on Life 2 on Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/high-on-life-2-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1423852</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new foul-mouthed shooter is on the horizon with the release of High on Life 2, and, like with any release, there is discussions about whether the game is available on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>The action-adventure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shooter</a> from Squanch Games releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-s/">S</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/high-on-life-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 13</a>, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch later down the line.</p>



<p>If you’re an Xbox player and want to know if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> is included with your Game Pass subscription, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-high-on-life-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Is High on Life 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Landing zone. Image via Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, High on Life 2 is included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription and will be playable on day one when it launches on February 13.</strong></p>



<p>The approach is not a surprise, as a similar launch was taken with the original game, and means those with a subscription to Game Pass won’t have to splash out to purchase High on Life 2 outright.</p>



<p>However, following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes made to the Game Pass service</a> last year, the availability of High on Life 2 depends on which tier of subscription you are signed up to.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-game-pass-subscription-tier-is-needed-for-high-on-life-2">What Game Pass Subscription Tier is Needed For High on Life 2?</h2>



<p><strong>A Game Pass Ultimate</strong> <strong>subscription is required to jump into High on Life 2 on Xbox Series X|S or PC without purchasing the game separately.</strong></p>



<p>The Ultimate subscription is the only way to obtain day one releases on Xbox Game Pass following Microsoft’s changes in 2025, though the Game Pass Premium tier adds new games within 12 months of their launch.</p>



<p>Neither the standard PC Game Pass nor Xbox Game Pass Essentials provides access to High on Life 2, so Ultimate is the only choice if you want to play immediately at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-edition-of-high-on-life-2-is-included-with-xbox-game-pass">What Edition of High on Life 2 is Included With Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription provides access to the Standard Edition of High on Life 2, with no advertised bonuses.</strong></p>



<p>High on Life 2 does have a pre-order bundle available, providing the ‘I PRE-ORDERED HIGH ON LIFE 2’ hat for select weapons, and, while it provides no benefits, Squanch Games says “if you don’t pre-order, you’ll never be allowed to have it.”</p>



<p>As this is merely a cosmetic bonus, there isn’t much need to splash out, unless you really want to, and the Standard Edition that comes with a Game Pass subscription is sufficient.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">For Stardew Valley's 10th anniversary, we didn't just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">speak to creator Eric Barone (ConcernedApe)</a> about the game's present and future. We also went out into the community to find out how Stardew Valley has changed the lives of its players, from everyday fans to popular content creators. Here, we've shared three stories – from a music farm creator, a speedrunner, and a mod maker – on how Stardew Valley impacted them. And we've interspersed those with testimonials from fans whose experiences with Stardew Valley have helped them overcome personal challenges, work through grief, and connect with loved ones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responses have been very lightly edited for length and clarity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"Over the past 10 years [my wife and I] have played [Stardew Valley] off and on, on our own farms and together once co-op released, and we always come back for more. We're sitting on well over 1,000 hours of combined playtime. We love everything about the game – the music, the characters, all of the creatures and animals and crops, and most of all the story. There is so much heart and reality packed into this game. For my wife and I it's what we turn to for comfort, for joy, and for nostalgia... I have bought this game as a gift at least a dozen times, and will continue to do so. We have played together four-player with my best friend and his wife and we're all nearing 40. I have given it to coworkers and friends and family. We have the cookbook and the board game and a dozen shirts. Stardew Valley is so important to us." -</em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qb8pty/comment/nz94x84/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>u/SPECPOL</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"It's a comfort I can always fall back on during hard times.

Even though it has some adult storylines in it, I knew they would go completely over their heads. We played together in the living room, everyone on their own device, but chatting all the while about how our melons were coming in or how annoying Clint was being. I named all of my chickens after my daughter’s classmates, and all of my cows after my son’s. It faded after a while, but came back with a roar after we took ourselves to Symphony of the Seasons when it came through town last year. They are teenagers now. We all started playing again and doing three-part harmonies around the house of the best songs. (I like to do the baselines: bleep blop- bleep bleep blop.) It’s our special fun thing. None of their friends are into it and they usually tell me that they can’t imagine sharing it with anyone besides us." -</em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qb8pty/comment/nza1ujc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>u/Sad_Hovercraft_1367</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"It's basically what has kept me sane throughout cancer treatment!

Her job had been deemed inessential, and she was out of work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With her free time, she turned to Stardew Valley. Her husband saw her playing more, and suggested she try streaming it. At first, Malblueeyes wasn't so sure she wanted to. But then one day, she just went live. She didn't even tell him she was doing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This was never a thing that was planned," she says. "It was a thing that at the time I needed something to make me feel like I had a purpose."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Malblueeyes had loved Stardew for years, having played since 2017. It was very different from anything she'd played prior, and was her first true resource management/sim game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were just so many moments where I was just sitting back going, 'My God, I'm having a lot of fun and I'm not terrified.' And so, I just, how could you not love a game that is as difficult as you make it?"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On stream, Malblueeyes started just playing casually. Later, to focus her streams a bit more, she began to do "Challenge Farms," or farms where you try to achieve certain goals under very limited conditions, such as only growing one crop or only raising animals. She began to pick up a following on Twitch. While a lot of her audience just seemed to be there for good vibes, she says that a large number of people were first-time players, asking questions on how she was accomplishing certain things in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you're a Twitch streamer, you feel that pressure to know stuff," she says. "And I figured out very quickly, even with the 1,200 hours of Stardew I had on my Xbox, that there was a lot to Stardew I didn't know. And so, I started developing these challenge farms that would force me to confront aspects of Stardew that I was otherwise unfamiliar with or just didn't really interact with unless I had to. So, like unlocking the Joja Warehouse, that's become a staple in my challenge farms because I had never done it before and shockingly enough, a lot of Stardew players don't, they refuse. And so, one of the best ways I've discovered is to allow people to vicariously experience that through my challenge farms. They don't have to unlock Joja, but they can at least see what it's like to unlock Joja."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Malblueeyes' first challenge farms was called "Floja," where she unlocked Joja only raising money by growing flowers — an activity she hadn't really engaged with in Stardew Valley before. She had a great time, and kept doing different challenge runs. Until one day, she was struck with a different idea.</p><p>Oh, it was so bad. It was awful. But at that time, it was like the coolest thing I had ever done.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was sitting and I was watching one of my friends streaming one night trying to think of challenge farms and it was somebody's birthday in her chat and I was just tootling around and I thought, 'Oh, you know what would be fun? Making a happy birthday farm, that would be fun to make a happy birthday farm.' So anytime someone's in chat and they say it's your birthday, it's my birthday. You just go on the farm and you have a little party set up. And then I thought, 'Okay, but what other than just a table and flowers, what's really going to set this farm apart?' And that's when I thought of the flute blocks. That's how that started."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley includes "Flute Blocks," blocks that are placeable out in the world that play a selected note when a character walks past them. By combining strings of these, players can design little melodies that will play as they walk. Malblueeyes wanted to make one of these for the Happy Birthday song, but she self-admittedly isn't a musician. She can read music, but can't identify notes by ear. So she went hunting for assistance online, trying to figure out what note she should even start on. It was then that she discovered Music Farms: farms dedicated solely to playing elaborate tunes by walking through flute block mazes that often span the entire map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I took the happy birthday farm and I balled it up and I threw it away, because who wants Happy Birthday when I can do something even bigger? And I spent 12 hours doing He's a Pirate. That was my very first music farm was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRh-dzrI4Z4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>He's a Pirate from the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack</u></a> and I was so proud of it. And when I look back on it now, oh, it was terrible. Oh, it was so bad. It was awful. But at that time, it was like the coolest thing I had ever done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With some encouragement from friends, Malblueeyes showed the Music Farm to her audience, and everyone loved it. So she started making more. As she improved her skills, she eventually opened up a channel point redemption incentive so her audience members could request songs, and was quickly hit with numerous requests for all sorts of complex songs.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stardew Valley Gameplay Screenshots - 1.6 Update</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"And I would figure out a way to do it," she says. "I would always tell people, 'Give me a week.' Nah, I would sit there for hours after stream and figure it out and make it work. And then the very next stream I would be like, 'Your farm's done. It's done. Let's watch it together.' And people just loved it and I loved it. And I had never felt so vital before in a community."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Malblueeyes took a break from Twitch for nearly two years, during which time she was still making music farms and posting them on TikTok. She couldn't help herself. She started streaming again back in November, and while the break was much-needed, she's glad to be back in the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It makes me happy to make other people happy," she says. "And I don't think that there's anything I've ever done that has ever made people as happy as when they request a music farm and I make it for them. People just, they love it and I love it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"Got me through the stress and isolation of covid.

At the time, I felt overwhelmed by the weight of deciding what to do with my future. I didn't get into my dream program at my dream school, but I did get into a great school and needed to pick a major soon. I was constantly reminded that childhood was about to end, and what happened next could affect the rest of my life.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"Then, I found this cute farming game that reminded me of the hours I spent on Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life, and for the first time, I wasn't worried about my future. I was worried about having the right items prepared for the community center, or guessing which gifts would make my villager friends happy. Then, I read about ConcernedApe's story and how he too began this chapter with a door closed... and he chose to open a window. That set me on a path to pursue game development on my own, and I fell in love with it.

She never even intended to be a streamer when she first went live one New Year's, just as the clock ticked into 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was thanks to the recommendation of a streamer friend that she was inspired to try streaming for the first time, playing Stardew Valley's new-at-the-time 1.5 update. Lichatton had already played Stardew Valley before and even had a file on Year 8, but describes herself at the time as more into League of Legends. Her streams managed to attract a few viewers, and one day, some speedrunners showed up in her stream and suggested she give that a shot. So Lichatton rushed to complete a fish bundle, and loved it so much she started running regularly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Lichatton is the world record holder for reaching Level 50 in the Mines, has over 15,000 Twitch subscribers, and over 8,000 hours in Stardew Valley itself.</p><p>I came back upstairs and I looked at him and I'm like, 'I just got a world record off-stream. Do you think people will be mad at me?'<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I told my husband, I'm like, 'I just need a break. Can you watch the baby? I'm going to go speedrun,'" Lichatton tells me. "And then I came back upstairs and I looked at him and I'm like, 'I just got a world record off-stream. Do you think people will be mad at me?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No one was mad at her. Lichatton says that the community that has formed around Stardew Valley is one of the best things about the game. She's found it especially friendly toward women in a way that other online gaming communities are not, and in speedrunning especially she's seen an increase in the number of women on the leaderboards in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stardew Valley is a very supportive community. I haven't ever had trolls on Twitch or anything like that, because my community usually bashes them. But they talk to each other's communities, so like all of my friends are Haboo's [another record-holding Stardew Valley speedrunner] friends or other people's friends and it's kind of like people bounce around from one place to another."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speedrunning Stardew Valley has changed over the years, particularly with major patch updates, Lichatton explains. Patch 1.6 especially shook things up due to all the content that was added. "I'll give you an example," she says, offering one that admittedly may not make sense if you haven't played Stardew Valley yet but which should click immediately for avid players. "Community Center, before you needed to do a house upgrade for 10,000 gold and 450 wood to be able to get two of the items for one of the bundles, and now you don't need to upgrade your house. So that changes things quite a bit because you need less money.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even the mining has changed a lot, which is kind of where the grinding came from. Because before you would run on previous patches, but then we discovered that you can get a club on level five. So the enemies that you kill give you a chance at a ladder, so that kind of changed everything up and shook it up."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Lichatton is working on what she describes as a "randomizer" of Stardew made by a friend of hers. You choose a letter of the alphabet, and the randomizer gives you an item in the game, and you play to see how fast you can acquire that item in a new file. "We're almost at the end of it. We're on Z. So for Z, she did Zuzu City Express, which is a poster you can get from the crane game in the movie theater."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Future ambitions for Lichatton include working on her times for reaching the 120th level of the Mines. She also wants to eventually do a modded playthrough of the game, as she's never played with mods before despite all the hours she's sunk in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the coolest thing I've been able to do because of this game is, my husband and I got to be on [Summer Games Done Quick] a couple of years ago, and that was a very, very rewarding experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley and speedruns of it have changed Lichatton's day-to-day life significantly. She now has a massive audience, new goals to reach, new friends, and a following she never imagined. But while she loves both speedrunning and streaming, she also just loves Stardew for what it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stardew is just one of those games that always got me through difficult days," she says. "You can have a bad day at work and go home and you're just going to be in a happy Stardew world where you can farm, you can do whatever you want, you can just hang out. It's just one of those games that's always been a part of my life and it's very, very special to me."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"I’ve been playing for a little under two years, but it’s my favourite game in the world. I do go through ruts where I won’t play for a month, then nonstop for hours everyday. I love decorating my house and farm, dating Haley, memorizing everyone’s loved gifts, all while keeping track in a meticulous spreadsheet. It’s also nice to love something that was made by a good person, ConcernedApe has created an incredible game that I will forever rave about." </em>-<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qb8pty/comment/nz9dtrw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>u/ks_wizard</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"I started the game eight years ago over the holidays after my stepfather suddenly died and was in this weird limbo.

He tells me he used to mess around in Photoshop making avatars and forum signatures, and he had made custom maps in Advance Wars and StarCraft. He started playing Stardew when it came out in 2016, but it wasn't until he was laid off during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic that he discovered its modding community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, he says, there were only about 800 or 900 available mods for the game, in contrast to the more than 28,000 now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/stardewvalley?modSort=popular" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nexus Mods</u></a>. Hedegaard downloaded a bunch of them, and loved them so much that he started teaching himself how to make his own. He learned how to program, make pixel art, compose music, and create maps. All of this eventually led to Stardew Valley Expanded, a massive expansion for Stardew Valley that adds "28 new NPCs, 58 locations, 278 character events, 43 fish, reimagined vanilla areas, three farm maps, a reimagined world map reflecting all changes, new music, questlines, objects, crops, festivals, and many miscellaneous additions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why expand the already expansive Stardew Valley?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Well, the way I looked at it is, Stardew Valley is already perfect the way it is. You don't need mods to enjoy Stardew Valley. I fell in love with version 1.2 of Stardew Valley, and that's just all Eric [Barone, creator]. That's entirely just Eric's work there, all himself, and you see what the game did to me. It made me want to make a huge mod for it, but when it came to me wanting to expand the valley, the way I went about it is I just wanted more of everything in the game. I wanted more NPCs, I wanted more locations, I wanted more crops, I wanted more character events, I wanted more machines, more items, more quests, more of everything. You can think of my mod as a well-rounded meal with all the meat and potatoes and green beans and maybe a cocktail on the side. It's the full show, a full meal of everything. There are some mods that just focus on some potatoes, there were some mods that just focused on some meat. A lot of work that goes into that, but I was fueled by my love for the game, my love for the community, and I had a lot of determination and a lot of excitement about the game in general that just fueled my desire to add everything that I did over all these years."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley Expanded first released in 2019, and at the time included three dozen new character events, three new locations, redesigned some base game maps. Hedegaard was going to stop there, but the mod started to blow up. It became so popular, he didn't want to leave it there. So he made it even bigger. He was in the process of working on version 1.15 of the mod, when his life was suddenly upended.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My car got stolen and I was screwed, because I didn't have theft insurance on it and I was in a hole, and not to mention I had all my student loans I had to pay off still," Hedegaard explains. "I'm just like, 'What am I going to do?' I was modding full time, but modding full time, I was making a bit of money from it, but it's enough money to pay for food and rent, not pay for my student loans and pay for a new car. I like Christmas, I like buying Christmas gifts for my family and friends. It's like, 'What am I going to do? What am I going to do?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was then that Hedegaard did something astonishing. He reached out to Barone, and asked him for a job.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was just like, 'You miss every shot you don't take.' So I went to the office and it was like, 'Yeah, do you want to hire me?'"</p><p>I was just like, 'You miss every shot you don't take.' So I went to the office and it was like, 'Yeah, do you want to hire me?'<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't <em>quite</em> as crazy as it sounds. Hedegaard did already know Barone – they had hung out 3-4 times before, he says, describing them at that point as "acquaintances." They also both lived in the Seattle area, so it's not like he flew across the country to do this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even more shocking was that Barone entertained the idea. He told Hedegaard that he'd have to think about it. Then, just a few days later, Hedegaard received a job offer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I remember that day fondly, it was one of the best days of my life," he says. "At that moment, my life changed. My life had already changed when I had first started playing Stardew Valley, it had changed when I had first released my mod, and then the other time it changed was when Eric hired me that day."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's how Hedegaard came to be employed by ConcernedApe, LLC and working on the next update to Stardew Valley. Hedegaard was also able to complete version 1.15 of Stardew Valley Expanded, which he considered a "finished" product. He's still providing bug fixes to the mod as needed, and is planning on updating the mod to be compatible with the future 1.7 update when it lands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But other than that, he's fully devoted to Stardew Valley itself now. The game, its creator, and the job that he now holds and loves have transformed his life in the best possible way, he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think that this is what I was born to do, it's like my fate or my destiny," he says. "I wasn't meant to be an accountant working at Joja Corp, going in with a suit and tie in downtown Seattle, because I was really starting to feel like… I'd go home and I'm like, 'I don't want to do this anymore. I wish I would get a letter from Grandpa,' and you know what? Eric gave me that letter from Grandpa. And it changed my life. His game, what he made, working for him, working with this team, everything that Stardew Valley has given to me has improved my life so much and it's made me so happy. Part of my development process is I just want to give all that love and happiness back to the community and to the world and to keep creating… I like seeing people be happy, I like seeing people playing this game, seeing people come together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"...I feel like, as time goes on, more and more and more people will play. Heck, even 20 years from now, there will be even more millions of people who have discovered the game. What's crazy is Stardew Valley is 10 years old. In year one, year two, some people had kids, they had babies, and eight years later, their kids are now playing Stardew Valley. The next generation of players are playing Stardew Valley. It's crazy. Eric and I and the whole team, we deeply understand how much Stardew Valley means to people, and that's why we always want to do right by the community at every turn, every possibility. And like I've been saying, to give all that love and happiness back that we've gotten."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

When we asked him for updates on 1.7, Barone said the following:</p><blockquote>I'm trying to not reveal too much because I like for it to be a surprise. What I will say without maybe being too specific is that with this update, one of the things we're trying to do is... Well, there is a popular fan request, which has to do with the children, trying to make the children a little more interesting. So I'm trying to do something with that, but there's a lot of other things in the update as well that no one's really asked for, but I think people will appreciate it. </blockquote><blockquote>I'm going to be adding two more marriage candidates, but I'll reveal who it is on the anniversary day.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is, quite frankly, huge! Players have been asking for more romanceable characters for years now, and the only new additions since the game's launch were Shane and Emily, added way, way back in 1.1. We don't yet know who these two mystery partners will be, though. It's possible that ConcernedApe is adding two brand new characters to the game, but it's also possible that existing characters that players have wanted to marry for a long time will finally get their due. I'm thinking of folks like Marnie, Sandy, Linus, Clint, or even the elusive Wizard. There's also a contingent of folks who want to break up Robin and Demetrius, but that seems like it would cause some drama, to say the least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whoever it is, we know they'll get additional scenes for heart events, lots of new relationship-focused dialogue, and their own unique area on the farm. So whether these are new or old characters, we're sure to see some cool new story content surrounding them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley is turning 10 years old, and we're celebrating with a bumper crop of stories. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">interviewed ConcernedApe</a> and spoke about topics such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-explains-why-there-isnt-a-stardew-valley-tv-show">why there isn't a Stardew Valley TV show</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-still-has-one-secret-players-have-never-found-says-creator">the one secret that players still haven't found yet</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/haunted-chocolatier-is-coming-along-says-creator-but-isnt-as-fast-as-i-would-like">how Haunted Chocolatier is doing</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley is 10 years old this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The popular life/farming simulator made waves when it first dropped on February 26, 2016 on PC, quickly becoming beloved for its loving recreation of some of the best aspects of the old Harvest Moon games, while also determinedly following its own path with elements such as the mines, a much wider variety of crops and animals, and queer relationships.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the last 10 years, a series of updates have kept the energy alive, adding even more farming activities, more people to marry and befriend, more dungeoning adventures, more seasonal events, and just... more. Of everything. It remains wildly popular as a result, having sold nearly 50 million copies since its initial launch and still drawing hundreds of thousands of players on a daily basis on Steam alone, not to mention all the other platforms it's come out on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew is consistently among the most-played games on Steam, and retains a massive community of players, content creators, modders, and other artists all participating in its fandom. We re-reviewed it in 2024 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">gave it a 10/10</a>. There's a cookbook. And a symphony tour. My most normie, non-video game friends have played it. It's everywhere. And it's somehow <em>not done.</em> A planned 1.7 update is still in the works and (as you'll soon see) it seems unlikely creator Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) will be able to put the game away even after that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story of Stardew Valley's creation has been told and retold across numerous articles and interviews, so in celebration of its 10th anniversary, we took a different approach. We sat down with Barone for a lengthy interview not about the game's beginnings, but about its journey over the last 10 years, and its future. You can read some shorter highlights in our stories about new marriage candidates coming in 1.7, why there isn't a Stardew Valley TV show, the secret no one's found yet, and how Haunted Chocolatier, Barone's next game, is doing. We also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-changed-my-life-stardew-valley-community-and-creators-on-the-games-10th-anniversary">spoke to a handful of Stardew Valley fans and creators</a> about what the game has meant to them over the years, and you can read that here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for the fans who want everything, as we did, we've republished the full Q&amp;A with Barone here, lightly edited for clarity:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/02/stardewvalley-header-farmingyear10-1770061844606.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Well, let's start off easy. You're about to enter year 10 of Stardew Valley. How do you feel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Barone:</strong> That's right. It's been so long. I just can't believe that 10 years has gone past. It was a blur, I would say. And it's 10 years since launch, but it's been almost 15 years since I started working on Stardew Valley. So for me, the majority of my adult life now has been basically dedicated to Stardew Valley. This is my entire life. So it's hard to even be objective about it, to be honest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been blown away by how popular Stardew Valley is, how many people have played it, how it continues to be popular 10 years after launch. I think that's a crazy thing. It's not something I would've ever expected, but the amount of love for the game is one of the reasons I've continued to work on it for so long. It's difficult to stay locked into one project for 15 years. I definitely have urges to work on other things, but then Stardew Valley keeps drawing me back in, really just because there's so many people who love the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've talked a lot about the development of the game in the past and that process. So I don't want to make you retell that story. But in these 10 years since it's released, I'm curious about your evolution as a developer. You've been working on this game for far longer than that, but what do you think are the biggest changes you've undergone as a game developer since Stardew Valley released?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone: </strong>I think the biggest thing was transitioning to working with other people. When Stardew Valley first came out in 2016, I literally did not work with anyone, not a soul. It was entirely my own project and I did everything. Since then, now I have a pretty good-sized team of people helping me with the updates and with the business side of things. Really with everything, managing the forums and all that stuff. So that's been a big change. I wasn't used to it. It took me a while to get used to working with other people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I mean, it's been really great with my team that I have now. They do great work. They add their own unique sensibilities and ideas to the melting pot of Stardew Valley. There's just so many things that I couldn't have done on my own. For example, translating it into 12 different languages, adding multiplayer. There's some technical things that are just beyond my skill level. I'm a very amateur developer. I still feel that way. I'm just a total amateur. It's good to have some people who are more technically focused, for example, and can help me with some of those things. Really polish up the game, make sure it's running smoothly, that multiplayer works in a seamless way and all of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's been the biggest thing is working with other people, but also just, I guess, getting used to the prominence of Stardew Valley. I think back to, I think it was September, I was at one of the Stardew Valley concert shows in LA and it was at this huge outdoor venue with 5,000 seats and it was sold out. It was this cool outdoor venue. I was standing there just looking at the audience and thinking, "This is crazy." I don't even know how to think about it. It's surreal, but I'm also used to it at this point, I guess. So I try not to take it too seriously, but it is surreal that this has all happened.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I do want to back up and poke at that a little bit because you said you still feel like an amateur. Are you just being deferential or do you really feel that you're still an amateur after working for 15 years?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone: </strong>No, I still definitely feel like an amateur.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Why?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> I think it's because my approach to development is very scrappy. I've never really become super professional in the way I do things, but I think in a way it's part of what gives Stardew Valley and hopefully Haunted Chocolatier it's a, you might say indie soul, is that it's not too professional. There's a little bit of rough edges around it. Also, my mindset is that I never think of myself as a master of anything. Pixel art, I feel like I'm bad and I need to always get better. I feel that way about every aspect of the game. I'm not good enough. I need to improve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To me, that's a helpful mindset because that inspires me to always want to strive to improve and not just think, "Yeah, I'm perfect. I don't need to do anything else." It's like I always need to be working to improve and get better at every aspect of development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So in the 10 years since release, can you talk about a couple major moments in your life connected to Stardew Valley that stood out to you as really big or notable or joyful?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone: </strong>Well, I think the first one was just when the game launched, that was a very, I would say stressful day, but also just blew my mind that this was finally coming out, people were going to play it. I didn't have much time to really marinate in that feeling. I just had to lock in and start doing updates and everything. And that's been a blur ever since. When multiplayer came out, that was also a big deal. I think that really expanded the game and brought a lot more people into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I guess another highlight would be the concert tours. The first time I was at one of these shows, these Stardew Valley shows, and it was 1,000 people in a room who were all mega-Stardew Valley fans, that made it sink in that there's a lot of real people that have been touched by Stardew Valley. Because a lot of my experience as a developer, from my perspective, I'm sitting here looking at a monitor all day. I'm seeing messages and things from real people, but there's a lack of a real physical human connection. So to actually bridge that gap and meet real players in the flesh and shake their hands, that was very touching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It just reminded me of why I'm doing this. It's partly because I want to share my ideas with the world. What keeps me going after 10 years of still working on this. Because as an artist, I guess, I have a desire to just move on and do something else. I want to be always doing something new. Ideally, every month I'd be doing something totally new and different. Whatever whims I have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so many people that say Stardew Valley changed my life or saved my life or helped me bond with my family members or all these things that makes me feel like there's a more important purpose that I have here than to just share my ideas. It's part of it, but I feel like a responsibility to all the players because I feel like I've been granted a very rare opportunity to be in this position. I have the capacity here to touch the lives of millions of people. That's a big responsibility and I want to do it as best I can and hopefully be a positive influence in people's lives in a real way, a real physical, real life way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's a heavy burden, then? The way you describe it.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Yeah, it is. Like I said, I just feel like I've been granted a special opportunity. This feels like it was my destiny and I just want to do the best I can to maximize that opportunity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This might just be the same question, but I also wanted to ask if there's anything in the last 10 years that you can pinpoint as something that you're the most proud of, like an accomplishment, maybe not including the launch of the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> I think the last update, the 1.6 update, I was pretty proud of that because it was a whole team effort. It felt like the apex of this transition from being a total solo developer to actually incorporating several different people and their ideas and their work all into a cohesive package. And I think it was very well received by the players as well. That was a fun moment. It was fun to be able to share that with my team and with the community. It felt like a little celebration when we launched it and then we're all working together. So it wasn't just me alone. For better or for worse, it's like if there was any stress, it was distributed among the team too, so that was helpful.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  Stardew Valley</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm sure you're aware of this, but you've been held up over the years as an example of a successful "solo developer." And you did make Stardew Valley largely by yourself with the support of family members and things like that, but it sounds like what you're saying now is you've discovered since release, is that it does take a village to keep it sustained. Do you have any thoughts about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> It's true. People say, "No, it's just one developer." It's true and not true because it was true up to a point. I made a complete game that was successful completely by myself. So it does prove that it is possible to do that. There's so much that couldn't have happened post-launch without the help of other people. And I think that was crucial for making Stardew Valley as complete and as good as it is today. It's true. It's like both things are true, I would say. It just depends on how much you want to expand the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's like the game became so popular that in order to meet the needs and demands of the player base, I feel like I did need to expand the team. There's been a lot of benefits of that. There's a certain thing where not every single thing in the game now is completely done by me, which does make it a little bit less of my personal baby, but I'm fine with that at this point. I feel like when it launched, it was like my baby that I was incubating and then it went out into the real world and Stardew Valley has become its own being that's external from me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best analogy would be, it feels like I was a parent and the child grew up and now it left the house and it's developed a life of its own that is beyond just me. And that's how I feel about Stardew Valley now. It's not my personal baby anymore. I'll always have a father connection to the game, but it's also become its own being. And that's not just me and the team, but also the entire Stardew Valley community and all the players, all the modders have really turned it into its own thing. So that's been, I guess, an evolution over the past 15 years as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So I asked you about big positive moments in the last 10 years. What about challenging times? Is there any moment in the last 10 years of Stardew that you recall as being exceptionally difficult or frustrating?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone</strong>: I think the hardest part is just staying totally high energy about it for 10 years. Like I've said, I've wanted to move on and work on other things and I've struggled with that and with thinking about, "What is my purpose? What is my life purpose? Is it going to be to just work on Stardew Valley forever, for the rest of my life?" That's been a little bit challenging. So I have to keep reminding myself of all the people that are affected by the updates and playing Stardew Valley to try to stay locked in for so long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of technical difficulties, it hasn't been too bad. There's been some issues and I've brought more people onto the team that have been able to help with that. It's true that managing a team and being the leader of a team is something that I wasn't really prepared for necessarily. I had to learn and grow in that regard too, but I just view it as one other aspect of being a game developer. There's a lot of things you don't think of. At first it's like, "Okay, I'm programming. I'm drawing pixel art, I'm making music." But then it's like, "Okay, I also have to have a public persona." I'm managing my social media, I'm doing business stuff, I'm doing taxes and all this stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then it's also, I'm managing a team. So there's so many different aspects to this, which have been a learning experience, I would say, but I'm trying to get better and try to always improve and increase my skills in that regard. And sometimes it's been difficult, but I think things have been getting better and better over the years.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/02/stardewvalley-header-upgradingtools-1770061861081.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You touched on this slightly earlier, but when you've been considering updates to Stardew over the last 10 years, how much of what you have done has been influenced by community requests or mods versus how much of it is just you coming up with stuff you think is cool?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone</strong>: Yeah, I mostly try to just do what I think is cool because I think that that will keep Stardew Valley, Stardew Valley. I don't want it to be developed by the public necessarily. It's like I do consider what people request and if it lines up with things that I agree with, then I might lean in that direction a little bit because I do want to make the players happy. But I think sometimes what will make the players happy is for Stardew Valley to still be my creative ideas ultimately, whether they realize it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I try to do a mix, I guess. A few things that maybe the fans are asking for if it lines up, but then I also like to just do whatever. I mean, my favorite way to come up with ideas for the update is just play the game myself. And when I'm playing, I'm like, "Hmm, this would be cool." And then I'll just add it. I think that's always a crucial part of any new update is me playing the game. And usually what happens is, I or my team will work on the update for a while and then we'll play through some of the new stuff we've done. And then as we're playing through it, we're always thinking, "Oh. Okay, this would be cool to add." There's always things that come up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite thing to do is just whatever weird thing pops into my head, I'll just add that in. For example, 1.6, I added the family of raccoons that lives near your farm. That wasn't a player request. It was just something I had thought of and I was like, "This would be fun." I think those things are what gives Stardew Valley its authentic character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any particular mods or fan projects that you found super cool or super interesting or super inspiring?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> I actually don't really play with mods, to be honest. I try not to look at mods too much because I actually don't want to be influenced by mods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah. That makes sense.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> I know people think that I take ideas from mods, but it's probably just that there are natural ideas that make sense that would be added to the game. I end up adding those things, just because it naturally makes sense. Or maybe someone suggested it to me and it came from a mod, but I wasn't even aware that it came from a mod. I just thought, "Hey, that's a good idea."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of ideas, are there any updates on 1.7?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone: </strong>Yeah. I'm trying to not reveal too much because I like for it to be a surprise. What I will say without maybe being too specific is that with this update, one of the things we're trying to do is... Well, there is a popular fan request, which has to do with the children, trying to make the children a little more interesting. So I'm trying to do something with that, but there's a lot of other things in the update as well that no one's really asked for, but I think people will appreciate it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm going to be adding two more marriage candidates, but I'll reveal who it is on the anniversary day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This was a couple years ago, but I think you said there was still a secret or two that at the time fans hadn't yet found. Can we get an update on that? Is there anything in the game that people haven't seen?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> There's still a secret that no one has ever found. I don't think they ever will. Maybe I'll reveal it someday, but the problem with the secret is that it's ... It's basically a secret message that's in the game and it reveals something that actually isn't even true anymore. It was revealing a thing about- Do I want to reveal it or not? Well, that's all I'll say. I'll say it was a secret message that was basically announcing something that I actually shifted gears and that thing wasn't even true anymore, but it's still in the game. I just don't know if anyone will ever discover it because it's so obscure.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's really interesting that there is still something because, I mean, this game is on PC. It's been datamined all to heck. People have seen all the puzzle pieces of this game.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> That's true. That's true. But the thing is, there's certain ways to hide messages that can't really be datamined. If you hide something in the code, it's going to all be found because people decompile the code and look at everything. If you say hide it in the art or something, if it's a secret message that's hidden in the artwork somehow, then people can't really discover that as easily. They have to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is going to drive people crazy. I'm going to write this and this is going to drive people crazy for months.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> I feel like no one will ever find it, but I hope someone does. It'd be interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So Stardew Valley in the last 10 years helped spark a new wave of, I guess we can call them cozy games in a similar tradition. Do you play any of those? What do you make of that trend?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone</strong>: I've played a few. The trend, I mean, I'm glad if Stardew Valley inspired people to make these games. The whole idea of cozy games, I feel like, I've never called Stardew Valley a cozy game. That's just a genre that formed, I guess, and people started calling it that and people started retroactively calling Stardew Valley a cozy game, which is fine. I don't really call it that, but I mean, I would say Stardew Valley is cozy. But a cozy game, I feel like there's certain aspects to this whole genre that have gone beyond or different than my conception, which is fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, it's not like Stardew Valley was the first. Harvest Moon obviously was the first farming game, the original so-called cozy game, but it's like if you're the first screamo band, you probably weren't calling your band a screamo band. It's just the music you made. And then people started calling it screamo, and then they retroactively call your band a screamo band. It's like, "Well, okay."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of the genre itself, I think it's cool because I mean, the reason why I liked Harvest Moon was because it wasn't just about fighting and going on some big grand epic adventure. It was the opposite. Instead of going out on a huge adventure, you were at home, it was domestic. It was just one little area and just trying to go deep on that one area, which for some reason that just really appealed to me. I don't know why. Maybe I've always been a homebody, but I think that idea resonates with a lot of people. And maybe a lot of people that didn't classically like video games, but maybe because this whole thing where it's all about fighting and combat and competition and going on a big adventure, maybe that's not appealing to a lot of people. It's appealing to some, like a subset of the population, but Stardew Valley maybe brought this whole other idea. Which is part of the human experience, an important part of the human experience, and brought that to the mainstream in a way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So people are like, "Hey, we could actually make games that are about cooking or running a household or running a small business." Things that are a lot more, I don't know. I guess I would call them domestic, but it doesn't really quite capture it because a lot of cozy games aren't just about being at home. They're just more, I would say, less about fighting and competition and they're more about the normal everyday things that people do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a certain sense of growth in these games too. It's about acquiring resources and then developing those resources into something, a life that you want to live. And that's such a core part of being human that I think it just naturally appeals to people. It's like something we're all meant to do in a way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/02/stardewvalley-header-inspiration-1770061894832.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>When I was researching for this article, I saw that you had talked a lot for understandable reasons this year about how much you admire David Lynch. And I was wondering if you'd be willing to talk a little more specifically about what it is you love about him and how you feel he's influenced your work.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Yeah. I feel like David Lynch, he was... He just had a transcendental understanding of the world. And you could see it in his art. I never met the man, and unfortunately I never knew him, but I felt like in his art, I always felt a connection. There's something about David Lynch, he's connected to the spiritual world it almost feels like and that always appealed to me. And another thing I really admired about him is that he never seemed to really try to be popular. He always seemed to be authentic to himself and his artistic vision, for better or for worse, in terms of popularity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Twin Peaks Season 2 was very abrasive. Not a lot of people, I think, would necessarily enjoy it, but I felt like David Lynch was just being true to himself and he didn't care about whether this was going to be a commercial success. He just stuck to his guns and I really admire that. I just think that in general, the world needs more artists who are pure and not necessarily trying to be popular. That's the stuff that I like best is when, you might call it Outsider Art almost, because it's just a random person's unique vision. And I feel like everyone has this capacity, but a lot of people will instead be influenced by what's popular or what might be successful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I would just hope that people would instead just stick to their true vision. I want to see everyone's unique perspective and vision. And David Lynch was the ultimate form of that, in my opinion. And I just liked his stuff. I mean, I loved Eraserhead, Twin Peaks, The Straight Story. Again, even in The Straight Story, which was not very avant-garde, it was his most wholesome, straightforward movie, but you could kind of still feel the David Lynch essence in it. And I always love that when you can just tell this is a certain artist's thing. No matter what they do, they just have this unique flare that you can always pick up on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any other people just across all different kinds of craft who have been big influences on you over the years?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone</strong>: I mean, I don't know about big influences. Obviously Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli has been pretty big. A lot of people have been influenced by that, me included. And I feel like he's [Miyazaki] another one of those artists who you can always feel the artist in whatever he does. There's just a certain thing and I really appreciate that. Obviously, Yasuhiro Wada, the Harvest Moon creator, has been a huge influence on me. You could say that he started it all. So I have to shout him out and point to him as the original farming game person. He made it all possible.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stardew Valley Cookbook Preview</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We've talked a little bit already about continually updating the game and why you feel it's so hard to step away from Stardew Valley and why you keep going back to it over and over. Do you see a future where it's ever done?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Yeah, I could see a future where it's done. Just to be realistic at this point, there's been many times where I was like, "All right, I think it's going to be done after this update." And then that never happens. So I think just realistically, it might not ever be done. I do want to release Haunted Chocolatier. I want to finish Haunted Chocolatier. That will require me to spend time working on Haunted Chocolatier. And it's like if I'm always working on Stardew Valley as well, it's going to probably take a long time. That's one worry I have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe if everyone stopped playing Stardew Valley, if it fell off, then maybe I wouldn't be as inspired to keep working on it. A big part of it is just because it's so popular. And like I mentioned earlier, it's like when there's so many people still playing it, I feel a responsibility and an inspiration to want to keep adding to the game because I just know that it's basically the best avenue for any ideas or any of my work to reach other people. And that's why I have always created things in my life is because, I guess I would say it's probably my way of connecting to the rest of humanity is through art or music. For me, it was always primarily music before Stardew Valley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I created music and art and stuff always. Even I think if I was the last person alive on earth, I would do it because I want to get stuff out. I have ideas and I want to actualize those ideas. But I think in a way, it was also my way of trying to connect with the rest of humanity. So Stardew Valley has become by far the best avenue that I've ever had to do that. Before Stardew Valley, no one ever listened to my music or anything, which is fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As long as people are still playing it and it's still popular, I'll probably want to keep making updates for it. The only thing is, I don't want the game to become too bloated with content. I feel like at some point it might be too much actually. So I am very cautious about that. There's so many systems in the game now. I don't want to keep adding systems, but I do feel like all the things that exist could always be expanded upon more. Stardew Valley, as a game, you progress through these years in the game. Eventually things start looping.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's like there could always be a third year of festival variants, a fourth year of festival variants. There could be more dialogue. I could go deeper on all the characters. That's one of the things ... It's like why I'm not really too into adding new characters to the world because I feel like all the existing characters could use so much more depth and I could keep going deeper and deeper adding the third year of dialogue to everyone and adding more character cutscenes and all these things that open up as you keep playing the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there anything you've ever wanted to add to or change about Stardew Valley that for whatever reason you couldn't?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Well, I feel like some of the things are so established that it would be weird to change it now. There are some things that maybe I slightly regret. One thing I mentioned before was the spiral level in the mines. That level's awful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It kinda sucks, yeah.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Yes, that level sucks. And I could maybe adjust it to make it suck a little bit less. I don't know about just taking it out completely because some of these things are part of- I guess I fear that if I retroactively change things in the game, it'll lose that classic Stardew Valley feel. Sometimes I wonder if some of these things that are slightly annoying do actually add to the game experience as a whole, because not everything in life is easy. There's got to be some things that are even annoying, I think sometimes, so that the things that are not annoying and are more comfy feel even comfier in comparison. I'm not sure about some of those things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, one thing that I also, I wouldn't say regret, it was just that my skill level and understanding at the time was all the- For example, the New Desert Festival and the Winter Night Market, which are the two most recent festivals, they operate in a totally different way. They're not like an instance, where you're stuck on this map. You can come and go and it's very ambient. I really like that approach so much better, which I feel like is an evolution of the original idea I had with the festival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think it would be great maybe to retroactively turn all the festivals into that style, but that would be a huge change for the game. It might be controversial even because maybe some people like the instance festivals, I don't know. So I do sometimes struggle with like, "Should I change something and make it not classic Stardew Valley anymore, even if I think it's better or not?" So I struggle with that sometimes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It is interesting because now this game is a decade old. There is a mystical "classic" Stardew Valley that people can remember that had much less and also had friction points that you maybe could have solved. You think back at the original Harvest Moon and it has that quality of, some things in that game were really frustrating, but that's what I remember fondly about them. So you might have reached that age.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> True, true. I mean, maybe someday there'll be a Stardew Valley Classic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Would you ever do it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Maybe, maybe, but it'd be difficult because I feel like most of the updates have added meaningfully good things to the game. I think the game is better today than it was in 1.0. There was one thing I remember that I did change that was funny. When the game originally came out, when Grandpa came and evaluated your farm after two years, he was super harsh. It was really difficult and he was almost rude about it. He was like, "I should have bequeathed the farm to my other grandchild."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oh, gosh.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> And I don't think you could reevaluate either. So it was like, a lot of people were upset because they felt like it was contrary to the comfortable atmosphere of Stardew Valley. So I did adjust that. I made Grandpa a lot less harsh and I made it so that you could re-summon him at any time to reevaluate the farm. And I don't regret that. I think it was the right move. I don't know what I was thinking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Has Stardew Valley ever surprised you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone: </strong>I think so because, well, there's certain things that- It is a bit of a sandbox game a little bit. And so there's certain things that just happen that I didn't necessarily intend. One example is if you breed slimes in town, they'll speak to the villagers because the game treats- a slime and an NPC are both the same base entity in the game. They're just different offshoots of this base entity. And it was in that base entity in the code that I had this stuff where if one of these entities came close to a different one, they might have a chance of greeting them and saying something, which I put in because I thought it'd be fun if NPCs cross paths and they say hello to each other. But I never thought about the fact that slimes would talk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's one example. I thought that was funny, so it's still in the game. I didn't change that or anything. It added, I guess, a lore that I wouldn't have necessarily intended, which is that the slimes can talk, which is weird. There's some things like that in Stardew Valley where it's like, I almost view it as like, is this lore or is it just a funny, silly little thing?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's like the Abigail eating amethysts thing.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Exactly. Yeah. That's another example of something that I didn't intend, but I left it in the game because these are the things where I would say it has an indie quirkiness to it where it's not exactly- If it was a totally professional operation, there would be QA testers that would've caught that and then they would've probably gotten rid of it because it's not intended behavior. But with Stardew Valley, it's like, "Eh, whatever. Just leave it in. It's fine." And there's a lot of stuff like that actually in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Would you ever consider doing a Stardew Valley 2 instead of just continuing to update?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Yeah, I would. In fact, I would love to because it would just be fun to work on a whole new set of characters, a whole new world, maybe capture some of that original energy that I had back in 2012, when I started working with Stardew Valley. There's something fun about the number of possibilities in a whole new world, which I think would be fun for me. It'd be fun for my team. We'd be really excited about it. It's a bit difficult because people are so attached to Pelican Town and to the villagers in Pelican Town. I do fear a little bit that if it's a whole new cast of characters, people might feel put off by that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I guess another approach to Stardew Valley 2 could be to use the existing cast, but it's like a new adventure in the world, but then I'm still stuck with the same thing. I'd have to think about that one. Yeah. There was a time where I was starting to work on a Stardew Valley 2, but, I don't know. For various reasons, I moved over to Haunted Chocolatier instead. Haunted Chocolatier you could say is like the Stardew Valley 2, but it's a bit different of a game, so we'll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A while back, you took a really uncommon step. You got a publisher and then later you removed that publisher and now you're publishing all the versions of Stardew Valley yourself. Are you happy with the results of that decision?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Yeah, I'm happy with that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone: </strong>I'll just say that it's nice to be fully in charge of my own game. A lot of indie developers, well, I guess it begs the question of what is an indie developer? Was I an indie developer when I had a publisher? And that's obviously debatable, but I think an amateur developer, you might say, who created an IP would ultimately like to be fully in charge of their own IP. I mean, Stardew Valley always belonged to me as a intellectual property. It's just nice to be able to- It's all my decision now. If I want to do this or that or enter this market or make a port of the game, it's up to me. So I don't know. I just like doing that. I appreciate the help that I got from my publisher when they were helping me out.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/02/stardewvalley-header-chocolatecalls-1770061992240.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So I have a question written in here that you've already kind of answered, which is, do you have any plans for the 10th anniversary? But I just want to ask that very directly. Is there anything else that I should mention here?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> I don't think you need to mention anything, but I mean, I have some plans. I was thinking of maybe doing my own little retrospective video or something where I just have a message for the players and maybe go back through the timeline of all the different things that have happened during the last 15 years. Just to basically remind everyone of what all has transpired.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some people are brand new to Stardew Valley. It's still selling a lot of copies every day. So those people may be brand new players. They might not know about the whole history of the game. I feel like it'd just be a good way to think back about everything that's happened. Just this whole grand adventure of Stardew Valley, the past 15 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Have you ever been approached to do a movie or a TV show for Stardew Valley?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Many times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Why didn't it happen?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> I think the main reason is that I would be worried that I wouldn't be happy with the final result. Stardew Valley is very much about the characters and the world and the tone of the game. So to take those characters, which, they don't have voices in the game. You have to use your imagination a bit to fill in the gaps, which I think makes the game more personal to every player. They're filling in the gaps. If it becomes a movie or a TV show, suddenly those gaps are all filled for you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One example I'll use is Harry Potter. When I read the books, I had my own idea of what Harry looked like, what Ron looked like and everything. Then you see the movies. I can't remember what my own idea was anymore. It's all just now what the movies are. Same with Lord of the Rings or any of these IPs. With Stardew Valley, I'm a little bit wary of taking that step because I feel like it might- I care about Stardew Valley so much that I don't- Even though it would be cool to see Stardew Valley on the silver screen and drive by a movie theater and see Stardew Valley on the marquee, that would be cool, but it's like, "Is it really the best for Stardew Valley?" I guess that's my worry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I could potentially imagine it being cool. That's why I said once, that if David Lynch had wanted to make a Stardew Valley movie in the style of Twin Peaks or something, I would've been like, "Yeah, great. You can do whatever you want, Mr. Lynch." Honestly, I would've let him just do whatever. I think it would've been great. Especially if it's like this mainstream Hollywood Stardew Valley. It's like, "Is this really the heart and soul of what Stardew Valley is about?" And I'm sure someone could do a great job, but it feels like it's a bit of a roll of the dice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've said many times, including this interview, that you've had trouble balancing, doing updates to Stardew Valley with working on Haunted Chocolatier. Has that changed more recently? What's the balance in your life right now?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Well, part of the reason why I've expanded my team a little bit is so that hopefully I can spend more time working on Haunted Chocolatier. And it's worked out pretty well so far, I would say. On 1.7, the approach we're taking is that I am like, you might say the creative director and I'm involved with like, "Okay, here's what we're going to do. Here's some of the ideas." Then I let the team work on that. And then meanwhile, I'm working on Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point in 1.7's cycle, I will get heavily involved, because I feel like my hand needs to touch every part of the game, every aspect of the update. I need to go over it and adjust it or at least approve everything. So it will require a lot of my time anyway, but I think the balance has been a little bit more shifted, so that I can spend more time focused on Haunted Chocolatier. And I think it's been working out pretty good. That's been a big change from the 1.3 update or 1.1 or something where it's completely me. I had no time to work on a new game. So that has changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is difficult because it's hard to shift gears, I guess. If I'm thinking about Haunted Chocolatier, it's difficult to be like, "Okay, I'm going to one day of the week or two days of the week work on Stardew Valley." That's not how my brain works. I'm all in one thing or the other. So I've been trying to work on that. I feel like it requires a lot of discipline, which I'm always working to improve on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Any update on Haunted Chocolatier you want to share?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> I would say it's coming along. The progress isn't as fast as I would like. Nothing is ever as fast as I would like. The main important thing about Haunted Chocolatier is I'm not going to release anything that I'm not happy with. If I don't think it's a great game, I'm not going to release it. So even if that takes years and years, so be it. That's just what I want to do. Fortunately, I don't feel like there's any real pressure. I haven't received funding from anyone or crowdfunding. There's not going to be any pre-orders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't actually owe anyone the game. It's like when I want to do it and when I want to release it, it'll get done. I mean, it's true that I've announced the game, that does create a lot of pressure on me because I do feel like I don't want to disappoint the fans by taking too long, but there's no real physical obligation with it. It's more just mental constructs, you might say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>As far as pressure goes, I guess how do you perceive Haunted Chocolatier in relation to Stardew Valley? Because Stardew Valley was such a hit, does that make it harder to decide that Haunted Chocolatier is ready?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Absolutely. Yeah. It's been a huge struggle for me actually. See, what I want to do is just not care and just make the game however, just whatever, not worry about it. But it's basically impossible because I can't help but think about how this will be received. And I know that there's going to be a lot of people playing this game who are expecting it to be a Stardew Valley 2. And are they going to like it or not? And it's like, yes, I want to just make the game I want to make, but I also don't want a bunch of people to not like the game because they were expecting a certain thing. That's not going to feel good. I know that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Haunted Chocolatier Screenshots 2023</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So that's been a constant struggle is like, "Do I just do whatever I want and not think about the existing player base or do I try to please the existing player base?" And I feel like there's just going to have to be a little bit of a balance between those things. It's been difficult. And also just the- I mean, I pretty much know that Haunted Chocolatier won't be as popular as Stardew Valley. I just feel like that's an extremely tall order. I mean, Stardew Valley was a once in a generation type of phenomenon. And part of that might've just been it was the right game at the right time. People were ready for this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you mentioned before, there's been a whole cozy game burst. So it's like the market is saturated with cozy games. Maybe people are tired of cozy games by the time Haunted Chocolatier comes out, which is fine. I mean, I wouldn't even call Haunted Chocolatier a cozy game, but I'm just saying these games that are more focused on one town. Maybe people want to go on epic adventures again and they don't want to play Haunted Chocolatier. That's fine, but I got to still make the game I want to make.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Earlier, you mentioned that if you weren't working on Stardew Valley or Haunted Chocolatier, you'd just be making a new game every month. Do you have other things you want to make? Is there anything particular that you're yearning to get out there?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> I mean, I would love to make small games and not worry about it. This goes back to me feeling like I have this rare opportunity. I've been granted a one in a billion opportunity to be in this position. It would almost feel like a waste of that to just make whatever I felt like doing. I feel like I need to do something big because I've been granted this opportunity. That being said, whenever I have an urge to make a small game, I might just do it and then make it as an arcade game in the cafe of Haunted Chocolatier. With Stardew Valley, I made Journey of the Prairie King and that could have been a little game on its own, but instead I made it an arcade game, so I integrated it into the world. So there's ways that I feel like anytime I feel like doing something, I can integrate it into the big game that I'm working on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I tweeted a while ago about how, sometimes I start writing these stupid philosophical rant things. It's like, "Okay, instead of posting this online, I can just put this in a text document and then eventually put it in a book in the library of Haunted Chocolatier to add to the lore and just to the immersion." I feel like pretty much anything is like that. If I want to make music, which that's another thing, I've always been someone who likes to just make random music. It's like I can maybe take some of that and just put it into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the most popular song in Stardew Valley, The Dance of the Moonlight Jellies was not a song that I made for Stardew Valley. I made that for just some random album on my secret Bandcamp. That just happened to be on some random album I made. And then I listened to it and I was like, "Hey, I like this song. I can take this and put this into Stardew Valley." And then that became the most popular song on Stardew Valley, according to Spotify. I think it's best if I, to some degree, follow my artistic whims and not force anything.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/02/stardewvalley-header-grandpasevaluation-1770062030272.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So Stardew Valley's still wildly popular after 10 years. That's really rare nowadays. Everybody's chasing that and nobody can have it except a couple of massive AAA live service games. I know you've been asked this a million times, but as you are now, what do you think it is about Stardew that keeps people coming back?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone: </strong>I think it's a few things. I think maybe most importantly is that Stardew and I guess myself, it's never been about trying to be as popular as possible and as widely played as possible, which I think people appreciate. It's almost like if you are chasing the money, then you don't get it because, people, that's not what they're looking for. They're looking for something authentic and real. And Stardew Valley I think has always remained like that because it's never turned into a big business. It's never been a business. It's always been about the game and about the players and about just making Stardew Valley the best it can be. And I think people can feel that in the game. And that's one of the reasons why they like it. It sticks out because a lot of stuff is corporate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I'm not saying anything bad about those games. I like a lot of AAA, corporate games myself, but at the end of the day, those games, they have investors. The companies have investors, they have to make money, they have to make profit. And so that I think, can cloud the- It can mar the pure love and passion that a true indie game can capture. I think that's part of what makes Stardew Valley stick out. And as a game itself, it feels very scrappy, I think still. Which is more relatable to people. It feels personal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone who plays Stardew Valley, it feels like their own personal game. So that's heartwarming to people, I think. I think another aspect to it is the multiplayer has been huge because it just brings people together. It's a fun and unique way to spend time with other people. And I'm saying this, trying to be as objective as possible as a gamer. I feel like there's not enough games that you can play cooperatively with your friends and it doesn't require a graphics card. Anyone can play it on their laptop.</p><p>I think that's part of what makes Stardew Valley stick out. And as a game itself, it feels very scrappy, which is more relatable to people. It feels personal.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a group of friends, they're not gamers per se. They don't have high-end graphics cards. We can't go and play 3D games really together and have it run well. Stardew Valley though, it's like it runs on anyone's potato and we can all play together. So I think that is big. And there's actually not a lot of games like that, to be honest. There's Terraria, which is great, and Minecraft works on most people's computers, but I think that makes it unique. And just the fact that it's chill, you don't have to lock in too hard. You can just play and chat and hang out, but you're still doing a fun activity together, which can be very rewarding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all goes back to human nature and what we're meant to do as humans. We were naturally meant to live in small communities and work together to gather resources, hunter-gatherers, forage roots and berries and all that stuff. That's what Stardew Valley is in a way. And in this modern world, we don't really get to do that anymore. And so Stardew Valley gives us a way to live, I think, our natural lives together. And I feel like that's why it feels so meaningful and good to people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Last one. What does Stardew Valley look like in 10 years?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Whoa, that's crazy. In 10 years there'll be a few more updates, which just make the game even more what it's supposed to be. I feel like with every update, I'm trying to make Stardew Valley its ultimate form, fully self-actualized. So hopefully in 10 years, Stardew Valley is fully self-actualized. Maybe there's new things added to the game to make it even more future-proof, in terms of creative content or things that players can be almost a part of the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One idea that we were toying with for 1.7, I don't know if this will happen or not, but was adding a farm map editor for the public. So you could basically make your own. Because with every update, it's traditional to add a new farm type. When the game first came out, there was just standard farm, that was it. And then 1.1, I added four different farms or something. And then with every update, there's been one added. What if we opened this up to the community and it was like now you could press an extra button, go into a browser and look at everyone's farm creation? That now adds almost infinite replayability to Stardew Valley. So I'm interested in ways to make the game more just infinitely replayable without the use of AI. That's never going to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah, in 10 years, who knows? That's crazy. Hopefully Haunted Chocolatier will be out and maybe by then there'll be some new Stardew Valley IP stuff going on too. Stardew Valley is such a gold mine, I think, of potential things you could do with Stardew Valley. I have plenty of ideas. It's just a matter of basically bandwidth because in order for it to maintain what I feel like is Stardew Valley's soul. Well, I feel like I need to be heavily involved in it. And I'm not saying that to throw any shade on anyone else. My team is great. I love them. They're great, but I still feel like I need to be heavily involved or else it's not going to feel like Stardew Valley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's your baby.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barone:</strong> Exactly. So if there's going to be a Stardew Valley 2 or a spinoff game or some related thing with Stardew Valley, then that's going to require my full attention. So maybe this would be after Haunted Chocolatier comes out, which will hopefully- In 10 years, Haunted Chocolatier will be out. Maybe there'll be some new Stardew Valley project that's out even in 10 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's almost Stardew Valley's 10th birthday, which emans that for a decade players have combed over every inch of Pelican Town and the surrounding area, unearthing secrets, deciphering Dwarvish manuscripts, and putting Strange Buns in hidden boxes. But the game's creator, Eric Barone (ConcernedApe), says there's still one secret that fans have never found, though he hopes one day they do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke to ConcernedApe for a big interview in honor of the game's 10th anniversary, and among the many topics we discussed was the question of in-game secrets. ConcernedApe has said in the past that there was still an outstanding secret, so we wanted to check in and see if that was still true. And, yup, it is, though maybe his cheeky teasing will help someone find it now. Here's exactly what he said:</p><blockquote>There's still a secret that no one has ever found. I don't think they ever will. Maybe I'll reveal it someday, but the problem with the secret is that it's, it's basically a secret message that's in the game and it reveals something that actually isn't even true anymore. It was revealing a thing about- Do I want to reveal it or not? Well, that's all I'll say. I'll say it was a secret message that was basically announcing something that I actually shifted gears and that thing wasn't even true anymore, but it's still in the game. I just don't know if anyone will ever discover it because it's so obscure.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">I followed up by marveling at this knowledge, as the game has been combed over and datamined all to heck over the years. However, ConcernedApe replied that "there's certain ways to hide messages that can't really be datamined. If you hide something in the code, it's going to all be found because people decompile the code and look at everything. If you say hide it in the art or something, if it's a secret message that's hidden in the artwork somehow, then people can't really discover that as easily. They have to see it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Could that be a clue as to what this is? Possibly! Get to work, secret hunters. ConcernedApe concluded by saying he doesn't think anyone will find it, but hopes that someone does.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley turns 10 years old this February, and we're celebrating with a bumper crop of stories.

            <p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Grasshopper Manufacture co-founder and Romeo is a Dead Man director Goichi Suda (also known as Suda 51) has spoken more about his opinions of generative AI in game development, after previous statements indicating the technology wouldn't be used in the upcoming action game.</p>
<p>Eurogamer asked Suda on whether the Romeo is a Dead Man people will play in a few days would be as good, or artistic, a game if generative AI were used in its development, he responded with the following:</p>
<p>"For me personally, a lot of the AI stuff I see pops up on social media. As far as it's come, there's something about the images and videos you see that feels off. Most people have that same kind of sense, something psychological lets you know something isn't right here. Something's kinda funky.</p>

<p>"They've been saying the day will come when AI will fool people, when you won't know something is AI. That may be true, but honestly, I don't think it has reached those levels yet. When I see something made with generative AI something in the back of my brain gets set off.</p><p>"If I used AI to make Romeo: A.) it would have been a fake Romeo. Not that he was a real person to begin with, but people would notice something shallow about the character. He would be hard to relate to, and kind of creepy.</p>
<p>"And, B.) The way we make games now, the specific skills of the studio and people we know, be it practical effects, art, creating graphics on their own… those skills and passion the humans put into their works comes across to players. It's something people can feel, not just that it was person-made not AI-made, but you can tell someone poured their heart into this. Someone worked hard to make this happen."</p>
<p>When asked about his previous statements, and how he felt about Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association survey last year which found <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese developers were using the technology in some form</a>, Suda emphasised he didn't have strong feelings on it, and shared his belief that wider use of the technology would depend on player wants.</p>
<p>He also revealed that, at one point, Netease had a research section looking into generative AI, but eventually shuttered it for reasons Suda couldn't confirm for certain. He did, however, have his theories.</p>
<p>"As far as not using any AI for our games, it started as a Netease policy for all their companies," Suda said. "They originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff, but at one point they decided not to do that any more. They folded that section and told their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all."</p><p>Suda, when asked why exactly the section shut down, shared his own assumptions. "I don't know, they never explained directly why. If I had to assume, it was probably one or both of two things. A lot of gamers out there don't like AI and having it in their games. Another thing is issues with copyright infringement. That can be tricky to get around, and clear before making something. That was probably part of it too - it would be easier to get rid of it altogether. But, again, that's my assumption. No one told me directly."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Epic Games has released a series of new figures today as part of a "year in review" lookback on Steam storefront rival, Apple lawsuit bane, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> forever-maker the Epic Games Store - and there are some interesting stats in the mix.</p>
<p>The headline figure, of a few, is that the Epic Games Store hit a total of 6.65bn gameplay hours in games launched via the store - a number that is down noticeably year-on-year, by 14 percent. But third-party gameplay hours - that is, time spent playing games that aren't Fortnite or any other published by Epic - were up by 4 percent to 2.78bn. Between the lines then, that suggests a fairly notable drop in first-party games' playtime, specifically that of Fortnite, with the wildly popular battle royale-cum-crossover platform still the top game on the store overall.</p>
<p>"That's the logical conclusion on hours [played]," Epic Games Store's vice president and general manager, Steve Allison, confirmed to Eurogamer during a brief interview on the figures. "But you've got to remember Fortnite's coming off one of its best years ever on PC," he added, noting that "relative to the state of the industry," it was still "outpacing" a lot of other games. Fortnite "still remains the biggest game in the world on many fronts," he added, while conceding that "the conclusion is fair and accurate" that it had seen a noticeable drop compared to 2024, enough to offset the rest of the store's growth.</p>
<p>Another key stat from the review details player spending - a tad businessy, maybe, but something that makes for interesting reading amongst the ongoing debate on live service games and, frankly, the future sustainability of the industry as a whole. There, third-party games saw a huge increase in spending, up by 57 percent to $400m. For context, Epic had what Allison called a "down year" in 2024, where the equivalent spending was $255 million, 18 percent down on 2023's figure of $310m, which also makes last year's increase especially large.</p><p>The reasonable guess as to what drove that would be the rising popularity of 'gacha' games, such as Kuro Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a> and MiHoYo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai Star Rail</a>, on the store. Epic puts Wuthering Waves, Honkai, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> in its top five, 'mythic'-rated top games rankings, alongside staples Fortnite and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, and their relatively aggressive monetisation, centred on gachapon vending machine-style loot boxes, would suggest that's where the big spending growth is coming from.</p>
<p>"Obviously MiHoYo does really well here, and has chosen to be exclusive here" Allison said, "but they are not the lion's share of the spending on the store." Instead, Allison claimed the spending was "pretty dispersed across third-party games." Notably, other high-ranking games on the store continue to be live services with significant microtransactions, such as EA Sports FC 26, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Infinity Nikki.</p>
<p>There was also another record set, in total monthly active users playing Epic Game Store games in December 2025, with 78m logged-on, presumably tying in with the usual flurry of holiday freebies and sales - but again that's offset, this time over the wider year's average. Monthly active users were down 1 percent to 67m on average, and daily active users down 2 percent to 31m.</p>
<p>Those free games meanwhile have now ticked over the 100 mark, with 662m free games claimed, Epic putting the total value of those - presumably at full retail price - at $2,316 per player.</p>
<p>Finally, Epic also announced some relatively big plans for the Epic Game Store in terms of new features this year, including social functionality that "maybe is better than anyone's doing," Allison said. Expect much more on those, and the wider player opinion of the Epic Games Store, from us here very soon.</p>

              <p>Working out while listening to your favorite tunes is fun, but earbuds popping out every time you push through cardio or warm-up are both inconvenient and frustrating. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 solves that problem, and we just spotted the pair going at a discount on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7013/">Right now, you can snap it up for $200, after the retailer slashed it $250 price by 20%</a>. This offer applies to all color options, including Hyper Purple, Electric Orange, Jet Black, and Quick Sand. You can pick whichever suits your aesthetics the best. Like your audio gear basic? Grab the Quick Sand model. Want something bold? Orange is the new black.</p>
<p>Delivery is free, as well. That means $200 is all you’ve got to pay today. Grab the offer quickly, though. Deals like this don’t stick around for long, so it’s worth grabbing them while the discount is still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7013/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Listening Modes</h2>
<p>Beats calls this pair “the advanced headphone we’ve ever made”, and we don’t doubt that. The brand has reinforced the earhook with a nickel-titanium alloy for incredible flexibility and superior comfort. The buds are also 20% lighter than their predecessor, which makes them easy to wear all day long. In fact, these have gone through over 1,500 hours of athlete testing to help ensure a secure fit for any ear shape and workout intensity level.</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy superior sound, plus two audio modes; Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. The former blocks all external, background noise from coming in, offering an immersive listening experience. This mode comes in handy when you want to enjoy distraction-free listening in busy areas, such as a cafe or an office. The Transparency mode, on the other hand, lets some ambient sound in to keep you aware of what’s happening around. Then there’s adaptive EQ, which uses advanced microphones to measure what you’re hearing and adjusts the frequencies of the music based on that.</p>



<p>The buds support personalized spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, as well. This feature places the sound all around you for that 3D, theatre-like experience, and can bring content like movies and TV shows to life. You’ll also get excellent call clarity, thanks to the advanced built-in microphones in each earbud, so whether you’re catching up with friends on a subway or taking a quick meeting in a busy cafe, your voice comes through clearly on the other end.</p>
<p>Managing music and adjusting volume on the go will be just as convenient with the on-ear buttons, tactile volume rockers, and voice-activated controls. Basically, you won’t have to reach for your phone every time you need to pause the song or increase the volume.</p>
<p>Battery life is better than most options in the same price range. A single charge offers up to 45 hours of listening with the charging case. That means you can go days without worrying about plugging these in. And finally, Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 play nicely with both Android and Apple devices, so compatibility won’t be an issue, either.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7013/">There’s a lot more to like about this pair, especially now that it’s discounted by $50.</a> Note that the offer won’t be around forever, so it’s best to pick these up before it expires!</p>

<p>Titled <strong>'The World of Hideki Kamiya'</strong>, the book is currently only confirmed for release in Japan on <strong>2nd April 2026</strong>, but we'll be keeping a close eye on a potential western release. Naturally, it will cover Kamiya's career, with the creator providing his own thoughts on some of the games he's made over the years.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you can also expect to find over 100 examples of concept art from his games. Heck, even the front cover is an absolute banger, showcasing the likes of Dante from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry">Devil May Cry,</a> Leon and Claire from Resident Evil 2, and Amaterasu from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/okami">Okami</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="53peCvnRDq8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt53peCvnRDq8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938a0nvgszp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Speaking of which, Kamiya is currently hard at work on the official sequel to Okami at his new studio Clovers in collaboration with Capcom. There's no word on when the game might release, but we're very excited to see more.</p>
<p>For now, here's a look at the front cover for The World of Hideki Kamiya:</p>

<p>Fellow game developer Yoko Taro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/hideki-kamiyas-block-happy-take-no-crappery-is-super-reassuring-says-yoko-taro">recently commented</a> on Kamiya's penchant for blocking users (or "insects", as Kamiya calls them) on social media. He noted that "it’s a net positive to instil that fear that there are some game creators who do have that edge", praising Kamiya for seemingly taking a stand.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of <strong>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</strong> at <strong>The Game Awards 2025</strong></a> was among the most unexpected. It had been many years since there was a Star Wars-themed racing game, so many gamers were overjoyed at the news. At the same time, it was not clear based on the released footage, screenshots, and info whether the game would include <strong>Podracing</strong>, the high-speed fictional sport featured prominently in the movie <strong>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</strong>, in which a very young <strong>Anakin Skywalker</strong> enters and wins a podrace. The most popular older racing games, Star Wars Episode I: Racer, Star Wars: Racer Arcade, and Star Wars Racer Revenge, all prominently featured Podracing.</p>



<p>Now, though, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Gamesradar</a>, <strong>Fuse Games</strong> CEO and co-founder <strong>Matt Webster</strong> confirmed that <strong>Podracing is indeed available in their upcoming title</strong>, albeit alongside other vehicle types:</p>



<p><em>You can’t really make a Star Wars racing experience and not have Podracing, can you? The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and Podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the Star Wars galaxy. However, when we set out to create Galactic Racer, we wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. Star Wars: Galactic Racer offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes</em>.</p>



<p>Star Wars: Galactic Racer doesn't have a release date yet, but publisher <strong>Secret Mode</strong> is planning to launch it at some point in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. There's still a lot we don't know, except for the fact that tracks based on the <strong>Jakku</strong>, <strong>Ando Prime</strong> and <strong>Sentinel One</strong> planets have been confirmed. We also know that there will be a story-driven campaign, as well as competitive online PvP racing with a ranking system.</p>

            <p>An Assassin's Creed designer who publicly spoke out against Ubisoft's return-to-office mandate claims the company have now fired him. Developer David Michaud-Cromp <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-designer-claims-ubisoft-have-suspended-him-for-alleged-breach-of-the-duty-of-loyalty-over-new-rto-policy">posted on LinkedIn last week</a> that he'd been put on unpaid disciplinary leave after recently criticising the policy change on the social media platform.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, Ubisoft have recently revealed plans to push remote staff back into offices amid a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">bloodbath of game cancellations, restructuring and voluntary redundancies</a>. The company intend to have employees return to working in-office five days a week, with an annual allowance of work-from-home days. All of these moves have understandably not gone down well with French unions, who've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">subsequently called strike action</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This brings us to Michaud-Cromp's latest <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424133083051978757/">LinkedIn post</a>, in which the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> team lead wrote he'd been "terminated by Ubisoft, effective immediately". "This was not my decision. I won’t be discussing internal details or circumstances. I’m taking time to regroup and will share next steps when appropriate," he added.</p>
<p>Asked about the firing, Ubisoft provided the following statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-montreal-lead-fired-david-michaud-cromp-work-from-home-linkedin-2000665081">Kotaku</a> via a spokesperson: "Sharing feedback or opinions respectfully does not lead to a dismissal. We have a clear Code of Conduct that outlines our shared expectations for working together safely and respectfully, which employees review and sign each year. When that is breached, our established procedures apply, including an escalation of measures depending on the nature, severity, and repetition of the breach."</p><p>Speaking to Kotaku, Michaud-Cromp offered more of his view on remote work, outlining that in his estimation nailing "fundamentals like clarity of goals, trust, documentation, tooling, and communication practices" often has more of an impact on the effectiveness of teams than how physically close their members are from 9 to 5.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's decision to force staff back into the office, potentially costing those who can't do so due to various personal circumstances their jobs, has been one of the main areas the unions organising strikes on behalf of Ubisoft staff they represent object to. A number of staff have <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-union-representatives-call-for-resignation-of-ceo-yves-guillemot">reportedly</a> been left feeling as though they've suffered a "betrayal" at the hands of top management they can't trust. In that same article from Game Developer, two Ubisoft devs who serve as representatives for the Solidaires Informatique union - Marc Rutschlé and Chakib Mataoui - have publicly called for CEO Yves Guillemot to resign.</p>
<p>"I think Guillemot should move away at this point," Rutschlé said. "I think the level of hate people have for him [means] he should move on. Then, we could build some sort of trust again."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Western RPG fans are finally becoming </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>-curious thanks to Square Enix’s recent spate of re-releases and remakes. The past couple of years alone have given us </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>on top of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, updated versions of the three games that form the bedrock of the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>series. These releases have also been a touch confusing, as the remake of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span> was released before </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I &amp; 2</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Square has decided to muddy things up further by giving us </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> before the expected </span><i><span>Dragon Quest IV</span></i> <i><span>HD-2D Remake. </span></i><span>What’s more, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> utilizes bright, cartoony 3D character models instead of the HD-2D pixel art style of the earlier remakes. Thankfully, the models animate well, and they look particularly cool in battle. </span></p>

 <p><span>But </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span>‘s makeover also comes with quality-of-life tweaks that make for a much more streamlined gameplay experience than the Nintendo 3DS version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII, </span></i><span>which itself had already streamlined the original PSX version of the game. Some of the tweaks even make the game a good starting point for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> newcomers who are worried the games might be too difficult for them. But </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> is always going to be </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> at the end of the day. It’s always going to be an imperfect RPG that has problems with pacing and a strange cast that I’ll never warm up to. (Barring Ruff, obviously.)&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, playing </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is still fun as heck and it’s great to see </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>gain some momentum over here. As a long-suffering </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> fan who’s watched the series’ popularity gradually tick upwards in recent years, it gives me great pleasure to say this: Square Enix’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is a great entry in a series that finally—</span><i><span>finally</span></i><span>!—has us western </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> fans spoiled for choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Ooooh, let me say that again: </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> fans are “spoiled for choice these days.” Shiver</span><i><span>.</span></i></p> <p><span>But</span><i><span> Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> might give pause to series’ newcomers and veterans alike, since </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> is generally not named amongst beloved entries like</span><i><span> Dragon Quest III, V</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>XI</span></i><span>. 2000’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> for the PSX has a notoriously slow start that noodles away hours before you’re allowed your first taste of combat. It’s also not much of a looker, which is a shallow thing to say, but we were deep in PS2-mania by the time it came west. In any case, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> was ignored when it came to North America.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665145"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665145">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Square Enix has never given up on trying to get westerners to like </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>—not for more than a handful of years at one time, anyway—and we received </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII’</span></i><span>s full Nintendo 3DS make-over (subtitled “Fragments of the Forgotten Past”) in 2016. This iteration of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> fared better here: For one thing, westerners had stopped trying to hurt themselves by denying </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> as their lord and saviour by this point, and for another,</span><i><span> Fragments of the Forgotten Past </span></i><span>did a lot of trimming and slimming on the PSX game. The long introduction was nerfed, random encounters were done away with in favor of on-screen enemies, and other changes made it much easier to recommend the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> series’ blackest of black sheep to newcomers.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Reimagine Dragons</b></h2> <p><span>Well, move on over Nintendo 3DS, because the award for “Most Digestible Version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span>” now goes to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> for consoles and PC. Additional streamlining makes for a much snappier experience compared to previous releases, and the storybook-style environments and animations look wonderful. All that’s left is to evaluate </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> alongside other games in the series. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> is a rather linear game by design, with a story that tasks you and your pals with saving the world. It doesn’t feel as open and free as </span><i><span>Dragon Quest XI</span></i><span>, or even older titles like </span><i><span>VIII</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>III</span></i><span>. It’s still not a short game: You’re looking at around 60 hours. But if you like focused quests served to you with as few distractions as possible, expect some good eating here.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is the best version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> still isn’t my favorite </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game. (At least I still like it more than </span><i><span>VI</span></i><span>.) That doesn’t mean much in the context of the series. Like pizza, a </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game is never actually </span><i><span>bad</span></i><span>. It just doesn’t have your preferred toppings. Exploration is one of the things I love most about </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </span></i><span>has you hopping from one small island to the next, and most of them don’t offer a lot of opportunities to get sidetracked on your journey. You’re usually there just long enough to beat up whatever dark force is plaguing the area. Then you zip back to the future and admire your holy handiwork as a new “rediscovered” island resurfaces on your map.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Dragon Quest VII Reimagined           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Dragon Quest VII, only it's better than the last time they made it better."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>developer:</p>                 <p>Square Enix</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>type of game:</p>                 <p>RPG</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Wonderful environment and creature designs, double-fisting jobs is fun, even more bloat has been cut from the 3DS version of DQ7.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>disliked:</p>                 <p>Linear progression, so-so character roster.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>platforms:</p>                 <p>Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 (played on), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>release date:</p>                 <p>February 5, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>played:</p>                 <p>Rolled credits at about 60 hours, but haven't done post-game stuff.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>Yes, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is technically about time travel. You, as the Chosen One, quickly learn there’s more to life than the single island your family lives on, and you must dip back in time to solve the problems that keep each individual island shrouded in the dark. The further you progress, the more you learn about the apocalyptic war that cut the humans off from each other and allowed monsters to roam the world. But what can be done can also be undone. You know what you must do™.</span></p> <h2><b>Get a Job (Heck, get two!)</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> also saddles me with the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> cast again, and they’re just not my favorite group. The hero is the typical wordless Toriyama-designed </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> homunculus the player drives through the game. Maribel is abrasive, though she does soften up as the quest goes on. And there’s something wrong with Kiefer’s face. Every time I look at it, my brain screams what I can only describe as an ancestral warning not to turn my back on him lest he might shank me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It might be that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined’</span></i><span>s art style is just better suited for environments and monsters than humanoid characters. Unlike Kiefer, Ruff the wolf boy looks like he’s in his element. Something about his goofy perpetual grin meshes perfectly with the world and creatures around him. Speaking of creatures, the late, great Akira Toriyama whipped up a whole bunch of new critters for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span>, and they all translate brilliantly into </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span>‘s 3D space. Not only are the monster designs peak (as per usual with </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>), they animate fluidly too. Fur, scales, and metal are all textured and look fantastic.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665147"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665147">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I do miss having costumes for each job like with </span><i><span>Fragments of the Forgotten Past </span></i><span>(Ruff and his wolf pal just belong in sheep costumes), but it’s the trade-off for one of </span><i><span>Reimagined</span></i><span>‘s better examples of streamlining: The dual job system, which lets you learn more than one job at a time. Yes, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> has a job system, but you’re going to be disappointed if you expect the kind of character fine-tuning that </span><i><span>Final Fantasy V</span></i><span> allows. </span></p>

 <p><span>You only have access to a job’s skills for as long as you’re wielding that job. The idea is to open up as many jobs as possible by mastering other jobs, until you finally unlock the high-tier jobs you’re going to want to keep for the rest of the game. “Learning” jobs feels more like speedrunning them in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span>, but the job mixing and matching means you can make some pretty sick combinations of skills and spells that compliment each other. By the end of the game each fight starts to resemble a miniature episode of </span><i><span>Dragon Ball Z</span></i><span> as you and your foes trade blows of fire, ice, lighting, and steel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Do a Little Island-Hopping</b></h2> <p><span>The dual job system helps make </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> one of the friendlier </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> games for beginners. It’s not exactly easy, and bosses will still whup your under-prepared ass on a bad day. But it also lets you pull from a common pool of items in a fight (not something </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games typically let you do), and HP/MP restoration points are plentiful. The random battles are still gone here, same as they’re gone on the 3DS, but </span><i><span>Reimagined</span></i><span> does you one better by letting you attack and kill weaker enemies on the overfield. You’re not awarded as much experience for these fights, but the rewards still add up and you build levels very quickly compared to other </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665148" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665148"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665148">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is the point where I infuriate people who ask me, “But is </span><i><span>this</span></i><span> the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game I should start with if I’m new to the series?” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is not a bad place to start thanks to its lower difficulty and simple-to-grok job system. But I personally wouldn’t recommend it, especially if you prefer games that let you wander far and wide. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is a wonderful remake of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> 2000, but as I said earlier, all </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII </span></i><span>can be is itself with its small islands, portals, and a lot of walking back and forth to fix specific problems like appeasing an active volcano or helping a kingdom fight against rampaging robots. I’d more easily recommend </span><i><span>Dragon Quest XI, </span></i><span>which is a great entry point for anyone curious about 3D </span><i><span>Dragon Quest.</span></i><span> And of course, there’s the trio of HD-2D games that lay out the origin of everything </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is about. There’s nothing wrong with choosing </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> as your first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but remember what I said before? We </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> fans are spoiled for choice now. And with that last thought, celebrate and revel in our good fortune.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Wants To Use Gen-AI To Feed You Fake Podcasts Voiced by PlayStation Characters]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-gen-ai-fake-podcast-playstation-characters/</link>
            <guid>1423756</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Have you ever sat there and wondered how cool it would be to listen to a fake podcast presented by God of War’s Kratos or Ellie from The Last of Us? No? Well, you’re probably not alone. But for some reason, Sony thinks that’s <strong>exactly </strong>what people want, as a recently discovered patent reveals that the tech titan plans to use generative AI to facilitate such a concept.</p>



<p>In an uncovered filing, the ‘LLM-Based Generative Podcasts for Gamers’ proposal was unearthed, and it would use generative AI to create <strong>personalized podcasts </strong>voiced by some of PlayStation’s most iconic characters.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-wants-to-listen-to-ai-delivered-podcasts">Who Wants To Listen to AI-Delivered Podcasts?</h2>



<p>Sony’s latest patent publication aims to use a gamer’s personal profile to piece together an AI-driven podcast feed hosted by their favorite first-party characters. That means you could have Ghost of Tsushima’s Jin Sakai’s dulcet tones in your ear, moulded by AI, giving you the lowdown on gaming news that might interest you.</p>



<p>The background <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US471594142&amp;_cid=P22-MKTGE2-37885-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the patent</a>, submitted in 2024 but only just published on the WIPO platform, explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As recognized herein, video game platforms currently lack the ability to provide unique and targeted content to gamers to update the gamers about things that are happening on the platform. There are currently no adequate solutions to the foregoing computer-related, technological problem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-podcasts-games-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The lengthy summary of the proposed patent goes on to detail using an LLM (Large Language Model) to identify data associated with your PlayStation profile and then <strong>generate a podcast of news related to that data</strong>.</p>



<p>It would then be reeled off by a video game character of a game <strong>played by the video game player</strong>.</p>



<p>This could then be paired with video footage, trailers, screenshots, and other media.</p>



<p>But it would get pretty personal. The filing revealed how ‘the audio may include a joke at the video game player’s expense.’ Which means you could be roasted by a generative-AI podcast voiced by your favorite characters. Because that’s what we, as gamers, want.</p>



<p>The patent filing came with images that showed how this would fit on your PlayStation dashboard:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another image showed how a video podcast using this same format would work, using ‘desk hosts’ to give players something visual to focus on:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>At no point in the filing does it indicate how the voice actors for these characters would potentially be compensated or represented via this technology. It could be a nightmare for the actors who brought these characters to life, as while it’s their voices that are being used ad infinitum, the <strong>characters </strong>and their personas are owned by PlayStation and the vast number of studios under that banner.</p>







<p>Do you think there are any major concerns regarding this patent, and would you want to listen to gen-AI podcasts featuring your favorite characters? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>It appears that the press kit for Ubisoft's cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> would have included a collectible dagger.</p>
<p>A video which allegedly shows off this collectible was recently shared online, with the dagger being unpacked from a wooden box with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake markings.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The purported Sands of Time dagger itself, meanwhile, featured a golden painted hilt and iridescent resin-looking blade (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-collectible-dagger-looks-to-have-popped-up-in-an-unboxing-video-days-after-games-cancelation">IGN</a>). As well as the dagger, this unboxing video (which you can see below) included a display stand within the box, which again had the game's name written across it in gold writing.</p>
<p>While this dagger is, for now, only an alleged collectible for Ubisoft's Sands of Time remake, which would have been part of the press Kit sent out to media, many have said its reported existence shows just how close the Prince of Persia team was to releasing its game.</p><p>As a reminder, Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, but suffered numerous delays and setbacks since. This included the game seemingly being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">rebooted from scratch</a> in 2023. However, it seemed the great wait was coming to an end, as towards the end of last year, Ubisoft itself had its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">Sands of Time Remake slated for release during"Q4" of the current financial year</a>, which comes to an end on 31st March. So, in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>Alas, it wasn't to be, though, and last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft announced a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has Ubisoft for comment on the alleged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> press kit.</p>

<p>Soon after Ubisoft announced its company reset, the team behind Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time's embattled remake shared a few words of its own, acknowledging the cancellation was "deeply disappointing" for fans. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">it was keen to stress this "does not mean [its] stepping away from the franchise" for good</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roku-goes-big-for-the-super-bowl-with-nearly-50-off-its-2025-streaming-stick-hd-2000665111</link>
            <guid>1423741</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How old is the television sitting in your living room? Does it lack smart features and built-in streaming apps altogether? Or maybe it is a smart TV, but you’re simply not a fan of the manufacturer’s interface (yes, LG, this means your wannabe Wiimote-style motion controls). The good news is that you don’t have to stay stuck with whatever functionality your TV shipped with on day one. Grab a Roku streaming stick for next to nothing, and suddenly you’ve got a clean, dependable way to stream your favorite content and move through apps with ease. Under normal circumstances, the 2025 Roku Streaming Stick HD sells for around $30. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/">Right now, though, Amazon is offering a limited-time discount that drops the price by almost half, bringing it down to just $16.</a></p>
<p>This is the bare bones Roku streaming stick. This one doesn’t support 4K or HDR, but that’s not such a bad thing. The TV you’re putting it on might not support those either, so why pay extra for support you can’t actually take advantage of? Plus, so much content is only available in up to 1080p anyway so you’re really not missing out much.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Roku streaming stick is super low profile. It’s compact design allows it to just plug into an HDMI port on the back of your TV. It’s small enough that it won’t rudely block the other HDMI slots so you can still use them all for consoles or cable boxes or whatnot. The TV is also it’s source of power, so it won’t be taking up a valuable outlet along your power strip either.</p>
<h2>One Remote for Everything</h2>
<p>With the Roku streaming stick setup, you can use it’s remote to replace your TV remote for most daily use. It has volume controls and power controls, so unless you’re trying to adjust some specific setting on your TV (like turning off motion smoothing which you should be doing), the Roku remote will be the only remote you need to have out on your coffee table.</p>



<p>The remote even has a built-in voice function. This can be super useful when trying to pull up a specific movie or show. It’s far, far easier to just speak the words, “Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back,” then it is to type all that out on a digital keyboard with arrow keys.</p>
<h2>Watch It All</h2>
<p>Not only does a Roku streaming device allow for you to access all the great streaming apps like HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu, and Apple TV, but Roku even comes with a number of free TV channels&nbsp; with live news, weather, sports coverage, and more. That number is over 500, actually.</p>

<p>A terrifying new experience lies around the corner with the highly-anticipated release of Reanimal, which is set to make a splash upon its release date.</p>



<p>Coming from the developers of Little Nightmares 2, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/reanimal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a> offers a co-op <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horror</a> adventure through a disturbing world, and expectations are high for the Tarsier Studios title.</p>



<p>For all the release date details, the exact start time you can jump in and play, and all the platforms Reanimal is available on, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-reanimal-release-date">What is The Reanimal Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Frightening. Image by Tarsier Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Reanimal’s official release date is Friday, February 13, though the date may change depending on where you are located in the world.</strong></p>



<p>THQ Nordic has adopted a global release structure for Reanimal, meaning the game becomes available to all players around the world simultaneously. In some regions, this means Reanimal will actually be released on February 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-reanimal-start-times">Reanimal Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Reanimal releases at 6 AM PT on February 13, and the global release means simultaneous access for all players across the world.</strong></p>



<p>While this approach is familiar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> players, it may be a different experience for those on console, where many releases adopt a staggered release. When a staggered release is available, it opens the door for some ways to access games early. However, this isn’t the case for Reanimal.</p>
