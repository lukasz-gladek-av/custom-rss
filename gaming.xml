			<p>In 1957 in North West England, the worst nuclear accident in UK history happened – the Windscale fire. If you’re not familiar, this was when a fire burned for three days in a nuclear military facility in the Lake District, spreading radioactive fallout across the UK and the rest of Europe. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> is set in the wake of this disaster, inside a quarantine zone errected around the facility, where things are somehow even worse than they were in real life.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Pre-Launch Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RL57lHE-xvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with you waking up in a bunker with no memory of who or where you are. Stepping out into the open you’re greeted by a view of the glorious Cumbrian countryside. Also the Atom Plant shrouded in a hazy purple glow and an out-of-place red telephone box that starts ringing as you come closer. Should you dare to pick it up, an unsettling and very mysterious voice comes down the line, telling you that “Oberon must die” and to go power up something called the Interchange.</p>


<p>A lot of Atomfall is like this; flummoxing, strange, and thoroughly endearing. It’s easy to draw comparisons to Fallout with the setting, and it’s remarkable how well that comparison can stick – it’s set in the early 60s after five years of quarantine, so any sci-fi robots are right out of the vision of futuristic tech from that era, and could fit right in with a Fallout or The Outer Worlds. Atomfall has its own identity, though, both with the setting and the gameplay.&nbsp;I’m actually from the North West of England and hearing accents local to me in this game was actually a little strange at first.</p>


<p>Being set in the Lake District also brings with it some stunning environments, as well. Sharing a game engine with Rebellion’s Sniper Elite series, the game can look great as you look out across the landscape, but it’s fair to say that character models, lighting and animation feel pretty dated – this game is also coming to last gen consoles. It’s nothing too egregious, but it is noticeable in comparison to the quality of the environments.</p>
<p>The main thing that sets Atomfall apart, though, is that the threat here isn’t just radiation and we’re not in a post-apocalyptic world. Sure, there’s radiation around, even some poison, and an occasional electric wire hanging from the ceiling that always manage to walk into, but the biggest threat here is actually an infection. Ominous blue-y purple clouds and growths have taken root in places around the quarantine zone, seemingly the cause of people hearing voices and of the blue-y purple zombies known as Ferals that you’ll find.</p>
<p>Atomfall leans in on this for a good part of the mystery running through the story, but there’s no getting away from the familiarity of the gameplay they present. Ferals are tough to kill, growths explode when you go near them, it hurts when you stand on infected floors, and an infection meter fills up when you’re in the gas. It’s all rather standard. The novelty of unwrapping the game’s mystery wears off a bit after fighting off the third wave of zombies. I’m still very much interested in getting there, I just wish there was a little less stuff in the way.</p>

<p>Even when facing against roving groups of bandits and druids, there’s a roughness to the combat that starts to wear on you. The survival game leanings mean that you’ll be crafting throwables, using your ammo supplies sparingly, and wanting to use stealth and melee as much as possible. When you do go toe-to-toe with someone, the lack of a block means you’ll almost inevitably take damage – that always feels like failure to me.</p>
<p>Enemies tend to be in groups when they’re patrolling the open world, some of which will have ranged weapons. Getting the drop on a group or using stealth is key, whether that’s trying to do a stealth takedown or going all in with thrown Molotovs and shotgun blasts. They’ll happily empty multiple magazines of ammo in your direction, given the chance, but in true survival game fashion, they will only ever have a few bullets on them when you loot their bodies.&nbsp;Ammunition is conspicuously scarce in this game and only through meticulously looting everything – sometimes whilst in the middle of combat – was I able to find enough to avoid melee combat. Thankfully the shooting itself feels good enough.</p>
<p>Another issue is that your inventory is very limited. Important items you need take up space in there, including quest items. A single bandage, which heals maybe a third of my health, takes up one of your twelve inventory slots and they don’t stack, so just healing supplies will always take up a big chunk of space. Atomic batteries, an essential item for powering up the Interchange, also take up slots, as do any pistols or small melee weapons, painkillers I’m saving for a tough fight, or anti-infection drugs. This is addition to carrying items to sell to traders as there is only a bartering system and no currency, means you’re constantly evaluating and dropping stuff, which feels like it really gets in the way. The most generous part of the inventory is having four slots for long guns and weapons, and you’ll need all of them for switching as you run through your ammo stocks. Crafting supplies are gathered separately, thankfully, though this is constrained in its own way to keep you from having too big a surplus.</p>

<p>The main driving force is really the desire to keep exploring the lore and background of the world and setting. The narrative is structured around finding and following leads, whether they come from talking to people or picking up scraps of paper and notes from around the environment. You’ve got maps of each area, but points of interest are only filled in as you find them, and you’ll often find clues that lead you to map coordinates, or have someone mark a spot for you to follow up on. You can also just merrily stumble your way into some discoveries, giving a freeform feel to some parts of how the game’s story unfolds, beyond picking dialogue options and deciding which faction you want to align with.</p>
<p>A lot of the game experience can be adjusted and tweaked in the granular difficulty settings. There’s a bunch of presets that can put the focus more on survival or narrative, when compared to the standard suggested difficulty, but within that there’s individual settings to tweak up and down if you want to really customise it to your tastes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s some bugs that give the game a few blemishes, though mostly of the amusing or slightly advantageous varity. I cleared out a whole station of soldiers by climbing into a cafeteria and shooting them as they took cover behind two pillars, only to clip through to the other side. I’ve also had other AI oddities with enemies that inexplicably lose interest in me, or struggle to get to me, and I once saw one of BARD robots just shooting at a wall for some reason. I wasn’t even behind that wall, so maybe it was a random swarm of rats that the AI could detect, but I couldn’t see? I also encountered a couple of frame rate drops in combat on PS5, one specifically when I shot a giant robot in its gas cylinders, with accompanying fire and explosions. A patch is coming for release to address some issues, but we’ve found some that weren’t noted in the patch notes we’ve seen.</p>

<p>There’s a few quirks and hang ups, but I’m enjoying Atomfall. The world, setting, and story have me very interested in seeing how it pans out, though there’s a little voice in the back of my mind that says I’ve seen these story themes many times before, so maybe the ending won’t be as novel or unique as it wants to be. I still don’t know just yet, but it’s been an enjoyable time so far. Keep an eye out for our finished review, once I’ve finished exploring the deepest, darkest parts of Cumbia.</p>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; 5, Xbox One &amp; Series S/X</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellions-atomfall-single-player-survival-action-game-is-out-on-march-27-2025/">Atomfall</a> is a game that came out of nowhere for me. I was browsing Steam a few weeks ago, having taken a little break after the gaming marathon of Civilization VII and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and there it was: a post-apocalyptic game set in Britain. Considering I'm from Britain and have been to where this is based—that being Windermere—and I love Metro, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Fallout, and other similar games, it was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>With people running around in masks, battering innocents to death with cricket bats, or using a shiv to watch the life bleed out of them as they mutter utter gibberish about returning to the soil before telling you to "fack off", Britain in 2025 is an interesting place. Then we get Atomfall, set in a fictional post-apocalyptic Britain following the Windscale disaster, not the current post-apocalyptic Britain hoping to recover from the incompetent Tory government only to have a new Tory Labour government, mercilessly taking from the poor and disabled while catering to their wealthy overlords.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Taking place inside a quarantine zone following a disaster at a nuclear power station, it's not an open world but a connection of multiple open areas, Metro: Exodus style. Rebellion has captured the feel of the North-West quite well, to the point where I have been on Google Maps to figure out the exact location it's set in; I blame the road sign to Kendal for doing this to me. In terms of the story, there is more than just the nuclear accident, including a government coverup surrounding the accident and how it links to Oberon - the code name for a government project, which I won't spoil more of - and the impact on the surrounding area the combination of these have had.</p>
<p>The direct impact you will see is the area's abandonment and how quickly it delved into chaos. There are five open zones in the core playable area; Wyndham Village is controlled by the Protocol (the army) and is generally friendly and accessible except in a few places. Three of the other zones are controlled by the Raiders, Druids and Protocol, respectively, but parts of the areas are completely off-limits, and if you are spotted, you will be attacked. The remaining area is The Interchange, where the secrets of Atomfall are primarily revealed.</p>
<p>You'll find yourself moving between these areas, following clues and tasks from NPCs in the area, aiming to escape. You don't know why you're there, but you know you don't want to be. The way you move between the different objectives you find is how Rebellion has tried to differentiate Atomfall from other games. Rather than a quest log, you have "leads". It's a distinction with at least a little difference, as you have a collection of the notes and conversations to do with a "lead", and you can read through these to figure out exactly where and what you should be doing next, and more often than not the clues are reasonably obvious. What is more interesting is that you can frequently find the objective of a quest - or lead - before you've even seen the start, depending on your proclivity to explore.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Through this and the interconnected maps, where shortcuts can be revealed to make your life easier, Atomfall rewards exploration in a way many larger games forget to do. I should clarify that even when doing a significant amount of exploration, as I have been, you'll find Atomfall may only take about twenty hours to complete. Now, there is replay value in the fact that you have various stories, many of which can collide and result in one being cut off early.</p>
<p>Two, for example, are scientists around at the start of everything. One is hiding in the village, infected, but working on a cure and weapon to stop the source. Another left has come back and has been imprisoned. If they work on both stories but tell the first where the second is, he kills her - spoiler warning. This cuts off one possible story on escaping the quarantine zone. I don't know exactly how many threads are in the game, but at least five lead towards an escape. Do they differ? I can't tell you; I am keen to find out.</p>
<p>If I have an issue with the leads system, there are a few where you can be left a little clueless about what you need to do. There are a few where you are more likely to stumble across the next step than intentionally find it. Also, as mentioned in the above example, a decision you make can result in a part of the story being completely cut off from you. I don't want to say "with no warning" because when you listen to the audio logs and read the notes surrounding the two characters, only a moron wouldn't be able to figure out the outcome. I said to myself "he's going to kill her", before I even gave him the location. Some people may argue you need it made a little too clear.</p>


<figure></figure>

<p>Outside of the exploration and story, Atomfall is still more than serviceable. Combat isn't too dissimilar to other titles. Melee and Ranged weapons will be found or picked up from the corpses of enemies, and you have a limited ammo capacity. When the respective skill is selected, I think the ammo capacity is expanded alongside the capacity of your materials used for crafting. Either way, it feels pretty balanced, mainly as you can only hold a limited number of items.</p>
<p>Often, I've found myself hoarding enough ammo to then go into one of the - I'll call them dungeons - when I get out of the other end, I'm low on ammo and even low on some crafting gear since I've been making Molotovs on the fly. I've rarely found myself in a position I can't get out of, one way or another, even if it's just trying to be stealthy to avoid people, then doing a runner. I want to say the options are limitless, but they never are. It's either fight, run, sneak, or a combination of two or more.</p>
<p>Combat feels quite responsive, though; I will certainly give it that. Aside from lobbing a Molotov Cocktail, the most valuable skill in your arsenal is the option to kick an enemy. If you unlock the ability that gives it a better stun and knockback, you become challenging to beat in close quarters. Some of the stronger enemies, the thralls, will eventually get to you, but it becomes instrumental in the areas you find them. Creating space to reload your shotgun, to pump some extra shells into their heads. Also, aim for the heads; it does the damage. Even better, though, get a good rifle, keep your distance, and go for the head.</p>
<p>Once you realise how useful it is, the crafting becomes quite essential. I didn't touch the crafting system for much of the game beyond creating random Molotovs or sticky bombs. However, since the materials don't use inventory space, strategic thinking becomes all the more critical. Why carry multiple bandages with you when you can craft some? Later, when you learn how to upgrade weapons, you need to. Improving their damage, range and aim is crucial to surviving the late-game events.</p>


<figure></figure>

<p>I won't argue that Atomfall will be the next Metro: Exodus or something like that. I don't think it is. Atomfall sits in the realms of the games that died out a while back but are in a resurgence. Your non-Triple-A games aren't budgeted to blow apart the biggest releases, but they can do well if they get it right. The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a similar title, and look at what happened with the sequel. Atomfall strikes me as a similar title, with a style designed to reach as broad an audience as possible.</p>
<p>That this is on last-gen systems is proof enough, though I have to say that when playing it on the PC, with settings to max, I have no issues with the visuals. I'd argue that the more colourful and less realistic style adds charm to Atomfall, and frankly, I would say it looks and plays better than any of Bethesda's post-apocalyptic output. Hell, even it's more space-faring production.</p>
<p>I've only encountered a small number of bugs while playing through Atomfall; a few characters have clipped into each other, and beating robot enemies is a chore once you realise you can break their paths by having them spot you, and then you disappear. Without fail, they never seem to be able to go back to their patrol. Also, the most glaring issue is that enemies cannot see you or shoot you through windows - I can't explain how or why, other than maybe Rebellion forgot windows are transparent and break when a bullet hits them.</p>
<p>If I have another criticism, the audio, specifically the voice acting, can also be off. I understand the army having a mixture of accents, but the residents and other locals of the area should sound like they're primarily from Cumbria. There's something just a little off, though the reality is that nobody outside of the North of England will ever notice. I can't say anything massive about the soundtrack, to be honest. It works as it doesn't stand out, but at the same time, it doesn't stand out. Other audio effects are generally strong; nothing stands out like it shouldn't be.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As I've said, I can't honestly argue that Atomfall will be the next post-apocalyptic masterpiece. What I will say, though, is that it is a game I've had a fun and enjoyable time with. This is the sort of game you can pick up at a lower price-point (£45) than your traditional £60 "Triple-A" games, and you can have a good twenty-plus hours, or more, with it.</p>
<p>Atomfall looks good, plays well, and has a decent atmosphere. It has a reasonably interesting semi-open collection of maps to explore and the dungeons (for lack of a better word) that come with such a game. The combat doesn't feel janky, and the AI isn't terrible. It has an interesting story and tries something a little different with the quests system to enhance exploration. I hope this does well enough that we get the sequel treatment in the same vein as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> because we could see the next leader of the post-apocalypse.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles. The score likely doesn't reflect the game as well as it should, as I would heartily recommend this to anybody, with the added advantage that it's coming to game pass.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>An interesting story, adding to the generic "nuclear fallout" plot found in other similar titles.

</li><li>Good art design which enables it to look good, while also catering to last-gen consoles.</li>						</ul>

<p>As revealed by Mintrocket in a new Dev Dive video,&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>on April 10th. It'll be available across all platforms on which you can play the game, and it'll introduce everyone's favorite lovable goof Ichiban Kasuga to the Blue Hole.</p>

<p>This will be the latest in a long string of&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro" rel="nofollow">collaborations</a>; the game has also entertained the likes of fiendishly addictive roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, potion sim&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>, and Shift Up's&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</em>, among others.</p>

<p>Rather sweetly, Hwang shows off some of the goodies he got when meeting longtime&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>producer Masayoshi Yokoyama at last year's Tokyo Games Show, including signed copies of&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&nbsp;</em>and a Korean translation of the script for the first&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>As for the crossover DLC itself, it'll see Ichiban and the bartender of his hangout spot Survive visiting Dave and Bancho's restaurant. As you might expect, it's not peaceful for long, and soon, Ichiban finds himself drawn into yet another adventure.</p>

<p>You can look forward to a new side-scrolling beat-'em-up minigame, as well as&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>'s signature karaoke and appearances from several other franchise favorites. Hwang says he "basically put everything [he likes] about&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>into this collaboration".</p>




<p>Unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>crossovers,&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>will be paid DLC, which Hwang acknowledges might be "disappointing" for some. He also announces that the DLC will only be available for a "limited time of six months".</p>

<p><em>Dave the Diver</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>DLC launches on April 10th.

<p>Atomfall’s world has fallen into chaos and is a windswept wreck thanks to the Windscale disaster. You need to venture into the game to explore and exterminate threats if you hope to complete the Atomfall Trophy list and dust off all Trophies and Achievements along the way.</p>



<p>Rebellion’s 2025 is a hot one with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>. Resistance is a one-man crusade through Nazi-occupied France, whereas Atomfall is an alternate-history England where the infamous Windscale nuclear disaster turned out to have more serious consequences than we all thought.</p>



<p>We’ve called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-played-again-most-anticipated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall one of our most anticipated games of the year</a>. The setting, the subplots, and the scarily eerie nature of its world all play a factor. There’s a lot to uncover, and you need to undertake a heavy workload for the Atomfall Trophy List.</p>



<p><strong>Spoiler Warning: Atomfall’s list has hidden Trophies and Achievements. We will show you the known objectives first, and it’s up to you if you want to see the rest.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-atomfall">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in Atomfall?</h2>



<p><strong>A grand total of 37 PlayStation Trophies and 36 Xbox Achievements await you in Atomfall.</strong></p>



<p>Veteran hunters know why there’s a notable difference between PlayStation and Xbox. But if you’re new to this game, PlayStation users are awarded a Platinum Trophy for earning all 36 other Trophies. Microsoft hasn’t implemented a similar system yet, but you still get a hefty amount of Gamerscore instead.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is enormous in more ways than one. It has a gigantic open-world map, a staggering array of enemies to assassinate, and branching skill paths spread across two playable characters. It also has a stream of endgame credits that scroll up your screen for a whopping <strong>two hours</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s right – the credits that roll at the end of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will occupy two whole hours of your life if you intend on watching them through to the end, which is a painful thing for any developer wanting to wait around to catch their name in the mix.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-speed-it-up">Speed It Up</h2>



<p>Admittedly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a two-hour roll of credits because the text goes by so slowly – for no real reason.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, Video Game Credits captured the PC credits and uploaded the full segment to YouTube, with the video totalling <strong>three and a half hours</strong>. The soundtrack that plays behind the credits is pretty impressive, but nobody needs to wait around that long to catch their name.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows (Credits) (Windows)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5VYcPXnuDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>For reference, Video Game Credits has documented the following feature-length credits segments:</p>



<ul>
<li>GTA V Enhanced – 01h08m</li>



<li>Hearts of Iron IV – 01h06m</li>



<li>Gangstar New Orleans – 01h07m</li>



<li>Battlefield 2042 – 1h15m</li>



<li>The Sims 2: Ultimate Collection – 1hr19m</li>
</ul>



<p>Don’t worry, though. You can speed up the credits by tapping (and holding) fast-forward, just in case you want to scroll through to a team you perhaps worked on for a nice social media snapshot.</p>



<p>If anything, it’s indicative of the sheer scope of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which is going down in reviews as one of the best games the series has seen in many years. It’s great, but it’s not perfect, and if I had to put a number on it, I’d say it’s an 8 out of 10.</p>



<p>The game has had a couple of issues since being released on March 20, though. For instance, a day one patch was released that stripped the ability to damage shrines, which was in response to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/">the Japanese government</a> expressing concerns about ‘imitation attacks’ at shrines across the country.</p>



<p>Do you plan on watching the entire Assassin’s Creed Shadows credits roll? Let me know in the comments why you would and what’s wrong with you.</p>

Concurrent players on PC via Steam for its launch day also look good compared to the previous release, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but there is a caveat here.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">It's not even 4PM here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!<br>Thank YOU from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan.

Valhalla adopted a different approach when it first launched on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and even Google Stadia in November 2020. While it was available on PC as well, it was an Epic Games Store exclusive until November 2022. When it reached Steam, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2208920" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it peaked at 15,431 concurrent players</a> in December 2022.</p><p>On its first day, Shadows eclipsed that with a peak of 41,412 players and that number has already grown to 42,415. In comparison, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/3035570" rel="nofollow ">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> has a peak player count of 7,837, and at the time of writing, Shadows hasn't beaten <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/582160" rel="nofollow ">Origins</a> (41,541 concurrent players) or <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/812140" rel="nofollow ">Odyssey</a> (61,984 concurrent players) numbers yet. Concurrent players typically increase on the first weekend after launch as well, so these numbers could still potentially increase further.</p><p>With Ubisoft undergoing financial struggles recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-is-bit-of-an-existential-moment-for-ubisoft-analyst-says/1100-6530208/">analyst Joost Van Dreunen explained how Shadows</a> could be a "bit of an existential moment" for the company. In an interview, Van Dreunen explained how if Shadows can do "really well" in terms of sales, that could "go a long way toward repairing [Ubisoft's] financial position."</p><p>In related news, a new update for the game now prevents players from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-update-makes-key-changes-to-shrines-amid-cultural-sensitivity-discussion/1100-6530252/">destroying certain items in shrines</a>, possibly as a response to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's criticism of the game and the discussion around potential cultural insensitivity.</p><p>If you're planning to get started in the new Ubisoft game and you're looking for a few tips, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-guides-hub/1100-6530214/">Assassin's Creed Shadows guides hub</a> for a selection of walkthroughs.

                <p>FBC: Firebreak is an upcoming co-op shooter from Control and Alan Wake studio Remedy, and the game is currently confirmed for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>, as well as to buy outright. It's a "mid-priced" game that will have free post-launch DLC along with paid cosmetics. FBC is canon to Control and some characters from that game could appear in FBC, Kayatta told Kotaku.</p><p>As for Switch 2, it's set for release later this year, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">major reveal planned for April 2</a>. Given the immense success of the existing Switch, many are expecting strong third-party support, but as mentioned, it's too early to say if FBC could be among the list of titles coming to Switch 2.</p>

			<p>The Xbox UI is set to change significantly in the future, and it may soon show Steam games that are installed on the system, judging from an image shared online that was promptly removed shortly after.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a>, an image was shared in a new blog post titled&nbsp;<em><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">"Opening a Billion Doors With Xbox</a>," </em>which highlighted changes in the game industry and users now tending to engage with games across multiple devices, showing how the Xbox UI could change in the future to account for this tendency. What makes this new interface interesting is a clearly visible Steam label in all variants of the interface: TV, tablet and handheld. According to unspecified sources, Microsoft is working on an Xbox app update that will show every game installed on a PC, including games purchased on other digital storefronts like Steam and the Epic Games Store. As this Xbox app update is still in the early stages of development, however, the inclusion of all installed PC games in the interface may be scrapped as work continues.</p>
<p>Besides working on a new Xbox UI and app update, Microsoft is also hard at work on the hardware side of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation plans</a>, which include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a handheld console. In addition, the company is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">reportedly working with ASUS</a> on a handheld known as Project Keenan that will launch later this year. This handheld system, which will look markedly Xbox, will run full Windows with a focus on the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. As such, it will definitely be able to run games purchased on Steam and other digital storefronts, so it wouldn't be surprising for the new UI featuring the Steam label to launch alongside the system.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date-set-for-june.1141221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nightdive has announced the&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>release date, with the reworked version of the classic FPS coming to PC and consoles in summer.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster will be launching across PC and consoles (that's current-gen and last-gen consoles, happily) on June 26th.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering what happened to Nightdive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-is-being-ported-to-kex-engine" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed</a>&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition</em>, this is, in fact, that very thing; the project was renamed to&nbsp;<em>25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>earlier this year, but it's still the same, ahem, enhanced edition Nightdive has been working on for the past few years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=u9-8m4kP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=J5FgeGFv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster is coming in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As you've probably come to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">expect</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Nightdive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-studios-remastering-shadow-man-restoring-cut-content" rel="nofollow">remaster projects</a>,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new features to the iconic 2000 FPS-RPG.</p>

<p>You can expect a visual revamp that will touch up some of the game's rougher edges and models without deviating from Irrational and Looking Glass' artistic vision, as well as some minor quality-of-life improvements, controller support, and more.</p>

<p>The game will also support Steam achievements, as well as achievements and trophies on the relevant consoles, and it'll boast 144fps and ultrawide support too, so this'll likely be the best-looking version of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>you can play (without mods, of course).</p>

<p>On the subject of mods, Nightdive is also promising expanded mod support for&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>, so if you want to turn all the enemies into Mr. Blobby and work out some very specific trauma, you should find it pretty easy to do so.</p>




<p>It's worth remembering that although Nightdive is the studio responsible for 2023's excellent&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-goes-gold-release-date-for-pc-announced" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, this project isn't on the same scale; it's not a full reimagining, but a remaster, so bear that in mind if you pick it up.</p>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>launches for PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013043" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/System-Shock-2-25th-Anniversary-Remaster/9P4FK543SMZF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch on June 26th. Make sure you pick this one up if you're interested in a revamped slice of FPS history.</p>

<p>It’s time for a new expansion with Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Shining Revelry content. We’re already putting Triumphant Light behind us as we’re being blinded by the long-awaited arrival of Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;in Shining Revelry.</p>



<p>The next main-set Expansion is here, and it’s called Shining Revelry. A fitting name as it welcomes Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;variations into Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Shinies have become part and parcel of the Pokémon&nbsp;experience in the mainline games and Pokémon&nbsp;GO.</p>



<p>It’s Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s turn to have Shinies, and they are the centerpiece attraction of Shining Revelry.</p>

<figure><figcaption>I’ve looked at this for hours. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry expansion comes to us on <strong>March 27</strong>—giving you only a few days to fill in the gaps of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-triumphant-light-secret-missions-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> and other sets.</p>



<p>The headline-makers we’ve seen—so far—in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Pocket</a>‘s Shining Revelry set are a <strong>Shiny Charizard ex</strong> and a <strong>Shiny Lucario ex</strong>. They look absolutely stunning, and it introduces a new form of rarity to the grading system.</p>



<div><article><p><span>It’s time to shine ✨ in the latest </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a><span> expansion!

Shiny Pokémon arrive alongside Pokémon from the Paldea region in the upcoming expansion, Shining Revelry! Available on Thursday, March 27.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry’s debut likely coincides with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ranked-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-period-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Battles</a>. The PvP mode was announced a while back after being a rumor. So it’s a double-whammy for Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket players as the mobile app continues to Rock Smash it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Entertainment Software Association has unveiled the Accessible Games Initiative, which aims to help people understand accessibility features available in video games. The US-based effort came about from some of the biggest companies in the industry: Nintendo of America, Sony, Microsoft, Google, EA, and Ubisoft.</p><p dir="ltr">The Accessible Games Initiative is kicking off <a href="https://accessiblegames.com/accessibility-tags/" rel="nofollow ">with 24 tags</a>. So far, they're categorized under four different features--auditory, gameplay, input, and visual--and then specified from there. For example, there is a Full Input Remapping tag, meaning the game offers the ability to swap button actions, joystick functionality, and other controls. This differs from the Basic Input Remapping tag, advertising only buttons can be reconfigured. Other official tags include Narrated Menus, Playable With Mouse Only, Color Alternatives, and Large Text. These should start appearing on digital storefronts and product pages in the near future.</p><p dir="ltr">"Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that comes with playing video games," ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis said in a press release. Specifically, <a href="https://accessiblegames.com/" rel="nofollow ">the Accessible Games Initiative website</a> points out that 44.1 million US residents have a disability, with reportedly almost half of them playing video games.</p><p dir="ltr">The ESA states that Amazon Games, Riot, Square Enix, and WB Games have joined the Accessible Games Initiative. This is just one of the latest pushes for better accessibility in the gaming industry. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-adaptive-joystick-is-available-now/1100-6530210/">Microsoft revealed the Xbox Adaptive Joystick</a> that looks similar to a Wii nunchuk.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/21/empyreal-looks-like-a-stunning-new-indie-action-rpg/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There seems to be a major movement towards bigger, bolder indie RPGs right now, that push the boundaries of what we should expect in the indie space. We’ve just had the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/eternal-strands-review/">Eternal Strands</a>, and now Empyreal is heading towards launch on the 8th of May. The development team at Silent Games is keen to give players an early glimpse of the game, and to help them understand the world and some of the systems that they’ll encounter so they’ve dropped an all-new overview trailer with a heap of detail to dispense.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empyreal - Official Game Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>In the seven-minute Game Overview video, creative director Joseph Rogers delves into the game’s key mechanics and narrative. You can learn more about the stories waiting to be told, the myriad ways to build your character, and how the mysterious Cartograms will affect every journey into the belly of the Monolith.</p>
<p>Empyreal is described as a feature-rich action RPG where players explore an imposing Monolith and fight to survive against the guardians that lie within. Uncover a complex narrative combining mythology, philosophy, and transcendental revelations as you lead an Expedition further into the structure to discover the truth that lies at its core. There’s already a demo available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377700/Empyreal/">PC players via Steam</a>, so if you fancy checking it out early, you can!</p>

<p>The main features of the game are a unique and complex combat system, a memorable cast of characters, with personal questlines and multiple endings for each one. A beautiful but shattered ancient world, where you can explore breathtaking environments filled with hidden details. You can also customise your character with a vast array of equipment and collect armour sets that confer powerful bonuses, while upgrading and modifying the loot you find. Besides that you’ll ablso unlock new abilities to personalise your playstyle.</p>

<p>It definitely looks fantastic, and we can’t wait to show you more. Empyreal will release on 8 May for PC via Steam, PlayStation®5, and Xbox Series X|S. Empyreal is priced at £24.99/$29.99/€29.99, with a 10% launch discount on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features some brand new gameplay mechanics that set it apart from past entries in the series. After accepting the vast majority of main and side quests, the game won't tell you outright where to go and will only provide some general hints regarding where you have to go, leaving you on your own to search for your next quest objective. If you want to speed up this process, you will have to use <strong>scouts</strong>, but every season, you will only be able to use them for a limited number of times, and you will have to wait for the season to change if you want to use them again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250321131024_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully,<strong> you are not forced to wait for a season to change if you want to use scouts again</strong> after depleting their use and if you are willing to spend some resources. Besides forcing a partial season change via the main menu when the compass in the top right of the map hits south, which still requires time to pass, in any <strong>Kakuraga safehouse</strong> that you have unlocked, you can <strong>refill scouts</strong>&nbsp;by interacting with the sacks hanging on one of the walls and paying 200 mon. Constantly refilling scouts can be a costly endeavor, so you should still avoid abusing the system, but in case of emergency, this option is extremely handy to have, especially if you prefer to use scouts to salvage Stockpiles from enemy strongholds or use them to clear the Wanted status instead of using them to find quest objectives faster. To expand and improve the capabilities of scouts, you will need to upgrade the Kakurega in your Hideout to level 2 and the Stables.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250321132000_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you like using the scout system in Assassin's Creed Shadows a lot, you will also want to recruit as many scouts as possible. To do so, you will need to upgrade your <strong>Study</strong> in the Hideout, as each upgrade will increase the number of available scouts up to 9. You will need a lot of resources to do so, and the best way to gather enough of them relatively quickly is to complete the seasonal contracts available for each region, besides clearing enemy camps and strongholds. Much like refilling scouts, seasonal contracts can be accepted in any Kakurega.</p>

<p>The dust has finally started to settle on Monster Hunter Wilds’ incredible launch. But if you thought Capcom would leave it there, you’re deadly wrong. We’re just getting started, and the newly announced Monster Hunter Wilds First Title Showcase coming in April is the next phase.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game in the United States</a> in 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds is also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-become-the-fastest-selling-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling game in Capcom’s long and illustrious history</a>. They’re some impressive accolades to shout from the mountains. Although I wouldn’t recommend it as you’re likely to disturb <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/creature-coin-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ancient Wyverns</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-catch-whoppers-in-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoppers</a>, and other other-worldly creatures.</p>



<p>The first major content injection is on the way courtesy of the Monster Hunter Wilds First Title update. A Showcase has been set in stone which will unveil new footage and features.</p>

<p>Capcom has announced a Showcase for the first Free Title Update in Monster Hunter Wilds. The presentation is set for <strong>March 25</strong>, with the update launching in “<strong>Early April</strong>.”</p>

You can watch the show on the <a href="http://twitch.tv/monsterhunter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds Twitch channel</a>, and it will show “Mizutsune and a host of other new additions.”</p>

This will be our first real look at the creature, how it fights, and how you can prepare yourself for the titanic battle.</p>



<p>Capcom is making sure fans are eating good. If this announcement isn’t a testament to that, you only need to look at the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-promotion-is-rewarding-players-with-lots-of-free-goodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds promotion offering free goodies and bonuses</a>.</p>

The first of these, <em>FEAR</em>, is now in.</p><p>Meanwhile, 2004's <em>Silent Hill 4</em> has joined the program with the addition of “restored scenes that were never available on PC before,” according to a press release from GOG. This includes missing “hauntings,” the strange events that occur, which GOG found were in the PC code but never included—their engineers have dug them out and got them working.</p><p>Alongside those two headliners are some other classic games that could easily merit the same moniker. Stone-cold classics like <em>Deus Ex</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2</em>, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption</em>, <em>Alone In The Dark 1</em> to <em>3</em>, and all eight original <em>Ultima </em>games are also now included, meaning they will be constantly maintained to work on modern PCs for as long as GOG exists (and, the company told me, it has plans in place to ensure preservation can continue if it was to go away).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14-patch-notes-for-7-2-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Final Fantasy 14 is gearing up for the colossal 7.2 update titled Seekers of Eternity. Square Enix isn’t content to sit around and leave us all wondering though. The developer has already showcased the preliminary patch notes revealing much of what’s to come in the update.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-director-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> can release as many remakes and new mainline FF entries as it wants. However, none of them are likely to have as great an impact as Final Fantasy 14 Online continues to have. With tens of millions of subscribers coming back each month, FF14 Online is where it’s at—and new DLC expansions help.</p>



<p>Every so often a giant update comes along with a content pile so big it makes the content of Santa’s sleigh seem minimal. The Seekers of Eternity 7.2 update is the latest and great patch for Final Fantasy 14, so let’s check it out.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-14-update-7-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 14 Update 7.2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>March 25 is when the Seekers of Eternity update goes live in Final Fantasy 14.</strong></p>



<p>There’s also a cinematic trailer to get you ready for the incoming content and patch notes. You can check it out here.</p>

<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-14-seekers-of-eternity-7-2-update-reveals-many-changes">Final Fantasy 14 Seekers of Eternity 7.2 Update Reveals Many Changes</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-quest-to-complete">New Quest to Complete</h3>



<p>A ton of new quests have been added requiring the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14s-dawntrail-launch-trailer-tells-us-more-about-the-expansions-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawntrail expansion</a>. This includes Main Quest missions, Chronicles of a New Era quests, side missions, and more.</p>



<h3 id="h-battle-system-bolstered">Battle System Bolstered</h3>



<p>We know there’s a new dungeon to explore called the Underkeep. Plus, Season 8 of Final Fantasy 14’s PvP is set to get underway, and many other changes and tweaks have been made to combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-greater-graphics">Greater Graphics</h3>



<p>Square Enix has made a serious graphical improvement to lots of the game’s weapons and accessories, improved the resolution for vegetation and environmental objects, and adjusted lighting and shadows to appear more realistically.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A wealth of content. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to Square Enix, we have the <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/ad533b893feebc1a06995b73a33497345dfcd8aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Seekers of Eternity 7.2 update patch notes</a>. Here, you can see every single change, which piece of DLC you need to benefit properly, and what to expect overall.</p>



<p>This should keep Final Fantasy 14 fans ticking over until the 7.3 update and the eventual successor to Dawntrail.</p>

		<p>It’s a great time to be a driving game fan, with 2025 already hotting up with the arrival of games like Wreckfest 2 and Assetto Corsa Evo. Firmly on our upcoming radar is JDM: Japanese Drift Master, which might boast a Ronseal-styled name, but which is looking absolutely incredible, especially if you have any interest in the Japanese drift scene (watching Fast &amp; The Furious: Tokyo Drift doesn’t count, Initial D does).</p>
<p><iframe title="JDM: Japanese Drift Master | Eurobeat Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFOkWEiIhIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer shows off more of the drifting action as racers slide their way through neon-infused Japanese cities and towns through to the beautiful, traditional countryside. The team have used their own photos, as well as images lifted from Google Earth to truly capture the look and feel of the country, something that it looks as though they’ve absolutely done.</p>
<p>This new trailer features an exclusive Eurobeat song that’s been written for JDM: Japanese Drift Master. Called LIFESHIFTFIRE!, it’s an electrifying Eurobeat track composed by Kamil Hasselhoff, Naski, and Marga, and it made its international debut during the Future Games Show. Music looks to play an integral part in the game, and in keeping with the drift scene, it’ll bounce between Eurobeat, Dance and Nu-Metal while you’re trying to achieve drift supremacy.</p>


<p>There’s a fully featured story mode here, and you’ll play Polish driver Touma, a new entrant on the scene. It’s up to you to take him from a nobody to the drift master, and there’s a great bunch of licensed cars from manufacturers like Nissan and Mazda in which to do it. JDM looks like it should be fairly welcoming too, with a Simcade driving setup that will give you heaps of control, without being too exacting.</p>
<p>JDM: Japanese Drift Master is due to arrive on the 21st of May, and will be available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/japanese-drift-master-b4fd48?__cf_chl_tk=b5um8CjyirgFe0bmT1hc5EMp5tCkEheD_xZPmT01ybw-1742556033-1.0.1.1-H9l41dC590rpjYP0w1iB5coAWf3qRK_AtPiNvYL45T4">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/japanese_drift_master">GOG</a>.</p>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows reached an important player number milestone on its first day of availability, Ubisoft confirmed.</p>
<p>A few hours after the latest entry in their series launched on PC and consoles, the publisher confirmed the game had passed 1 million players. While it's not clear how many have accessed the game via a Ubisoft + subscription, this is definitely an excellent result which bodes well for the upcoming weekend, when the number will likely get higher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It's not even 4PM here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!</p>
<p>Thank YOU from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you! 💝 <a href="https://t.co/1cqwABrQfN">pic.twitter.com/1cqwABrQfN</a></p>
<p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While not exactly attempting to push the boundaries of the open-world RPG formula established by Origins, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a more than worthy new entry in the series. Despite its often inaccurate recreation of Feudal Japan, it attempts to bring back stealth gameplay into the spotlight while not doing away completely with the combat-focused approach seen in Valhalla, making for a surprisingly varied experience. You can learn more about it in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

		<p>It’s the time of the week where we’re starting to hit cruise control, readying ourselves for two days of chilling out, time with family, and hopefully, one or two video games. But first we have to tell you what we’ve been playing <em>this</em> week, and I have to say I’m feeling a renewed love for gaming at the start of 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds has probably helped with that, though friends and family alike already feel that they’ve squeezed nearly everything out of the launch build, and are now impatiently waiting for more.</p>
<p>I’ve played a bunch of my Dreamcast favourites on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, as well as continuing with my run through Yakuza: Like a Dragon which I’m really enjoying. Other than that, I’ve been playing Wanderstop for review, and I loved returning to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> in its Definitive Edition.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, Helldivers 2, and “Generically Dull RPG With Too Much Talking #23787, aka Dragon Age: Veilguard”. Also Split Fiction which he says, “Is just fab.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile <strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent the week playing Atomfall for review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">AC Shadows for some guide work</a>, plus some Phasmophobia and Earth Defence Force 5 with his sister.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit more Witcher 3, starting the Hearts of Stone DLC. He’s also played Football Manager 24, telling us, “I gave up the FC Brea save as that was too impossible. Now I’m at SC Bastia and overachieving with them. Expected mid-table but currently flying in the promotion places.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still working his way through Mafia III, though he thinks he’s on the home stretch now. He said, “I’ve had a good time with it but it definitely suffers from that open world bloat that’s become prevalent in a lot of games. Story missions are gated behind open-world activities to the point where – 25 hours in – I’m eager to wrap things up and move onto my next game.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> was on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows review</a>, which he thoroughly enjoyed! Also, Split Fiction, “it’s fantastic!” and watching his partner play Two Point Museum, which “looks loads of fun!”</p>
<p>Joining us from the States, <strong>Miguel</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-review/">Atelier Yumia</a>, Zenless Zone Zero, Girls Frontline 2 EXILIUM, and the Demon Tides demo!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> is thankfully on the mend, and he’s been able to get some gaming time in along the way. He told us, “My recovery has not been accompanied by Nintendo titles as I had thought it would, with Avowed instead providing a surprisingly chilled out RPG experience. Combat is a little dull but the world is cool to explore. I’ve also spent some family time playing through Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which is more bloated and unnecessarily expanded than my gallbladder was when I went to A&amp;E… but a lot more fun than that experience.” Glowing praise indeed!</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has also dipped a toe in with Atomfall’s opening hours and is looking forward to more, but the game that’s really starting to gets its hooks into him is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/">33 Immortals</a> with its large scale action-RPG raid battle vibes. He’s even roping me in to start playing it with him.</p>
<p><em>But enough about us, what about you? What have you played?</em></p>

<p>After a hugely successful release, it seems several studios are already set to battle it out to claim the rights to a full-length Split Fiction movie—bringing the dramatic journey of Mio and Zoe to life.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-trophy-and-achievement-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> had the tough job of following up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>—2021’s Game of the Year. I’d argue that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-reaches-major-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of two million copies sold in just one week</a> has put this doubt to rest. Josef Fares and his team have done it again, and it looks like another triumphant statement that cooperative multiplayer sells.</p>



<p>Now, it’s time to see if the medium is as effective on the big screen. A Split Fiction movie is heavily rumored—barely two weeks removed from its debut—and it looks promising.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the 2025 Game Developers Conference has birthed Split Fiction movie talk. Story Kitchen is the company potentially “<strong>Putting together the film’s cast, writers and director into a package as offers for the rights keep coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios.</strong>“</p>



<p>Again, the rumor and chatter come directly from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gdc-awards-balatro-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC 2025</a>, so it remains to be seen if the talk will continue once the event has concluded. Hopefully, a Split Fiction movie has better luck than the It Takes Two one. A movie for the previous co-op title was given the go-ahead, but it apparently remains on hold for now.</p>



<p>If we do get a Split Fiction movie, will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-split-fiction-voice-actors-revealed-who-voices-zoe-mio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoe and Mio’s voice actors</a> get to reprise their roles? Only time will tell. For now, we’ll continue to lap up every second of Split Fiction. After all, new secrets keep being discovered such as the now-infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-split-fiction-laser-hell-secret-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laser Hell Secret Hell</a> featuring a guest appearance from director Josef Fares himself!</p>
