			<p>Coming to any game over a year since its release can be a daunting prospect. Stuffed full of alterations, adaptions, and updates, it’s often hard to know where to begin. This is even truer of a complete edition, which can be overwhelming in the sheer weight of content it throws at you from the very beginning. Add to this that the game is a rock-hard evil blighter that hates anyone who plays it and you can see why I was a little anxious about commencing playing Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty – Complete Edition for review.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Complete Edition" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2odHwyi49t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hailing from Team Ninja, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty wowed souls-like fans when it debuted last year with its fluid, violent, swordplay and surprisingly coherent story. Now the Complete Edition is here, and it is an absolute beast of a release. Alongside the original game, you get all three DLC packs; ‘Battle of Zhongyuan’, ‘Conqueror of Jiandong’, and ‘Upheaval in Jingxiang’. That means all the new weapon types and armour sets are available from the get-go. As is all the equipment and stages from Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s collaborations with Lies of P, Nioh 2, and Naraka: Bladepoint.</p>


<p>If all that wasn’t enough, and it really should be, you get a vast swathe of new endgame content that plays like a roguelike and, like Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, never seems to end. That’s an awful lot of Wo Long for your wonga.</p>
<p>If you were thinking that Team Ninja would have come up with some fresh presentation for the Complete Edition then, well, you’d be wrong. This is the base game with the DLC bolted on, absolutely no new visual bells and whistles here. Also, the DLC content is hidden away behind the fact that you need to be around level 80 to experience it. As such, if the hardcore arcade soulslike gameplay of Wo Long isn’t your thing, then you won’t even be able to give the DLC levels a try.</p>


<p>If Wo Long clicks for you, and you make it that far, then the DLC is all of a particularly high standard. Each new chapter adds new baddies to be murdered by, as well as some suitably epic divine beast encounters that will truly punish any gamer’s skills to the limit. Even better, the DLC stories skilfully fill out on missing elements of the main game’s narrative.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, if you’ve ever been tempted by Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, then this is the version to get. It’s remarkable how well the game plays; combat and movement are silky smooth, the parry system is masterful in its intricacies, and the morale mechanic adds a neat twist to the soulslike formula.</p>
<p>A word of warning, it can be hard to find anyone online to co-op with, and when you do they tend to be so skilled that they destroy everything whilst you check your nails. Fortunately, the AI comrades do a great job in their buddy role, so if you want to get by on your own, that’s totally an option. Even better, the historical setting and characters are utterly glorious in their presentation, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms has never looked better.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty – Complete Edition is, without a doubt, the ultimate form of Team Ninja’s soulslike series. It’s just a shame that no attempt has been made to make this edition more accessible for a new player and to explain the game’s complexities more clearly. Still, if you wanted things easy, then you wouldn’t want Wo Long.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The Asus ROG Ally X is the best a Windows gaming handheld has ever been. It’s got the most comfortable grip, the smoothest gameplay, and the longest-lasting battery — three of the elements that make a PC gaming experience truly <em>portable</em> for me.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">Most of this is no surprise</a>: It’s smooth because Asus makes the only handheld that pairs AMD’s powerful Ryzen chips with a variable refresh rate screen, which better syncs up with your game. It’s got longer battery life because Asus now stuffs an 80-watt-hour pack in there, the biggest we’ve seen in a handheld to date. The battery’s so big, you can <em>keep</em> that AMD chip humming at higher power levels for higher framerates.</p><p>But what might surprise you is this: the Ally X is the first handheld I can recommend alongside my gold standard for handhelds: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">the Steam Deck OLED</a>. That is, if you’ve got a few extra bills burning a hole in your pocket, don’t mind wrestling with Windows, and trust that Asus has actually learned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus">its customer support lesson</a>.</p><p>My ROG Ally X review unit arrived just before I went on vacation — the perfect opportunity to test its massive 80Wh battery. As of today, I’ve spent more than 24 hours playing actual games on the Ally X.</p><p>At first, the battery life didn’t seem like anything special. When I navigated the Japanese high school demon drama of <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> at maximum brightness in the car and on the beach, I got 2.5 hours per charge. That’s not enough to last the drive from Northern California to Southern California, at least not without an external battery. I did get an entire additional hour in <em>Dave the Diver</em> compared to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">the Lenovo Legion Go</a>, but my total runtime of 3 hours, 19 minutes still paled in comparison to the Steam Deck OLED’s total of 4 hours, 42 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>But when I fired up more demanding games, the Ally X pulled far ahead. I got nearly an entire extra hour of <em>Armored Core 6 </em>(2h59m) and an extra half-hour of <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider </em>(2h41m) at 720p and medium spec, using the Ally X’s default power mode. That’s the best I’ve seen handheld for games that intensive!&nbsp;</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->25</p><div><figcaption><em>Want to see some comparisons to the original ROG Ally and Steam Deck? Here are my photos with the final Ally X, followed by earlier comparos with a near-final one.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>Then, I played two full hours of one of the most demanding PC games currently in existence: <em>Alan Wake II.</em></p><p>Technically, the ROG Ally X is the first handheld that even begins to meet <em>Alan Wake II’s</em> system requirements. It wants 16GB of system memory <em>and</em> 6GB of VRAM, and it’ll throw errors at launch if you’re short; on the original ROG Ally and Steam Deck OLED, which have to share 16GB between system memory and GPU, the game is a choppy mess.</p><p>But the ROG Ally X has a full 24GB of shared memory, and it shows! At a 540p render resolution, upscaled to 1080p with AMD’s FSR 2.1 tech, I could actually delve through the game’s lush, eerie forest without wanting to throw my handheld against the wall. The game did dip as low as 29fps in combat, but I saw a smooth 35–45fps just running around.</p><p>It felt playable enough that I finally sat down and <em>beat the game </em>on Ally X — and I had enough battery to do so for two full hours using the Ally X’s 25W “Turbo” mode.</p><p>As you can see in my <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25542989/247200_Asus_ROG_Ally_X_ReviewDSC02310.jpg">comparison</a> <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25542990/247200_Asus_ROG_Ally_X_ReviewDSC02311.jpg">screenshots</a>, the game’s only running 5fps faster on the Ally X when Saga’s standing still over this corpse. But when we’re playing a game that would dip below a smooth 30fps <em>if not for that boost —</em> on a handheld with VRR and <a href="https://www.displayninja.com/what-is-freesync/#lfc:~:text=refresh%20rate%20range.-,LFC%20(Low%20Framerate%20Compensation),-As%20long%20as">Low Framerate Compensation</a> that works right down to 30fps — it makes all the difference in the world.</p><p>In game after game, benchmark after benchmark, the Ally X produces the smoothest gameplay I’ve seen from any handheld, even in the valleys and caves of <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> where the Legion Go technically produces more frames per second. That’s because Asus’ screen is dynamically working to smooth things out. (Even the Steam Deck OLED’s brighter, more colorful, and faster-responding OLED panel can’t match it there.)</p><p>Speaking of benchmarks, <em>Alan Wake II</em> isn’t the only game where the Ally X pulls ahead. Despite having the same AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip as the original ROG Ally, the faster memory, more efficient cooling, and power tweaks make their mark.</p><div><p><em>Tested at 720p low, save</em>&nbsp;Dirt Rally<em>&nbsp;at 720p ultra. Ally X tested with 15W custom TDP, 17W “Performance”, 25W “Turbo”, and 30W “Turbo” AC modes. </em></p></div><p>While you should note that the Ally X now defaults to a new 17W “Performance” mode rather than 15W, I’m getting better numbers in almost every game with the newer handheld, regardless of wattage.</p><p>See how <em>Returnal </em>is now hitting 38fps in my 720p benchmark in the 25W “Turbo” mode, up from 33 with the original Ally? Like <em>Alan Wake II</em>, I bet that means it’s finally enjoyable on a handheld.</p><div><figcaption><em>The ROG Ally X’s massive 80Wh battery is bigger than that of most laptops. It’s also easy to remove: four Philips head screws, no glue.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But again, power is only half the performance story. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review#:~:text=ROG%20Ally%20wattage%2C%20May%202023">A year ago</a>, the original ROG Ally drained its 40-watt-hour battery pack at 40–50 watts in Turbo mode, meaning you’d get less than an hour of gameplay if you ran the Ally that fast away from a charger. With the Ally X, I’m draining an 80-watt-hour battery pack at 33–40 watts in Turbo mode, generally giving me two full hours in a worst-case scenario.</p><p>I’m not even seeing any slowdown as the battery reaches empty — it’s good all the way down to the 3 percent mark, when it puts itself in hibernation, and I can begin playing again at full speed almost as soon as I plug into the wall.</p><p>Even configured to its lowest wattage of 7W TDP, the Ally X isn’t as power-hungry as the original. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> gave me over eight hours of magic roguelike poker at 50 percent brightness, by draining under 10 watts the whole time. So far, my best result was total battery drain of 7 watts in <em>Slay the Spire</em>, down from 9 watts with the OG Ally. At that rate, the Ally X should be able to play for 10 entire hours before shutting down.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The ROG Ally X is still easy to repair — though slightly harder to pop open — and Asus tells me it’ll offer spare parts this year. </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld#:~:text=to%206%C2%B0C-,cooler.,-1/11"><em>More insides here</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’m not going to rehash everything I already told you about the ROG Ally X in my early hands-on — there are so many substantive little changes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review#:~:text=ROG%20Ally%20wattage%2C%20May%202023">they deserve their own story, and I’ve already written that one</a>. But I suspect you may have three distinct questions that deserve answers here:</p><div><ul><li>How are the revised ergonomics and other physical changes?</li><li>Can Windows really be so bad that you’d choose a Steam Deck with worse performance?</li><li>Why trust Asus when it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus">dodged our SD card reader defect questions</a> and its customer support reputation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus">is in the toilet</a>?</li></ul></div><p>I find the ROG Ally X <em>so much more</em> comfortable to hold than the original, despite its additional weight. The meatier grips, triggers, and pebble-shaped omnidirectional back buttons no longer have any protrusions to get in the way. The joysticks and bumpers feel tighter and more premium, the face buttons have a deeper (though noisier) throw, and the D-pad has gone from meh to quite decent — though I am already getting an annoying squeaky sound when I press the down arrow. The fan is also genuinely quiet, not that it was an issue with the original.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I like that you can activate the back buttons from practically any angle. The </em><a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25474422/rog_ally_x_verge_sean_hollister_019.jpg"><em>ROG microtexture</em></a><em> is neat, too.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It’s also nice to have twin USB-C ports for charging and peripherals, even if I haven’t yet been able to hook up a Thunderbolt eGPU (Asus tells me there’s a driver issue with AMD eGPUs at the moment).</p><p>But I vastly prefer the Steam Deck’s symmetrical analog sticks, which always lie right under where my thumb naturally lands, instead of the Ally’s offset right analog stick that makes me uncomfortably shift my grip. I miss the larger screen I get on other handhelds and their less cramped 16:10 aspect ratio.</p><p>And I cannot stand that Windows <em>still</em> cannot reliably make a gaming handheld <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.audible.com%2Fpd%2FGo-the-F-k-to-Sleep-Audiobook%2FB00551W570"><em>Go the Fuck to Sleep</em></a> and reliably wake up again. The Nintendo Switch does it perfectly, and the Steam Deck does it nearly perfectly, but I couldn’t keep track of the number of times Windows decided it could no longer recognize my fingerprint on the sensor or black-screened my game, or the Ally X simply woke up again the moment I set it down, or Asus’ Armoury Crate settings app simply forgot my choices (like whether to turn on my joysticks’ RGB lights) on wake.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Windows is still lurking under the surface.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’m happy to say that Armoury Crate has actually improved tremendously over the past year — the game launcher now intelligently sorts my games, lets me easily map buttons and gyro controls for fine aiming, and seamlessly downloads updates (including BIOS updates) without navigating to a website or separate app.</p><p>But it’s nothing compared to the ease of use of SteamOS and its compatibility with generations of older PC games thanks to community support — and Windows itself is more of a pig than ever. I spent nearly 45 minutes waiting for mandatory updates and clicking through unwanted offers for various Microsoft products before I could use the Ally X for the first time.</p><p>Did I get a joystick-navigable virtual keyboard or PIN screen or a pre-mapped Alt-Enter shortcut for my trouble? Nope — instead, Asus added a Copilot shortcut, there’s a copy of Outlook sitting on my taskbar, and OneDrive is on by default. The only mercy is that Microsoft Teams doesn’t launch on startup this time.</p><p>As far as the whole SD card situation, Asus has only told me that it’s not the same reader as the old one that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision#:~:text=And%2C%20while%20Asus%20still%20won%E2%80%99t%20admit%20that%20the%20Ally%E2%80%99s%20SD%20card%20reader%20ever%20had%20any%20fault">it won’t admit has an issue</a> — it’s the one it uses on laptops. That’s somewhat reassuring, I guess. I haven’t yet had issues playing games from SD after a week of play, in case you’re wondering.</p><p>The ROG Ally X doesn’t check all the boxes I personally need in a handheld. The one-two punch of performance and battery life is tempting, but not tempting enough to steer me away from a $549 or $649 Steam Deck OLED that will play my legacy library of Steam games more easily, then reliably go to sleep when I want to put it away. The customer support controversy is just one more reason to hesitate.</p><p>But if you must have Windows or play the latest games on the go, the Ally X is the best Windows handheld yet. I hope it normalizes bigger batteries and VRR screens, and I hope Asus will seriously consider a SteamOS version, too. I hope to test it <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-3-6-0-update-released/3000">with Bazzite</a>, an unofficial SteamOS clone, later this year.</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The entirety of Blizzard's 500-strong World of Warcraft development team have unionised, making it the largest group within Microsoft's gaming teams to do so thus far.
</p>
<p>
Around 1750 employees within Microsoft's gaming teams are now unionised, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-24/world-of-warcraft-unionizes-growing-foothold-at-microsoft-s-activision-blizzard">Bloomberg</a> reported yesterday, including those working on Blizzard's veteran MMO.
</p>
<p>
World of Warcraft developers will now be represented by the Communication Workers of America (CWA), which celebrated the inclusion of Blizzard staff yesterday in a statement which dubbed the joining as the "first wall-to-wall union at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>", and "a key inflection point in the broader movement for video game worker organising industry-wide".
</p>
<p>
Blizzard unionisation leaders have said they want to improve standards of pay, as well as the company's stance towards remote work and diversity. 
</p>
<p>
There's also a hope that the mass unionisation of the entire World of Warcraft team will act as a blueprint for other developers across the industry.
</p>
<p>
"It's exciting to potentially raise the standards of the entire industry as siblings in organising," World of Warcrft designer Kathryn Friesen said.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has once again voluntarily recognised the union, as it has done with others in the past - most recently, the 240 staff at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and The Elder Scrolls 6, who similarly voted to unionise last week. 
</p>
<p>
The Xbox maker previously pledged not to hamper unionisation efforts among staff, as part of its long-running but ultimately successful Activision Blizzard buyout. 
</p>
<p>
"Unionising one of the most successful games ever signifies the rising power of worker solidarity across the industry, from AAA studios like Sega and Bethesda to indie developers," CWA spokesperson Tom Smith said. "What seemed impossible six years ago is now a reality, and this is just the beginning. 
</p>
<p>
"Together, workers are redefining their industry. Up until now, my proudest WoW moment was successfully main-tanking RoS as a prot warrior, stance-dancing with no off-tank back during TBC. But what these amazing workers have done today leaves that in the dust."
</p>
<p>
"When workers have a protected voice, it's a win-win for employee standards, the studio, and World of Warcraft fans looking for the best gaming experience," said World of Warcraft test analyst Eric Lanham. 
</p>
<p>
"Through our union, we're ready to tank any obstacles, heal any wounds, and DPS through the challenges ahead," he continued. "Together, we will ensure a full tier set bonus with the inclusion of all job titles in the same union. Like the legendary heroes of Azeroth, our union is forged in the fires of perseverance and resilience, and together, we will stand strong as the Alliance and the Horde to ensure a bright future for all."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-app-steam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation VR2 app Steam Store page has gone live today, providing more information on how users will be able to use Sony's VR headset on PC.</p>
<p>The page, which can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, also features some screenshots showcasing the setup process, and the app's release date, which is planned for August 7th, the same day the PC adapter will released at select retailers and on PS Direct. The store page also lists the system requirements, which are identical to those shared by Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-system-requirements/">last month.</a></p>
<p>While the headset will retain its basic functionality on PC, the PlayStation VR2 experience on PC will not be the same as on PlayStation 5. Some key features, such as HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking and adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback, won't be supported. However, 4K visuals, a 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, see-through view, and foveated rendering should provide a more than acceptable VR experience with the many VR games available on Steam.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation Portal system software update went live a few hours ago, introducing improvements to the Remote Play-focused handheld device released last year.</p>
<p>The new update, version 3.0.1, not only introduces unspecified system software performance and stability but also expands connectivity options by allowing the system to connect to a wider range of public networks, including certain 5GHz networks. Regarding performance, multiple users on the system's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1ebjb6w/update_just_dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subreddit</a> report improvements, but more thorough testing will be required to see if the improvements are actually real.</p>
<p>Albeit small, it is nice to hear Sony expanding the PlayStation Portal options, as the system has the potential to be something more than just a Remote Play machine. As of now, at least, the console does well what it is meant to do, as highlighted by Kai in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>The PlayStation Portal isn’t quite the portable successor that players have been asking for from Sony since the decline of the PlayStation Vita. That being said, the PlayStation Portal does one job and does it exceedingly well. It might not reinvent the remote play experience, but for those relying on controller clips to mount a phone to the top of a DualSense controller or third-party controllers that use a mobile device as the display, an official Sony product just makes sense for a unified solution. It might not replace those Backbone controllers and other devices that players might have in their home, but the PlayStation Portal might wind up being the controller that players start reaching for first.</em></p>
<p>The PlayStation Portal system is now available worldwide</p>

<p>A man confessed to sending 39 threats to Nintendo last year during a trial last month, which led to the cancellation of one of their gaming events. The Judge passed the final verdict for the man’s actions yesterday; the accused will be sentenced to one year in prison along with four years of work suspension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per <a href="https://nordot.app/1188760785942986824?c=39546741839462401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nordot</a> (via <a href="https://splatoon-torikara.com/archives/42988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Torikara Sokuhou</a>), the Judge passed a sentence against the man threatening Nintendo, sentencing him to one year in prison and suspending him for four years. Judge Hiroshi Kawakami charged the man with obstruction of business and stated, “The damage was great, and the responsibility is not light” (as translated by Google Translator).&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>A Nintendo employee also provided a statement, revealing that the situation with these threats deeply affected them. The threats reminded them of the ‘Kyoto Animation arson and murder case’, and they were ‘terrified’ due to that. The 39 threats that the man sent Nintendo included messages like ‘I’ll kill everyone involved. You should be careful about events with spectators.’ Kyoto Animation Arson is a reference to the 2019 arson case at an anime studio, where 36 people tragically passed away.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Judge Kawakami’s verdict was based on the man’s selfish motive for the crime against Nintendo. He committed the crime to relieve stress caused by online gameplay. The Judge described his actions as persistent and malicious.</p>



<p>In the earlier report, a 27-year-old Hitachi City employee was identified as Kenshin Kazama, and the prosecution revealed that the threats against Nintendo caused staggering damage of around caused damage worth ¥700 million or around $4.3 million. The prosecution sought a one-year imprisonment and managed to achieve that ruling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo has announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-new-2-way-joy-con-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new 2-way Joy-Con stand</a>.

Concord may fare better on PS5 (Sony does not make PlayStation player numbers public), but tough questions will surely continue around whether the game hits Sony’s commercial expectations for it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Sony has found enormous success going down the PS5/PC cross-platform route for fellow PlayStation live service, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>. Arrowhead’s third-person co-op shooter, which also launched at $40, is PlayStation's fastest-selling game of all time with over 12 million sold in 12 weeks. Early indicators suggest Concord will struggle to emulate its live service predecessor’s sales success.</p><p>Meanwhile, Firewalk confirmed Concord does not have a PvE mode at launch, although pointed to the addition of new modes in the future. Concord launches with the six 5v5 PvP modes seen in the beta, alongside 12 maps and hundreds of customization items to unlock.</p><p>The idea is Firewalk will release new characters, maps, and plenty more as part of regular post-launch seasons. Cinematic vignettes will be released weekly in-game at launch (three we shown during the beta). These let you get to know the characters and learn about life as a Freegunner and the broader Concord galaxy.</p><p>One big problem the beta suffered from was no mid-match leaver penalty, and no join-in-progress system. That meant players would be faced with playing as part of an under strength team, or against a team short on numbers, which would encourage more players to leave.</p><p>Firewalk said “ensuring teams are complete and evenly matched throughout a game is a priority for us,” and confirmed plans to explore the potential of a leaver penalty system “to incentivize players to start and stay in complete teams,” but it doesn’t sound like it will be in place for launch.</p><p>And finally, at launch, Concord will have its training mode and Galactic Guide unlocked.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>I've never been a poetry guy, not because I don't like it, I've just never gone out of my way to read them over books or whatnot. The poems I've engaged with the most are those read out during wedding ceremonies, those that pop-up before the start of a horror game, or <a href="https://826dc.org/student-writing/the-tiger/">The Tiger</a> by 6-year old Nael that occasionally pops up as I'm doomscrolling. But thanks to the multiplayer web game "fridge poetry", where you drag words to create poems, I might become a day-to-day poem guy. Going off my first effort, I don't think many will appreciate my career switch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Head on over to <a href="https://playhtml.fun/fridge.html">this site</a> and it'll transport you to the web's fridge wall, complete with loads of magnets folks have already popped on there and arranged to create poetry. At the bottom right, you can generate your own words, too. All you have to do is drag a word around and plop it next to any others, rearranging existing poems or creating your own. And what's really nice is that you can see other people's cursors as they go about their business, before they disappear into the ether.</p>
<p>My first poem? I saw my opening, the moment I laid eyes on the fridge door: the night consumes <em>blank</em>. I saw the word "fortnite" hovering nearby. Smugly, I put the two together: the night consumes fortnite. I think of it as a sort of contemplation, let's say, on how Fortnite both consumes people's evenings and is also being consumed itself. Consumed by Disney and Lego and Ariana Grande - perhaps gleefully. The word "night" also sounds like "nite", which I thought was clever.</p>
<p>Someone immediately dashed my work, hopping in to unpick my poem before leaving (fair enough). So I left another poem later, simply entitled: rock, paper, shotgun. And just as I did so, someone else generated the word "frotnite" and positioned it above "fortnite" in what was a rather beautiful thing that happened in real time.</p>
<p>Other poems on the door at the time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>every raccoon is gay</li>
<li>meow! meowmeowmeow</li>
<li>Dismay@aol.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, I really like that last one.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-best-guns-tier-list-weapon-stats">Apex Legends</a> developers Respawn Entertainment have announced that poorly-received plans to overhaul the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">battle royale</a>'s Premium Battle Pass will be partially walked back. Most crucially, the new passes – set to launch alongside the upcoming Season 22 in August – will no longer be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-new-battle-pass-plans-promise-greater-rewards-but-for-more-of-your-real-world-money">sold exclusively for real-world cash</a>; as with previous BPs, players will still be able to buy them with accumulated in-game currency.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"You’ve spoken, and we’ve listened", opens the statement on the official <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1816156552396734859">Apex Legends TwiXer</a>. "With the release of Season 22 we will restore the ability to get the Premium Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins. We recognise that we could have handled the Battle Pass changes better – that’s on us."</p>
<p>Several other changes will still go ahead, including the switch from one Premium Battle Pass per season to one smaller (yet still more reward-stuffed) PBP per half-season. Yet these were never the target of player ire, which has been laser-focused on that hard cash requirement since it was revealed by publishers EA a couple of weeks ago. In essence, this would have denied dedicated players the chance to earn future Premium Battle Passes for no additional cost, as each pass includes enough Apex Coins as levelling-up rewards to cover the cost of the next one.</p>
<p>Happily, that can now continue, as even these truncated half-season passes will dish out 1300 coins when completed – more than enough to chain together successive purchases. A wise change of course, then, even if it’s one that probably shouldn’t have been necessary in the first place. If you're curious, here's a full breakdown of each tier's price and goodies:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/apex-legends-content-przepustka.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Respawn Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>EA and Respawn aren’t entirely abandoning the cash-for-passes model, though, as in addition to the Premium Battle Pass, Season 22 will also introduce Ultimate and Ultimate+ Battle Pass tiers, each offering yet more rewards – and costing $10 / $20 respectively, with no Apex Coin option. While that means some will end up forking out <em>$40 per season </em>if they pick up both Ultimate+ passes – good lord, people, control your hat urges – I wouldn’t expect these to draw the same kind of rancor as the original set of changes. Beyond a couple of timed-exclusive skin variants, they’re only serving up some extra crafting materials and loot crates over the Premium tier, and are more of a genuinely optional upgrade that won’t leave Apex Coin buyers in the lurch.</p>

            <p>
Fallout: London, the fan-made game-sized mod for Fallout 4, will be released today. The mod's creators confirmed the release to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-london-bethesda-mod-tomorrow">Inverse</a> - saying the date was now definite, "unless nuclear war happens".
</p>
<p>
Developed by Team Folon, the mod has been over five years in the making and transports the post-apocalyptic game to England's capital city, with a whole new story, environments, characters, factions, weapons, and gameplay elements.
</p>
<p>
Due to its size it won't be available on popular mod hosting sites, so is instead <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london">available on GOG</a> with a custom launcher.
</p>

<p>

Note, however, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4s-next-gen-version-to-play-that-massive-fallout-london-mod">mod is currently not compatible with the next-gen version</a> of the game, so players will need the pre-patched version (1.10.163.0). For this reason, players on Steam will need to downgrade before installation. As previously reported, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-will-work-with-fallout-4-on-gog-and-steam-but-not-epic">mod is not compatible with Epic</a> due to lack of rollback features.


</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-fallout-london-finally-gets-a-release-date">mod was originally set for release on April 23rd this year</a> (fittingly, St. George's Day), but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">release was delayed due to Bethesda's next-gen upgrade</a>.


</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has followed development of Fallout: London for some time. Most recently, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-cast-will-include-former-speaker-of-the-house-john-bercow">former Speaker of the House John Bercow would be lending his voice</a> to an AI robot, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-adds-baldurs-gate-3-actor-to-its-cast">Neil Newbon - voice of Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3 - is also in the cast</a>.


</p>
<p>
The release of the Fallout: London mod will likely be boosted by the popularity of Amazon's Fallout TV show. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">watched by 65 million people in its first two weeks</a> and has just recently been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-adaptation-nominated-for-16-emmy-awards">nominated for 16 Emmy Awards</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-series-creator-talks-about-the-unexpected-challenges-posed-by-more-realistic-graphics.936240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-series-realistic-graphics/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Dragon Quest series is facing some unexpected challenges posed by more realistic graphics, according to the series' creator Yuji Horii.</p>
<p>Speaking with<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/240722m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Denfaminicogamer</a>, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/dragon-quest-creator-talks-about-an-unexpected-challenge-the-series-is-facing-due-to-graphics-becoming-more-realistic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton</a>, the popular RPG series creator talked about some unexpected challenges for the franchise posed by more realistic graphics. As now character models have become more expressive and detailed, having a silent protagonist, or "symbolic protagonist," as Horii-san calls it, who allows players to be the main character of the story has become more difficult. With more realistic and detailed graphics, a character that just stands there will look like an idiot.</p>
<p>The Dragon Quest series creator feels there is no easy way to address this, as making the character react to events would ruin immersion. This, according to Yuji Horii, will become even more of a challenge in the future, so the day that the series will feature a different sort of protagonist may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, things are remaining as they have always been. The next entry in the series, the long-anticipated Dragon Quest III HD-2D remake, will feature a silent protagonist and many of the features that have always defined the series. You can learn more about the remake launching later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grit-and-valor-1949">Grit And Valor 1949</a> certainly evokes the tactics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into The Breach</a>, with its stompy machinery and floating tile battlegrounds. But, despite all appearances, this one isn’t actually turn-based at all. A tiley, tiny real time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> then? Aye, and one that’s actually pretty frantic as it happens. Missions are snappy, intense skirmishes. You’ll fight off waves while trying to protect your useless, freeloading command vehicle. This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.</p>

<p>Set in an alternate World War II, in which Europe has been destroyed by officious enemy commanders aggressively wielding grandiloquent moustaches, Grit And Valor 1949 has you play as an allied resistance force campaigning to plant a very large EMP in the Axis base. Set the device, and reduce all their scary mechs to so many spent disposable vapes and Apple products that have passed their preprogrammed obsolescence counter. It’s got some mid-mission rogue-y bits where you’ll progress down a mission tree, collecting upgrades and doing some mech tinkering. The meat of it is the missions, where you’ll command a team of rock-paper-scissors aligned mechs to fend off enemy waves, and maybe do some sub-objective capturing too.</p>
<p>These tiles keep lying to me, making me expect some sort of action economy, but no! You can move your mechs around freely. Really, the tiles are just there to signify your stomper’s firing range. There’s cover dotted about the map, as well as terrain advantages, so you end up rushing to set up little phalanxes between waves. There’s even extra mech abilities, like mine laying and the Mech Special, i.e a large jump that crushes whatever it lands on. It’s very much a learn-as-you-do game. The tutorial is solid as far as teaching the basics, but even the first mission drops a lot of different options on your plate as far as approaches go. The initial enemies are quite weak, to be fair, so there’s a margin for error here. I think it’s cool! Lots of ideas, really good energy to it. Also, mechs.</p>
<p>Best of all, there’s a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911860/Grit_and_Valor__1949/">Steam</a> at time of writing. If you like your mechs buried behind about 800% more interface, however, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mech-engineers-demo-is-for-people-who-love-hateful-interface-design">Edwin has you covered</a>. Unrelated, but has anyone made a mech game about giant evil Furbys with no fur yet? That’d go unbelievably hard, I reckon.</p>

            <p>Fallout: London, the massive fan-made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod set in Poundland Prime (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-dogs-legion-how-to-talk-like-a-fackin-future-fackin-cockney">No Elephants, Some Castles, Canary Wharfare</a>) has finally got a release date. Happy days, it’s actually today, Thursday 25th July. The news comes from <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-london-bethesda-mod-tomorrow">Inverse</a>, who’ve sent their dear alsatian companions sniffing around the mod’s Discord. Yesterday, Team FOLON lead Dean Carter shared the song I Just Can't Wait (For Tomorrow) then, when sniffed at harder, confirmed that the 'Tomorrow' part meant tomorrow (as in, today), "Unless nuclear war happens."</p>

<p>Fallout: London is, of course, the massive total conversion mod for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in dear ol’ blighttown. Uh, blighty. It’s from a team of around 50 developers, and over 200 contributors, which is wild and humbling and, gosh, we don’t deserve modders. Activities include shooting antique rifles, dressing like a bobby, and milking mutant cows. There’s even a bulldog, named Churchill, that you can recruit as a companion. It’s a wildly ambitious and impressive project, featuring a load of quests, plus original voice acting from the likes of Neil Newbon (from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>), and former UK Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow (not from Baldur’s Gate 3, iirc.)</p>
<p>Originally set to release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-london-the-impressive-fallout-4-mod-thats-basically-a-whole-new-game-has-a-release-date">back in April</a> after five years in development, Fallout: London was delayed indefinitely thanks to a chaotic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-update-fallout-4-for-your-next-generation-pc">'next-gen' update</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-sized-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-has-been-delayed-indefinitely-by-bethesdas-incoming-next-gen-update">broke a lot of mods</a> and generally made people quite unhappy. It is, of course, oh-so-easy to adopt the misinformed stance that that big bad Bethesda clumsily got in the way of people trying to make their game interesting. So, anyway: Bethesda messed everything up for the people trying to make their game interesting, and the team had to delay things so they didn’t break.</p>
<p>More recently, Team Folon sent <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1809555735681913115">a build to GOG</a> for testing, and it turned out that they still couldn’t get London and the next-gen update to play nice together. As such, players will need to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-want-to-play-that-whopping-fallout-london-mod-youll-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4s-next-gen-version">downgrade their copies of Fallout 4</a> to run the mod. No hassle - London will ship with a custom installer that also does the downgrading for you.</p>
<p>"GOG have been amazing through all of this. To be honest, we've been the ones causing them the issue," Carter told the Discord, via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-devs-confirm-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4-next-gen-version-not-stable-enough">VG247</a>. "What with us having things break due to the next-gen [update] and then needing the 3rd parties to update, then waiting for them to be fixed, only for the fact that at the 11th hour we've discovered that the next-gen [version of Fallout 4], even after updates, isn't stable enough and thus we are now going out on the old version - [hence] the need for a downgrader."</p>
<p>Anyways, that’s all in the past now, and Fallout: London looks to be playable and set to arrive just in time for the weekend. You can find the mod on GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london">here</a>. Oh, and if you missed the other good Bethesda news, Bestheda Game Studios <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">announced a 'wall-to-wall' union</a> this week.</p>

<p>Concord’s beta hasn’t been a huge success for Firewalk Studios. It fell flat on its face on Steam, the number-one storefront and launcher platform on PC, drawing in just a few thousand players. Now that the dust has settled following the end of the beta phase, we can confirm that nobody wants to wishlist the game, indicating that the beta didn’t hit the spot with gamers anywhere.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Concord sits at #793 on the Steam Wishlist Leaderboard – and it’s being released in just under one month.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-doa">DOA?</h2>



<p>Concord is a free-to-play shooter from Firewalk Studios that’s being released on PlayStation and PC next month. That’s the first indicator as to why so many people haven’t wishlisted the game – it’s <strong>free </strong>and there are no bonuses added for doing so. Presently, just 4,129 people have wishlisted the game on Steam, which is a paltry figure (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/concord-top-750-most-steam-wishlisted-games-after-disappointing-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanks to TheGamer</a> for noticing this miserable performance). </p>



<p>To put that into perspective, here are the wishlist numbers for some other upcoming titles:</p>



<ul>
<li>STALKER 2: 217,854 (#4)</li>



<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite: 119,076 (#13)</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2: 61,630 (#24)</li>



<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard: 42,524 (#55)</li>



<li>State of Decay 3: 14,441 (#153)</li>
</ul>



<p>It was recently revealed that Concord <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-wont-have-a-battle-pass-and-will-add-new-characters-and-maps-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have a battle pass mechanic</a> – but it will have cosmetic-based microtransactions. That’s something of a win for players, but it’s not enough good news to drive up the hype for the upcoming shooter. </p>



<p>Concord was revealed during Sony’s latest PlayStation showcase, but it didn’t turn too many heads. For one thing, people are generally tired of the Overwatch-esque first-person hero shooters. It’s an overdone trope that’s no longer interesting or innovative enough to make gamers excited.</p>



<p>Are you going to give Concord a try when it releases next month?</p>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> have quietly released a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> demo on PS5. If you’ve yet to play the open world samurai sim, you can head over to the PlayStation Store now to download the playable preview. This arrives alongside a new title update – <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1816130076385456418/photo/2">version 1.07</a> – that includes fixes for a swathe of minor bugs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of the Ronin - The Aftermath Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34FMSgdzzvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Those who have been sitting on the fence will be able to play the game’s first chapter in full, the Rise of the Ronin demo having no time limit. Naturally, you’ll be able to carry over your save data should you pull the trigger and purchase a copy of the full game.</p>
<p>The latest PlayStation exclusive from <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> studio, Team Ninja, Rise of the Ronin is an action RPG game set in Japan during the transformative Bakumatsu period. This era, spanning the late 19th century, marked the end of the Edo period and the coming of the Meiji Restoration, characterised rapid modernisation, clashing cultures, and the move away from long-held Japanese traditions.</p>
<p>Rise of the Ronin casts players as, well, a ronin: a samurai warrior with no master, free to roam Japan at a time of major political and social upheaval.&nbsp;On your historical quest, you will engage with various factions vying for power, including the Tokugawa shogunate and imperial loyalists.</p>


<p>One of the game’s highlights is its frenetic melee combat which expands over time as you level up and unlock a broad arsenal of weapons. Unlike previous Team Ninja titles, Rise of the Ronin features an immersive open world that can be explored on foot, horseback, or even airborne.</p>
<p>In our own review we scored it a stellar 9/10, Aran saying that “Rise of the Ronin is a massive gamble for Team Ninja, known for its more linear action games, but it’s one that has paid off. Rise of the Ronin has a lot of depth to it from the satisfying combat, to all the side activities across three broad regions, and the plethora of excellent characters. This game should mark the start of a grand new era for Team Ninja.”</p>

<p>Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm vanished exactly one month ago after allegations surfaced claiming he was inappropriately messaging a minor several years ago, which ultimately led to his permanent ban from Twitch. In a lengthy statement posted on Twitter, the charismatic and controversial streamer copped to it, stressing that ‘nothing illegal happened’ but that the messages ‘leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate’. He then said he would be taking an extended vacation with his family and promptly disappeared.</p>



<p>Now, for the first time in a month, he has updated his social media channel on Twitter, changing his banner image to something cryptic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-with-dr-disrespect">What Happened with Dr Disrespect?</h2>



<p>Dr Disrespect was shunned by the wider gaming community when the news surfaced that he’d been inappropriately messaging a 17-year-old female on Twitch in 2017. He lost connections and sponsorships, and he was even forced to leave Midnight Society, the development studio that he founded to create an extraction shooter – DEADROP.</p>



<p>He was called out by his closest peers on social media, with the likes of TimTheTatman, NICKMERCS, and Ninja saying their piece about the debacle.</p>



<p>Now, in a subtle change, Dr Disrespect <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has updated his Twitter</a> (now known as ‘X’) profile. He has uploaded a cryptic banner that shows a fishing bobber floating in a dark ocean. On the bobber is Dr Disrespect’s iconic logo, and it’s wrapped in the red hue that we’ve come to associate with the streamer (thanks to <a href="https://gamerant.com/dr-disrespect-social-media-page-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a> for the tip):</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans were quick to judge this change and to take a guess at what it meant. It could be a representation of Dr Disrespect feeling lost at sea and alone, or it could be a visual representation of ‘bait’, with Dr Disrespect trying to pique the curiosity of gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>It could just be an indication that Dr Disrespect is fishing on vacation – that’s also possible, but it seems too obvious.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, while he changed his Twitter banner, he neglected to remove the link to Midnight Society from his bio.</p>

<p>It was a long time coming, but the (surprise) release date for Fallout: London has finally arrived, with the team having confirmed that today, July 25, will see the launch of this game-sized mod. Following several years of development that saw issues come and go, celebrities lend their voices to the project, and countless developer blogs get published online, the day has finally come around.</p>



<p>Today, you will be able to play Fallout: London.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-years-in-the-making">Years in the Making</h2>



<p>In a quote picked up by <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-london-bethesda-mod-tomorrow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>, the FOLON team said that Fallout: London will be released today ‘unless nuclear war happens’. While there’s always a chance of that, it looks unlikely (he says, glancing out of the window). Therefore, after years of waiting and several pushbacks – the most major of which was caused by the Fallout 4 next-gen update – Fallout: London is about to be listed for download.</p>



<p>This free, super-sized mod comes with a caveat or two, though. Firstly, you’ll need to downgrade your Fallout 4 next-gen update to play it, but don’t worry, the mod has a feature that does that automatically. Also, it’s a beast of a mod – we don’t have the confirmed size, but it’s expected to be more than 30 GB in total.</p>



<p>For the hardcore Fallout fans, Fallout: London is a lore-breaking mod, but it’s an intriguing one. Almost a decade after Fallout 4 was released, Fallout: London offers one of the broadest reimaginations of the universe we’ve ever seen, boasting a fully-voiced cast, a massive open-world map of London, new factions, an immersive story, and much more. </p>



<p>It’ll only be available for PC players, but there are whispers that the team wants Bethesda’s help to bring the mod to Xbox. For now, it’s going to be made downloadable through GOG – but the link isn’t available just yet.</p>



<p>Fallout: London launches today, July 25 – will you be playing?</p>

<p>The esports industry is growing at an alarming rate, with more multi-million-dollar tournaments surfacing every day. One of the most exciting and popular parts of the industry is the concept of esports betting, and with each new event, thousands of esports bets are placed against players, teams, and the inner workings of the tournament itself.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, the concept of esports betting was alien – it now makes up 50% of the industry’s revenue. In this guide, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about esports betting, from how to bet on esports to what the best esports betting sites are.</p>



<p>Can you bet on esports? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-esports-betting-legal">Is Esports Betting Legal?</h2>



<p>That’s a great question to start with – is it <strong>legal </strong>to place bets on esports games? It all depends on where in the world you are. In some countries, any kind of betting is illegal, and naturally that’ll extend to esports betting. In most countries that allow gambling, esports betting is just another facet of that concept, which means that yes, it’s legal to bet on esports.</p>



<h3><strong>Is Esports Betting Legal in the United Kingdom?</strong></h3>



<p>Yes, esports betting is legal in the United Kingdom – it’s also massively popular and the top game for esports bettors is Call of Duty.</p>



<h3 id="h-is-esports-betting-legal-in-the-us"><strong>Is Esports Betting Legal in the US?</strong></h3>



<p>In the United States, esports betting is only 100% legal in a few states: Nevada, New Jersey, Tennessee, and West Virginia. It’s a list that’s forever expanding, as over time, more states are opening their doors to the concept of esports betting.</p>



<p>Esports is becoming a more mainstream concept all the time. Globally, there are almost half a billion enthusiasts, and recently, the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IOC announced</a> the upcoming Olympic Esports Games, which adds yet another avenue for legal esports bettors to target.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-bet-on-esports">How to Bet on Esports</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It couldn’t be easier to place a bet against some top-tier esports odds these days. It’s a matter of tracking down your desired esports betting site, navigating to the esports section, and then placing wagers. Betting on esports is the same process that you’d follow to bet on football or basketball – even a lot of the esports betting markets are the same as traditional sports betting markets.</p>



<p>To that end, here are some of the best esports betting sites to get you started:</p>



<ul>
<li>Thunderpick</li>



<li>Bet 365</li>



<li>GG.BET</li>



<li>LOOT.BET</li>



<li>Betway</li>
</ul>



<p>Typically, you’ll use the same betting sites you would for traditional sports to bet on esports. It’s just another angle that they’ve taken to try and dominate their corner of the industry, and for the most part, it works well – esports betting is <strong>very </strong>popular.</p>







<h2 id="h-tips-for-esports-betting">Tips for Esports Betting</h2>



<p>If you’re a seasoned bettor, you’ll have no problems getting to grips with esports gambling, but there are a few key tips you can still walk away with if you want to improve your odds.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Study Your Markets </strong>– Make sure you understand the markets you’re playing, and more importantly, that you know how to read the esports odds.</li>



<li><strong>Know Your Game </strong>– It’s almost pointless betting on an esports game that you don’t understand. You wouldn’t take part in Counter-Strike betting if you didn’t know the first thing about the game, would you? It’s a solid tip to learn about the game you’re betting on.</li>



<li><strong>Understand Your Budget </strong>– As with sports betting, making sure that you control your budget when betting on esports is vital.</li>



<li><strong>Only Use Trusted Sites </strong>– Some esports betting sites take advantage of the freshness of the vertical to entrap unaware players – make sure you’re only using a reputable, trusted esports betting site.</li>



<li><strong>Take Advantage of Bonuses</strong> – Almost every esports betting site offers betting bonuses and promotions – make sure you’re soaking these up to maximise your profits.</li>
</ol>



<p>Now that you know the inner workings of esports betting, are you going to place some wagers?</p>

<p>If you have been following Olympic news recently, you might have seen that the Olympics officially voted to add esports to its list of competitions. This decision marks a historic landmark within the world of esports, as competitive gaming is constantly on the rise. But what games are set to be played at this inaugural, landmark event?</p>



<p>Here is a list of all the games at the Esports Olympics.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-games-at-the-esports-olympics">All Games At The Esports Olympics</h2>



<p>While many popular esports titles will be seen in the Olympics, quite a few did not make the cut. In fact, all shooting games were left out of being a part of the competition.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This means that games such as Call of Duty, Fortnite, Valorant, Counter-Strike and more will not appear during the 2025 Esports Olympics.</p>



<p>But there are still quite a few other popular titles that are going to be included. <strong>Here is a list of every game that will be in the Esports Olympics:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>League of Legends</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Street Fighter</li>



<li>Tekken</li>



<li>iRacing</li>



<li>NBA 2K</li>



<li>FIFA</li>
</ul>











<figure></figure>







<p>First released in 2009, <strong>League of Legends</strong> has become a staple when it comes to the gaming and&nbsp;esports community. The game has one of the biggest competitive fanbases, as many of its players are known worldwide.</p>



<p>With many historic and large-scale tournaments, this popular MOBA has yet to decline in popularity. Massive gaming organizations, such as G2, Team Liquid, Cloud9 and many more have had a hand in this series for years now. </p>



<p>With competitors such as Faker, Perkz, Uzi and others running the playing field, we should expect to see some swift competition when it comes to League of Legends in the Olympic Games. Who knows, though? We may see some new stars take the spotlight next summer.</p>



<p>This could be at the top of the most popular games at the Esports Olympics.</p>



<h2 id="h-rocket-league">Rocket League</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Originally released back in 2015 and now owned by Epic Games, <strong>Rocket League</strong> has become as well-known as any other popular video game. With various crossovers with different franchises and games such as Fortnite, this popular car-soccer game has been a hit for years now.</p>



<p>And now, it is officially a part of the Olympics.</p>



<p>While Rocket League has been a competitive esport for some time now, it has not been until recent years that the RLCS (Rocket League Championship Series) skyrocketed in popularity. With some of the biggest teams in esports investing in this game, tournaments have begun to grow and grow.</p>



<p>Many large-scale in-person events are held across the globe, with features at DreamHack, The Esports World Cup and more. </p>



<h2 id="h-street-fighter">Street Fighter</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Being one of the earliest esports, <strong>Street Fighter</strong> has continued to grow amongst fans all across the world. The fighting game may seem simple on the outside, but the mechanics and plays that go into this title make it just as difficult and competitive as any other esport.</p>



<p>With the Evo being one of the biggest tournaments each year, Street Fighter has continued to pave the way for other competitive games. Unlike other games, Street Fighter requires players to practice and get used to the skills of a specific character.</p>



<p>This makes the competition much more exciting to watch, as each popular competitive player has a specific character they choose to play.</p>



<p>Which character will be crowned the best at next year’s Olympic Esports?</p>



<h2 id="h-tekken">Tekken</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another historic fighting game to join the Olympic Esports is <strong>Tekken</strong>. With the first game premiering back in 1994, Tekken has been a direct competitor with fighting games such as Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Super Smash Bros.</p>



<p>Like other fighting games, Tekken has a list of characters, all with different and unique skill sets, that players can learn to fight with. Developed by Capcom, this game has gone from being a fun arcade title to now being in the Olympic Esports.</p>



<p>Do not be fooled, though. To some, games such as Tekken look just to be filled with button mashing, but the game requires a heavy knowledge of the character’s techniques to develop different strategies when fighting.</p>



<p>Out of all Esports Olympic games, this is by far one of the most exciting.</p>



<h2 id="h-iracing">iRacing</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>You can’t have a large-scale esports tournament without including some sort of racing game. Developed by Microsoft, <strong>iRacing</strong> is sort of a distant cousin to Flight Simulator. Played with an actual wheel controller, iRacing puts players in realistic racing scenarios.</p>



<p>The fact that this game does not require a traditional type of controller is what makes it so unique, especially for being put in the Olympic Esports. The game may have been released back in 2008 but has seen a plethora of updates, which have given it close-to-real graphics. </p>



<p>With different cars to race with and many different tracks to race on, iRacing makes for the perfect racing title to join the Olympic Esports.</p>







<h2 id="h-nba-2k">NBA 2k</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>At least one type of sports game needs to be included in the Olympic Esports and it seems as if <strong>NBA 2K</strong> has made the cut. With many sports games, other than FIFA, only being popular within the US, NBA 2K has made strides within the world of esports.</p>



<p>Being one of the biggest sporting games in esports, this title allows players to play as professional basketball athletes, forcing them to choose different plays and strategies when facing off against other teams.</p>



<p>Throughout the last half a decade, NBA 2K has grown quite increasingly in the world of esports. In fact, a new title is released every single year. With basketball already being a part of the regular Olympics, having the video game version of it too is exciting.</p>



<h2 id="h-ea-sports-fc">EA Sports FC</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>With football (soccer) being the biggest sport in the world, <strong>FIFA</strong> (now known as EA Sports FC) seems like the best sports game to include in the Olympic Esports. Back in 1993, the first FIFA video game was released. Since then, the FIFA franchise has taken the gaming world by a stronghold.</p>



<p>With popular players such as Nicholas99fc, Vejrgang and many more in the constant spotlight regarding FIFA, it will be interesting to see just how big this game shows up to be at the Olympics.</p>



<p>Like NBA 2K, football is also a sport in the regular Olympics. Which one will end up being bigger? The esports version? Or the regular version? We can expect this to be one of the best Olympic Esports games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/flintlock-is-as-good-as-a-2024-video-game-needs-to-be.936153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/flintlock-impressions-review-souls<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the middle of 2024 and I find myself in a weird place.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-crab-has-a-gun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> As I've said previously, I really do not like <em>Souls </em>games</a>. And yet this year I keep finding myself enjoying <em>Souls</em> games. What a time to be alive!</p><p><em>Jedi Survivor</em>? I loved it. <em>Lies of P</em>? Cool game! <em>The Crab Game</em>? Also excellent. I am now adding <em>Flintlock </em>to that list, a game I hadn't even properly heard of until last week, but which, despite its relative obscurity for me and its genre, has well and truly got me.</p><p>Yeah, it’s a Soulslike, so there are fundamentals that every game with that label shares. You rest at spots that reset enemies, there's concentration required for even the most mundane opponent, there are gruelling boss fights, devilish combos, upgrade trees and, most importantly, gross dead guys to kill.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which I could take or leave, to be honest, because like I've said I'm not a <em>Souls</em> guy! But I can tolerate them if the wider setting and context is worth it, and just like it was with force-blasting stormtroopers off cliffs and giving a little crab a huge gun, the setting and context of <em>Flintlock </em>was very much worth it for me.</p><p><em>Flintlock</em>--I can't believe a game hasn't used that name already--is set in a fantasy world where humanity fights to hold back the hordes of the undead. The catch is that the ones holding them back aren't sword-wielding medieval types (though the game does feature them), but 19th-century soldiers. Imagine the US Civil War, or the Franco-Prussian War, just against...zombies. Trenches line the landscape, cannons are aimed at the gates of hell and humanity's first line of defence are wearing backpacks and firing muskets.</p><p>I like it! It's a fresh take on not just the setting but the combat as well, as <em>Flintlock </em>pairs a firearm and melee weapon about as well as any fantasy game ever has, from <em>Fable </em>to <em>Dishonored</em>. Much of the game's combat is built around juggling both of your weapons’ strengths and weaknesses, like your flintlock being able to blast at enemies from a distance, but then can only be reloaded by engaging in a certain amount of melee action.</p><p>Rounding out a trinity of powers is the help you get from a tiny little god, who is along for the ride and to help you kill much bigger gods by sharing some of his powers with you. Switching between your multiple means of attack, as well as having to constantly block, evade and parry keeps every encounter interesting.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fl8YHNlC8fE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Anyway, enough of the standard impressions stuff. What I <em>really</em> want to say about this game is that from the second you fire it up, it's clear that despite its best attempts, this is definitely not a AAA experience, at least as we have come to expect from 2024.</p><p>Yet it feels like one from a bygone era, something from a decade ago. It looks great, has a well-developed style, sharp visuals, quality writing and voice acting (including regular lines from Adam Jensen's Elias Toufexis). Even the menus are slick. You could have told me this was a centrepiece game at E3 2016 on the PlayStation stage and I would have believed you without hesitation.</p><p>Please know this is not a bad thing. In 2024, it still looks and plays just fine. I found myself playing <em>Flintlock </em>at the same time I was replaying <em>Wolfenstein: New Order</em>--an actual AAA game from a decade ago--and comparing the two, and the amount of fun I was having with both, I just kept thinking this is all I need. This is all video games need to be.</p><p>I know<a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this is a topic I've already touched on this year while battling my way through half the <em>Call of Duty</em> series</a>, but I want to repeat it here: the absurd amounts of time, money and manpower being spent on modern AAA video games are unsustainable, and worse, not even worth it. What we've long suspected--<a href="https://aftermath.site/big-budget-game-development-is-not-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and had pretty much confirmed by the sums revealed in the Insomniac dump</a>--is that the diminishing returns of the fidelity arms race are going to end up killing every studio until the only blockbuster developers left are Rockstar and whoever is still standing to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> game.</p><p>As a sports fan, and also a games writer pondering the death spiral much of the industry finds itself in, <em>Flintlock's</em> suitability got me thinking: what if video games had a salary cap? What if games had a finite amount of resources that could be spent on them, instead of the gaping, fiery maw that AAA budgets currently look like? A ceiling that would curb the rampant excess currently driving studios to the wall, and force more imaginative thinking from publishers (thinking that, to their credit,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366957330_Out_of_Red_Ocean_and_Soaring_into_Blue_Ocean_The_Wii_U_Nintendo_Selling_Strategy_in_Gaming_Industry#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20idea%20to,making%20to%20competition%20primarily%20irrelevant." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Nintendo settled on years ago</a>).

It doesn't matter that it doesn't have the latest in next-gen visuals or a $150 million marketing budget. It didn't need a huge open world, or to feature lifelike facial animations.

<p>Over 500 developers at Blizzard, making up the entire World of Warcraft team, have officially formed a union, it was announced on Wednesday. </p>



<p>The Communications Workers of America&nbsp;(CWA) <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced the formation</a> of the World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild – CWA Union (WoWGG-CWA) with the Microsoft-owned organization. The new union includes all designers, engineers, producers, artists, quality assurance testers, and other game developers at Blizzard. It’s the “first wall-to-wall union at Activision Blizzard and the largest wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft-owned studio.”</p>



<p>“What we’ve accomplished at World of Warcraft is just the beginning,” Eric Lanham, Test Analyst and member of the WoWGG-CWA, said via release<em><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></em> “My colleagues and I are embarking on a quest to secure better pay, benefits, and job security through a strong union contract. We know that when workers have a protected voice, it’s a win-win for employee standards, the studio, and World of Warcraft fans looking for the best gaming experience.”</p>



<p>With the formation of the WoWGG-CWA, over 1,750 workers a Microsoft-owned studios have unionized. Just last week it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-game-studios-union-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workers at Bethesda became the first</a> Microsoft studio to fully unionize.</p>



<p>“This victory, built on years of foundation work since the launch of the Game Workers Unite movement at GDC, reflects a deeply rooted commitment to change,” Tom Smith, Senior Director of Organizing at CWA, said. “Unionizing one of the most successful games ever signifies the rising power of worker solidarity across the industry, from AAA studios like SEGA and Bethesda to indie developers.”</p>



<p>Activision-Blizzard has yet to publicly comment on the WoWGG-CWA formation.</p>

While some of the pictures highlight what appear to be early-in-development locations and gameplay modifiers, others are instantly recognizable.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/multiversus-blogroll-1716421095391.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Harry Potter and Barbie content may soon join the MultiVersus family.</figcaption></figure></output><p>One<a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815827879361487036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>notable example</u></a> shows a stage with broomsticks that hover above a platform decorated with four distinct colors: blue, red, green, and yellow. It doesn’t take a Harry Potter expert to recognize that the broomsticks could signal that the map is intended to be Quidditch-themed, but those banners also seem to be placeholders for the universe’s four houses, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff. While no Harry Potter representative can be seen in the image, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the stage accompanied by someone like Dumbledore or Hermione should Harry Potter content ever make its official MultiVersus debut.</p><p>The datamine also reveals a stage that is unmistakably inspired by last year’s megaton movie hit, Barbie. The <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815821132651548714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-pink location</a> is dressed with palm trees, multiple levels to fight on, and a twisty slide that seems to lead to a pool. It looks almost exactly the same as star Margot Robbie’s Barbie Dreamhouse, though like the Harry Potter stage, it lacks any Barbie or Ken character representation.</p><p>Other MultiVersus datamine images show off heavily rumored characters like the <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815780822080794744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powerpuff Girls</a>, <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815780738706329909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DC’s Nubia</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815781343889899559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventure Time’s Marceline</a>, though until developer Player First Games has anything to announce, it’s best not to expect any of the content shown to officially appear in-game. It's at least clear that the developer has more plans behind the scenes, as Warner Bros.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft%E2%80%99s-entire-development-team-has-officially-unionized.936111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-entire-development-team-has-officially-unionized<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The developers behind World of Warcraft, one of the world’s biggest and longest-running MMORPGs, have officially unionized.</p><p>Earlier today, an official vote of over 500 eligible employees working on World of Warcraft was tallied and certified. With this, Blizzard Entertainment has its first ever “wall-to-wall” union, encompassing the entirety of a game development team instead of just one division, like QA. The union includes designers, engineers, producers, artists, QA testers, and other developers, most of whom are based in either Irvine, CA, or are part of a smaller team in Massachusetts. The group is called World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild, or WoWGG, and is a part of Communications Workers of America (CWA).</p><p>Additionally, a second group of Activision-Blizzard QA workers based in Austin, Texas have formed a separate union with Communications Workers of America, called Texas Blizzard QA United. The roughly 60 developers involved primarily work on Diablo, Hearthstone, and other games. Both unions concluded their votes today and have been officially recognized under Microsoft’s labor neutrality agreement and certified by an independent arbitrator.</p><h2>Something need doing?</h2><p>Speaking ahead of the election’s conclusion, World of Warcraft senior producer Samuel Cooper told me that organizing work on the WoW team began in earnest near the end of 2021 after a (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-to-pay-about-54-million-to-settle-major-gender-discrimination-lawsuit"><u>since-settled</u></a>) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california"><u>California lawsuit</u></a> alleging instances of harassment, inequality, and bro culture at the company. In the weeks and months that followed, the company put out a series of statements, but in June 2021 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-walkout"><u>Blizzard employees staged a walk-out demanding further action</u></a>. Cooper tells me the walkout was the “spark” that eventually led to further organizing efforts and, now, WoWGG.</p><p>So why did it take three years? Organizing takes time, and 500 people is a <em>lot.</em></p><p>“You can't just fire off an email blast and then have a bunch of people swarm in,” Cooper says. “It's mostly individual conversations between people who know and care about each other. It is gradual, but it's also exponential. The more of those conversations you have, the more people there are having them.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Cooper tells me he got involved in organizing in hopes of having “a more democratized way of representing employees in the workplace.” He later convinced senior quest designer Paul Cox to join in. Cox tells me he was frustrated that the voices of ground level employees weren’t being represented in Blizzard’s response to the California lawsuit, and he wanted to make sure they were taken into account.</p><p>“This isn't an attack against our World of Warcraft leadership or something where we're like, ‘We hate those guys.’” he said. “We just want to make sure that our voices are being heard and that at some point we don't end up as numbers on a spreadsheet. Because you go up high enough and these people have never met any of us, none of the names mean anything to them.”</p><p>WoWGG’s initial “spark” and early organizing work took place while the company was still independent of Microsoft, but last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal"><u>it was acquired</u></a>. As a result, Blizzard employees benefited from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-agrees-neutral-approach-future-activision-blizzard-unions"><u>Microsoft’s prior commitment to labor neutrality</u></a>, effectively allowing them to organize in the open without company interference.</p><p><strong>Update 1:24pm PT:</strong> Microsoft has <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-union-microsoft-response-1236083616/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offered the following statement to Variety</a> with regard to today's unionization announcements: "We continue to support our employees’ right to choose how they are represented in the workplace, and we will engage in good faith negotiations with the CWA as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement."</p><p><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><p>Cooper adds that Microsoft has upheld its commitment with regards to Blizzard.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We had CWA folks on campus for weeks on end, right in the middle, next to the big bronze orc.</p></div><p>“We had a lot of folks who, rightly or wrongly, felt fearful before,” Cooper says. “There are legal protections for organizing, but it can still be scary to have that change…We had CWA folks on campus for weeks on end, right in the middle, next to the big bronze orc. I think that really made people feel like it's not scary. I know they're not allowed to retaliate, but now I have confidence that they're not going to retaliate.”</p><p>Once they were able to organize openly, the WoW team’s efforts picked up speed throughout 2024. Cooper tells me the group was also emboldened by other game unions such as those at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-of-america-union-workers-ratify-contract-less-than-a-year-after-recognition"><u>SEGA</u></a> and fellow Microsoft unions at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-media-sees-300-qa-workers-unionize"><u>Zenimax</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-qa-workers-vote-to-form-largest-us-video-game-worker-union-to-date"><u>Activision</u></a>, many of whom had representatives on the Blizzard campus speaking with employees. The group even had a friendly race with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-microsoft-game-studios"><u>unionizing employees at Bethesda Game Studios</u></a>, who won a similar election last week. “In a friendly way, we were seeing who was going to squeak in there first,” Cooper says. “Never happier to be outrun. Huge congratulations to them.”</p><h2>What's worth fighting for</h2><p>Cooper believes that WoWGG’s victory is part of a growing wave of industry unionization in recent years. He hopes their union can serve as inspiration to others, just as SEGA, Zenimax, and Activision inspired them. “Blizzard's a big name. We make great games, we occupy a position in the industry that I think has a lot of influence. The ability to show folks a large, very successful, very long-standing game…is able to do this and able to do it with all of our development groups, not just design or production and design or production design, engineering and art, but quality assurance, too, brought in and treated correctly as full development partners. We hope that that's the start of a paradigm shift across the industry.”</p><p>Though WoWGG is still a ways off from contract negotiations, Cox tells me that two big issues the union wants to put on the table are pay equity and work-from-home. On the latter, he says that most of the WoW team is required to be in office three days a week, and exceptions have been very, very limited. That’s been a huge issue for those who moved out of town during the pandemic, or bought houses, or who struggle to afford living in Irvine, CA. “We've lost some really great folks who have just been like, ‘I don't want to come back into the office. I like the fact that I don't have an hour and a half commute every day,’” Cox says.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>World of Warcraft: The War Within Pre-alpha Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Cooper adds, “Long-standing partners who I personally really relied on that we've had to figure out how to move forward without. It's a huge topic for us. Ultimately, how these things shake out in bargaining, how we prioritize pay against promotion transparency, against layoff protections, against work-from-home and other concerns. That'll really be up to our friends and teammates, our members, to survey, but those are big topics.”</p><p>Fundamentally, both Cooper and Cox tell me their desire to unionize comes out of a deep love for Blizzard and the work they do on World of Warcraft. Both of them have been at Blizzard for over 15 years, and feel invested in making it a better place to work for themselves and all their teammates.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you want a place to stay good, you've got to make the place good.</p></div><p>“Another one of our organizing committee members said, ‘There's a temptation when things get hard at a job to go look for a job where things are easier. But this is a tough industry, you can jump and you may experience some improvement for a while, but if you want a place to stay good, you've got to make the place good,’” Cooper explains. “Unionizing, I think, it's going to make a difference for us. I think it's going to make a difference for the company, a positive difference that'll help us be more successful in all senses and take better care of our people. I think that's going to ripple out to the industry, even the players. I'm excited for the future.”</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/courtisans-card-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Gaming has a very long tradition of very small card games that allow players to be very mean to one another. Arguably it goes back to the days of playing cards and the Hearts family of evasive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games">trick-taking</a> where you’re trying to avoid winning points, some versions of which see you passing pain cards to other players, and getting their cruft in turn. </p><div catalogid="53b021f6-76fe-4bb7-a747-922595d8f1dc" id="205185"><div id="205185" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Courtisans Card Game</h3></p></div><p>So it’s a crowded market to venture into, but with it’s super-simple rule set and beautiful cards, Courtisans clearly feels it has the chops to make a splash nevertheless. </p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><p>As a small-box card game, there’s not a lot in the small Courtisans box, but what there is is very high quality. The main draw is the main deck of tarot-sized cards in five colors, representing five noble families, each one luminous with characterful artwork and gold embossing. They’re an absolute delight, justaposing a character and its suite symbol – which doubles as a color marker for the colorblind – in the manor of a court card from a deck of playing cards. </p><p>The rest of the compact box is less attractive. There’s a much smaller, much plainer deck of objective cards and a rolled-up board made of printed fabric depicting the families feasting at the queen’s table. The art is in the same grand style as the cards, and rolled up boards are easy to store but fabric, while eco-friendly, isn’t the most practical choice. Because it’s stored in a roll, it won’t lie flat on the table without a sheet of perspex or an iron. This isn’t a major issue during play as cards go above or below the board, not on it, but it is a shame that it doesn’t show off more of that glorious art to full effect.</p><h2>Rules and How It Plays</h2><p>Gamers have a bit of a reputation for claiming that games are simple when they’re anything but, and this is particularly true of card games when half the rules can be printed on the cards themselves. But Courtisans really is very straightforward to learn. On your turn, you draw three cards from the deck. One, you keep face up in front of you. Another you place, face up, before an opponent of your choice. And the third you place either above or below the Queen’s table, in the column matching its suit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Courtisans really is very straightforward to learn.</p></div><p>Once the deck runs out, suits that have more cards above the table than below are “esteemed” and each one in a player’s tableau is worth a point. Those with more cards below than above are “fallen” and each costs you a point. Cards with a x2 icon are worth double in both reckonings. Tot up your points, and see who’s won. The only other complexities to this formula are a smattering of special cards: spies do not reveal their suit until the game ends, assassins remove a card from whatever area they’re laid in, and guards can’t be assassinated.</p><p>You’ve now learned almost the entire rules of Courtisans. And you would not believe just how much angst is lurking below that smooth, approachable ruleset and those lovely cards.</p><p>The fact that you lay almost all the cards face up, the odd spy excluded, means there’s nowhere to hide. When a pile of red cards are cowering pitifully below the queen’s table, and you give another player a red card, that’s an outright act of aggression. You’re saying, “I want you to lose”, and no amount of apologetic talk or sour-puss facial expressions can disguise it. It’s like the famous, blood-draining, knife-twist betrayals of Diplomacy, allegedly Henry Kissinger's favorite board game, except you haven’t taken seven hours to get there, and you’ll commit a dozen more such hostilities in this game alone.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s not a lot in the small Courtisans box, but what there is is very high quality.</p></div><p>And the game contains a number of ways to make every gut-punch worse. You can give someone an out-of-favor suit and make it worse by adding the same suit to the stack below the table. You can double the misery in both respects by doing the same with one or two x2 cards. You can give someone an assassin in an out-of-favor suit and kill one of their higher scoring, in favor, cards. And then you can rub salt in the wounds by laying the one decent option in your three-card draw in your own tableau.</p><p>This outright, in-your-face meanness does mean that the game works best with four. With two, you’ve only got one target. With three, and to a lesser extent with five, it’s very easy to dogpile one poor player into oblivion relatively early in the game, although given it only takes a quarter-hour to play that’s hardly the end of the world, and no doubt your bullying will be remembered in turn for the next hand. But four strikes the perfect balance of blow and counterblow.</p><p>In all cases, you’ll have to do your level best to direct the pain away from yourself and toward other players, in the time-honored fashion of trying to persuade people to target the current leader. Some people love this kind of trash talk, others hate it, and this probably isn’t a game for them. But to prevent anyone from becoming an easy target, there’s one final cog to the game’s mechanisms: everyone gets two secret missions. These are all straightforward, like ensuring a particular suit is fallen or esteemed or owning two assassins. But they do the job very effectively, muddying the waters and adding to the excitement while giving you a reason to keep a poker face when someone slaps a card down.</p><p>At this point, it feels important to mention that luck of the draw and social engineering aren’t the only tricks Courtisans has up its sleeve. While the initial few plays are uncertain, mapping out the status of the different suits and the interpersonal dynamics between the players for the game to come, the collection of cards rapidly reaches a level where decision-making is decidedly non-obvious. A simple card might raise or lower someone’s score, but then there are the hidden goals to be aware of. And the special cards inject additional dynamism: assassins in particular make it very difficult to properly weigh the correct course of action. The card itself may be worth a point, or not, but its choice of target can also impact the game in subtle ways.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Luck of the draw and social engineering aren’t the only tricks Courtisans has up its sleeve.</p></div><p>This uncertainty dovetails beautifully with the social aspects of the game, into an ouroboros that’s likely to end up eating someone at the table along with its tail. You start to feel like every play contains both a social and a strategic message. What does it mean that the player opposite gave a green to their neighbor? Does it say something about their own secret goals, or the spies they placed the turn before? Or is it more of a gotcha revenge moment, for that neighbor dumping rubbish on them early in the game, or even for a disagreement they had last week? Is it worth making an argument out loud for the table? And if so what form should it take, and what will persuade your fellow players that might give you an edge? It’s amazing how such a tiny game can tease at all the communal faultlines around the table. </p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/oeDE6?object_uuid=85486945-6716-4ab9-b11a-32cd71b65e9f&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/W0bbx?object_uuid=85486945-6716-4ab9-b11a-32cd71b65e9f&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Adeew?object_uuid=85486945-6716-4ab9-b11a-32cd71b65e9f&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Pandasaurus</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 24, 2024 7:25 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Courtisans is a nasty game with very significant random and social factors, and for a chunk of gamers that’s enough to make them walk away. However, in the wide, deep sea of take-that games in which Courtisans belongs, it’s a shark in it’s own right: sleek, powerful and often taking you by surprise. There might not be a whole lot to this box, either in terms of content quantity or rules, but it does what it’s supposed to do pretty much perfectly.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Concord, the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter from Sony's Firewalk Studios, is bucking the battle pass trend, with its developer telling players, "You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."
</p>
<p>
Firewalk Studios announced the news in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayConcord/status/1816141419914093045">series of posts</a> on social media, explaining Concord won't have a battle pass because it "wanted to focus [its] attention on making Concord a rewarding and robust experience on day one, where just playing the game, levelling up your accounts and characters, and completing jobs yields meaningful rewards."
</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/markderidder/status/1816152226815172785">seperate post</a>, Concord gameplay animation director Mark DeRidder wrote, "No Battle Pass, folks. You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."
</p>
<p>
It's certainly an increasingly unusual, if not unwelcome, choice in a world where it feels like every major live-service game - including the Sony published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> - comes with a time-sucking battle pass (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-is-evolving-its-battle-pass-by-splitting-it-in-two-and-charging-players-twice">or two</a>). Firewalk has, however, previously confirmed the £35/$40 game will be further monetised via cosmetic character customisation items.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's posts, the studio noted Concord will include additional cinematics beyond those featured in its recent open beta, and will receive new Freegunners (as its heroes are known), maps, modes, and more in regular post-launch seasons and updates. These will be made available to all players at no additional cost.
</p>
<p>
Firewalk also confirmed Concord will including single-player training modes at launch (but no solo-specific play modes), alongside six "distinct" 5v5 team-based modes, and "multiple" unlockable variants for each of its 16 heroes.
</p>
<p>
Concord launches for PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam and Epic on 23rd August. Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">took a look at the 5v5 shooter</a>, declaring it good. "The bad news," he continued, "is I can't figure out how good, just yet... Each element done in absolutely the right way, but not necessarily in service of anything more than simply doing things the right way... My fingers are crossed for this one being given enough time to find its identity on the fly."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following on the heels of Friday’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wall-to-wall union at Bethesda Games Studios</a>, over 500 workers on <em>World of Warcraft</em> have unionized under the Communications Workers of America (CWA). Like Bethesda’s union, the World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild spans departments, including engineers, designers, artists, QA testers and more, in what the Guild calls “ the largest wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft-owned studio.”</p><p><em>“</em>The decision by workers on <em>World of Warcraft</em> to form a union marks a key inflection point in the broader movement for video game worker organizing industry-wide,” said Tom Smith, Senior Director of Organizing at CWA, in a press release. “This victory, built on years of foundation work since the launch of the Game Workers Unite movement at GDC, reflects a deeply rooted commitment to change. Unionizing one of the most successful games ever signifies the rising power of worker solidarity across the industry.”</p><p>Alongside the WoW Game Makers Guild, 60 Blizzard QA workers in Austin also formed a union today. Microsoft, parent company of Activision Blizzard, signed a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality agreement</a> with the CWA in 2022, agreeing not to stand in the way of organizing workers. That agreement went into effect 60 days after the finalization of Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, which was completed in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pretty promptly, Microsoft laid off <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 2,000 people</a> from its gaming division in January 2024. <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Closures of four Bethesda studios</a> followed in May. Most recently, the FTC–which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/12/08/microsoft-activision-acquisition-ftc-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tried to block </a>Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2022– <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ftc-accuses-microsoft-of-breaking-promise-not-to-raise-game-pass-prices-after-activision-blizzard-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a letter to the US Court of Appeals</a> accusing the company of “exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged,” following Microsoft’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass price hike</a> in early July. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-decries-ftcs-misleading-claims-of-degraded-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> by calling the FTC’s claims “misleading.”&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s easy to read both these unions as direct responses to all of that, the WoW Game Makers Guild makes specific mention of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/07/27/blizzard-employees-walkout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walkouts and protests</a> at Blizzard in 2021, which followed the company’s response to California’s sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit against the company. The press release calls today’s unionization “a significant milestone in [that] journey.”</p><p>It rules to see more unions in the games industry, especially interdisciplinary ones. Finding commonality with your colleagues across differences, and using those commonalities to change your workplace, is one of the best things about unions (ask me how I know!). If you haven’t experienced that for yourself yet, there’s never been a better time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
