            <p>Honestly, I turn my back on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>-of-note <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> for (checks calendar)... one, maybe two weeks, and you all go and transform a planet into a black hole. "You" being the players who completed the metagame's last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental "Dark Fluid" - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.</p>
<p>Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d6l1px/this_is_what_happened_if_you_were_in_orbit_around/">rudely ejected from orbit</a> via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d6rk3h/nearly_three_minutes_listening_to_the_void_these/">gaze into the dark heart of their victory</a>. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I'm sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The Supercolony has been destroyed," reads a Super-Earth broadcast in the wake of Meridia's liberation from the everyday laws of physics. "In its place, a beautiful black hole remains, drawing in every Terminid spore within several billion kilometres. Interstellar spore levels have already sharply decreased in every system. The destruction of Meridia came not a moment too soon ... Containment is now once again possible."</p>
<p>As we know, Super-Earth broadcasts are sometimes so Super in their patriotism that they are forgiveably... expansive with the truth, in much the same way that airstriking a whole valley is a perfectly acceptable way of smashing that one Automaton you can't seem to headshot. But it's credible that we'll have fewer bug monsters to fight in the near-future, because look, Super-Earth has spawned itself a planet-sized hoover. On the other hand, we might have to deal with the sudden arrival of a fleet of highly advanced cthulhoid aliens. Swings and roundabouts, eh!</p>
<p>The Illuminate are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-updates-could-bring-back-the-first-games-sneaky-teleporting-illuminate-faction">already much-tipped to return in Helldivers 2</a>. There's a big gap on the Galactic Map ready and waiting for them, and let's face it, no developer worth their salt is going to add a visitable black hole to a game only to leave it sitting there like a lawn ornament. Mark my words, young divers. Something is going to come out of that hole, and I'm pretty sure it won't be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-once-had-a-portable-hole-but-swen-vincke-says-it-would-have-been-a-crime-against-humanity">all your leftover junk from Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>

		<p>Last year, Summer Game Fest directly overlapped with the launch of <em>Remap</em>, which is why I wasn't even on the first podcast lol. But it made sense for me to attend, because it felt like a way of legitimizing the whole endeavor. We had lost our jobs, yes, but we'd just launched this new thing, it seemed successful, and attending an industry event, with a badge and everything, felt <em>official</em>. It was also a lot a fun to see friends and colleagues, when increasingly, so much of our work happens remotely these days. So on Friday, I'll be heading to the airport to spend a few days in Los Angeles. I'll be playing games, talking to developers, drinking beers, and showing up on a <em>Giant Bomb</em> live show. It'll be fun, and I'll certainly have lots to share in the days and weeks ahead, because, yes, I'll be bringing a microphone.</p><p>-pk, who also has to travel two other times this month, bleh!!!!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY:</strong> Our collaboration with LudoNarraCon comes to an end, with a final panel hosted by me.

If my flight goes well, I'll be joining them remotely from Los Angeles!</li><li><strong>SUNDAY: </strong>A bonus Stream, as we chat over the Xbox showcase, as well. I should be present for this before darting to Summer Games Fest itself, which you'll hear more about when I return from the trip!!!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em>support@remapradio.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-armored-core-6-lore-video-is-the-best-mecha-movie-of-2024.888393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170549/amored-core-6-lore-video-best-mecha-movie-2024-vaatividya<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="5MyfBl"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23842706/armored-core-6-review-fromsoftware"><em>Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon</em></a> was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23648669/best-video-games-2023">one of last year’s best games</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81PpudVySmw&amp;ab_channel=Polygon">a fitting return for the franchise after a decades-long hiatus</a>. It’s a game you should enjoy yourself for its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23846137/armored-core-6-smart-cleaner-boss-fight-good">lightning fast mecha combat</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23849203/armored-core-6-best-boss-fight-strategy">bottomless level of customization</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23864578/armored-core-6-rusty-steel-haze">meticulously plotted sci-fi story</a>. But if you just want to skip all that gameplay and ingest a captivating FromSoft science fiction tale, then I’ve got just the video for you!</p>
<p id="m8cQ2K">“<a href="https://youtu.be/4n9eakXNsIQ?si=GDD8gmDp6LKuwc9I">The Entire Story of Armored Core 6</a>” is a completely comprehensive, five-and-a-half-hour video from legendary FromSoftware lore chronicler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VaatiVidya">VaatiVidya</a>. Known for his Dark Souls boss deep dives and epic Elden Ring story breakdowns, this time Vaati gets to share in his love for one of FromSoftware’s oldest franchises and it <em>might</em> be his best video yet. </p>
<p id="y0yrcG">Not only does it take into account every voiceover line, part description, and combat log to weave together all three of <em>Armored Core 6</em>’s timelines into one sweeping epic, but Vaati and his collaborators uncover cut dialogue tracks, animate still images from the game, and record audio tracks for characters who don’t have a voice in the game proper. In between Vaati’s gracefully narrated sections of lore are immaculately captured sequences of gameplay that <a href="https://github.com/vswarte/ac6-freecam">required a custom built free-camera capture mod</a>.</p>
<p id="gqeoDs">Even someone as<em> AC6 </em>obsessed as me (it was my personal GOTY) learned so much from watching this video. For example, I’d originally enjoyed Iguazu’s storyline as the classic Gundam rival archetype — basically, someone who is constantly big mad that the main character is so awesome all the time, but also someone the main character doesn’t really think about. So I thought it was hilarious when Iguazu turned out to be in cahoots with the final boss of the game’s NG++ ending. This time, when my extremely angry rival gave his big speech about how long he’s been planning to take his vengeance <em>blah blah blah</em>, I genuinely thought “Igua-who?” before remembering him as the whiny punk I’d thrice beaten before. It felt a bit like an in-joke reward for beating the game three times.</p>
<p id="JnCLaT"><em>Now</em> I understand that his being a 4th gen augmentation and one of Allmind’s chosen makes him a mirror image of my character. The fact that my coral ghost ally, Aer, actually causes him physical pain any time I’m present. The way he’s constantly made a pawn by pretty much everyone. Just under the surface of his nearly comical revenge tale is a classic FromSoftware tragedy. Based on cut dialogue and part descriptions, it’s implied his rage and envy are powering his armored core. Which actually makes him even <em>more</em> like a Gundam character, just not in the way I realized.</p>
<p id="5BSVRc">Watching this video gave me an even greater appreciation for one of my all-time favorite games. If you enjoyed <em>Armored Core 6</em>, it’s a must-watch. You can even break it up into smaller pieces with the video’s chapter markers if the long runtime intimidates you. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-last-of-us-part-3-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following the immense success of the live-action television series and the critical and fan acclaim of the two games in the franchise, many find themselves eagerly awaiting a third entry. We want to finally learn more about Ellie and Abby and see where the story unfolds from here. But do we know The Last of Us Part 3’s release date yet?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-last-of-us-part-3-coming-out">When is The Last of Us Part 3 Coming Out?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking about the studio</a>, its future, and The Last of Us as a whole, Neil Druckmann said that Naughty Dog won’t always be The Last of Us studio forever. He wants to pursue other projects, unique storylines and single-player adventures, which means stepping away from the post-apocalyptic storyline altogether.</p>



<p>Does that mean they’re entirely done with the franchise? It’s unlikely. Again, following the incredible success of the television series starring Pedro Pascal, it would likely be foolish to toss the franchise aside now. There are still more stories within the world.</p>



<p>But we know very little about The Last of Us Part 3 release date. It’s not happening yet, but it is coming. Druckmann already said the team’s process for the third game is the same as the second game, focusing on a compelling story and message about love. But he also said that if the team can’t develop something, the ending in The Last of Us Part 2 was quite strong overall.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-last-of-us-part-3-star-ellie">Will The Last of Us Part 3 Star Ellie?</h2>



<p>While we know very little about The Last of Us Part 3 overall, including whether it’s officially happening, we can speculate that Ellie will play an integral role in its storyline. Whether it’s a short-lived appearance remains to be seen, but we know from firsthand experience that Naughty Dog has zero qualms about tossing out beloved mainline characters early on.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of story left to tell, from Ellie’s and Abby’s perspectives, but there’s also a world of survivors and tales within The Last of Us to explore!</p>

You can also customize the chair with magnetic interchangeable patches featuring the DPS, healer, and tank role icons that attach to the left shoulder padding. All three patches are included with the chair.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4311388-ffsecretlabhead.jpg"

                <p>A Google employee reportedly accessed private videos on Nintendo's YouTube account and then leaked that information ahead of planned announcements. That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a> based on a copy of an internal Google database that tracked six years of self-reported privacy and security issues.</p><p dir="ltr">While we don't have many details on the incident, the report states that Google's internal review of the incident concluded that it was "non-intentional"--it's not clear what that actually means in this case. The report mentions dozens of other instances of Google violating its own privacy policies (usually by accident), including one where Google Street View was transcribing a large number of license plate numbers and another where a Google speech service mistakenly logged speech data (including that of "1,000 children") for about an hour. The tech giant told 404 in a statement that all data related to these incidents has been purged.</p><p dir="ltr">Though this incident is relatively minor in the grand scheme of gaming leaks, it's a good example of how tech companies have practical access to a staggering amount of information that could be leaked--accidentally or not. The copy of the database was sent to 404 Media by an "anonymous tipster," and Google confirmed "aspects of its contents," per the report.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is an extremely litigious company, though it's unclear what actions it has taken, if any, in this instance. In the past, Nintendo went after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-but-he-still-owes-a-lot-of-money/1100-6513332/" data-ref-id="1100-6513332">Bowser himself</a> for involvement in a hacking group.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/strategy-games-like-against-the-storm-let-us-think-about-the-bigger-picture-of-cooking<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via Eremite Games/Hooded Horse.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you live in a tiny apartment and grew up without proper instruction on properly seasoning your food, fictional cooking in video games can look far more appealing than spending a half-hour in your own kitchen. As Cooking Week rolls on here at Game Developer, I've had to yank myself away from drooling at the magnificent creations offered up in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Cafe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Loathe as I am to pick up the pot and pan (don't worry, I throw a lot of food in my air fryer to ensure I'm not only eating processed meals), I still catch myself thinking about cooking in the world of game design. When we began looking at games to feature this week, my eye drifted away from the more obvious titles and into the realm of strategy games and citybuilders that I've loved since childhood.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After all, a civilization is nothing without mass-produced food. We simulate the passing of the ages in the Civilization series by researching innovations like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/key-components-civilization/">irrigation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/domestication/">domestication</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Armies in the Total War series </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/06/18/414614705/appetite-for-war-what-napoleon-and-his-men-ate-on-the-march">march on their stomachs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as any army would. And if you're building a game with different factions and many cultures, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://stacker.com/food-drink/signature-dishes-50-countries-around-world">preferences of your people's diets</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can shape what resources you prioritize in trade and harvest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To discuss how these topics can fit into your next game, let's take a closer look at Eremite Games' roguelike city-builder </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The building blocks of settling the land">The building blocks of settling the land</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s cooking system is one thread of a large tapestry of game balance meant to support the game's roguelike nature. Lead designer Michał Ogłoziński explained in his 2024 Game Developers Conference postmortem of Against the Storm that this system ensures every settlement (or spree of settlements) feels different every run.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eremite Games shuffles a number of variables like unit races, resource availability, and tasks set by the Queen to offer different challenges and guide them down different paths. These variables are introduced the minute a new settlement is established—but as Ogłoziński pointed out, a number of consistent traits are in place to make sure every run is winnable, and that players don't feel screwed from the jump.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the beginning of each fun, players are assigned up to three races of villagers among their starting units. Each race has a set of unique skills and a series of "needs" that will maintain or boost their resolve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players also start each run with a modest stockpile of food and access to raw ingredients like meat, eggs, vegetables, or fruit in their starting vale. Because these ingredients will inevitably expire, they're incentivized to cut into new zones to make sure their people don't starve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Villagers can feed on raw ingredients, but without more complex foods, their people may be demoralized and won't gain buffs that will help with other urgent tasks. Feeding only on raw ingredients also becomes less efficient as a settlement's population grows. These varying systems—and challenges sent down by the Queen that can push them to victory—incentivize the building of facilities that can produce bread, skewers, pies, etc.</span></p><p>Image via Eremite Games/Hooded Horse.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As intricate as this food system is, it exists side-by-side with the process of producing other goods like clothing, bricks, and oils. This means at the most abstract level a delicious meal doesn't fulfill a different gameplay purpose than a comforting cloak.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both are tools to chase certain gameplay objectives, and both are manufactured using similar processes. The downside of this system is that it can't fully express what makes cooking unique from other forms of production, but the upside is it places a greater priority on diversifying food sources in a way other games can't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, credit to Eremite Games, this system does support an important idea about depicting food in civilizational-level video games: that food isn't just a meter to be ticked up and down, it's a system that can express how people thrive and come together when food can be more than the bare essentials.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Complex food can also be a resource for social and economic needs">Complex food can also be a resource for social and economic needs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designers familiar with psychology regularly reference Abraham Maslow's "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Hierarchy of Needs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" theory first published in 1945, which explores the notion of human motivation evolving to achieve different goals as basic needs for sustenance and survival give way for the need for community, a sense of belonging, self-esteem, and spiritual transcendence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In survival games that have grown popular of late, it's a useful shorthand to express the player's journey of scrounging for essentials to building complex structures in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or massive fleets of spaceships in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>No Man's Sky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a similar design logic exists in how the player will prioritize the aesthetics of their settlement as they become more sustainable. It also uses this theory to build out the game's fictional world and show how food fits into a civilization struggling with a neverending magical storm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key design choice here is that complex foods beloved by different races aren't just an output of the many logistical equations, but also an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>input </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">as well. The most basic system they play into is producing "Reputation," the resource needed to win a settlement run. When different races of villagers have their needs yet by goods such as complex foods, they produce Reputation, and the player inches closer and closer to victory.</span></p><p>Image via Eremite Games/Hooded Horse.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If that were the only purpose complex foods served, the player's objective would be to mainline facilities producing them and just pump out infinite amounts of it. But because of varying other needs from villagers, complex foods become a tool for other systems as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance "foods" like wine, beer, and tea are ingredients needed to operate "service buildings" like Taverns, Guild Houses, and Monasteries. These buildings offer global buffs that support other tasks and generate traits like "Religion," "Luxury," and "Leisure," which are craved by villagers and will boost their resolve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Foods both raw and complex also fit into the game's trading system. Individual items can be bought and sold to individual traders and other settlements, but the most efficient way to make money off them is to package them in goods like "Packs of Crops," "Packs of Provisions," or "Packs of Luxury Goods."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Food-related items like Flour and Waterskins may also be packed into "Packs of Trade Goods" as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These systems balance the psychological benefits of good food against the commercial benefits. Players struggling against debuffs that make Resolve-based victories harder can still rely on food to win via commerce-related objectives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With these high-level design choices, Eremite's philosophy of incentivizing different win conditions by increasing or decreasing certain variables is wide enough to support the many ways food fits into our society.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where can cooking go next in strategy games?">Where can cooking go next in strategy games?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makes for a great case study in how the "higher-level" needs met by complex food still belong in survival-themed games where players are tasked with surviving in harsh elements. It's a great way to scrutinize the need for luxuries in hard times and ask players to evaluate if they're worth pursuing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designers on other strategy games may rightly point out that this particular resource management loop isn't right for their genre. But there's still inspiration that belongs in other games!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Strategy games about conventional warfare can explore how the physical act of moving food from A to B can be a lifeblood for armies or cities under siege. Business or city simulators could explore how different types of food are craved—and can evolve—in cities with multicultural populations. And games leaning into trade and negotiation could explore how supply and demand for food or ingredients goes beyond monetary value and into the social needs a person or society has for a particular flavor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Food is such a key lifeblood for any society. And with the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, developers working on games thinking about the nature of society and civilization should feel emboldened to explore why we value food once we step beyond individual kitchens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Game Developers Conference are sibling organizations under Informa Tech</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Although <em>Wuthering Waves </em>Version 1.0 is already packed with content, we can’t help but want more. Luckily, the wait won’t be too long, thanks to an upcoming new update. Here’s what you need to know about <em>Wuthering Waves </em>1.1, including a release date and upcoming features.</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-wuthering-waves-1-1-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Wuthering Waves 1.1 come out?</h2> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">As per the <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> from Kuro Games, mark your calendars for the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em> 1.1 on <strong>June 28, 2024, at 05:59 (UTC+8)</strong>. Like most updates, a server downtime is expected prior to this, so you can plan your game time accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Originally, Version 1.1, also known as Thaw of Eons, was supposed to launch a week after this. However, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-update-roadmap-includes-story-skips-and-yinlin-companion-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kuro Games</a> announced they would release it earlier to give players more content. Due to this change, 10 Radiant Tides will be provided to you via the mailbox. However, it will no longer be available after the release of <em>Wuthering Waves </em>1.1.</p> <h2 id="h-all-wuthering-waves-1-1-features" data-injectable="false">All Wuthering Waves 1.1 features</h2> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">Version 1.1 will introduce two <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-all-upcoming-characters-and-banner-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Resonators</a>, <strong>Jinhsi and Changli</strong>. These characters, depicted as 5 Stars in their artwork, are not yet playable but have a significant role in <em>Wuthering Wave’s </em>main storyline. Get ready to meet them in the game soon.</p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">You can also look forward to a <strong>new boss challenge</strong> with the formidable<strong> </strong>Jué. You may remember this creature from the main quest prologue as one of Huanglong’s six Sentinels. Specifically, Jué is the Sentinel of Jinzhou, so the boss fight may be playable in this location.</p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true"><strong>Mt. Firmament</strong> is another upcoming <em>Wuthering Waves </em>1.1 feature that showcases a new area to explore. Not much is known about it, but the Waking of a World trailer may have given us a sneak peek. Toward the end of the video, we see a mysterious location with a dragon-shaped landscape, possibly hinting at Mt. Firmament.</p>

<p data-characters="224" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following its initial reveal three years ago, <em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>had been hit with some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/metal-slug-tactics-delay-2023-dotemu-leikir-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a>. Now it has its eyes on the prize, with publisher Dotemu and developer Leikir Studio <a href="https://twitter.com/Dotemu/status/1797629431416082487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing</a> a fall 2024 release window.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">That release includes some additional platforms. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series consoles are now in the mix along with the previously planned launch on Nintendo Switch and PC. The news served up the perfect opportunity to share a new trailer, which shows more of the lovingly crafted pixel art tactics and trademark <em>Metal Slug </em>shenanigans.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - New trailer | Coming Fall 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjQ5hyo-Jkk?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for a way to try this out ahead of fall, a limited-time demo is planned for Steam Next Fest from June 10 through 17.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true"><em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>has looked promising ever since it was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/metal-slug-tactics-reveal-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a>. The charm of SNK’s long-running-and-gunning series appears to be wholly intact and transplanted in an oddly fitting new genre. <em>Tactics </em>promises a mix of strategy gameplay with some rogue-lite progression elements, but the maps themselves are all hand-crafted. There are 110 maps in all and 20 mission types throughout the course of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">Between all that and the numerous loadout possibilities, <em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>sounds like a kitchen sink attempt at taking the series into tactical territories. Throw in a soundtrack from Tee Lopes (<em>Sonic Mania</em>, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>) and you’ve got me ready to head out onto the battlefield right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Xbox version of Kena: Bridge of Spirits will feature all the content previously released for the PlayStation edition, including the Anniversary DLC.

The game will be available in both physical and digital formats at a price of $39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99, with the physical edition comes with the Official Digital Soundtrack and an exclusive sticker sheet for retail.</p>

Well-paced and beautiful to behold with plenty to see and do, Ember Lab has well and truly captured the spirit of the 3D platformers many of us grew up adoring.”</em></p>

		<p>Sony has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/psvr-2-pc-adapter-spotted-at-south-korean-regulator/">PSVR 2 PC adapter</a> that leaked last week is real, and that people will be able to buy it from August 7th. The PSVR 2 PC adapter will allow those who own the headset to tap into the library of VR games on PC through SteamVR. The adapter will cost &nbsp;$59.99 / €59.99 / £49.99.</p>



<p>There is a catch as not all of the PSVR 2 features will work on PC. HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (except rumble) will not work when using the headset to play games on PC. The PSVR 2 features that will function on PC are 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, see-through view, foveated rendering, and 3D audio where supported. The minimum specs that you will need to operate the PSVR 2 on PC are listed below.</p>

<p>If you do get the PSVR 2 PC adapter, set up is relatively straightforward. You will need to plug in the adapter to PC, along with a DisplayPort 1.4 cable. Sony does not provide this cable and you will have to purchase this separately if you do not have one already. You will also need to register for a Steam account if you do not have one already to get access to the SteamVR store and games library.</p>

<p>The PSVR 2 is currently on sale through Sony’s Day of Play promotion. You can pick up the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-consoles/playstationvr2">headset by itself for £439.99</a>, or get the<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-consoles/playstationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle"> PSVR 2 Call of the Mountain bundle for £479.99.</a></p>

            <p>The onslaught of fun <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wishlisted">Steam Next Fest demos</a> you can play right now continues and will not relent. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/card-bard">Card Bard</a> is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It's surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I'm 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

<!--more-->
</p><p>You can't just fire away willy-nilly, of course. Each shooty card costs a different amount of juice (the little orange pips in the corner of the cards). Firing five bullets will cost two pips, firing a single bullet will only cost one. This energy restores over time, so as keen as you might be to unleash everything in a volley, you do have to be more judicious about each shot, especially once trickier enemy types appear. Like the hoppers who leap out of a bullet's path, or the mandible lads who wriggle for you at a faster pace than all the other crawlers. </p>

<p>As you clear each stage you get new cards. A trio of splashy bombs, for example, or a machine gun-like streak of fire, or a "love bullet" that turns any enemy it hits into an ally who'll attack their own kind. All you want is to survive as long as you can before the wrigglers chomp you to bits. That's it really. To be honest it'll take you longer to read the rest of this article than it will to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2854060/Wildcard/">download the bloody demo</a>, so if you've got this far, go on. Get out of here. I give you permission to waste some time. No, I have no idea why the game is calling itself "Card Bard" in the game menu but "Wildcard" in Steam. Maybe that was an old name? Or maybe Card Bard is the old name. These are mysteries perhaps YOU can solve.</p>
<p>If you prefer to run while you gun, good news. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkjjQc38uc">Gunrun</a> looks bananas and is by the same developer, Terry Brash. It has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561650/GUNRUN/">its own demo</a>. Not content with making one game, Brash has been making this cardy Vampire Survivors-style autoshooter as well, and it looks suitably crowded. Remember a couple of weeks ago when indie developers were challenged to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-dev-challenges-other-devs-to-multiply-something-in-their-game-by-1000-triggering-landslide-of-chaotic-videos">change a variable by 1000</a> to see what happened in their games? Gunrun looks like the creator did that, then neglected to change it back to normal. Sick.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170394/diablo-4-treasure-goblins<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="qPQUC8"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions"><em>Diablo 4</em> is definitely on the right track</a> after its current season, titled Loot Reborn, made sweeping revisions to the item game of Blizzard’s flagship action role-playing game. But it still lags behind its predecessors in a few areas, one of them being its relative lack of treasure goblins — those little cackling guys with sacks of stolen gold and loot who inspire frantic chases around the map to slay them before they teleport away, often with a comedic conga line of monsters in tow.</p>
<p id="qXwVvA">Treasure goblins rule. You can’t have enough treasure goblins. <em>Diablo 3</em> introduced the ability to follow them back through a portal to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/8/6944731/diablo-3-patch-the-vault-blizzard-ps4-xbox-one">their own loot-filled realm, The Vault</a>, where you could battle a boss called Baroness Greed for even more goodies. How great is that?</p>
<p id="BNww4M">The good news is that <em>Diablo 4</em> is about to get much more treasure-goblin-centric. The bad news is that it’s only happening for a week.</p>
<p id="mo4ALM">To celebrate the game’s first anniversary, <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24096024/celebrate-the-diablo-anniversary-with-march-of-the-goblins">Blizzard is running an event</a> called March of the Goblins from June 6-13. During the event, there’ll be more treasure goblins running around, their bags will be stuffed with more loot, and there’ll also be a greater incidence of greed shrines, which cause monsters (including treasure goblins) to drop even more gold when activated. Treasure goblins will appear in dungeons in pairs, or even larger packs.</p>
<p id="M0vdj1">As another nod to <em>Diablo 4</em>’s first birthday, all players will get a Mother’s Blessing buff that increases XP gain by 25% and gold rewards by 50%. Blizzard said the buff would last 10 days, although it wasn’t precise about the dates. There’ll also be some free cosmetics to claim from the shop.</p>
<p id="aGV8Y3">There’ll be a similar March of the Goblins event, as well as other bonuses, in mobile game <em>Diablo Immortal</em>, which coincidentally celebrates its second anniversary at the same time.</p>
<p id="SxwjUQ">Goblins all round. Get ’em while they’re hot!</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/genshin-impact-guides/24170514/version-4-7-maintenance-release-time</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-time-does-genshin-impact-4-7-release.888309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/genshin-impact-guides/24170514/version-4-7-maintenance-release-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fIpcwd"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/genshin-impact-guides"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> patch 4.7 is coming soon, bringing new characters and story with it. This patch will likely go heavy on narrative, as Dainsleif will make an appearance during these new story quests, and new characters Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos will also make their debuts.</p>
<p id="e3CnpT">Below, we explain <strong>when </strong><em><strong>Genshin Impact</strong></em><strong> maintenance starts and ends</strong>, alongside the <strong>release time of version 4.7</strong>. We’ve also added some details about what to expect from <em>Genshin Impact</em> patch 4.7.</p>
<hr id="iEzQbJ">
<h2 id="T4eTkV">
<strong>What time does Genshin Impact</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>go down for maintenance?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="lNoIYf"><em>Genshin Impact</em> will go down for maintenance on <strong>Tuesday, June 4, or Wednesday, June 5</strong> (depending on your time zone), at the following times and will be unavailable for approximately five hours:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>June 4 at 3 p.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>June 4 at 6 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>June 4 at 10 p.m. GMT</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="XaeSfj">
<strong>June 4 at 11 p.m. CET</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>June 5 at 7 a.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="GliPUK">
<strong>June 5 at 9 a.m. AEDT</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="IAdoB6">Make sure to burn your fuel before maintenance starts, if you wanted to.</p>
<hr id="bvHqwW">
<h2 id="dIJyU6"><strong>What time does Genshin Impact version 4.7 start?</strong></h2>
<p id="4nhhcQ"><em>Genshin Impact</em> should come back from maintenance with the 4.7 version at the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li id="k7RBy1">
<strong>June 4 at 8 p.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="4FGns2">
<strong>June 4 at 11 p.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="fFEk3q">
<strong>June 5 at 3 a.m. GMT</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="Qvthe3">
<strong>June 5 at 4 a.m. CET</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="c5tLfo">
<strong>June 5 at 12 p.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="fRHGT4">
<strong>June 5 at 2 p.m. AEDT</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="XkQSR0">The servers may come up early or late, depending on how maintenance goes, but these are the approximate times 4.7 should go live. Usually Hoyoverse is pretty good by abiding by maintenance times. We don’t usually get extended maintenance, but it does end early sometimes!</p>
<hr id="47ziSN">
<h2 id="9dmzLd"><strong>What’s new in Genshin Impact version 4.7?</strong></h2>
<p id="zHi8mg">Version 4.7 will bring Clorinde, Sigewinne, and Sethos to the game as playable characters. As you may have been able to predict from seeing them in action via story quests, Clorinde is a five-star Electro sword character, Sigewinne is a five-star Hydro bow character, and Sethos is a four-star Electro bow character.</p>

<p id="V4yn6L">The patch will also have new story with Dainsleif making another appearance, which means some kind of big revelation is not far behind.</p>

Aside from maybe giving you a jump scare, this animal will bounce around and damage you on contact until one of you retreats. You might think your only recourse in these moments is to retreat, but that’s not the case. In fact, this Kangaroo hides a secret for you to hunt down. We’ll tell you where to find this elusive marsupial, and what to do when you do track it down.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>There are five locations on <em>Animal Well</em>’s map where the kangaroo can spawn. It will move to one of the other four locations whenever you spot it, so you’ll have to check each spot if you’re trying to hunt it down. As for <em>why </em>you’d want to hunt for it? Well, if you throw a Firecracker whenever the Kangaroo appears, the marsupial will retreat and drop a <strong>K Shard</strong>. Once you have three K Shards, they automatically combine to form a <strong>K Medal</strong>, which you can place in a Circular Recess near the top-left side of the map (next to the room where the giant bat appears after placing a candle).<br></p><p>This hunt isn’t necessary to complete the game’s first “layer,” but it is essential to achieving 100% completion. Here’s everything you need to know to knock out this optional objective.</p><h2 id="h1014"><a id=""></a>How to find the rooms where the Kangaroo will spawn</h2><p>Before we outright tell you how to find the Kangaroo, you should know that you <em>can </em>figure out where the Kangaroo will spawn on your own. You will need a certain item to do it, though, and there’s a good chance you missed it before you saw the credits for the first time (it’s not the Top). If this information is enough to pique your curiosity, then stop reading here.</p><p>Ready for another hint?</p><p>The item you need is the <strong>UV Wand</strong>. You can obtain it after exploring the area that opens after placing the E Medal into the Circular Recess in the bottom-left quadrant of the map (past the room where you got the B. Flame after the seahorse boss battle, there’s a hidden room on the top-right of the screen above the fish head). The UV Wand shows hidden images and messages you can’t normally see, which you’ll need in order to uncover all kinds of codes in <em>Animal Well</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="238444d5eac87b3504b5b11ad3bd5e44" data-recommend-id="image://238444d5eac87b3504b5b11ad3bd5e44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A kangaroo symbol can be seen on a wall lit by UV light.

You’ll find one spawn point near the top-left end of the map, one near the bottom-right end, and three near the map’s center. If you want to explore and find the spawn points yourself, you now know everything you need.

Enjoy your newfound medal!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<article role="article" about="/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0">

  
    

  
  <div>
      
  
  
  <div>
      <div><p>Steamforged Games has acquired the hit miniature fantasy wargame <em>Warmachine</em>, as well as the whole <em>Iron Kingdoms </em>IP (including the RPG line) from publisher Privateer Press.</p>

<p>You likely know Steamforged Games more from their video game tabletop adaptations in recent years, where they've been hit or miss. Games like <em>Dark Souls: The Board Game</em> disappointed, but others like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-board-game-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Horizon Zero Dawn The Board Game Review"><em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em><em> The Board Game</em> reviewed</a> quite well, including with us. A number of other projects have also been in the works of translating the world of 1s and 0s into analog games like the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/Steamforged%20Announces%20Monster%20Hunter%20World%20Iceborne%20Board%20Game" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-announces-monster-hunter-world-iceborne-board-game"><em>Monster Hunter: World Iceborne</em> board game</a>.</p>

<p><em>Warmachine </em>is one of the hotter miniature warfare games out there with Privateer Press working to revitalize it with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/privateer-press-announces-warmachine-mkiv" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Privateer Press Announces Warmachine MKIV"><em>Warmachine Mark IV </em>in 2023</a>, and it has big fans in Steamforged CEO's. Rich Loxam, a CEO and co-founder of the company said that "almost every aspect of Steamforged's history can be traced back to Warmachine in some way or another," while pointing out that both he, and co-founder Mat Hart are <em>Warmachine </em>players. Beyond <em>Warmachine</em>, the purchase also includes the entire <em>Iron Kingdoms </em>line, including the roleplaying games, and the Formula P3 painting brand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a real wealth of creative talent and, as you might expect, genuine passion for tabletop gaming in our team. In particular, we all share a special kind of love for Warmachine and the Iron Kingdoms. That, along with our expertise in creating games loved by many, makes us ideally placed to collaborate with Privateer Press in shaping the future of a hugely important franchise. There’s a profound sense of duty to nurture its growth and potential, and we take that responsibility seriously. We cannot wait for what’s to come for the players in this wonderful world.” - Mat Hart CCO and Founder of Steamforged</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What does this mean for <em>Warmachine</em> going forward?</h2>

<p>According to the announcement, Steamforged will work with Privateer Press going forward on developing the game, and releasing new products. Rich Loxam states that they are excited to bring their experience and infrastructure to "take Warmachine into its next era." There is no announcement about what changes will be coming in the future to the game, or other ones impacted by the move. Privateer Press founder and CCO Matt Wilson said the following about the acquisition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We couldn't have asked for better custodians than Steamforged. Their track record, history with the games, and genuine excitement about the future make them the perfect fit to shepherd Warmachine and the Iron Kingdoms into the future, opening up new opportunities and growth channels for all Iron Kingdoms titles. We look forward to working with Steamforged in the years to come.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Iron Kingdoms</em> IP contains more then just the RPG and <em>Warmachines</em> however. Other products that weren't explicitly mentioned in their announcement but fall into the <em>Iron Kingdoms</em> IP include:</p>

<ul><li><em>Iron Kingdoms Adventure Board Game Undercity</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/widowers-wood-newest-iron-kingdoms-board-game-hits-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Widower's Wood, the newest Iron Kingdoms Board Game, hits Kickstarter"><em>Widower's Wood</em></a></li>

	<li><em>Grind</em> Miniatures sports game</li>
	<li><em>High Command</em> deck building card games</li>
	<li><em>Riot Quest</em>, a alternate universe of <em>Warmachine</em> that is a miniature skirmish game</li>
	<li><em>Warcaster neo-mechanika</em>, a high speed miniatures game.</li>
</ul><p>Outside of the list all the games in the <em>Bodgers</em> line, the <em>Level-7</em> science fiction board games, and <em>Monsterpocalypse </em>miniatures games fall outside of this acquisition.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-closed-alpha-starts-today-with-beta-in-july-and-release-in-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Larian Studios finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined</a> a release plan for the official Baldur's Gate 3 mod tools. The Closed Alpha is actually available today, though only for a select group of mod creators from the community, which will be expanded over time.</p>
<p>Next month, Larian plans to allow users to register for a Closed Beta event with around 1K participants. The goal is to fully release the mod tools with Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 sometime in September.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-cross-platform-mod-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, the toolkit will enable the creation of cross-platform mods thanks to the collaboration with mod.io. Here's what modders can look forward to when it comes to the toolkit itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Access the editor to create your own mods.</em></li>
<li><em>Upload mods directly to mod.io servers.</em></li>
<li><em>Load levels read-only to look at all the local entities, as well as the setup, and test your mods in-game while creating them.</em></li>
<li><em>Get access to our internal editors for supported asset types such as textures and visual models, allowing you to override them directly in your mod through the developer interface.</em></li>
<li><em>Publish your mod via the editor where it will be moderated and made visible in the in-game browser, or pack your mod locally to upload to a third-party site.</em></li>
<li><em>Mod UIs through file editing. We will provide documentation that will explain how our internals are set up to solve mod loading/compatibility issues.</em></li>
<li><em>Within Baldur’s Gate 3 itself, you’ll be able to:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Download and manage your mods directly.</em></li>
<li><em>Manage multiplayer and save game files through a verification UI.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An internal curation process managed by mod.io will determine which Baldur's Gate 3 mods are available on consoles. As usual with console mods, it sounds like they will be very limited - for example, there won't be any direct level editing or changes to core game elements (like story, cinematics, dialogues, quests, and local gameplay adjustments) due to 'technical constraints' and 'platform-specific guidelines'.</p>
<p>Do not fret, though: on PC, modding outside of the official pipeline (like <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods-expand-party-size-unlock-level-cap-add-spells-feats-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what we've seen so far</a>) remains entirely supported. These unregulated mods may still be packed locally with mod.io’s toolset and uploaded to other mod distribution platforms, according to Larian.</p>
<p>This means that those mods can still be downloaded manually, and Baldur's Gate 3 mod browser will still recognize them and allow you to manage them in the mod load order of the game. However, because they would be local and alter unsupported systems, there will not be embedded<br>
support for checking for updates and syncing to others in a multiplayer session.</p>

But do you want to start an entirely new game? <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>will reportedly have a unique leveling system that will keep players from over-leveling, so getting a refresher on the game’s tough combat might be a good idea.<br></p><div data-video-id="195939" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Where Does Games Media Go From Here? | Ahead of the Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195939,195502,196790" data-current="195939"><div><p>Where Does Games Media Go From Here? | Ahead of the Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195939/195939_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195939/195939_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195939/195939_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195939/195939_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21458.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Like the rest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282">FromSoftware’s titles</a></span>, <em>Elden Ring</em> has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-soulslike-ranked-elden-ring-dark-souls-ps5-1850289282">New Game+</a></span> feature, which might just be the perfect way for you to familiarize yourself with the Lands Between once more.

That sounds simple enough, but this is a Souls game, so it’s not an easy feat, and it’s not a foregone conclusion that every player will have achieved it. Once you have earned the title of Elden Lord and seen one of the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-ranni-questline-ending-achievement-fromsoft-1850083349&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-ranni-questline-ending-achievement-fromsoft-1850083349">many endings</a></span> you will be given two ways to begin NG+. After the credits roll, a text box will appear asking if you would like to “Begin Journey 2,” simply accept the prompt and you will be taken immediately into NG+.<br></p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-lore-messmer-miquella-1851492064&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-lore-messmer-miquella-1851492064">I’ve Convinced Myself This Is What The <em>Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</em> DLC Is About</a></span></p><p>If you decline the option when offered it after the credits then you aren’t out of luck, <em>Elden Ring</em> gives you another way to begin your second journey. After reaching one of the game’s endings, you will be allowed to continue exploring the Lands Between to wrap up any loose ends you have. Maybe you just want to do some weapon collecting or you haven’t faced off with every secret boss the world has to offer. Whatever your reason, you can take your time before heading into NG+, but when you are ready, just fast-travel to the Roundtable Hold. Resting at the Hold’s Table of Lost Grace will now present the player with another option, “Begin Journey 2.” Accept it and you are on your way to NG+.</p><h2 id="h919"><a id=""></a><strong>Should you start <em>Elden Ring</em>’s New Game+ before <em>Shadow Of The Erdtree</em>?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="43369aca63ee2ff9aad4bd54aa989e5a" data-recommend-id="image://43369aca63ee2ff9aad4bd54aa989e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde woman wields a sword in front of her face" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blonde woman wields a sword in front of her face" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43369aca63ee2ff9aad4bd54aa989e5a" data-recommend-id="image://43369aca63ee2ff9aad4bd54aa989e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde woman wields a sword in front of her face" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ahead of the DLC’s release a lot of players who have previously beat <em>Elden Ring</em> are wondering what the best way to refamiliarize themselves with the game is. But is the answer really NG+? It’s a bit complicated. I would say that it depends on how much time you think you have to put back into the base game before <em>Erdtree</em>, and also what you are hoping to get out of it before the DLC drops.<br></p><p>The biggest thing to remember about NG+ is that it overwrites your save file. That might be an issue if you want to play Shadow of the Erdtree upon its release but don’t have enough time before then to replay the game up until the DLC’s unlock location. Once you begin NG+ you will not be able to return to your completed save file (unless you are on PC and back it up manually before entering NG+). As with other FromSoft games, <em>Elden Ring</em>’s DLC will require players to start it by entering through a mid to late-game location. For <em>Erdtree</em> that is Moghwyn’s Palace, a fairly difficult location most people suggest you tackle near the end of a playthrough. If you are able to get to that point in NG+ before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> then by all means go ahead.</p><p>For those who are just looking for a way to refamiliarize themselves with the combat and flow of <em>Elden Ring</em> before the DLC but don’t want to playthrough the game entirely, I would suggest just creating a new character (which doesn’t delete or overwrite your other save files) and working your way through the early game. I find that just playing the game, even at a low level, is enough to get that muscle memory working again at which point you can dive back into a higher level and feel much more comfortable. </p><p>Whatever you choose you don’t have to worry about your level being important, however. FromSoft has stated the DLC will have its own unique <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-difficulty-1851293313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-difficulty-1851293313">attack power system</a></span> that will be more important than your already acquired stats. Essentially as long as you can enter the DLC (regardless of level) you will be able to play<em> Shadow of the Erdtree</em> without worrying about being underprepared.</p><h2 id="h920"><a id=""></a><strong>What does and doesn’t carry over to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s New Game+?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="d91d03200cef1c0d01abd8f757c73e34" data-recommend-id="image://d91d03200cef1c0d01abd8f757c73e34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished casts a spell at enemies approaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished casts a spell at enemies approaching" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d91d03200cef1c0d01abd8f757c73e34" data-recommend-id="image://d91d03200cef1c0d01abd8f757c73e34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished casts a spell at enemies approaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The benefit of NG+ over just starting a new playthrough from scratch is that you can take some of your hard-won loot and levels into your next adventure. In the case of <em>Elden Ring</em>, there are quite a few helpful things that carry over into NG+. The big things that you will retain in NG+ are your level, Runes, armor, weapons, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-magic-incantation-spell-tool-ca-1848881054&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-magic-incantation-spell-tool-ca-1848881054">magic spells</a></span>. Remember that you will also be able to get duplicates of all your favorite weapons in NG+ to dual-wield, so make sure to grab them in your first playthrough before starting NG+ if you want to make some truly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-patch-1-03-op-build-mimic-tear-hoarfrost-nig-1848666715&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-patch-1-03-op-build-mimic-tear-hoarfrost-nig-1848666715">broken builds</a></span>. To balance out the player’s carried-over strength, enemies in NG+ are stronger but will also drop more Runes.<br></p><p>That’s quite a bit and it’s not the whole list. You will also be able to retain the majority of non-quest-related items and consumables. That includes Remembrances, upgrade and crafting materials, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-lone-wolf-spirit-ashes-how-to-get-church-ell-1848703303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-lone-wolf-spirit-ashes-how-to-get-church-ell-1848703303">Spirit Ashes</a></span>, and Ashes of War. There are also some key items that the game allows you to take into NG+, which include Stonesword Keys, Dragon Hearts, Larval Tears, Celestial Dew, and Lost Ashes of War. You will also have access to your horse, Torrent, as well as your map progress.</p><figure id="" data-id="8f8fec6a8db10da7f10e51367581ce44" data-recommend-id="image://8f8fec6a8db10da7f10e51367581ce44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished and Melina sit in a field at night" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished and Melina sit in a field at night" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8f8fec6a8db10da7f10e51367581ce44" data-recommend-id="image://8f8fec6a8db10da7f10e51367581ce44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished and Melina sit in a field at night" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for what <em>won’t </em>carry over into NG+ that list mainly consists of quest-related items. That just means if an item was used to progress the main quest or any side-quests, you will lose it so as not to mess up the natural progression of the game. Speaking of side quests, all of your side quest progress will completely reset upon starting NG+, so if you are in the middle of any side quests, decide whether you want to finish or give up on them before your next playthrough.<br></p><p>Great Runes that you acquire upon defeating the game’s key bosses will not carry over into NG+. Other key items that don’t carry over are Sorcery Scrolls, Incantation Prayerbooks, and Bell Bearings. While map progress carries over, States of Grace do not, and you will need to refind these points in NG+. An extensive list of every single thing that does and doesn’t carry over can also be found on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/New+Game+Plus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/New+Game+Plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Elden Ring </em>wiki</a></span>, so if you have a question about a specific item before starting NG+, give it a look.</p><hr><p>Whichever way you choose to prepare for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, I’m sure the DLC is going to kick all of our asses regardless of preparation.

<p>During the recent Game Access show in Brno, questions were lobbied at Warhorse Studios regarding the recent reveal of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. This follow-up to the 2018 open-world title is set to be a stunning game when it’s released worldwide later this year, but some concerns have been raised regarding how it’ll run on certain platforms.</p>



<p>At Game Access, producer Martin Klíma <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-scope-impacted-xbox-series-s-4k-30-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was grilled on this very topic</a>. He explained that owing to the technical limitations of the Xbox Series S, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s scope was impacted, which meant that the team couldn’t make the game as big as they’d wanted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-only-as-strong-as-the-weakest-link">Only As Strong As The Weakest Link</h2>



<p>Reportedly, the ‘weaker’ Xbox Series S console posed a problem for Warhorse Studios when assembling Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. In terms of technical specs, the Series S has just 10 GB of RAM, which is little more than 25% more RAM than the last generation of home consoles. Not only does this present a problem for those making the game, but the players will ultimately feel the pinch too.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed that on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will run at 4K / 30 FPS. On the Xbox Series S, that drops to 1440p and 30 FPS. As an aside, it has been noted that on PC using an RTX 4080 Super and 7950X3D CPU, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has been pushed to 4K / 80 FPS using NVIDIA DLSS.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018) felt like a fairly huge game, but that was because most of it was spent trudging through forests, fields, and expansive towns and cities. From what we’ve seen in the earliest trailers for KCD2, there’s plenty more to explore this time around, but thanks to the limitations presented by the Xbox Series S console, there will be a little less than intended.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-games-consoles-are-holding-back-interactive-storytelling<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Agency is perhaps the most important distinction between video games and any other form of entertainment. You have no control over how the characters fare in any book, TV or film, but in games, the power is almost entirely in the hands of players.</p>
<p>While this often translates to how well said characters do in combat or when confronted by puzzles, developers are exploring more ways in which players can shape stories as well. One such studio is As Dusk Falls developer Interior Night. Ahead of her Develop:Brighton keynote, we catch up with CEO Caroline Marchal about the untapped potential for interactive narratives.</p>
<p>To begin with, she observes that there are lessons game developers can learn from the likes of TV and film when crafting their stories. As Dusk Falls, for example, uses many of the same tools from those mediums, which makes it easier for players to get into; after all, everyone is already accustomed to cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>"We're using the same currency, telling you a story on the screen, but then we are adding this agency and interactivity, which is even more powerful and just draws you into the world and with the characters."</p>
<p>Interior Night demonstrated this in 2022 with its debut title As Dusk Falls, an interactive crime drama that follows members of two families across a period of 30 years. Marchal says the team remain "super proud" of the game, which achieved positive reviews from critics, as well as users on Steam and, as of March this year, PlayStation.</p>
<p>In fact, a physical edition of the PlayStation game lands on shelves tomorrow, where every copy not only includes the game on a disc but also a poster and a recreation of the in-game sheriff's black book, which help players uncover more secrets within the story. "We had a lot of fun crafting that," Marchal adds.</p>
<p>For the Interior Night CEO, As Dusk Falls demonstrates what she believes is the full potential found within the interactive narrative video games can offer: the ability to share and shape stories together. She tells us that countless players have told the studio about how they worked through As Dusk Falls with partners, family members or friends, each voting on actions with their phone or controller. Marchal even played through with her 73-year-old mother.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>As Dusk Falls puts players at the heart of a crime drama, inviting them to dictate how the story unfolds</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But crucially, she emphasises that games like As Dusk Falls are just one flavour of interactive narrative.</p>
<p>"The genre is much broader than that," she explains. "When you look at games like Unpacking, Norco, Venba, or Papers, Please, [those] are very different takes on the interactive narrative, all valid, and I think it's great, they're where they need to be. Maybe they are not on the right platforms yet for everybody to access this, because when you know you're on Xbox, you're accessing quite a core subsection of players. If Venba was on Netflix, for example, it would be able to reach a much wider audience, and that would be fantastic."</p>
<p>She adds: "As soon as you need to buy a console to enjoy Venba, you're not reaching the full potential audience."</p>
<p>If dedicated games platforms are the barrier to interactive narratives reaching the vast audience they deserve, that suggests that mobile is the way forward for this genre. After all, smartphones and tablets are ubiquitous by this point – but Marchal observes that the nature of the mobile games market raises different barriers, and these ones hinder developers.</p>
<p>"Mobile is very tricky because it's based on free-to-play, and having a narrative interactive free-to-play is difficult," she says. "There have been examples like Choices, and so on. But it's very difficult, because premium is not a thing on mobile anymore, sadly. It goes kind of against those experiences – imagine playing Unpacking and you've got to pay to [continue]. That's terrible. It breaks the narrative flow, it breaks the experience, it's just not great for that.</p>
<p>"But of course, everybody has [a smartphone] so how do we crack this? It's getting really difficult, because now user acquisition is insanely expensive, and it's an entirely different business. When you are used to 'crafting games' for PC and console, you are like an artist.</p>
<p>You are doing your thing and then sell it as premium. Switching to the mobile model is very difficult, it doesn't always suit the design and the skills."</p>

<figcaption>Caroline Marchal, Interior Night</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote><p>"As soon as you need to buy a console to enjoy Venba, you're not reaching the full potential audience"</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, Marchal suggests that smart TVs may be the way forward. While these devices do have gaming capabilities – there's a marketplace for Android titles on smart TVs – little is known about how many players actually engage with these. Streaming could be another alternative, with Marchal particularly keen to see what Netflix manages as it works on its own streaming offering.</p>
<p>"If that works, it could be a great opportunity for those kinds of experiences to reach the TV audience – which is massive. It's essentially everybody, gamers and non-gamers alike."</p>
<p>But Marchal observes that Netflix's particular offering will be a "slow burn," as its games streaming offering is still in its beta phase, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-less-than-1-of-netflixs-total-subscribers-play-games-daily">only a small number of the service's subscribers engage with the titles available</a>.</p>
<p>The Interior Night boss speculates about potential new models that might help bring interactive narratives to a wider audience. Could a platform offer game rentals, or perhaps offer an ad-based experience, with 30-second spots at the beginning and end of chapters in a title like As Dusk Falls? It's unclear what models might emerge, but that may be remedied by the growing understanding between the games industry and companies in other forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>"It's a different culture between Hollywood and the games world," Marchal says, by way of example. "Sometimes it's hard to talk to each other, but we are seeing more and more virtuous collaborations, so I think they are learning. Hollywood is learning to understand the appeal of games, while games with their increased focus on meaning and story and good characters, good character design, are also learning to speak to Hollywood.</p>
<p>"We and many other developers are already literate in story language, but there's still this culture. Culture-wise, it is very different to how they do business. So I think it will come.</p>
<p>Netflix and Amazon are already well-positioned. Apple's got the money, if they wanted. Then it's about the vision of their execs, I guess. Because it's about how serious they are with that – they've got the money, that's for sure."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Unpacking_SOCIAL.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Interactive narratives don't need to follow the same structure found in As Dusk Falls. Marchal cites Unpacking as one of many games pushing the boundaries of storytelling</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Platform and business models won't be the only barrier to overcome for future narrative games to reach a mainstream audience; the key, Marchal says, is to make these titles as approachable as possible – something Interior Night has some success with in As Dusk Falls.</p>
<p>For starters, removing 3D navigation is a major step towards appealing to non-gamers. While many folks may enjoy the story of something like Life is Strange, for example, having to guide an avatar around a 3D space can be something of a barrier. Marchal observes that even core gamers once had to get accustomed to moving a character with the left analogue stick while controlling the camera with the right.</p>
<p>"Remember how long it took you to get used to that? We got rid of that immediately, and when you do that, the trade off is you've got control over pacing, which means you've got control over how involved people get and the tension and everything. You can take them on a journey much more easily than when there is 3D navigation.</p>
<p>"Even if we say As Dusk Falls is easy to play, we just use the left stick and the A button, you have to know what the A button is. Whereas with a phone, everybody has one. There is no friction here. Everybody knows how to swipe, how to move, you've got nothing to explain."</p>
<blockquote><p>"How many memories do you have of great moments in games versus great moments in TV? You grow with them, they change your life"</p></blockquote>
<p>Marchal adds that multiplayer is instrumental in making these games approachable, but emphasises that it's important every player is involved throughout.</p>
<p>"When I worked at Quantic Dream, we had tons of reports from Heavy Rain that were 'Oh, my girlfriend sat with me.' Great, but I'd rather she plays with you. It's not the same thing, like watching a football match from the benches. Levelling the playing field meant everybody plays all the time."</p>
<p>Marchal adds that once the audience doesn't necessarily consider such titles as video games, it opens up the door for more people to participate and feel competent, without having to understand the typical gamer language – elements such as UI, health systems, inventories, and so on.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/as-dusk-falls-physical.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The physical edition of As Dusk Falls contains items that unlock more secrets within the story</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"It's about characters, what they are doing in the world and everybody is very competent at understanding people and motivations," she explains. "And we crafted quite a complex story with secrets. Nobody is either a good guy or a bad guy, everybody has got layered intentions and reasons for doing what they're doing – just like in life, really – so every player is very competent at understanding.</p>
<p>"That's part of being broad. It's not just about the controls or the accessibility. It's also about what the game is about. It's about people struggling with real life problems, and then suddenly anybody can jump in and participate on a level playing field."</p>
<p>The final barrier is that, even with minimum friction, interactive narratives are just that: active. They are a less passive experience than watching TV or films; 'lean in' rather than 'lean back,' as Marchal puts it. That means stories like As Dusk Falls are unlikely to ever replace prestige television as people's go-to choice of entertainment, but Interior Night is determined to continue offering them as an option.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's not something you do every evening, but when you know you've got a chapter and you know it's roughly the duration of a TV series episode, or there's like checkpoints in the middle, if you say 'Well, let's do one chapter tonight,' you know that you're going to be in just for an hour.</p>
<p>"It's not something that you might want to do every evening, but at the same time, I don't want to spend all my life watching average TV shows and sometimes great ones. When I have a choice between playing Baldur's Gate 3 or watching a show, I play BG3, you know?"</p>
<p>She concludes: "Video games are so awesome. I want everybody to be able to enjoy that. It's just such a compelling experience. For me, reading a book or watching a great show, that's really good. But then playing a really good game with someone you love, it's like the top of the chain. How many memories do you have of great moments in games versus great moments in TV? You grow with them, they change your life."</p>

I'd like to share with you what we learned while porting our FPS from mobile to PC.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why Steam?">Why Steam?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We decided to port Pixel Gun 3D to Steam after recognizing significant demand from both our players and our internal team. Over the past year, we saw a growing interest in a PC version. Additionally, many of our original players, who enjoyed Pixel Gun 3D a decade ago, have now transitioned to PC gaming. This demographic shift confirmed our hypothesis that a Steam release would attract nostalgic players, leading to a successful launch. The nostalgic appeal brought back many old players who were excited to experience the game on a new platform.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Development Process">Development Process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The development process for porting Pixel Gun 3D to PC was initially unstructured. We recognized our lack of experience in PC game development and sought external expertise. We partnered with an external team, who spent 5-6 months adapting the game for PC. This involved modifying the control systems to accommodate mouse and gamepad inputs. The most challenging phase was integrating the adapted code back into our main development branch. This synchronization was necessary to ensure that updates could be simultaneously deployed across Android, iOS, and PC versions. This integration phase presented significant challenges, as changes for the PC version sometimes caused issues with the mobile versions and vice versa. These challenges were addressed over a strenuous period of about a month and a half, teaching us the complexities of multi-platform development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Content Integration">Content Integration</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Integrating the extensive content of Pixel Gun 3D, which includes over 100 maps, over 1500 weapons, and various game modes into the PC version was a major task. We benefited from having a unified codebase, which allowed for easier content management across platforms. However, specific enhancements were made for the PC version, such as improved graphics for larger screens and enhanced animations for certain weapons. While most content transitioned seamlessly due to the shared codebase, some adjustments were necessary to ensure optimal gameplay on PC. This included tweaking certain elements to suit the different control dynamics and display requirements of PC gaming.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Community Engagement">Community Engagement</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our strong and active community, boasting over 5 million monthly active users on mobile, played a crucial role in the success of the Steam launch. The announcement of the PC version generated significant excitement, evidenced by high engagement on social media and over 500,000 wishlists on Steam before the release. This community support was instrumental in driving the initial success of the PC version. The positive reception from the community provided clear validation for the decision to port the game to Steam, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong community ties.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Porting Advice">Porting Advice</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Based on our experience, here are five lessons we learned and want to share with other developers considering porting their games from mobile to PC:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Understand the PC Market</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Mobile development experience may not fully translate to PC gaming. Consider the unique aspects of PC gaming, such as different player expectations and gameplay dynamics. Graphics, interface layout, controller responsiveness, and variety all need to be carefully thought out and addressed.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Seek Technical Expertise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Partner with experts who have experience in PC game development. This can save time, reduce costs, and ensure a higher quality end product. For example, integrating gamepad support and configuring it properly on Steam requires specific settings that are not always obvious from the documentation. Having experienced professionals can save a lot of time and headaches.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Learn Steam’s Launch Process</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The process of launching a game on Steam differs significantly from mobile platforms. Understanding Steam’s marketing and launch dynamics is crucial for success. From tracking wishlists to launch date planning to avoid clashing with competitors, everything needs to be coordinated. In our case, our checklist had over 30 items. Special thanks to Nikolay B. for his invaluable assistance in compiling this list.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Prepare for the First Wave</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Steam’s organic traffic can significantly impact the initial success of a game. Unlike mobile platforms, where marketing plays a more prominent role, Steam’s algorithms heavily influence the first few days after launch. Wishlist counts, launch streams, and community posts create a substantial initial wave. To be fair, we were not fully prepared for the influx of players and had to apologize to our players. Based on our current and potential online presence, I estimate you should plan for at least 10% of your wishlist count in concurrent users (CCU) at launch.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Adjust Balance for PC</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Free-to-play games, especially those with in-game advertisements, need to be rebalanced for PC. The absence of ad revenue on PC means that other monetization strategies need to be carefully considered to avoid alienating players.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Launch Results and Future Plans">Launch Results and Future Plans</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The launch of Pixel Gun 3D on Steam exceeded our expectations. The game ranked in the top 20 grossing games on Steam during its first two days, with peak concurrent players reaching 25,000. Over time, the game stabilized with daily peak concurrent players between 5,000 and 7,000. These metrics have encouraged us to continue developing and improving the PC version. Future plans include regular updates, with a focus on enhancing the PC gaming experience. We are also exploring the possibility of releasing the game on Mac and potentially developing our own launcher to attract players directly. The success of the PC version has also sparked interest in expanding to consoles by 2025.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Our Strategy">Our Strategy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our long-term strategy involves maximizing platform availability for our key games, Pixel Gun 3D and Block City Wars. We aim to ensure our games are playable on a wide range of devices, including low-end hardware, to reach the broadest possible audience. This inclusive approach is critical for maintaining a diverse and engaged player base. In addition to our existing platforms (Android, iOS, and Steam), we are considering porting our games to Mac and exploring the possibility of releasing on consoles. The experience gained from porting Pixel Gun 3D to PC will inform our approach to future platform expansions, including VR and other emerging platforms.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exploring VR">Exploring VR</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, we are considering the development of a VR version of Pixel Gun 3D. We have already developed a prototype in collaboration with Fibrum, and initial results are promising. However, we recognize the unique challenges posed by VR, such as the need to adapt the game’s dynamics and controls for immersive gameplay. While a full VR version may not be feasible due to these limitations, a PvE version or a promotional campaign with a few levels is being explored. We are keen to gather feedback from the community and assess the viability of further VR development based on this input.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Porting Pixel Gun 3D to PC has been a complex but rewarding journey for our team. The successful launch on Steam, driven by strong community support and meticulous development efforts, highlights the potential for mobile games to transition to PC. By leveraging external expertise, understanding the unique aspects of PC gaming, and maintaining a focus on player feedback, we have set a solid foundation for future platform expansions. We will continue to share our learnings with you as we move forward to other platforms!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/troubled-sands-of-time-remake-gains-yet-another-studio.888228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced that yet another studio is joining the long-awaited (and apparently rather troubled)&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>

<p>This time around (no pun intended), it's <a href="https://x.com/UbisoftToronto/status/1797629314059661635" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the turn of Ubisoft Toronto</a>, the studio responsible for making 2020's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/watch-dogs-legion-review">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 6</em>, as well as the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>

<p>Ubisoft Toronto says it's "excited to rewind time" and bring its "creativity, expertise and updated tech" to the project, which is already being worked on by former&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft Montreal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-dagger.jpg?itok=1NuMTd41 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-dagger.jpg?itok=nSkrPu8i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>just got itself a new developer.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake was originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-arriving-in-january">all the way back in September 2020</a>&nbsp;and was given a January 2021 release date, which seems almost hilariously quaint in hindsight.</p>

<p>Obviously, that date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-until-march">subsequently delayed</a>&nbsp;in late 2020, with Ubisoft claiming at that point that the game would launch in March 2021. Again, we can look back on that date and laugh.</p>

<p>In February 2021,&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-date-delayed">was again delayed</a>, although this time it wasn't given a new release date, with Ubisoft instead saying that the game would launch on "a later date" so as to ensure that the remake would be "the best game possible".</p>

<p>Since then, we haven't heard much from the project, although it has been delayed numerous times in the interim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-combat_0.jpg?itok=lWdsCqn1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-combat_0.jpg?itok=p31eEV1D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two other major&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>projects have been released since the&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake was announced.</figcaption></figure><p>Originally, the&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake was being led by the India-based studios Ubisoft Mumbai and Ubisoft Pune, but Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1521519964074749954" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that development had shifted to&nbsp;original&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022.</p>

<p>Now, it looks like Toronto has been brought on to help. Will these two Ubisoft studios be the final custodians of the&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>If you're hankering for a&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>fix, though, two other rather good franchise projects have been released in the intervening years: <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-review-its-about-time-and-space">Metroidvania</a> <i>The Lost Crown&nbsp;</i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-roguelite-precision-platforming-at-its-finest">roguelite platformer</a>&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>. They're both well worth checking out.</p>
