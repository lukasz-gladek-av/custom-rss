<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second installment in Square’s epic remake trilogy. It’s nearly time for the PC release date of FF7 Rebirth for new users to enjoy a fresh chunk of reimagined RPG gameplay, and the potential impact can only be rivaled by the use of Meteor Materia.</p>



<p>I’ve already said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth deserved more love in 2024</a>. Ultimately, it was overshadowed by fascinating new IPs, intricate roguelike card games, and an adorable PlayStation mascot. This doesn’t mean FF7 Rebirth wasn’t a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">success</a> (far from it) as it’s believed Rebirth has sold several million copies to go with its various game of the year awards and nominations.</p>



<p>PlayStation 5 players have had exclusive access to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but PC players are finally set to get their turn to strike.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-release-date">When is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strike down your opponents. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC release date is Jan. 23, 2025</strong>, marking the launch of FF7 Rebirth on only its second platform.</p>



<p>The PC release comes 11 months after the Feb. 29, 2024 debut of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on PlayStation 5. The launch was PS5-exclusive, but as we’ve seen with various PS5-only titles—God of War, Horizon, and Spider-Man—Sony has a habit of timed exclusivity. This means a PC release is always on the cards later down the line, and FF7 Rebirth is the latest addition to the crossover catalog.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s PC release date</a> was confirmed at The Game Awards 2024. The exciting reveal trailer’s climax shows the Jan. 23, 2025 date, but the brief announcement was not the full story here.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-new-features">All Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC New Features</h2>



<p>The “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzWvyncQh8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PC Announce Trailer</a>” explains the PC port’s litany of upgrades over the original. </p>



<p>You can check out each promised improvement below:</p>



<ul>
<li>DLSS</li>



<li>Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling</li>



<li>Improved Lighting</li>



<li>VRR</li>
</ul>



<p>DLSS stands for <strong>Deep Learning Super Sampling</strong> and is a real-time technique designed to artificially boost the frame rate and upscale the rendered gameplay. <strong>Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling</strong> should help Mt. Corel, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-where-to-go-in-nibelheim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nibelheim</a>, and various biomes to pop in new ways never before seen. </p>



<p><strong>Improved Lighting</strong> allows environments to illuminate naturally and look more engaging and lifelike, whereas VRR means <strong>Variable Refresh Rate</strong> and this modern technical process provides various benefits from smoothing the frame rate to reducing lag and preventing screen tearing.</p>



<p>Additionally, “more” differences are indicated by the trailer, but we need to wait for the official launch to see what other surprises Square Enix has up its sleeve.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 rumor mill has been working at a neck-breaking pace lately. Just yesterday, we got our first proper look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new JoyCon controller</a>, thanks to a leak from China. Fans immediately noticed its much larger shoulder buttons than the original Switch controller, as shown in the comparison picture below.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The comparison between Switch 2 and Switch 1 joy-cons. Look at those massive top buttons! 💙 <a href="https://t.co/jcQel893Bg">pic.twitter.com/jcQel893Bg</a></p>
<p>— Mucrush 🦋 (@Mucrush) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mucrush/status/1875892254189162537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, a new rumor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hue20a/switch_2_shipping_data_indicates_the_joycons_will/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> that the new JoyCons could also be used similarly to PC mice. This stems from shipping data listing component parts as 'mouse soles'. Insider NextHandheld had also previously <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hh6flf/unexthandheld_could_be_hinting_that_the_surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that the controller's laser sensors will allow it to be used that way, as we've already seen with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-handheld-with-amd-ryzen-z1-apus-official-starts-at-e799/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Legion Go</a> PC handheld. It could definitely be an interesting new approach for Nintendo Switch 2 gaming.</p>
<p>On a completely separate note, insider Nash Weedle has <a href="https://twitter.com/NWeedle/status/1873657637927338043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873657637927338043%7Ctwgr%5Ebb0b8b52fbe2d6bbc48c4823ef81f0d8f5a12f58%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Frumour-no-mans-sky-to-land-on-nintendo-switch-2-1477163%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> quite clearly that No Man's Sky will be released for Nintendo's new console. This isn't earth-shattering news, as the game is already available on the regular Switch, where it <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-launches-on-nintendo-switch-this-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in October 2022 after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/near-impossible-no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'near-impossible' porting process</a>. The new console is also backward compatible, so the game's compatibility with the system was a given. Weedle probably hints at a new version of No Man's Sky optimized to take advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware improvements; while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-performance-range-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not as powerful as Microsoft's Xbox Series S</a>, the upcoming hybrid console is rumored to be around the PlayStation 4 Pro, with certain built-in advantages over Sony's console like NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. As such, No Man's Sky should certainly look and run a lot better on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>At this point, it would be no exaggeration to say that Nintendo fans are nearly frothing in anticipation of the Japanese console manufacturer and game developer/publisher's official announcement. The reveal might come <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as early as this week</a>, so stay tuned.</p>

            <p>Last June, Valve’s trading card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/artifact">Artifact</a> Classic peaked at 78 players. November was a little rosier for the abandoned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/01/01/12000-people-are-playing-artifact-right-now-and-no-one-knows-why/">who first reported on the phenomena</a>, don’t know. <em>No one knows</em>. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.</p>

<p>This latest 24 peak of 12,500 players echoes a uptick last December of around 14,000, which lasted but a single day. Forbes speculate that the reason is “likely bots” in the absence of any notable community or influencer activity on Twitch, YouTube, or similar. There’s no interest in Artifact’s cards on the Marketplace, say Forbes, so unless Valve is hiding something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-3">Half Life 3 </a>related, there’s no clear reason why this should be happening. Unless…</p>
<p>The game’s subreddit has been doing some theorising of its own, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-dead-tcg-artifact-suddenly-had-12000-players-on-new-years-day-and-the-community-is-baffled">IGN</a>. Is Artifact being used to train AI? Are there <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/comment/m4y3g74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">scammer bots increasing their playtime</a> to build legitimacy for other, nefarious purposes? Could it be pirates using the free-to-play game’s AppID/SDK to mask other games - an honour, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/12k_players_again/">according to one poster</a>, usually reserved for Spacewar?</p><p>Paul Curtin digs into <a href="https://www.githyp.com/piracy-on-steam-may-have-tripled-in-past-2-years-based-on-unexpected-source/">this here</a>, but the basic idea is that pirates will give cracked games the AppID of the game Spacewar, which used to be part of Steamworks’ software dev kit as a testing tool. The pirated game then shows up as Spacewar to Steam, which then does whatever the platform equivalent of a slightly suspicious British Bobby deciding to move along casually twirling their baton and whistling is.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in diving into Artifact’s deflating history, Will Partin’s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/artifact-isnt-a-game-on-steam-its-steam-in-a-game/">brilliant piece</a> for Waypoint remains the definitive chronicle. The game ceased development and went free-to-play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-have-stopped-working-on-artifact-20-and-so-theyve-made-the-game-free">back in 2021</a>, with Valve saying “we haven't managed to get the active player numbers to a level that justifies further development at this time."</p>
<p>Valve’s newest multiplayer offering is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, which Matt Cox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fiddly-parkour-is-the-secret-sauce-that-makes-every-moment-of-deadlock-compelling">wrote about here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Photo by Yui Mok/PA Images via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on that, then, Notch is indeed setting out to work on a spiritual successor to Minecraft a decade after selling Mojang to Microsoft for $2.5 billion. Mojang continues to work on the eternally popular Minecraft, of course, putting out multiple updates each year across all the platforms the sandbox game is available on. Minecraft is officially the best-selling video game of all time, with an incredible 300 million copies sold. Microsoft has made no indication that it intends to release a Minecraft 2, which comes as no surprise given how popular Minecraft remains. Perhaps that leaves the door open for Notch to fill a gap from the original creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Notch noted himself, it remains to be seen whether this ‘Minecraft 2’ ever sees the light of day. Since selling to Microsoft, the Swedish developer has started and stopped a number of games, including space sandbox game 0x10c (pronounced "Ten to the C”). However, in another tweet, Notch said the odds of him finishing projects now are higher than they were because he has employees he feels responsible for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In later tweets, Notch answered questions from followers on social media about this Minecraft 2, and insisted he doesn’t want to use anything “too similar to the stuff I sold,” in this new game. He also said his Minecraft 2 wouldn’t be a story game, suggesting a new sandbox of some kind. “I'd make a similar game [to Minecraft] based on what I think the audience that says they want that game might enjoy,” he explained. “Probably do early access to make sure we're on track.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I mean best I've got at the moment is Adventureland, so yeah no idea</p>— notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1875234889773261240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Notch even went on to <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875244214272893244" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">say</a> that if Minecraft ever wanted him to make an official Minecraft 2 and both parties agreed on terms, “I'd absolutely be willing to to that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'd even give them a much bigger share than I'd feel obliged to just to make it clear I'm not doing it with ill intent,” he continued, before adding: “But I'll be a bitch to work with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems unlikely that Microsoft would work with Notch, given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/28/new-minecraft-update-removes-mentions-of-notch">it removed his name from the opening credits of Minecraft</a> following various controversial statements he made in the years following the sale of Mojang.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Yui Mok/PA Images via Getty Images,</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>If you are one of the many who play Wordle every day (I still like to use it to flex the ol' mental muscles with my morning cup of tea), you may well be interested to discover the one word in 2024 that stumped so many of us, it broke a whopping 5.6m streaks.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/news/new-york-times-top-wordle-connections-2024-rcna185738">Today</a>, editorial director of NYT Games Everdeen Mason revealed that 11.1bn puzzles were solved via the New York Times in 2024. Of those, Wordle accounted for 5.3bn plays.</p>

<p>The most played day for the New York Times' Wordle puzzle was 23rd April, when the word was Rover. But the word that left the most players scratching their heads arrived later in the year, on 15th October. That word was Corer. Like I said, this chap caused 5.6m Wordle streaks to come to an end.</p><p>In addition to sharing these little titbits, Mason revealed 2.8 million of us are creatures of habit and routine, and use the same starting word every day. As Eurogamer reported previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-now-has-an-in-app-bot-to-analyse-how-good-your-guesses-are">the most popular starting word for Wordle is Adieu</a>, which is actually what my mother uses (for general interest, I always start with Ouija. My sister-in-law starts with Ocean).</p>
<p>I also learned a few weeks ago that Epona - Link's wonderful horse from the Legend of Zelda series - can not be used as a guess. I was quite upset by this, and took a screenshot to document this sad moment (and now, finally, I have somewhere to share it - so, hurrah!).</p>

<p>Along with Wordle, other New York Times puzzles also remain popular. In 2024, the Mini Crossword and Strands accounted for 2.1bn and 1.3bn plays respectively. I recently discovered Strands - which is a kind of themed word search - along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-responds-to-only-connect-resemblance">Only Connect clone Connections</a>, and have added these to my daily puzzle time. Anyone else?</p>

            <p>The Sonic film franchise has now surpassed $1bn at the global box office, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> prior to Christmas.</p>
<p>The latest film earned over $187m in the US, for a worldwide total of $336.3m. It debuted globally with $211.5m in its first week.</p>
<p>The previous two films collectively grossed $725.2m globally, following releases in 2020 and 2022 respectively. In addition, they generated $181m in consumer spending on home rentals and purchases, while the Knuckles TV spin-off on Paramount+ was the number one Kids and Family series ever on the platform with 11m global hours watched in its first 28 days of streaming.</p>

<p>Sonic 3 has certainly been a success, then, earning franchise-best critics ratings, aided by the inclusion of Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>"We are so overjoyed with the amazing response to the Sonic the Hedgehog films from audiences and fans around the world and are proud to be part of the incredible, world-class filmmaking team that has come together to build this franchise," producers Neal H Moritz and Toby Ascher said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>"We make these movies for the fans; and their passion, support and love for these characters is what drives us every day to continue creating the fast, funny and action-packed stories that make up the ever-expanding Sonic Universe."</p> <div>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-30-to-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-30-to-26.1074633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-30-to-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we approach the midway point of our Most Wanted Games of 2025 list, there’s a suitably odd mish-mash of genres, new and old IP, and styles of game. From the turn-based RPG of Clair Obscur, to Borderlands 4’s looter shooter, and then onward to the Telltale successor studio’s superhero-infused Dispatch, there’s some great variety here.</p>
<h2>30 – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p>JRPGs are in a really good place right now, but who says you have to be a Japanese studio or developer to make a game in this style? French studio Sandfall Interactive has taken inspiration from this subgenre, belndingit with a Belle Epoque France fantasy world to create the turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dLBUD08_3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Poignant and painterly</a>, as I described it for our Gamescom preview, the game sees you follow yet another doomed expedition as they venture out to try and stop the Paintress from literally just ending the lives of people of a certain age. It will lean in on the tried and true turn-based RPG combat, with a few invigorating twists mixed in, such as an active QTE element and Persona-like menus fanning out from characters. This could be a real treat for fans of the genre.</p>

<h2>29 – Borderlands 4</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the planet Kairos, a world that’s dominated by a ruthless dictator known as the Timekeeper, with an army of synthetic followers known as the Order. You, of course, will play as a Vault Hunter searching for mythical alien treasures in a race against time against the Timekeeper to uncover it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official First Look" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26vY2GMfYTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You pretty much know what to expect from Borderlands 4, with the procedurally generated loot pushing you on through each battle and mission, and a humour-filled script that will thankfully tone down the toilet humour of Borderlands 3. We’re yet to really be introduced to the Vault Hunters that will lead this adventure, but the gameplay first look showed an impressive sense of scale and slick snippets of action.</p>
<h2>28 – Dispatch</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from the minds behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>, and with a cast that features Aaron Paul, Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright, Dispatch is a narrative adventure that’s well worth paying attention to.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DISPATCH | Official Reveal Trailer - Extended Cut (HD)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbERWU5bc50?feature=oembed" width="780" height="439" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Casting you as a de-suited Robert Roberston, formerly known as Mecha Man, this is a superhero workplace comedy that sees him adapt to life without powers. He still has a role to play in the community, but as a part of the dispatch centre team, charged with rehabilitating ex-supervillains as they go straight. Between the narrative moments, you’ll also have to manage those heroes, sending them out to answer calls, managing their particular skills and helping to unlock their full potential.</p>
<h2>27 – Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>The early 2000s and PS2 era is proving to be a fertile source for modern remakes, and Konami is the latest to try to get in on the action with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Having been rumoured for years, this MGS3 remake was confirmed back in 2023, with 2024 giving us a couple of additional glimpses of cutscenes and story.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - Official Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sk6VdMoAgTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is really known about the remake, how much the gameplay is being tweaked and modernised, but you can see from the cutscene-heavy trailers that the game does look pretty fab with Unreal Engine 5 powering it, and they’ve kept a lot of that Kojima tone.</p>
<h2>26 – The Sinking City 2</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</p>
<p>After all the trials and tribulations that Frogwares went through with the first game, it’s great to see The Sinking City 2 coming from Frogwares. This one’s a little bit different, though, with the team diving in on a full horror experience.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Sinking City 2 | World Premiere Trailer (PC, PS5, Xbox Series)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLIOZg9NzUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Taking us to 1920s Arkham – the Lovecraft one, not the Batman one – there’s still plenty of cosmic horror here, and you’re still trawling through a flooded city, but the detective elements of the first game have been toned down a lot. Combat and exploration will be the main focus now, the city and world you can explore will be smaller, and the team is aiming to have a much stronger visual horror as well.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve heard an update on this one – Frogwares has its roots as a Ukrainian studio, so there’s some real hardships that they’ve faced this past few years – but we hope to hear and see more on this soon if they’re to hit their 2025 release target.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Japanese publisher and developer CAPCOM <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Resident Evil 4 remake has sold over nine million units since its debut in late March 2023. It is no doubt a remarkable result, especially when considering that the game is essentially the same as the 2005 classic from a content standpoint.</p>
<p>The first three million units <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-surpass-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were sold</a>&nbsp;<span>just two days after launch. The fourth million mark&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was passed</a>&nbsp;in early April 2023, while the fifth&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was reached</a> in late July 2023. CAPCOM provided the next sales update around the game's first anniversary, when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-over-7-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that&nbsp;</span>the Resident Evil 4 remake had sold over seven million copies.</p>
<p>The game was well received overall by critics, too, though our own Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't quite love it</a> (but still gave it an 8.5 out of 10):</p>
<p><em>Now, I have to say, while the tone of the last few paragraphs has been a bit negative, whether we’re talking about the original or the remake, Resident Evil 4 is still a very good game. I may be a bit disappointed by the scope and ambition of Capcom’s reimagining, but RE4 is still one of the most inventive and engaging action-horror games ever made, and this is a competent, technically-impressive new version of the game. The village battle may be largely the same, but it still gets your blood pumping. Same goes for the cabin defense sequence, your showdown with the village chief, or your first encounter with a Regenerator. The Resident Evil 4 remake is still a fun, bombastic dose of mayhem, I just feel like it had the potential to be even better. It also suffers from the fact that Resident Evil Village was, in some ways, the bigger, crazier take on RE4 that this remake could have been.</em></p>
<p>2025 might be a big year for the franchise, at least when it comes to announcements. Resident Evil 9 is expected to be unveiled, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rumor-resident-evil-9-reportedly-launching-in-second-half-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially with a late 2025 launch window</a>, and there are already rumors that the atmosphere will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired by Resident Evil 4</a> while also having two 'unkillable stalkers' possibly inspired by Resident Evil 3's Nemesis. The playable characters are rumored to be two of the most iconic protagonists in the series: Jill Valentine (Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 3, Resident Evil 5) and Leon Kennedy (Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 6).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wwe-2k23-servers-officially-closed-down-today.1074606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k23-servers-officially-closed-down-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For many, this doesn't come as a surprise. WWE 2K23 was removed from all storefronts on November 1, 2024. It's now been taken one step further, with all online functionality for the title being removed. This means that anyone who was hoping to scrap against their friends in some online matches will no longer be able to do so. Instead, you will now have to resort to purchasing the latest game in the franchise, WWE 2K24. This title was only released in March 2024, and with an economic crisis and games being relatively pricey, people have to pick and choose which games they're picking up and when.</p>
<p>For a fair amount of players, WWE 2K23 losing online functionality won't affect them whatsoever. However, for those who haven't had the chance or funds to pick up the latest game in the franchise, it does make the franchise inaccessible. Compared to previous titles, this game didn't even have long in terms of online functionality, as it lasted less than two years before all of the servers were pulled.</p>
<p>Thus far, 2K hasn't given a reason as to why WWE 2K23's servers have closed down, just the broad statement that they were shutting down when announcing that the game was equally being pulled from storefronts in November. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>WWE 2K23 is getting its final takedown. As of January 6, 2025 the servers will be discontinued. This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. You will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point. However, if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes.</em></p>
<p>Whether they will announce why this has happened is uncertain, as they commonly shut down servers for their old sports games, such as NBA 2K23 also being delisted from digital storefronts in December, 2024. However, some fans were expecting that 2K would push the date back and give fans more time with WWE 2K23. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.</p>
<p>Now, the only game in the WWE franchise that has online functionality is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k24-launch-roster-vince-mcmahon-brock-lesnar/">WWE 2K24</a>. If you want to purchase this game, the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24CROSSGEN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard edition</a> of the title will set you back around $69.99. There are also many different editions and bundles you can get, which can set you back up to a whopping $139.99, depending on what edition of the game you get. However, the most expensive version of the game does come in a bundle with NBA 2K25 and TopSpin 2K25. These games have recently been on sale for the festive period, but the sale is soon ending, meaning those who want to get their hands on the new wrestling game will have to pay top price for it.</p>
<p>Will you miss WWE 2K23?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/wwe-2k23-servers-have-been-shut-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>WWE 2K23’s servers have now been shut down, with 2K sunsetting all online functionality for the wrestling game. This means, currently, the only WWE game with online functionality is WWE 2K24, which was released in March 2024. WWE 2K23 was released in March 2023, meaning the online functions of the game lasted less than two years. The game had already been removed from digital storefronts on November 1st, 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Even Stronger  | WWE 2K23 Official Showcase Trailer | 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LRreShTggQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In its announcement about the WWE 2K23 server closures, 2K wrote, <em>“WWE 2K23 is getting its final takedown. As of January 6, 2025 the servers will be discontinued.This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. You will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point, however if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes.”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/29/wwe-2k23-review/">WWE 2K23 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our WWE 2K23 review, Adrian said, <em>“As a wrestling fan, I want to create five-star classic matches, with back-and-forth action, near falls, and iconic moments, but ultimately WWE 2K23 cannot facilitate that. Messy and overly complicated controls hamper those efforts, but it’s 2K’s obsession with players winning matches that ensure this professional wrestling game misses the point entirely.”</em></p>

<p>This server shutdown follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/01/nba-2k23-has-now-been-delisted/">NBA 2K23’s servers</a> being taken offline on December 31st, 2024, after being delisted from digital storefronts at the end of November. This is standard practice for 2K, as the company turns off servers it’s big sports games only a couple of years after release to focus on the latest titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-assassins-creed-in-any-order/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> is one of the most legendary franchises in gaming history, with a series stretching back over fifteen years. It’s an iconic, open-world collection that boasts ambitious adventures, immersive stories, and memorable characters. But, given that there are dozens of games in the series, we’re asking (and answering) an all-important question: ‘Can you play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed/">Assassin’s Creed</a> in any order?’</p>



<p>Some die-hard fans might have their ideal chronology, but in this guide, we’re looking on a more general scale. If you’re wondering what order to play Assassin’s Creed in, look no further than this guide.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can use it to get an idea of the size of the franchise ahead of the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-assassin-s-creed-games-are-there">How Many Assassin’s Creed Games Are There?</h2>



<p>It’s a rich and storied franchise that can be traced back to 2007. It’s a little-known fact, but <em>Assassin’s Creed’s</em> origins rest with <em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/prince-of-persia/">Prince of Persia</a></em>. It was later revealed that 2007’s <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> title, which kicked off the franchise, was an experiment, with the project being twisted from the failed development of a<em> Prince of Persia</em> game. </p>



<p>In total, there are <strong>13</strong> major <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games and several more spin-off titles that were typically released on handheld consoles and mobile devices. It’s a franchise that has taken players from Ancient Greece to Victorian London, and with each new release, the lore gets richer, deeper, and more immersive.</p>



<p>With that in mind, can you play<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in any order?</p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-games-planned/">Ubisoft Has 11 Assassin’s Creed Games Planned</a></strong></h6>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-in-any-order">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed in Any Order?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically, no restrictions are blocking you from playing<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in whatever order you so desire, but some barricades might make the experience a little confusing.</p>



<p>For instance, if you wanted to soak up the entire timeline in order of release, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> (2007) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage </em>(2023). But, if you wanted to play the series in chronological order, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> (2018) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> (2015). </p>



<p>With the most recent releases, Ubisoft pivoted to an RPG-based model, with each game more or less being a standalone title with only a few concepts and aspects connecting them. For instance, Assassin’s Creed Origins (2017), Assassin’s Creed Odyssey (2018), and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (2020) can all be experienced as standalone games but there is an underlying story that connects them.</p>



<p>It’s not as jarring an experience as if you were to play the older games as standalone titles, though. For example,<em> Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood</em> (2010) was a direct sequel to <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> (2009). The former game starts in the exact scenes where the latter game ends, so if you’ve not played<em> Assassin’s Creed II</em>, <em>Brotherhood </em>will be disorienting until you’ve managed to catch up on the story.</p>

<h2 id="h-does-that-answer-your-question">Does That Answer Your Question?</h2>



<p>If you’ve been wondering what order to play<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> in, we hope that’s cleared things up. There are a few ways to soak up the franchise, but ultimately, it’s up to you in which order you play the games. Realistically, if you were to play them in order of release, you’d be neck-deep in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games for several hundred hours.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s best to start with the most recent titles and track backwards if you want to learn about the origins of the series and what it all means. You can also skip some games if you don’t feel like they’d interest you. It’s your journey, after all. There might not be any one ‘best Assassin’s Creed order’.</p>

<p>It was almost ten years between Dead Island 2 being revealed and it being released – and fans are hoping that history doesn’t repeat itself. During the closing scenes of Dead Island 2, there are suggestions made that point to a follow-up title being delivered, but we need to dig into that idea to see the truth in it.</p>



<p>Is Dead Island 3 coming out? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-long-until-dead-island-3-is-released">How Long Until Dead Island 3 Is Released?</h2>



<p>Dambuster Studios, the developer that finally created Dead Island 2 in all its zombie-slaying glory, is reportedly ‘prepared for Dead Island 3.’ In <a href="https://gamerant.com/dead-island-2-release-sequel-threequel-when-dambuster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with Game Rant</a>, one developer at the studio revealed that the team has ‘set the stage’ for an eventual release of Dead Island 3, given how the second game closes out. </p>



<p>It’s very open-ended – but don’t worry, I won’t spoil it here.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the ending – and how it was laid out – would facilitate an expansive sequel, but is Dambuster Studios truly committed to delivering it? Are we going to have history repeat itself, seeing Dead Island 3 announced and then put on a back burner for ten years?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Dead Island 2 suffered so greatly because it kept changing hands. If it stays with Dambuster Studios – which it should – then there’s almost no doubt that Dead Island 3 will come out at some point in the next few years.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 was an overwhelming success, with many post-apocalyptic gamers being all too eager to get their hands on a game that they’d waited a decade for. It secured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-1m-sales-zombies/">over one million sales</a> in a relatively short time – just a few days. It went on to remain successful, with Dambuster releasing a string of expansions and content drops that kept the player base fully engaged for many months to follow.</p>



<p>But what about a sequel?</p>



<p>Ultimately, to answer the question, ‘Is Dead Island 3 coming out,’ we’ll have to say that we honestly don’t know – but we can wait and hope that something is revealed in a year or two, perhaps. </p>

			<p>Infinity Nikki is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/">latest gacha game</a> to take the world by storm and is the perfect game for those who are fans of dress-up games and enjoy the platforming from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, as those elements feature very heavily in this game. For those who want to get stuck, the game is <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completely free to play</a> and is available on PC, iOS, Android, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>For those just getting stuck in it or those who have sunk a fair amount of time into it, there are some codes that you can use to give you access to free rewards. Of course, like any game that has redeemable codes, they will expire after some time. These are the current active codes for January 2025 in Infinity Nikki.</p>
<h2>All Active Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<ul>
<li>PEARFECTGUIDES - 10 Shining Particles and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>NIKKIXWEBTOON - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>INGIFT1205 - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some additional international codes that you can use. To be able to use them, we recommend copying and pasting them on a PC or mobile.</p>
<ul>
<li>ニキプレゼント1205 - 50 Shiny Bubbles and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>おめでとう - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>

</ul>
<h2>How To Redeem Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<p>To redeem Infinity Nikki codes, you need to have access to your Pear-Pal. You get this once you have met Dada Florawish Stylist's Guild. This is very early on in the story, so you'll find this area quickly. Once you've done that, there will be a gear icon below the Pear-Pal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Gear, and it will open the Settings menu.</li>
<li>Select 'Other'</li>
<li>There will be a Redeem Code box</li>
<li>Click on it and enter your code</li>
<li>Press 'Apply'</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your code has been entered correctly, you will get the rewards from the code. It will give you a notification about the items you've been given for using the code. There may be a message telling you that the code is incorrect or expired. As we said earlier, the codes are time-sensitive, and it's possible that the codes have now expired, and you will no longer be able to get rewards for them. Check out the expired codes below to see if the one you tried to enter is on the list.</p>
<h2>Expired Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<ul>

			<p>2024, what a year. It has seen the utter decimation of thousands of jobs, the failures of countless "Triple-A" games and a few <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Quadruple-A" games</a>, and a general downturn in the games industry. My favourite genres - strategy and simulation - haven't had a great year, with few marquee titles. Even the stalwart of the simulation genre, Football Manager, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was delayed</a> in a move that made 2024 the break from the annual saga that started in 2003 (for the best, in my opinion) - and a number on my <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most anticipated</a> list did not see a release, with one cancellation.</p>
<p>We can't be talking about games that haven't even come out yet; we need to be talking about Strategy and Simulation games that have been released, so let's dive into Wccftech's Best Strategy and Simulation Games of 2024. As always, games that aren't released cannot be used on this list, so there are no early-access titles, nor can remasters.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2024-hop-skip-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platformer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2024-with-or-against-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-sports-racing-games-of-2024-switching-gears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports &amp; Racing</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Homeworld 3 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/homeworld-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.5/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Strategy (Real-Time Strategy).&nbsp; <strong>Platform:</strong> PC.</p>
<p>It's most certainly the biggest name on this list. Homeworld 3 is one I first got hands-on with back in 2022. It had a delay, but it finally got a release in 2024, which was successful. While there were a few issues at launch, Homeworld 3 was and is a great game that returns you to the world and gameplay of the classic titles.</p>
<p>Here's what I said in the summary of my review of Homeworld 3:</p>
<p><em>Homeworld 3 marks a successful return to a long-revered series. Bringing back the successful space strategy series, but improving the combat by a large amount with a more tactical approach, Blackbird Interactive has successfully made their mark. With exceptional tactical combat, made all the more important by the fact that everything carries over, and one bad mistake could cripple you much further down the line. The additional War Games mode only enhances this, making for a very engaging title.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Frostpunk 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation.&nbsp; <strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation, Xbox.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is a game I was very much looking forward to, being on my most anticipated list. When I got hands-on with it in previews, I was even more interested before I finally got to review it upon release. My summary back then was:</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others.</em></p>
<p>I stick by this. Frostpunk 2 is an excellent game that firmly expanded on the original while keeping what made it great. The move from the single core to creating districts made perfect sense. Expanding the world map elements, creating outposts, and more added a whole new level to the game. This is one I recommend and one I would argue is the best game of the year on this list.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Satisfactory (<a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation. <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Satisfactory is a monster of a game. Launching first into Early Access back when I was still cuddled up in my safety blanket, nestled with a nice bottle of lukewarm milk, the thirty-year-old me never knew that it would take five and a half years to <a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-finally-leaves-early-access-on-september-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully release</a>, but even before release, it would sell 5.5 million copies.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, and it's well deserved. In a genre that rarely reaches such wide reaches, Satisfactory turned building a factory - albeit one on an alien planet where you also have to survive - into something millions wanted to buy and play and an average daily player base that would make most "AAA" games envious.</p>
<p>There's not much I can say about this game that you don't already know because you play it or you've looked and decided you aren't interested. The level of detail, as complex as it is, is made so easy to get into. The creativity is excellent. The gameplay is enjoyable and addictive. Satisfactory has it all, and its success reflects that.</p>

<h2>Ara: History Untold (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5/10</a>)</h2>

<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based Strategy (4x). <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide Games has finally produced another game after their debut title. While their first game is mostly remembered for being an early DirectX 12/Asynchronous Compute <a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-escalation-updated-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmark</a>, Ara: History Untold, which Xbox Game Studios published, is very much focused on the gameplay experience. It's also turn-based, whereas Ashes was a real-time strategy game. Here's what I had to say about Ara in the review:</p>
<p><em>I must admit, when not writing this review, my brain kept saying, "I like this, but", and I'd decided that I was leaning towards around a score of six and a half, but putting everything on paper and playing more, I was wrong. Ara: History Untold is a genuinely good 4X strategy game, but it has its issues. If you like the genre, you will like this. If you want a 4X with even more added depth, this will tickle your pleasure zones. I fully intend to play it more.</em></p>

<h2>Strategy and Simulation Games in 2024, and Honourable Mentions</h2>
<p>I think it's been a slow year for Strategy and Simulation games. There have only been a few marquee titles in Homeworld 3 and Frostpunk 2, but nothing that could let 2024 compete with what is still arguably the best year for the genres in recent memory: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-strategy-games-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm only human, as we all are, so there are some good-looking strategy and simulation games that we haven't played due to time or any other reason. Some such titles are <a href="https://www.songsofconquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songs of Conquest</a>, <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Coaster 2</a>, <a href="https://www.ug1775.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimate General: American Revolution</a>, and <a href="https://www.f1manager.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 Manager 2024</a>, to name a few. Still, of the others we have played, here are some noteworthy titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic (<a href="https://www.sovietrepublic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Empires of the Undergrowth (<a href="https://eotugame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Diplomacy is Not an Option (<a href="https://www.door407.com/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (<a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>While this has been a slow year, thanks to delays and cancellations, there are positives to look forward to. Games in early access will emerge from it, and new games will be released - likely stalwarts of genres such as Total War and, of course, Football Manager. Roll on the games of 2025!</p>

            <p>Another day, another Nintendo <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leak - this time pertaining to images that purport to be of a Joy-Con for Nintendo's Switch successor.</p>
<p>As Tom reported a little while back, we've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.</p>

<p>Now we have brand-new images of what's reported to be the new generation of Joy-Con controllers with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Reportedly originating from China, the Joy-Con shows off its new magnetic attachment as well as revised colour palette which differs from existing Joy-Cons.</p> <div>

<p>If the images are authentic - and right now, there is no proof - it looks like we can also expect enlarged SL and SR buttons, too, and maybe even a mouse-like optical sensor. You can check the photos out yourself in the X post above or in the subreddit thread embedded below:</p>

</span></p><p>If the images are not fake and do indeed originate from a Chinese factory that's manufacturing the new machines (apparently, the Joy-Con has a system serial number that is allegedly validated by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hua4lu/the_leaked_photo_of_the_switch_2_joycon_has_a/">Nintendo's Check Warranty page</a>), it seems increasingly unlikely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo will exceed its self-imposed deadline of 31st March 2025</a> to show off its Switch successor.</p>
<p>When it does arrive, fans expect next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-awaited blockbuster Metroid Prime 4</a> to launch on Nintendo's new hardware.

            <p>As Amazon's phenomenal TV adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> begins filming its second series, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has opened up on why he thinks violence sells when it comes to AAA games, particularly RPGs.</p>
<p>Over the New Year, Cain posted a video to YouTube about "why so many AAA RPGs expect and often require the player to do combat" and discussed "whether or not games treat [violence] as the default".</p>

<p>Acknowledging he's had "pushback on similar answers in the past", Cain then summarised his thoughts with: "The TL;DR of it is, companies make games - and, in general, products - that people will buy. That's it".</p>
<p>"It means games that sell the most - and I'm not even talking about review the best, just sell the most - will dictate future games.</p>
<p>"This is <em>obvious</em>. If you have a company and it's trying to make money and there's one game type that sells millions of copies and another one that sells a hundred thousand, which one are you going to do if they both take <em>just</em> as much time and money to develop? This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars," he added.</p>
<p>And people who do choose to vote with their wallets won't just be a "drop in the bucket", Cain insisted. If enough people did the same, "those drops become a storm and companies will listen".</p>
<p>"Action genres tend to sell very well, and by that I mean, action RPGs kinda outsell classic RPGs, even though both of them are violent," he added. "It's also easier to market those sorts of games. When you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching - it looks like: 'Whoa! Look at all the things you can do in that game' [...] It's hard to show the other things.</p><p>"How do we show that this game has a really good story? How do we show that it has fantastic dialogue? How do you do that in a trailer that may only be 15 or 30 seconds long?" Cain said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-co-creator-tim-cain-says-violence-will-be-the-default-in-aaa-rpgs-as-long-as-we-keep-buying-it-companies-dont-make-them-because-they-feel-like-it-they-make-them-because-they-sell/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"You have to reduce this wonderful narrative, that's super creative and nuanced that has a huge arc, down to a soundbite. And guess what? It's because most people won't watch more than a few seconds of something!"</p>
<p>As for that aforementioned Amazon Fallout show? Last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Walton Goggins slipped back into his Ghoulish guise</a> to start filming the second season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
