			<p>A report from <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-postpones-launch-of-Switch-2-in-China">Nikkei</a> reveals that Nintendo has decided to postpone the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-stepping-up-to-be-more-of-a-primary-platform-says-analyst/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in China. According to the report, this indefinite delay comes from Nintendo waiting to see what demand exists for the Switch 2 before its launch in China.</p>
<p>This is not unlike the original Nintendo Switch coming to China. Officially, the original Nintendo Switch arrived in China in 2019, two years after the console was available worldwide. Currently, the Nintendo Switch is sold in China through a collaboration with Tencent, who declined to comment to Nikkei when asked if they would also distribute the Nintendo Switch 2 in the region.</p>
<p>Nintendo's delay in bringing its new console to China isn't the biggest surprise, considering that last November, the company <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-to-close-switch-eshop-and-online-services-in-china-in-2026">confirmed</a> it would be shutting down online services, including the eShop, in China by 2026.</p>
<p>While some of the world's biggest games come from Chinese developers like Genshin Impact or the recent free-to-play success, Marvel Rivals, strict regulations around video games in the region still challenge releasing a game in China and finding success in the country.</p>
<p>Chief analyst at Gamma Data told Nikkei, "<em>The hurdles to success in China remain high. They need to improve the consumer experience while complying with government policies, and there is also the issue of whether they will be able to introduce major international software</em>."</p>
<p>Nikkei's report also adds that the console and the software released will need to go through approval processes from Chinese authorities, which could result in more restrictions on releasing the hardware and software.</p>
<p>Regarding the demand for the Nintendo Switch 2 in China, the report adds that retailers have been accepting pre-orders for the device, both in-store and online—pre-orders that will now presumably be canceled.</p>
<p>There's definitely some demand for Nintendo consoles and games in China, but the rollout of the Nintendo Switch and now the Switch 2 show just how precarious it is to get the console to the region in the first place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has reportedly postponed the Switch 2 in China, with stringent government restrictions and a continuing analysis of demand in the country being the main reasons for said delay.</p>

<p>According to Nikkei (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-wont-be-releasing-switch-2-in-china-yet-as-it-reportedly-analyses-demand/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Nintendo is looking into how much demand there would be among Chinese gamers for the Nintendo Switch 2 before deciding to release the console in the country.</p>

<p>Nikkei says that games and consoles in China are subject to exhaustive government inspections, with the Chinese government often imposing restrictions on said software and hardware based on what VGC calls its "intentions". As such, Nintendo may decide the headache of going through said inspections isn't worth the returns it would get by selling the Switch 2 in China.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/switch-2-delayed-china-console.jpg?itok=4V_52SKs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/switch-2-delayed-china-console.jpg?itok=zHPRAaFk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is reportedly delaying the Switch 2 in China.</figcaption></figure><p>As VGC points out, Nikkei's report points to the fact that Tencent is a co-distributor of the original Nintendo Switch in China, and when asked for comment, the tech giant declined to say whether it would also be involved with distributing the Switch 2.</p>

<p>It's possible, then, that the Switch 2 won't see an official release in China; it's a market largely dominated by mobile and PC games, so it may be that Nintendo decides the potential customer gain isn't worth the hoops it would have to jump through.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo is in the process of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-eshop-online-closing-china-2026" rel="nofollow">closing down the Switch's online services and eShop</a> in China, with the shutdown scheduled for the end of March next year. Evidently, the company doesn't see a benefit to keeping the services online any longer than that, which is another indication that there's not a large audience for the Switch 2 in China.</p>




<p>In case you missed it, the Switch 2 was revealed in full during a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct show last week</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world, the console is set for a June 5th release, a date Nintendo insists hasn't changed despite delays to pre-orders in both the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a>. Whether or not it sees a release in China remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>Two Microsoft software engineers who interrupted a Microsoft anniversary event to protest against the company's dealings with the Israeli military have been fired for misconduct, according to a report. Software engineer Ibtihal Aboussad, who is based in Canada and once worked for the company's genAI division, lost her job on Monday 7th April due to "wilful misconduct, disobedience or wilful neglect of duty," according to internal documents picked up by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/microsoft-fires-engineers-who-protested-during-anniversary-celebration.html">CNBC</a>. Another Microsoft software engineer, Vaniya Agrawal, had announced that she would resign on April 11th, but according to another document cited by CNBC, Microsoft have terminated her job in advance.</p><!--more-->
<p>Microsoft's business dealings with Israel's defence establishment have been in the spotlight recently thanks to investigations by the Guardian, +972 Magazine, Local Call, Drop Site News and the Associated Press. In a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108">lengthy and very disturbing article from February</a>, the AP claim that the Israeli military's use of Microsoft computing services and OpenAI technologies has "skyrocketed" to "nearly 200 times higher" since the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian militants on 7th October 2023.</p>
<p>The AP report is based upon interviews with current and former members of Microsoft and the Israeli armed forces, together with internal company data and documents. It claims that the Israeli military have used "AI-enabled systems" for intelligence operations during Israel's subsequent invasion and bombardment of Gaza, which has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people. It also discusses the use of genAI transcription software and Microsoft Azure for mass surveillance. There's a lot more in the full piece, which doesn't begin and end with Microsoft's alleged involvement: the AP also discuss the Israeli military's relationship with other big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco and Oracle.</p>
<p>Prior to Aboussad and Agrawal's intervention, many Microsoft employees have spoken out against their employer's reported involvement with Israel's armed forces. Back in May 2024, Microsoft workers <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">launched a petition</a> calling on the company to disclose all ties with the Israel Defense Forces, submit to an independent audit for potential human rights violations, protect employees speaking up for Palestinians, and overall "end Microsoft's complicity in Israeli genocide and apartheid by terminating all Azure contracts and partnerships with the Israeli military and government". The signatories are also pushing Microsoft to make a formal call for a ceasefire. "The products and services we build are being used and distributed around the globe to surveil, censor, and destroy," the organisers write. "We cannot stand by while our labor is utilized to aid in the oppression of innocent people."</p>
<p>Aboussad and Agrawal both took action on Friday 4th April at separate events organised to celebrate Microsoft's 50 year anniversary.  As reported by CNBC, Aboussad approached the stage during a speech from Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman in Redmond, Washington, calling him a "war profiteer" and declaring that "all of Microsoft has blood on its hands," before being escorted out. "Mustafa, shame on you," she said. "You claim that you care for using AI for good, but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty thousand people have died, and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region."</p>
<p>Aboussad subsequently spelled out her grievances in an email to Suleyman and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella, finance chief Amy Hood, operating chief Carolina Dybeck Happe, and company president Brad Smith. "I spoke up today because after learning that my org was powering the genocide of my people in Palestine, I saw no other moral choice," she wrote. "This is especially true when I've witnessed how Microsoft has tried to quell and suppress any dissent from my coworkers who tried to raise this issue." This last part may be a reference to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">Microsoft's firing last year of Abdo Mohamed and Hossam Nasr</a> after they held a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza.</p>
<p>In further correspondence cited by CNBC, a Microsoft contact then told Aboussad that her email to executives served as "an admission that you deliberately and willfully engaged in your earlier misconduct", adding that she could have aired her grievances "confidentially with your manager, or with Global Employee Relations. Instead, you chose to intentionally disrupt the speech of Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman." The message to Aboussad concludes "that your misconduct was designed to gain notoriety and cause maximum disruption to this highly anticipated event", and that "immediate cessation of your employment is the only appropriate response."</p>
<p>As for Agrawal, she interrupted a speech by Nadella at another event, and sent a similar email to executives afterwards. "You may have seen me stand up earlier today to call out Satya during his speech at the Microsoft 50th anniversary," Agrawal writes in the email, as reported by CNBC. "Over the past 1.5 years, I've grown more aware of Microsoft's growing role in the military-industrial complex." Agrawal further argued that Microsoft are "complicit" in the bloodshed as a "digital weapons manufacturer that powers surveillance, apartheid, and genocide", and that "by working for this company, we are all complicit."</p>
<p>Microsoft have yet to say anything about all this publicly save for the following statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/microsoft-fires-employees-protesting-israeli-militarys-use-of-companys-ai-tech/">PCGamer</a>: "We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard. Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate." The company have also yet to comment on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">last week's news</a> that the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement have made Microsoft a "priority target", and are <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft">calling on supporters</a> to avoid Microsoft and Xbox gaming services and products.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released on March 20 to a reception that nobody expected. It was lauded in the press, and the reviews were pretty stellar on a universal scale, and then the game went on to sell millions of copies. That performance and the ultimate delivery of the game have led many to believe that it’s a turning point for the series.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been a single month since Assassin’s Creed Shadows hit the market, and it’s already winning awards… <strong><em>Kind of</em></strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-voice-of-the-players">Voice of the Players</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the winner of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/01/players-choice-vote-for-march-2025s-best-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation’s Players’ Choice for March</a>. It was voted the best game of the month based on the results of a poll on the PlayStation Blog, which is about as official as it gets. </p>



<p>Admittedly, the competition wasn’t all that strong in March, except the smash hit Hazelight game, Split Fiction.</p>



<p>I think that Assassin’s Creed Shadows <strong>will </strong>go on to win some prestigious awards this year, as what Ubisoft produced was one of the best games we’ve seen in the series for many years. That’s a sentiment that I echoed in my in-depth review of the game.</p>



<p>Last night, I was fortunate enough to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-lead-actress-shrine-destruction-hurt-heart/">catch up with Masumi</a> (Naoe) at the BAFTA Games Awards, learning more about her role in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and what she thought about the more controversial elements of the game.</p>



<p>It’s not the end of the road for AC Shadows, of course. There is DLC in the pipeline, and Ubisoft is hard at work producing patches to add more quality-of-life improvements, including a recent one that I was desperate for.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Assassin’s Creed Shadows, or have you already moved on and are looking to what comes next? Let me know in the comments or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-prison-safe-locations-in-warzone-verdansk.1159518/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-prison-safe-locations-in-warzone-verdansk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Completing the Return to Verdansk event requires players to open safes in every area of the map. With that in mind, here are all the safe locations in Prison. </p>



<p>The Return to Verdansk event started on April 3 and runs through April 15. Unlike other events in Black Ops 6 that could be completed in multiplayer or battle royale matches, this one can only be completed in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> on Verdansk.</p>



<p>Your loadout weapons will make completing this event easier, as they are much better than what you find from ground loot. So, check out which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loadouts are the best in Season 3</a>, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cr-56-amax-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a>, before starting this challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-warzone-verdansk-safe-location-in-prison">Every Warzone Verdansk Safe Location in Prison </h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-map-return-intel-drop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Return to Verdank event</a>, the objective is to open one safe in each of <span>Verd</span>ansk’s<strong>&nbsp;12 zones</strong>. In the Prison zone, there are nine safes. Despite the POI being nestled in the bottom right corner of the map, Prison is a hot drop, and it will be challenging to open a safe without facing some opposition.</p>



<p>The image below shows where all of the safes are. After opening one, you can move on to the next zone. However, even after opening one, there is still an incentive to open more because each safe has a chance of unlocking <span>Caine’s rare&nbsp;<strong>Trail Blazer operator skin</strong></span>. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Prison is a hotly contested area, so opening a safe won’t be easy. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-warzone-return-to-verdansk-rewards">Warzone Return to Verdansk Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Kali Sticks always wreak havoc in Warzone. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each Zone has a different reward in the Return to Verdansk event. To unlock the <strong>Kali Sticks</strong>, you must&nbsp;<strong>acquire all 12 zone rewards</strong>. </p>



<p>Superstore, Prison, Stadium, and Hospital will be the most challenging zones to open a safe in because those POIs always attract a lot of players when a match first starts. In addition, it will take at least a few matches to complete this event, as the closing circle limits how many zones you can reach in one match. </p>



<p>And even when other players have completed every zone, safes will always be hotly contested throughout the event because everyone wants the rare operator skin. </p>



<p>Here are all 12 zones and rewards. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Zone </th><th>Reward </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dam </td><td>“Let’s Plan Something!” <strong>Loading Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Miltary Base </td><td>“Jarvdinsk Spomenik” <strong>Emblem </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Quarry </td><td>“Lumberjack Legends” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Storage Town </td><td>“Deathly Chill Return” <strong>Weapon Decal </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Superstore </td><td>“With Fries, Please” <strong>Weapon Charm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Stadium </td><td>“Breaking News” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Train Station </td><td>“The Back Adjustment” <strong>Finishing Move </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hospital </td><td>“Love 4 Tha Game” <strong>Spray </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Downtown </td><td>“Cheering the Squad” <strong>Emote </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hills </td><td>Double XP Token (45 minutes)</td></tr><tr><td>Port </td><td>“Shipping to Verdansk”<strong> Sticker </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Prison </td><td>“Wheel of Glory” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>That’s everything you need to know about opening safes on Prison for the Return to Verdansk event. With that out of the way, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-april-7-patch-notes-buy-stations-receive-major-update-attachments-suddenly-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> fans have much to look forward to. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-3-rated-in-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD MW2 and MW3</a> were reportedly rated in Australia, hinting at potential remasters.

                <p>A report recently emerged claiming to have new details on Titanfall 3, but there is more to the story.</p><p>Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb said on GameBreaking News today that people might want to temper their expectations for a new Titanfall game. As we've known for some time, there is a "skunkworks" team inside Titanfall studio Respawn now working on a new project. And it is true that this team is tinkering with gameplay elements involving titans, Grubb said.</p><p>However, any such project that could theoretically emerge from this skunkworks unit would likely be years away, Grubb added. There is also a possibility that whatever is being made by this team doesn't make it to release. That would be normal part of the creative process, after all.</p><p>"Don't get your hopes up for Titanfall anytime soon," Grubb said.</p><p>The Titanfall 3 rumor said the game was "almost complete" and would have single-player and multiplayer elements. For now, Grubb said he's confident in saying there would definitely be no announcement of the Respawn skunkworks project in 2025, and no release is planned for 2026 either.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INbzQN3gXkA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/INbzQN3gXkA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In 2023, we learned that Respawn veteran Steve Fukuda was in charge of the skunkworks team working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-director-making-something-new-but-its-not-more-titanfall/1100-6513762/" data-ref-id="1100-6513762">"something new."</a> Just what this game actually is, however, has never come to light.</p><p>Titanfall fans have been waiting years for a potential sequel to Titanfall 2.

The game was a success and spawned a sequel, Titanfall 2 (2016), but that would prove to be the final entry in the main series before Respawn shifted focus to its battle royale game, Apex Legends. Since then, fans have called on Respawn to return to the Titanfall series with a bonafide new entry--but as of yet, nothing has materialized.

            <p>As we thunder forward through this sunny April (apologies for any undue excitement if your local area is currently sun-free), Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-april-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-the-second-episode-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-and-more/">revealed the latest titles joining its PlayStation Plus game catalogue</a> for Premium and Extra subscribers this month. And that includes stellar puzzler Blue Prince, if you're looking to have your noggin particularly meddled with.</p>
<p>Away from the Blue Prince (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-review">Eurogamer just slapped with five shimmering stars</a>, so it's well worth checking out), there's plenty more coming to PlayStation's Game Catalogue. From next Tuesday, 16th April, Premium and Extra members also gain access to the closing instalment of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> originator Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review">intriguing narrative mystery Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>, EA Sports PGA Tour, and culinary co-op game PlateUp.</p>
<p>As for those Premium-exclusive additions, April brings a tally of two. You've got some classic survival horror action in the seminal Alone in the Dark 2 (which first released on PlayStation back in 1993), and 2003's War of the Monsters, which includes full trophy support as players grow big and smack around other huge beasties, kaijū-style.
</p>
<p>You'll find the full list of this month's titles below:</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blue Prince (PS5)</li>
<li>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage – Tape 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 1 (PS4)</li>
<li>EA Sports PGA Tour (PS5)</li>
<li>PlateUp! (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alone in the Dark 2 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>War of the Monsters (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>Back in January, Sony announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-shifting-focus-to-ps5-games-next-year-will-only-occasionally-include-ps4-titles">shift the focus of its PlayStation Plus monthly games and Game Catalog updates toward PS5 titles</a> starting early next year - after which PlayStation 4 games will only "occasionally" feature. "Many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles," it said at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/zootopia-2-fan-comic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-15-best-things-we-saw-at-cinemacon-2025-2000585331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cinemacon</a>, essentially the <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E3</a> of the film world, for better and worse. Over four days, major studios like Disney and Lionsgate take over Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to unveil logos,&nbsp; trailers, and a cavalcade of surprise cast announcements for their ever-changing release schedules, all of which could have easily been an email. Amid the fanfare, Cinemacon’s sneak peek at Disney’s latest <a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-sequels-frozen-3-zootopia-2-toy-story-5-bob-iger-1850090994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavenly mandated sequel</a>, <em>Zootopia 2,</em> was a sleeper agent activation code for brain-broken internet dwellers like myself.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Zootopia</em>, otherwise known as SFW <a href="https://gizmodo.com/beastars-caps-off-netflixs-fall-anime-season-in-spectacular-fashion-2000535938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Beastars</em></a>, is a 2016 animated film in which a rookie cop rabbit named Judy Hopps teams up with a sly, street-smart fox named Nick Wilde to save their society from a political conspiracy. Aside from having a tiger supporting character who is hot to folks who swear they aren’t furries, the film was entertaining, with overtones about social injustice and prejudice that were broad enough to reinforce racism as a deplorable thing to kids. At its core is the buddy-cops-with-romantic-undertones dynamic between Judy and Nick, a relationship Disney seems eager to delve deeper into in <em>Zootopia 2</em>.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1907931511531384859?t=wiNrcP2PzJp0ijU1s0GJtw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grainy cell phone photo shared by Discussing Film from the showcase floor</a>, Judy and Nick are seen in therapy, officiated by a quokka named Dr. Fuzzby, played by Quinta Brunson. The first look left normies puzzled, wondering what had transpired during the nearly decade-long gap between the films to send its heroes to therapy. But to those of us with Tumblr-warped minds — trained to spot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_(Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Loss”</a> memes in the wild like a <em>Where’s Waldo?</em> and receive breaking news via<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/destiel-confession" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Destial confession memes</a> — this seemingly innocent scene unearthed a relic of internet lore we thought had been buried: the infamous <em>Zootopia </em>abortion fanfic comics. The replies and <a href="https://x.com/JordanInHell/status/1908136314865607160?t=9Bf8zlipppw-43kZPD4j-w&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quote retweets</a> to Discussing Film’s post are flooded with users sharing the first panel of the fanfic comic, citing it as the <em>real </em>reason behind the therapy session, leaving the uninitiated scratching their heads.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, no one needs to know about <em>Zootopia </em>fanfiction in the year of our lord 2025, but I’ve been blighted with this Tumblr knowledge for nine years and have to offload it onto you. So allow me to bridge the gap for those left in the dark.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Zootopia Comic &quot;I Will Survive&quot; Full!!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_GRqInUwJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><a href="https://www.zootopianewsnetwork.com/2017/06/i-will-survive-by-borba-full-comic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I Will Survive: A Zootopia Fan Comic</em> </a>by DeviantArt artist Borba emerged in 2017 and quickly spread across the internet to platforms like Tumblr, Twitter, and even <a href="https://www.avclub.com/somebody-s-out-here-writing-pro-life-zootopia-fan-comic-1821058810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The AV Club</a>. The comic begins with Judy taking a pregnancy test and discovering she and Nick are pregnant. After insisting on taking a long shower before Judy can “ruin the rest of his day,” Nick reacts with joy upon hearing the news. However, Judy reveals her intention to have an abortion.&nbsp;</p><p>What follows is a heated exchange, with Judy expressing concerns about the complexities of bringing an interbred pregnancy to term (a theme explored extensively in <em>Beastars, </em>which is really good and you should watch/read it). Meanwhile, Nick embodies every conservative argument, condemning her decision as a “premeditated sin” driven by career ambitions. Judy slaps Nick across the face, creating <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nick-shocks-judy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nick-shocks-judy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many memes</a> that live out of context from the comic, before Nick storms out of the apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>But their story doesn’t end there. Borba responded to a DeviantArt question about <em>I Will Survive</em>’s political alignment by claiming it was <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1320605-i-will-survive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“negative for both sides,”</a> then later made a sequel titled <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/born-to-be-alive-i-will-survive-sequel-by-borba-BSyU5qm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Born to Be Alive</em></a>. That story picks up months after Nick and Judy’s falling out, with Nick showing up at Judy’s apartment at 2.a.m, desperate to make up. Upon learning Judy went through with the abortion, Nick pleads for forgiveness for his “past errors and many flaws”—conveniently leaving out the fact that he’d been seeing someone else during their time apart.&nbsp;</p><p>After Judy verbally drags Nick’s ass across the coals for abandoning her in her time of need, Nick insists they should get back together. Suddenly, a fox lady named Shay walks out of Judy’s bedroom, wearing a robe and offering to help. Amid Nick’s panicked “Oh no! No! No"s, Judy explains that Shay was there for her when Nick wasn’t. Judy also reveals she’s been hiding her relationship with Shay because her parents had already disapproved of her and Nick living together without being married; Judy outing herself would’ve brought about more conflict with her parents’ conservative “carrotholic” beliefs. Judy and Nick fall out once more, and Judy falls into Shay's loving embrace. It's no Shakespeare, but the comics made for an entertaining read on Imgur.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Zootopia Abortion Comic - Tales From the Internet" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwGIutQpFiU?start=96&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Borba’s webcomic saga includes a third installment titled <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/never-say-goodbye-zootopia-comic-by-borba-mXfFluq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Never Say Goodbye</em></a>, where Judy becomes the mayor of Zootopia and the story takes a wild turn and spoofs the assassination of John F. Kennedy, but we don’t need to dive into all that.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no chance <em>Zootopia 2 </em>will make Judy and Nick’s therapy session as dramatic as Borba’s bizarrely well-drawn comic. Still, it feels like a subtle nod, intentional or not, to that peculiar moment when the internet collectively imagined the pair needing therapy. While anything’s possible, including the idea that someone at Disney stumbled across that corner of the internet and decided to drop a subliminal wink to those of us who’d catch it, I can confidently say this is a prime example of how the internet loves to spiral, turning a sneak peek at a glorified ad convention into an unofficial epilogue for a decade-old fan comic.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review"><h3>No Other Game Is Shaped Like Blue Prince</h3></a><p>Defying definition and wholly itself, Blue Prince is one of the most unique games I've ever played.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad"><h3>Games Writing Words I Hate</h3></a><p>Let's get pedantic, my favorite thing to be</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Michael Sarnoski, best known for directing A Quiet Place: Day One has signed up for the Death Stranding movie at A24 Productions.</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/death-stranding-movie-michael-sarnoski-a24-1236360094/">Deadline</a> report he will both write and direct the film which “will delve into the game’s mysteries surrounding the ‘Death Stranding’ — a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.”</p>


<p><em><strong>Spoilers for Death Stranding now follow!</strong></em></p>
<p>Reports suggest that this means the film will be set before the first game so it’s unlikely Norman Reedus would appear as he is the cause of the Death Stranding. Experiments were conducted to study The Beach, and baby BB. The child is accidentally killed and arrives at the Beach, the junction between the worlds of the living and the dead. His sister/mother/extinction entity pal, Amelie, returns BB – aka Sam – back to the world of the living, thus causing Death Stranding.</p>
<p>Although Norman wouldn’t be in the film it does open the doors for the likes of Lindsay Wagner and Mads Mikkelsen to appear in the movie.</p>

<p><em><strong>End of Spoilers!</strong></em></p>
<p>Back in the world of video games Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out June 26th 2025&nbsp; for PlayStation 5. No other versions have been revealed but as the original Death Stranding has also been released on PC and Xbox , as well is getting a “Directors Cut” with additional content, it will probably go multi-platform at some point in the future.</p>

			<p>Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-portal-remote-player-system-update-releases-today-with-cloud-game-streaming-beta-ux-enhancements/">announced</a> a new update for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">PlayStation Portal</a> handheld device, adding a few basic features to the Cloud Streaming beta that PlayStation Plus Premium members can access.</p>
<p>The Cloud Streaming beta was introduced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/">November 2024</a>. At the time, it was just a bare-bones introduction to using the Portal to stream available titles over the cloud instead of directly streaming them from your PS5 console.</p>
<p>Wednesday's update brings a few basic features to the cloud streaming experience, like sorting the available games in the cloud streaming catalog alphabetically, by release date, or how recently they were added to the PS Plus catalog.</p>
<p>You can also now take game captures while playing a game through cloud streaming on your PS Portal, which works the same way it does when taking a screenshot while playing anything on your PS5 or PS Portal.</p>
<p>This update also allows you to pause a cloud-streaming gameplay session, allowing you to put the PlayStation Portal in rest mode with the game paused, though you can't leave the Portal in rest mode for longer than 15 seconds. The cloud streaming session will disconnect once that timer runs out. Similarly, if you've just set your Portal down without pausing the session, after 10 minutes of inactivity, a warning message will appear in the top-right corner of your screen to tell you that the cloud-streaming session will be closed in 60 seconds.</p>
<p>The last two features the update adds are a queue screen you'll be sent to when the streaming server for a game is full. Your wait time will be displayed on the screen, and you'll launch into the game once it's your turn. Lastly, this update adds the ability for you to provide feedback to PlayStation and Sony about the cloud streaming beta through five simple emoticons that let you share your satisfaction with the service from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest.</p>
<p>It's still surprising that the PlayStation Portal didn't support cloud streaming from the jump, but at least we can be glad it's here now. However, the addition of some of these fundamental features still shows the glacial pace at which Sony is adopting cloud streaming despite making a handheld that seems purpose-built for it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/645782/trumps-new-tariffs-leave-small-creators-scrambling<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve ever been to an anime or any fan convention, you know that the place that’s often the busiest is artists alley. There, creators sell their wares ranging from commissioned artwork to stickers, enamel pins, stuffed toys, apparel, food, and more. Often these goods are made with the artist’s own hand. Other times, merchants are resellers, importing goods that are hard to find domestically, like gunpla kits, from markets where they’re more abundant. But with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645215/trump-us-tariffs-china-eu">the Trump tariffs in effect</a>, artists alleys might soon become ghost towns. </p><p><em>The Verge</em> spoke to several fandom and gaming-adjacent small businesses about what they’re doing to prepare for the tariffs which threaten to destroy businesses of all sizes throughout the US.</p><div><p id="stocking-up"><h2>Stocking up</h2></p></div><p>An artist who simply goes by Biggles has been doing art commissions for the last eight years.</p><p>“I love drawing Vtubers and I love the community so much that my husband and I ended up opening our own merch store, <a href="https://vt-horizons.com/">VTHorizons</a>,” Biggles said in an interview on Discord. The store is stocked with merchandise of several Vtubers including Biggles herself who streams in the persona of a funny-looking cat on Twitch. “We do acrylics, glassware, metal bottles, stickers, slate rock coasters, and are planning on adding more items.”</p><p>Biggles sources most of the raw materials for her products from China and according to her, the business is thriving. “This is my dream,” she said. “Creating things is why I wake up every day. The tariffs felt like [they were] crashing something I worked so hard for.”</p><p>A lot of businesses, particularly in the gaming and art communities, source their products from China. In the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/643970/trade-war-consequences-crazy">trade war</a> initiated by President Trump, China now faces a whopping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645215/trump-us-tariffs-china-eu">104 percent tariff</a>. Businesses about to see their costs skyrocket.</p><p>“We’ve already had to shift money from investing in new equipment to stocking up ahead of time these past few months,” said Jasen, a maker of <a href="https://www.mimsysstitches.com/">embroidered goods</a> based in Wisconsin. “But if we were to keep our prices the same, eventually our profit margins would reduce to an unsustainable level since we barely count the labor cost of our time spent making the product, marketing it, and selling it at events as it is.”</p><div><p id="uncertainty-reigns"><h2>Uncertainty reigns</h2></p></div><p>Even though the Trump administration has instituted sweeping tariffs on nearly every other country in the world, none of the businesses I spoke to know what that translates to in actual costs. That uncertainty compounds their anxiety as they have no idea if they’ll be able to reasonably eat costs or if they’ll have to raise prices and by how much. </p><p>Most businesses don’t want to raise prices at all. Their products are already aggressively priced in line with their competitors, and others simply don’t want to place any more burden on their customers who themselves will feel the pain of rising costs in every other aspect of their lives.</p><p>“If prices were to go up across the whole economy no one would have the extra money to spend on our business,” Jasen, the embroiderer, said.</p><div><p id="making-it-in-america"><h2>Making it in America</h2></p></div><p>Businesses I spoke to said that they were either stocking up on supplies as they work out longer term plans, or are working to find suppliers from countries not getting double-whacked by tariffs like China. Part of President Trump’s stated goal for these tariffs is to encourage businesses to buy and produce American, and some of the businesses I spoke to would love nothing more. But more often than not, that avenue is simply unfeasible, if not outright impossible.</p><p>“I’ve always tried to have my products manufactured in the US,” said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vreni.bsky.social">Vreni Stollberger</a>, an illustrator and comics artist who runs a merchandise store for her work. “But there’s a lot of items that you can only get from China. Washi tape, key chains, plush toys, custom apparel, they’re almost impossible to find here and when you do find them, they’re far too expensive to be a viable option.”</p><p>Dustin Holden, whose company <a href="https://makemhz.com/">MakeMHz</a> modifies and updates older video game consoles, is in a similar situation.</p><p>“Even if we redesigned our products to accommodate alternative microcontrollers, power supplies, or analog components,” he said over DM chat. “No domestic equivalents are available.”</p><p>Those who can circumvent the tariffs by bringing production in house are doing so at steep cost and on accelerated timelines. Biggles said it’s costing her tens of thousands of dollars to bring in equipment that’ll let her make her acrylic products at home, a cost she’s not sure she can bear. </p><p>For Tim Zheng, CEO of <a href="https://viteramen.com/">Vite Ramen</a>, an instant noodle company, it doesn’t matter that his business does everything the Trump administration claims it’s trying to achieve, the tariffs still threaten to put him out of business. </p><p>“We make things here,” he wrote in an impassioned email to his customers. “We provide good jobs. We source as much as possible from American suppliers. And yet, we’re still staring down stacks and stacks of price increases across the board.”</p><div><p id="cuts-to-the-heart"><h2>Cuts to the heart</h2></p></div><p>For these business owners, figuring out how they will survive the tariffs is not just a financial imperative. It is emotionally taxing. </p><p>“We have to figure out more ways to get creative while still being creative,” the artist Biggles said. “Right now I’m steaming three days a week for three hours, then all the other days of the week I’m working on merch art, working on private commissions, and now planning shows.”</p><p>For all the business owners I spoke to, the tariffs are more than just a financial and logistical blow, but an existential one as well. The plans they’ve made to expand their businesses are now put on hold, and peoples’ livelihoods have been imperiled for arbitrary reasons beyond their control.</p><p>“I’m scared,” Biggles said. “I’m scared for the [tariffs’] impact and how this will uproot lives.” But there is hope, not in the government reversing its decision but in the communities these businesses have cultivated. </p><p>“I keep at it because as corny as it sounds, nothing in the world is better than drawing a picture that makes someone go ‘hell yeah,’” Stollberger said. “That’s really all I want to do in my life and these goddamn swaggerless [jerks] keep getting in my way!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/neil-newbon-nobody-is-playing-ai-game/</link>

<p>Earlier this year, Neil Newbon revealed the Pixel Pack, a stunning representation of some of the finest talent in gaming. The goal of the Pixel Pack is to better represent actors in games, oppose the arduous rise of AI voice replication, and provide a stalwart figure of inspiration to a community that’s facing many difficulties.</p>



<p>At the BAFTA Games Awards in London, I chatted with Neil Newbon about the Pixel Pack and what’s next for the group, learning more about the impact AI is having on skilled actors and developers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<iframe title="Nobody Wants to Play a Game Made by AI - Neil Newbon at the BAFTA Games Awards" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1x6Ffm_k38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>

<h2 id="h-the-problem-is-awareness">‘The Problem is Awareness’</h2>



<p>Neil Newbon couldn’t tell me too much about what the Pixel Pack had in the pipeline, but I picked up a nice mission statement for the group:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re deciding how we can use and galvanise the goodwill that we’ve got at the moment and also how to better represent and try to champion actors. A big part of it is really just about the conversation to not use AI to supplement performers, but also on the fact that game actors are <strong>actors</strong>, we’re not just voice actors, and we’re doing as good work as films and television, theatre… </p>



<p>Actually, just to make people aware that some of these incredible, talented people should continue to work. </p>



<p>There’s a lot of talk about AI performers, it’s honestly boring as hell, nobody really wants to use them. I have spoken to many people in the industry, developers as well.</p>



<p>The problem is awareness of this, it’s making people aware that these actors are doing such incredible, sometimes very challenging experiences, in a good way… But they deserve to be honoured.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the chief goals of the Pixel Pack is to show that ‘anybody from any background can enter into games,’ and to accomplish that, the group is made up of a wide variety of professionals, from motion capture artists to voice actors, and from creature performers to performance capture experts.</p>







<p>Neil continued, and our discussion turned more earnestly towards the use of AI for replication and replacement: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think the point is making awareness of it and saying it’s absolutely not cool, that is a big part of the fight, because ultimately, it comes down to the consumer of the games, the player of the games. Are they going to be as satifsifed with really substandard performances, because I personally think that narrative is the same as gameplay now. </p>



<p>Back in the day, the gameplay was the thing, narrative was sort of shoved in there a little bit, not always but a lot of the time. Now, I think that people have the appetite for great narrative as well as great gameplay, but I think that’s a big part of defending against misuse of AI, because people just don’t want it, ultimately. </p>



<p>Some of the people I’ve spoken to, <strong>nobody is interested in playing a game that’s made by AI</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lack of the human element is always key in these debates. There are certain things that AI can’t replicate, such as the natural imperfection of humanity, which Neil said can often lead to ‘happy accidents’ in a creative environment. In his words, ‘You can’t reproduce that, you can’t create that through software – you just <strong>can’t</strong>.’</p>



<p>The Pixel Pack will undoubtedly be making its collective voice heard very soon as these topics continue to thrive in the wider gaming industry.</p>

                <p>Following US president Donald Trump's announcement of massive tariffs on major manufacturing hubs like China, Taiwan, and Vietnam--and dozens of other countries--Razer has removed its new Blade gaming laptops for sale in the US. While they were available to preorder, the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16#notify-me" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">landing page</a> for these laptops only shows a "notify me" option.</p><p>Amazon and Best Buy have also pulled their pages for the new laptops, but if you really need one, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?id=pcat17071&amp;st=razer+blade#&amp;intl=nosplash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy is offering refurbished Razer Blade laptops for now</a>. It's not clear if these will be the only products that Razer no longer sells in the US for now or if they'll return.

It's not the only tech giant dealing with the fallout from the Trump administration's "Liberation Day" announcement, as companies like Framework and Micron have also paused sales of some of its devices in the US for now.</p><p>Nintendo has also seemingly been hit hard by the tariffs, as preorders for the company's $450 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2 console</a> were meant to begin on April 9, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">but have since been delayed</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canadians-cant-buy-the-switch-2-this-week-either/1100-6530689/">Nintendo Canada also delayed its Switch preorder window</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/">analysts are predicting a price increase for the Switch 2</a> in the US.</p><p>Another research company is predicting that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-sell-fewer-systems-than-previously-thought-analyst-says/1100-6530681/" data-ref-id="1100-6530681">Switch 2 will sell fewer systems than previously thought</a> due to the tariffs, while the Entertainment Software Association says that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-says-tariffs-will-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-entire-gaming-industry-not-just-nintendo/1100-6530636/" data-ref-id="1100-6530636">there will be a "detrimental impact" on the gaming industry</a> because of them.

			<p>Titanfall 3, the yet-to-be-announced new entry in the series by Respawn, will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and will feature a wealth of play modes besides an Extraction mode that is said to be the game's main mode.</p>
<p>Earlier today, known Apex Legends leaker Osvaldatore revealed some additional details on the yet-to-be-announced game, revealing it will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and will feature, together with the aforementioned main Extraction mode, a single-player campaign and other play modes, including Team Deathmatch, Control, Arenas and all Titanfall 2 classic modes. Additionally, the game will see the return of characters from Apex Legends and feature a weather system and a live service approach to multiplayer with Battle Passes, which isn't surprising at all for a modern multiplayer game. As for when the game is releasing, the leaker did not say, but as development is almost complete, its release shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>

<p>Titanfall 3 has been<a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-is-in-development-according-to-known-apex-legends-dataminer-rumor/"> rumored</a> to be in development multiple times since the release of the second entry in the series, but the game never actually materialized, making fans believe that the franchise was over and done. Hopes were reignited again<a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-isnt-dead-and-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2025-rumor/"> last week</a> when both Osvaldatore and Yorotsuki, another known Apex Legends leaker, revealed that the game is real and coming. According to the latter, the game will be revealed later this year during The Game Awards 2025 show, but hopefully, it won't take so long to learn if the series is indeed still alive and kicking.</p>

<p>According to a LinkedIn profile, it seems Warner Bros Games has been working on an unannounced IP slated to launch in 2025.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1909871298517360983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hot-on-the-heels-of-its-open-world-wonder-woman-game-cancelation-warner-bros-games-is-apparently-working-on-a-new-unannounced-ip-thats-set-to-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Brandon Maraia’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonmaraia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn profile</a> shows him as the Game Design Lead at Warner Bros Games since 2023. Under the ‘Experience’ section of his profile, Maraia states that he has been working as the Manager of Game Design “for a new unannounced IP game” for Warner Bros Games that is “launching in 2025.”</p>



<p>It is hard to tell which unannounced IP Warner Bros Games might be working on, especially after they recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-warner-bros-games-cancels-wonder-woman-shuts-down-multiple-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed multiple studios</a>. In February this year, it was revealed that Monolith Studios, the developers behind the cancelled Shadow of Mordor series and the cancelled Wonder Woman game, were being shut down. Along with Monolith, Player First Games, the developer of the now discontinued title Multiversus, and WB Sand Diego were shut down.</p>



<p>Warner Bros Games recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-canceled-by-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled a highly anticipated DLC</a> for one of their established franchises. It was revealed last month that Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition and DLC were cancelled as part of the “ongoing restructure at the entertainment company’s video game unit.” Also, there were concerns about whether the “amount of content was substantial enough to justify the price.”</p>



<p>Which unannounced IP do you think Warner Bros Games might be working on to release in 2025? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

It has a long list of games in development, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026-microsoft-reveals-brand-new-pre-alpha-gameplay">the new Fable, which was recently delayed to 2026</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, inXile’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/contraband">Contraband</a>, from the developer of the Just Cause series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-issues-update-on-rares-long-in-development-everwild">Rare's Everwild, which Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer recently checked out</a>, The Coalition's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">Hideo Kojima’s OD</a>, and Undead Labs' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a>.

The direct “will bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment, revealing new gameplay, details, and developer insights, straight from the people making the sequel to the award-winning, first-person sci-fi RPG.” The Outer Worlds 2 is expected out later in 2025, so it seems likely we'll get a release date during the showcase.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Airtime for the Xbox Games Showcase followed by The Outer Worlds 2 Direct in local time zones:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>PDT: June 8, 10am     </li><li>EDT: June 8, 1pm     </li><li>BST: June 8, 6pm  </li><li>CET: June 8, 7pm   </li><li>JST: June 9, 2am </li><li>AEST: June 9, 3am </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft said the Xbox Games Showcase and The Outer Worlds 2 Direct will be digital-only, which means there’s no theatre experience for fans and media this year. But it promised that its livestream will bring fans “everything you’ll need to know about what’s next for Xbox, no matter where in the world you’re watching.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
