            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox head Phil Spencer has officially confirmed that an Xbox handheld is in the works, although that announcement does, as you would expect, carry several pretty heavy caveats.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said that the "expectation" is that Xbox would create some kind of hardware in the handheld category. Bloomberg says that Xbox is "working on prototypes", but that the final release of any kind of Xbox handheld device is "a few years out".</p>

<p>An Xbox handheld (that is to say one created officially by Xbox, rather than one simply <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/logitech-and-tencent-cloud-gaming-handheld-images-possibly-leaked" rel="nofollow">designed to play</a> Xbox cloud games) has long been rumored, but this is the first official confirmation we've had from anyone on Xbox's side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asus-rog-ally-xbox-handheld.jpg?itok=qhbTOxyk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asus-rog-ally-xbox-handheld.jpg?itok=gnSjnz5M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are handheld devices that play Xbox games on the market, but we now know that an official Xbox handheld is in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than focusing on the handheld, Xbox engineers will instead work to improve the Xbox app on existing devices. Spencer told Bloomberg there was room for improvement with regards to the Xbox app, and that any potential handheld needs to be "informed by learning and what's happening now".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Spencer reveals a couple of other interesting tidbits regarding Xbox's strategy. He reiterates that there are no "red lines" dictating which games could or couldn't come to non-Xbox platforms, but says that it's too early to talk about whether&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>could go multiplatform.</p>

<p>Spencer also confirms that Microsoft and Xbox are still looking at more acquisitions, which puts recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">sweeping layoffs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">studio closures</a> at Microsoft into somewhat stark relief if you ask me.</p>

<p>Then again, Xbox arguably has a history of saying seemingly contradictory things after making big decisions. Remember when Matt Booty said Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush" rel="nofollow">needed "smaller games"</a> right after closing two studios that would have been ideally situated to make them? Me too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-xbox-arkane-closure.jpg?itok=p9SgA1Jz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-xbox-arkane-closure.jpg?itok=34aX7k45 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even after closing two studios earlier this year, Microsoft still says it's considering more acquisitions.</figcaption></figure><p>Spencer also confirms in the Bloomberg interview that the planned Xbox mobile store, which was originally announced in May with a July release window, has been delayed.</p>

<p>He says that an approach in which Microsoft simply hopes that "if we build it, they will come" won't work, and so the challenge is trying to figure out how to get consumers to find the Xbox store amongst stiff competition.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this is distinct from Xbox allowing you to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-android-app-games" rel="nofollow">buy and play games via its own app</a>, a feature that Xbox president Sarah Bond announced would be implemented following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store" rel="nofollow">a ruling in an Epic-Google lawsuit</a> that also proved favorable to Microsoft.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/its-time-for-sonys-annual-weird-playstation-advert/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Christmas just wouldn’t be Christmas if it didn’t start in November and include a weird advert from PlayStation that shows no games or consoles, so deck those halls and jingle those bells because the ad has arrived.</p>
<p>This year we see lots of young people jumping about, sliding down ramps, and generally engaging in physical activity, the complete opposite of sitting in front of a games console and killing aliens. It’s ‘aspirational’ I guess, maybe you could infer that anything is a game and PlayStation is here to make that true, but as your PS5 is securely tethered to you sofa I think that’s a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Play Has No Limits | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KiNPo7KvWCM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It does makes you miss the good old days when Sony used to mash up characters from thirty games in a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPctTR3y5Qc"> one advert .</a> I’ve just looked and that happened thirteen years ago so now I feel very old and so should you.</p>


<p>These videos are usually packed with Easter Eggs but there just a couple in this new advert. The bus stop at 28 seconds in has 1994-2024 on it, 1994 being the launch year of the PS1. The one that is getting everyone excited is 46 seconds in when a departure board is shown with and at the top is a date and time, 03 12 20:24, so December 3rd this year which is exactly 20 years on from the PS1 launch.</p>

<p>Sony are rumoured to have State of Play in December so some are guessing is that will be the date, it is a week before The Game Awards so Sony could get some big reveals out before the news is swamped with other announcements.</p>
<p>That appears to be it, there are no signs for games in the background, the graffiti does not reference anything, the shops are generic, not even a hint of Crash Bandicoot, all the things Sony usually does in these adverts are missing this year.</p>
<p>Probably the most boring PlayStation advert in history, I bet it cost a fortune to make.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-outlanders-is-an-open-world-mobile-rpg-from-tencent-and-capcom.1034622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom and Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio Group have announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, an open-world action RPG set to be released for mobile devices.</p>

<p>The two studios describe&nbsp;<em>Outlanders&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world survival game set in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>universe", and you'll be able to do all of the things you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game, including discovering ecosystems, crafting gear, and hunting alongside your friends.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>yet, but TiMi and Capcom say they will be conducting "several play tests in advance", although those don't have dates yet either, unfortunately. The goal with the game is to create a mobile experience you can enjoy "with friends, anytime and anywhere".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-outlanders-gliding.jpg?itok=CKAskoKS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-outlanders-gliding.jpg?itok=Q6GMqsIK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>is an open-world mobile survival RPG from TiMi and Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>The screenshots TiMi and Capcom have released so far show a game that looks...well, a lot like a traditional&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game. Expect open-ended areas to explore, monsters to take down, and lots of elaborate, ostentatious armor and weapons to build from monsters' remains.</p>

<p>The two studios are promising "natural environments [and] ecosystems" to discover, so like classic&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, you'll probably be able to observe monsters as they go about their daily lives before you start your hunt.</p>

<p>If you're interested in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, you can sign up for email announcements via the <a href="https://monsterhunteroutlanders.com/en/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newly-created official website</a>, which also displays some rather evocative concept art.</p>




<p>The reveal of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>comes as Capcom gets ready to release&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the next mainline entry in the franchise, which is scheduled to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive across PC and consoles in February</a>.</p>

<p>It's shaping up to be a pretty big success already; an open beta was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">held earlier this month</a>, and the beta alone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke the series' Steam player count record</a> despite not being a full game.</p>

<p>We don't yet have an official release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, so watch this space for more info as and when we get it.</p>

As Steam was on the rise and digital distribution was clearly to become the future of gaming, a Polish company that had just released its first game—a relatively obscure RPG called <em>The Witcher</em>—wanted to get in on the act. The goal was updating and preserving classic gaming, and selling it without any form of DRM. Over the years, GOG seemed to drift away from this origin, and shift its focus to trying to compete as a distribution platform for AAA gaming, going head-to-head with Valve’s behemoth. But today marks a big change.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196599" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="196599,195891,196131" data-current="196599"><div><p>Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22154.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Starting today, GOG is launching what it’s calling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GOG Preservation Program</a></span>. It’s a self-aware determination to return to the company’s roots, with a long-term commitment to preserve and maintain classic games for the foreseeable future. There are 100 games currently listed, with a pledge to use the company’s “own resources to maintain games’ compatibility with modern and future systems.” At a time when game preservation is becoming increasingly vital, and on far more people’s minds, this seems like a pretty positive step.</p><h2 id="h55952"><a id=""></a><strong>How It Started</strong></h2><p>16 years ago, the world of PC gaming was very different. In 2008, the number one issue anyone would name when it came to digital games was DRM—digital rights management. These anti-piracy measures were grossly ineffective, doing almost nothing to prevent piracy, but instead causing legitimate customers to have far worse versions of a game—versions that required online checks to launch, refused to be installed on multiple devices, or just flat-out didn’t work properly. GOG arrived right at the peak of players’ fury, and offered a service that sold games that promised there would be <em>none</em> of this. Versions that just downloaded the files to your hard drive, that you could copy and share if you felt compelled to, but would never fail to launch because of an abandoned server, or because you bought a new PC.</p><p>At the same time, GOG was releasing games that had been unavailable and unplayable on PC for years. Classic titles that dominated the ‘80s and early ‘90s, that were designed to run on MS-DOS and didn’t know what to do with Windows, were suddenly available again, and were sold DRM-free with scans of the original manuals, and updates that meant they’d run straight from the .exe without issue.</p><p>The site became known for restoring lost games, a way to play <em>Wing Commander</em> and <em>Ultima II</em>, <em>King’s Quest</em> and <em>Rise of the Triad</em>. An early deal with Ubisoft to release DRM-free versions of its classic games (an ironic situation, given Ubisoft was at the forefront of crippling DRM in newer games) helped the project gain traction, and by 2014 it had deals with companies like LucasArts to make everything from <em>Star Wars: TIE Fighter</em> to <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em> available.</p><h2 id="h55953"><a id=""></a><strong>How It’s Going</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="16e998ba573b4584e5b817e5fa1fe922" data-recommend-id="image://16e998ba573b4584e5b817e5fa1fe922" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1012" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max sat at the wheel of his car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max sat at the wheel of his car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

For whatever reasons, for whatever ambitions, in my view GOG changed its sights, wanted to be selling the big-name AAA titles, and took its eyes off that original purpose.</p><p>In 2019, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/facing-financial-pressures-gog-quietly-lays-off-at-lea-1832879826?_gl=1*4o9j2y*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMC4xNzMxNDM1MDI1LjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/facing-financial-pressures-gog-quietly-lays-off-at-lea-1832879826?_gl=1*4o9j2y*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMC4xNzMxNDM1MDI1LjU3LjAuMA..">according to a <em>Kotaku</em> story by Jason Schreier</a></span>, the company was in real trouble. Deep into its push to be a AAA store that competed with Steam, there were lay-offs, at the same time as the company abandoned its so-called Fair Price Package, through which GOG would repay customers who were charged higher fees due to regional price differences. One former employee said at the time that he was told, “we’re dangerously close to being in the red.”</p><p>As someone who, throughout the first half of the 2010s, regularly used GOG to find classic games and would frequently check the site to see what new titles had been rescued from the past, I drifted away, too. That the games were DRM-free still felt like a big deal, but the convenience of Steam, the improvements in DRM tech, and the shifting nature of all digital ownership made GOG feel so much less essential. I’d once seen it as the site that let me play classic point-and-click adventures, but now when I looked at it, I just saw the same big-name games that are splashed across every other store.</p><p>“The market is different today,” GOG’s senior business development manager, Marcin Paczyński, told me by email, when I asked what was driving the decision to refocus. “Most platforms continue to leave these classics behind, or don’t give them the care they deserve, so the games we set out to protect are disappearing again.”</p><h2 id="h55954"><a id=""></a><strong>Where It’s Going Next</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-recommend-id="image://3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="781" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Jagged Alliance screenshot with an apposite quote about wanting back-up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Jagged Alliance screenshot with an apposite quote about wanting back-up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Madlab Software / GOG</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-recommend-id="image://3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="781" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Jagged Alliance screenshot with an apposite quote about wanting back-up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The new moves by the site are giving me great hope. If DRM was the main issue in 2008, games preservation feels like the most vital topic of 2024. As we watch major publishers just wiping older (and even newer) games from existence, while abandoned servers and forgotten consoles make ever-more games we own unplayable, people are getting really riled up. It seems like a very smart move for GOG to step into this space and loudly declare its intentions.</p><p>The GOG Preservation Program promises to begin with 100 games, and keep adding to the list, pledging long-term support of all of them. Those currently included have, GOG say, been tested “on the most popular PC configurations,” and “work flawlessly,” but the company encourages its community, which is rather sweetly referred to as “restless,” to keep pestering if updates break things.</p><p>The 100 games are an eclectic bunch, with games like <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon Deluxe</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, <em>Blade Runner</em>, and <em>Alpha Protocol </em>in the mix. They reach as far back as the ‘80s, and as recent as <em>Mad Max</em>. The criteria for inclusion is that a game needs maintenance, and that GOG can commit to maintaining it themselves. The company aims to have “hundreds of games” stamped with the commitment by the end of 2025.</p><p>“It’s a renewed commitment to our mission,” says Paczyński, “offering improved, well-supported editions of the classics that defined gaming, while continuing to deliver DRM-free new releases.”</p><p>Paczyński reiterates the importance of no DRM to GOG, explaining that not having it is vital to preservation. “When you buy a DRM-free game on GOG, you can download and safeguard its offline installer any way you want. DRM-free keeps you out of the reach of platforms’ rules and policies and untethered to some central server suddenly switching off. We still strive to get as many DRM-free titles as possible on GOG, regardless of when they were first released.”</p><p>I ask how far ahead the plan goes. What if GOG is zapped by aliens and disappears—what happens to the games it’s preserving without them? “We’re dedicating significant resources and long-term planning to ensure that each game in the program receives continuous updates and care—we know it’s a commitment.” He repeats that the DRM-free nature of the games means the installers survive the site. “Whatever happens to us, ever, your games are always safe.”</p><p>“It will stick,” Paczyński adds. “Today, we made several bold commitments, so we are truly serious about this. GOG’s reputation is on the line here—we’re all-in on this!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But according to Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer, there are no “red lines” in its first-party lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has so-far used older games released over a year ago for its multiplatform push as opposed to brand new games, but that will soon change with the release of Indiana Jones. Microsoft will launch MachineGames' hotly anticipated Xbox game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-finally-gets-a-release-date-for-xbox-and-playstation-gamescom-2024"><u>on PS5</u></a> just a few months after it launches on Xbox and PC this December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to a rival console, following the release of Obsidian’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pentiment"><u>Pentiment</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded"><u>Grounded</u></a>, Tango Gameworks’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hi-fi-rush"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>, and Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> earlier in 2024. In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>Microsoft announced Id Software's upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages will also launch on PS5</u></a> next year.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/13/gettyimages-2183768916-1731502030266.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer. Photo by Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure now on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We run a business,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said in August</a>. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s pretty clear at this point that Xbox console exclusives are no longer a priority for Microsoft’s gaming business, but are there some Xbox games that are considered so sacred that they will never launch on PlayStation?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said every Xbox game is up for grabs when it comes to making the multiplatform jump. “I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’” he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo on PlayStation would perhaps be the biggest Xbox game to go multiplatform so far, given its association with the console over the years. Last month, tech experts said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>Halo’s move to Unreal Engine 5</u></a> would make it easier for developer Halo Studios, née 343 Industries, to take Xbox’s flagship first-person shooter multi-platform, including a launch on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s too early to make any sort of decision on the next version of Halo, Bloomberg quoted Spencer as saying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As former Xbox boss Peter Moore recently told IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>Microsoft will be debating whether to bring Halo to PlayStation as we speak</u></a>. Perhaps a multiplatform release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> or even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo: Infinite</a> would be more likely in the short term, with Microsoft yet to indicate when the next Halo game will come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Victor J.

The high graphics preset is what GSC calls recommended, and provides 60fps gameplay at 1440p.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For that high graphics preset, you’ll need a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti / RTX 4070 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT GPU and 32GB of RAM.

If a player opens one containing a Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Charizard ex</a>, and Blane, for example, there's a chance a friend of that player, or even a complete random, will see this pack in their Wonder Pick section.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They can then choose to open this pack and be presented with the Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, Charizard ex, and Blane, but each card is flipped around and players pick just one at random.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kOx_xHGujN4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PokéNinaa</a> shared a clip of her opening a pack while a friend checked their Wonder Pick from her. The moment PokéNinaa selected Open a Pack, and was presented with the carousel of boosters presenting a choice, her Wonder Pick appeared on her friend's account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wonder Pick contained a pack PokéNinaa hadn't open previously, and contained Pyukumuku, Blitzle, Slowpoke, Kabutops, and Melmetal. She then picked a booster pack from her myriad options and was presented with Pyukumuku, Blitzle, Slowpoke, Kabutops, and Melmetal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oher players have shared the same findings with Wonder Picks, leading to a general belief among the Pokémon TCG Pocket community that pack choices don't actually matter. It certainly appears to be the case, especially with The Pokémon Company refusing to say anything to the contrary, but there's a chance this could be an unintended bug or similarly unintended mechanic that will disappear once the game grows older than a couple of weeks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October on iOS and Android as a digital version of the beloved trading card game.

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has commented on bringing more Xbox games to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, saying he's not ruling anything out, and that includes the next Halo release.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said, "I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say, 'Thou must not,'" he said. For the next Halo game specifically, Bloomberg reported that Spencer said it was too early to make a decision about that.</p><p>In September, Microsoft announced that it was working on multiple new Halo games that are being made in Unreal Engine 5. None of the games have been officially announced, however. That being said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">elements from the Project Foundry demo are likely to show up in future Halo titles</a>, Microsoft has said.</p><p>Halo games being made on Unreal Engine 5 could help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">make it easier for the franchise to come to PS5</a>, tech experts claim. Halo on PS5 wouldn't be a total surprise, as it was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">Microsoft was considering bringing the sci-fi series to Sony's home console</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>So far, Microsoft has released a few of its games on rival platforms, including Sea of Thieves and Grounded. One of the next big ones is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which launches in December on Xbox and PC before coming to PS5 in early 2025.</p><p>Also in the Bloomberg interview, Spencer said he expects Microsoft will eventually release a handheld gaming device; the company is now making prototypes, the report said. "I love us building devices," Spencer said. "And I think our team could do some real innovative work, but we want to be informed by learning and what's happening now."</p><p>Microsoft has been openly discussing plans for a handheld gaming device for a long time already, and the latest rumor was that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">next Xbox home console could also link up with a new Xbox handheld device.</a></p><p>Spencer also discussed the possibility of more acquisitions, following Microsoft's blockbuster deal to buy Activision Blizzard. He said it might be worth pursuing deals that add "geographic diversity" to the company, including in Asia. There are no "imminent" deals coming, however.</p><p>Microsoft already owned a prominent Japanese game developer, Tango Gameworks, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shut the studio down</a>--it later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">re-emerged under the ownership of PUBG company Krafton.</a></p><p>In the past year, Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">overseen more than 2,500 layoffs at Xbox</a>, and he said in the Bloomberg interview that "the Xbox business has never been more healthy." Spencer had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-executive-defends-layoffs-says-they-were-necessary-to-run-a-business/1100-6527510/" data-ref-id="1100-6527510">always said the layoffs were necessary because capitalism demanded it. </a></p><p>He ended his chat with Bloomberg by seemingly reacting to Sony's recent launch of the $700 PS5 Pro (which costs more than $1,000 in some regions like Australia), saying expensive consoles are not going to help grow the video game industry.</p><p>"I feel pretty good about where this industry is going," he said. "To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We're not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gylt-and-rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency.1034556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gylt&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale&nbsp;</em>developer Tequila Works has filed for insolvency, with newly-appointed general manager&nbsp;Térence Mosca citing "prolonged market conditions" as the reason for the studio's predicament.</p>

<p>According to a GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Mosca says he's proud of what his team "has accomplished together", but that the aforementioned market conditions gave his studio no choice other than filing for insolvency.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Tequila Works <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">canceled an unannounced project</a> and laid off an unspecified number of staff back in October, calling the current moment in the gaming industry an "incredibly difficult time". Evidently, those layoffs and that cancellation weren't enough to save the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=9k1Rc0Q0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=LjOf2zZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tequila Works is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that insolvency isn't necessarily the same thing as a studio shutdown; essentially, insolvency means an entity isn't able to pay the debts it's incurred, which means Tequila is functionally out of money but not necessarily defunct yet.</p>

<p>As such, the studio could undergo a reorganization under Mosca, although it looks like it might take a pretty mighty reorganization effort in order to save a studio that seems to have been struggling for quite some time.</p>

<p>In the statement provided by GI.biz, Mosca says that the studio is doing everything it can to "provide support and guidance to our teams", an assurance that was also made when the studio laid off staff and canceled its project last month.</p>

<p>The statement notably doesn't say that Tequila has canceled its remaining project or laid off the remainder of its staff, so it's possible we may see Tequila rising from the ashes at some point in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sexy-brutale-tequila-works-church.jpg?itok=LSlQWP4B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sexy-brutale-tequila-works-church.jpg?itok=cuhNEQBm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Previous games by Tequila Works include time-loop puzzler&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Tequila Works was founded in 2009 and released its first game, cinematic zombie platformer&nbsp;<em>Deadlight</em>, in 2012. That game was followed by titles like&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Gylt</em>, as well as last year's&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu</em>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what lies in Tequila Works' future, but don't be surprised if we don't hear from the studio for some time. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Stellar Blade developer Shift Up has revealed more details on the game's upcoming PC release, and it has high expectations for the platform. In the studio's Q3 2024 earnings report, Shift Up confirmed that Stellar Blade is "being considered within 2025" for a PC release--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-dev-is-considering-a-pc-port-and-sequel/1100-6523587/">something it has spoken about in the past</a>.</p><p>"Considering recent trends such as Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth: Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles," <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng" rel="nofollow ">Shift Up said in its report</a>. To put that into context, Black Myth: Wukong had a strong launch in August with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/">10 million copies sold in its first three days</a> on PC and PS5, and within two

figure that can potentially be reached with its upcoming expansion. In comparison, Stellar Blade reached 1 million sales on PS5 by the end of June.</p><p>Shift Up also mentioned that sales on PS5--where Stellar Blade is exclusively available for now--continue to remain stable, thanks in part to the studio constantly updating the game and releasing new DLC for it. "With the addition of the Nier: Automata DLC and ongoing marketing activities, we plan to maintain the IP's popularity until the platform expansion," Shift Up explained.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-is-getting-a-nier-automata-crossover-dlc/1100-6526688/">The Nier: Automata DLC for Stellar Blade</a> will be available starting November 20, and in addition to some stylish outfits inspired by the game's co-protagonist 2B, there'll be a new hairstyle for heroine Eve to equip, as well as a photo mode will be added to the game.</p><p>"A strong battle system and exciting moments make Stellar Blade more than just an imitator," Imran Khan wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stellar-blade-review-nier-as-it-can-get/1900-6418215/">Stellar Blade review</a>.</p>

                <p>Nearly three decades ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-red-review/1900-2684314/" data-ref-id="1900-2684314">Pokemon</a> debuted in Japan and spawned a best-selling video game franchise that continues to this day. The Pokemania phenomenon has since grown to include multiple anime series, films, trading-card games, toys, and more. Pokemon was also one of the 12 finalists to make it into this year's inductees for the Toy Hall of Fame. However, Pikachu and his pals are going to have to wait until at least 2025 after being denied this year.</p><p>The National Toy Hall of Fame has <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/press-release/2024-toy-hall-inductees-revealed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released its new inductions for 2024</a>, and Pokemon didn't make the cut. But at least Pokemon is in good company. The Choose Your Own Adventure books, remote-controlled vehicles, Hess Toy Trucks, trampoline, Apples to Apples, and Sequence were also denied the honor.</p><p>Hasbro was the big winner, as two of its 1980s franchises, Transformers and My Little Pony, earned their induction into this year's class at the Toy Hall of Fame. The Transformers toys debuted in 1984, and the franchise has largely endured for four decades. My Little Pony was originally launched as My Pretty Pony in 1981 before it became a hit toy line of its own. MLP went dormant for a few years before a 2003 revival proved to successful. The card game Phase 10 was the final 2024 inductee for the Toy Hall of Fame.</p><p>Pokemon may not have won this year, but its ongoing popularity is staggering. On the Nintendo Switch alone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sales-reach-99-million-units-on-switch-alone/1100-6527600/" data-ref-id="1100-6527600">the Pokemon franchise has sold 99 million units</a>.

Now, the latest gameplay video for Arc Raiders demonstrates why Embark Studios felt confident about making that move as it shows off an impressive--and dangerous--post-apocalyptic world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCooWm-PDs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OpCooWm-PDs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game takes place in a future where humanity has retreated beneath the surface of the Earth to escape the lethal Arc machines, which are programed to slaughter any humans they find. Players assume the role of one of the Raiders, who risk their lives by returning to the surface to find badly needed supplies while evading both the machines as well as rival Raiders who aren't looking to share any of the spoils.</p><p>Getting in and out of the locations isn't easy, even though having a team to watch your back helps increase the odds of survival. The smaller Arc machines are always on patrol, and the larger machines aren't as easy to dispatch as their counterparts. Enemy Raiders can also ambush a team before they reach their extraction point. But that's only going to draw the attention of the Arc machines, which will target both sides of the conflict. As far as the machines are concerned, the only good human is a dead one.</p><p>Although Arc Raiders isn't finished yet, this early gameplay is already looking good. Embark Studios will release the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025.</p>

Blizzard has announced a new partnership with the University of Washington in which the college will become the University of Warcraft for a week in the lead up to the Washington Huskies' home finale against UCLA.</p><p>UW Football is collaborating with WoW to promise a "one-of-a-kind in-stadium experience" on Friday, with World of Warcraft mascots leading the team onto the field, a fan zone offering character meet-and-greets, and unique visuals for the stadium video board. Blizzard has also revealed a unique logo for its University of Warcraft collaboration, and has promised more unique WoW-themed graphics leading up to the game.</p><p>Blizzard is also getting some of the Washington Huskies team on board for the takeover, signing NIL (name, image, likeness) deals with players Carson Bruener, Denzel Boston, Jonah Coleman, Camden Simon, Adam Mohammad, Kamren Fabiculanan, Jacob Lane, Cameron Broussard, D’Angalo Titialli, Demond Williams Jr., and Will Rodgers. The players will be posting about the collab on social media to promote the Warcraft takeover--though its not clear if they'll be making an appearance in the game itself.</p><p>"We are thrilled to unite interactive entertainment with the sports industry to celebrate 20 incredible years of World of Warcraft delighting millions of players worldwide," said Blizzard head of marketing Monica Austin, as quoted by <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/name-image-likeness/nil-news/world-of-warcraft-makes-nil-debut-with-washington-huskies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sports Illustrated</a>. "Our teams have been working together to create incredible in-person and broadcast experiences for fans, and we hope Husky Nation and World of Warcraft players alike are excited to WoW down to Washington."</p><p>The Warcraft-themed game is taking place this Friday November 15 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET at Husky Stadium in Seattle, and will be broadcast on Fox for anyone curious to see how this unexpected collaboration plays out.</p>

<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has confirmed that Xbox is planning an Xbox handheld console, but it’s a few years away from release.</p>



<p>The news comes from a new interview with <a href="http://eyjzb3vyy2uioijtdwjzy3jpymvyr2lmdgvkqxj0awnszsisimlhdci6mtczmtq5otu0mswizxhwijoxnzmymta0mzqxlcjhcnrpy2xlswqioijttvcxq01umecxs1cwmcisimjjb25uzwn0swqioijcmuvbqki5njq2qum0rezfqtjbrki4mji1mzgyqtjfqsj9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. Spencer said that the company is currently working on prototypes and considering what it [a handheld console] might do.</p>



<p>Spencer said the “expectation [internally] is that we would do something”&nbsp;in that category of the handheld console market.</p>



<p>However, if you’re currently saving up the pennies in hopes of buying such a console soon, Spencer promptly squashed any false expectations and said that such a device is still a few years out.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, rumors of Xbox’s next-generation console and a handheld device have been circulating for some time. In March 2024, <span>Windows Central’s Jez Corden&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed that Xbox was already prototyping an Xbox handheld.</a>&nbsp;Other rumors also circulated</span> that Xbox could be planning to release its next-generation console sooner than PlayStation. </p>



<p>On the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By7ne7lHKLY&amp;ab_channel=RandalThor19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Two podcast</a>, Corden said, “I know that they’ve [Xbox] have got handheld prototypes right now”. Corden soon clarified that these are “new prototypes” and not the old prototypes often referred to.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-next-gen-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox announced that its next-generation console</a> would be “unique” and “powerful.” But apart from usual buzzwords, its currently not clear on what exactly that entails.</p>



<p>What do you think of Xbox working on its own handheld console? Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>
Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has said there's nothing stopping any of the company's games coming to Nintendo or PlayStation platforms in the future.
</p>
<p>
"I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say 'thou must not,'" Spencer told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth">Bloomberg</a>, adding that it was still too early to discuss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">Microsoft's plans for the next Halo</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-halo-on-unreal-engine-5-means-for-ps5">now being built in the cross-platform-friendly Unreal Engine</a>.
</p>
<p>
Xbox launched Pentiment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Grounded and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> across a mixture of PlayStation and Nintendo Switch consoles earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">to some success</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-published-sea-of-thieves-reportedly-surpasses-1m-sales-on-playstation-5">more than 1m sales reported for Rare's popular piratical live-service game</a>. Microsoft will follow this with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">PlayStation launch for Xbox's biggest Christmas blockbuster, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, early next year. The expectation is that many other Xbox games will follow.

<p>
In a wide-ranging interview, Spencer also discussed his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">long-held desire to launch some kind of Xbox handheld</a>. Microsoft is currently working on prototypes and considering the market, Spencer said, though the launch of an official Xbox handheld is still a few years out. (So, no Xbox handheld before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.)
</p><p>
Spencer also said Xbox still "definitely want to be in the market" to acquire other companies, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">Microsoft's record-setting $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard</a>. That said, deals of similar size were currently unlikely due to the still-ongoing process of merging in Activision teams.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox chief said he was still looking for deals that added "geographic diversity", such as teams in Asia, despite it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">walking away from Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks</a> earlier this year. 
</p>
<p>
"The Xbox business has never been more healthy," Spencer concluded, when asked how he felt about 2025 after a year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">punctuated</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">repeated layoffs</a>. "The business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build."

			<p>Any title in the Xbox portfolio of games can be considered for a port on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, as Phil Spencer doesn't see a red line in this regard.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczMTQ5OTU0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzMyMTA0MzQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTVcxQ01UMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.UjaVdB-1hJKO1VKY0-vUQaOjf2cpmUgGaLSXNqqYnHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the head of Xbox commented on a variety of topics, including porting Xbox titles to other formats. Phil Spencer is pleased with the results of the first batch of games released on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch so far, and more will be coming in the future. In regard to which titles will make the jump in the future, the head of Xbox said that he sees no sort of red lines in their portfolio that say "thou must not," but it's definitely too early to make any sort of decision on the next entry in the Halo series. As such, it really sounds like nothing is off the table, although a day-and-date release on Xbox and other consoles at the same time doesn't sound very likely.</p>
<p>Phil Spencer also touched upon the handheld market, which has been thriving in the past few years. The head of Xbox said that the "expectation" is that the company is going to do something in this regard. At this stage, they are working on prototypes and considering the future, and Phil Spencer asked his team to look at the market and develop their device based on what is learned. This device, Spencer added, is a few years out, so we won't be seeing it anytime soon.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Xbox head Phil Spencer has talked about the rumored handheld, but it is the first time he commented on the matter in a more concrete way. As the device is still a few years away, however, there's no telling what it will be capable of doing and if it will be focused on local play, as Spencer himself hinted at <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/">earlier this year.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-player-count-how-many-people-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farming Simulator 25</a> allows players to create and develop their very own farms, with a plethora of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-animals-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animals</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/products-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">products</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-crops-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crops</a> to choose from. Raising animals and harvesting crops is a rewarding experience, and many love the realism and progression Farming Simulator offers.</p>



<p>You’ll need to put in the hours though, as farm work isn’t easy. Speaking of which, if you’re wondering how many are online dedicating their time to their virtual farm, here’s the Farming Simulator 25 player count.</p>



<h2 id="h-farming-simulator-25-player-count">Farming Simulator 25 player count</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 has <strong>44,265 live players on Steam</strong> at the time of writing (November 13, 2024), and an <strong>all-time peak player count of 126,761</strong> on Valve’s platform, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2300320/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. The all-time peak was reached on its release date of November 12, 2024, which saw players flocking to start their farming journey.</p>



<p>These numbers are only for players enjoying the game via Steam on PC, and as the game is available through other platforms on PC and also consoles, the player count is likely much higher than what’s found on SteamDB.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credits to Giants Software</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-player-count-for-farming-simulator-25-on-consoles">Is there a player count for Farming Simulator 25 on consoles?</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 is also <strong>available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles</strong>, but unfortunately, we <strong>do not have access to the player count numbers</strong> on these platforms. However, it’s safe to assume that the player count would be much higher if the player count was accumulated for all the platforms the game is available on.</p>



<p>The game also features cross-platform play and a multiplayer feature for up to 16 players on a dedicated server and up to 6 on console servers. The multiplayer feature is very popular for Farming Simulator and it’s likely one of the main reasons for its high player count, as people are hopping on to create a farm on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fast-travel-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive maps</a> with friends.</p>



<p>If the devs, Giants Software, ever decide to release details on the Farming Simulator 25 player count or sales numbers across all of the platforms the game is available on, we’ll be sure to update this piece with all the relevant information.</p>

<p>The official FNCreate account on <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1856366599059427510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has revealed that Fortnite’s First-Person Camera Mode device publishing will arrive on December 11, 2024. As the announcement hasn’t come from the main Fortnite account, the first-person mode will be reserved for Fortnite Creative and will not be included in the game’s standard battle royale mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s first-person mode has been rumoured to arrive for years, and players finally have an official date to look forward to. It will be interesting to see what kind of island creators come up with this new perspective, what kind of weapons will be compatible with this mode and other features. Hopefully, the implementation in creative mode will pave the way for the first-person to arrive in the standard battle royale mode, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-fortnite-map-returning-permanently-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original map of the game will be returning permanently</a> from December 6, so players can enjoy Season 1 Chapter 1 whenever they wish.

		<p>Embark Studios has released a gameplay reveal trailer for their upcoming survival extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders | Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OpCooWm-PDs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gameplay footage comes from an early tech test that was held in October, following a group of three Raiders as they head out from the human haven of Speranza City and look to explore the surface and the Buried City to find vital resources – each player can have different objectives and goals, it seems.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s other players out there, and if you come across another Raider you can chat using a quick wheel of dialogue options, potentially trying to share the spoils with someone outside of your party instead of having a gunfight.</p>
<p>Any time a Raider is knocked down, a flare goes up to mark their position, though you’ll never be sure if they were in a fight with the ARC robots or ended up in a scuffle with other players.</p>

<p>Set for release in 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, ARC Raiders will be venturing into an increasingly busy genre. The extraction shooter and PvPvE multiplayer has become a popular follow on and counterpart to the battle royale over the past half decade, with the most popular examples including Escape from Tarkov and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/hunt-showdown-1896-review/">Hunt: Showdown</a>, while there’s both big budget upcoming games like Bungie’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/bungie-announce-some-kind-of-marathon-remake/">Marathon</a> and scrappier upstarts like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/ascendant-preview-how-this-80s-adaption-shooter-is-evolving-beyond-extraction/">Ascendant</a>.</p>
<p>This game has had a fair bit of time in the oven. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/arc-raiders-trailer-game-awards/">ARC Raiders was announced back in 2021</a> at The Game Awards, initially with a 2022 release target, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/09/free-to-play-shooter-arc-raiders-will-miss-2022-launch/">which it then slipped from</a>. Helmed by ex-Battlefield lead Patrick Söderlund, the team explained that they need more time to expand their take on the co-op shooter, seemingly shifting away from pure PvE originally to bake in the PvPvE elements.</p>
<p>It eventually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/arc-raiders-re-emerges-with-a-2025-release-target/">reemerged back during Summer Games Fest</a> with a new 2025 target launch. Between now and then, it seems likely that more tech tests and betas will be held, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">sign up for these tests on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>TiMi Studio Group and Capcom have just announced Monster Hunter Outlanders for iOS and Android devices. It is an upcoming open-world survival game set in the Monster Hunter universe. The developers did not provide a release date in the new announcement trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Monster Hunter Outlanders announcement trailer footage, players can explore a massive open world featuring different types of biomes, such as jungles, swamps, deserts, and more. You will see some familiar monsters from previous instalments and maybe some new ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Monster Hunter Outlanders announcement trailer also revealed different types of traversal mechanics players can use in this world. Regarding traversal tools, we see the player character use a glider to cover large distances, a grapple to move more freely in jungles and a catapult that launches them in the air. We also get to see the character climb rocky surfaces and swim in some water bodies, so you won’t just be running around in this massive world.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-horizon-adventures-review.1034478/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me a while to figure Lego Horizon Adventures out. It’s the action game equivalent of watching the movie version of a book you like: It hits the major points, takes some liberties with characters and events, and then wraps everything up with a shiny bow in an abridged length. And like so many Hollywood adaptations, it handles the source material well without ever hitting the same heights. After spending 21 hours reaching 100% completion, I enjoyed nearly everything about its beautiful world and rich customization options, but predictable level design,  and a lack of things to do beyond the modest yet well-paced campaign made it feel like I was building a Lego set while missing a page or two from the instruction manual.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Horizon Adventures is a playful retelling of 2017’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> in the body of a typical Lego co-op action game. While it may not go into the depths of that story when it comes to the world or Aloy's origins, the broad strokes paint an entertainingly familiar picture for existing fans that’s still simple enough for newcomers to enjoy as well. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The 12-hour campaign took me across recognizable regions like the foliage-filled forest of the Sacred Lands, the frigid Snowchant Mountains, and the scorching hot Sunfall Desert. Each mission is filled with swaths of machines and cultists to overcome, chests filled with Studs (basically Lego money) to collect, objects to build or break, and plenty of charming character moments to keep the journey enjoyable. Those moments are often brief, but plenty of them had me chuckling from start to finish. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout Aloy's Journey, she's joined by an eclectic cast of playable allies: Rost, her mentor and father figure; Varl, a young Nora hunter looking to prove himself; Teersa, the village elder who's never short on quips; and Erend, a lovable brute with a big hammer. It’s great that original voice actors Ashly Burch, John Hopkins, John Macmillan, and nearly everyone else you encounter are back to reprise their roles, and the lighthearted tone of this outing gives them all room to experiment and have fun with characters I otherwise know well in some amusing ways.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The world of Horizon looks great in Lego form.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The one unfortunate exception to this is Sylens. He is back too, this time with a love of DJ'ing as he assists Aloy and friends from afar, but with a new voice actor after the tragic passing of Lance Reddick last year. Sylens has always been a reserved character, but I wish his sharp tongue had been showcased more in the many scenes with him in Lego Horizon Adventures, and the new performance from Tim Russ can often feel flat or clash with the energy and playfulness of the other characters. However, I will say that the decision to make him a DJ is inspired, and a fitting match for the zany quirks that everyone else has, like Varl's overprotective love of his comic books or Erend's obsession with Donuts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Master Builder</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The world of Horizon looks great in Lego form. Each level is filled with charm, constructed out of smart recreations of familiar structures like dilapidated buildings to climb around or destroyed sections of road mixed with things like a traditional Lego police station. These additions can distract from the Horizon flavor a little, but aren't harmful in their own right as the environments still nail the look and feel overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s especially true of the soundtrack. The music is fantastic, pulling some great choices from Horizon Zero Dawn’s score and adding its own flair with some EDM and pop-inspired tracks. One standout was called Post-Apocalyptic Dance Party, which would feel right at home with songs like Everything is Awesome from The Lego Movie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the design of the levels themselves frequently boil down to just a few key components: linear exploration sections that often hide a few chests full of either Studs or the occasional limited-use rare weapon or gadget, arenas to fight numerous machines and cultists in, and then sometimes a platforming area with simple jumps and climbing paths as you chase a Tallneck to end of the stage. Special Cauldron levels can also have slightly trickier platforming sections that require you to use either some form of shock item or weapon to power movable objects or open doors. While each stage is different, it became clear after just a few hours that the formula is too predictable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was also a noticeable lack of things to do besides platform and fight – no puzzles to solve, and no sneakily hidden secrets to obtain things that many fans of Lego games have come to expect. For example, red bricks are relegated to just unlocking a few costumes and customization items instead of various cheats as usual, like the stud multiplier or 8-bit music modifier. It’s fine that they serve a different purpose here, but when I know they are usually used for so much more, the unavoidable comparisons come across as lacking.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Piece of Resistance</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Customization picks up some of the slack, and was one of my favorite elements of Lego Horizon Adventures. There are over 100 gold and red bricks to collect for unlockables like costumes and town alterations. You obtain a small portion of them by completing levels, but most are earned by completing tasks on a community board in the hub area, Mother's Heart. The community board encourages you to change your outfits regularly, asking you to do things like dress as various Ninjago characters before defeating enemies with specific elemental attacks, or build certain items in town that let you catch a fish or play fetch with a dog. You can even radically change how Mother’s Heart looks, whether that’s adding hot dog carts, dropping dragons onto rooftops, or dressing all the townsfolk up like ice cream cones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to those cosmetic choices, you also have two simple but helpful skill tree options to take advantage of; one is a general skill tree that benefits your whole team, while the other is a set of character-specific trees. The general tree offers benefits like experience bonuses, extra healing, and extending the duration of enemies being frozen, shocked, or on fire. Meanwhile, the character-specific trees offer advantages that increase maximum health, weapon damage, or other unique bonuses. These are all unlocked simply by leveling up after earning experience from defeated enemies, with combat standing as a simple but satisfying exercise in picking off the specific body parts of your machine adversaries. By using Aloy’s Focus to target these body parts, you can change how fights play by doing things like removing the horns of a Broadhead so it hurts itself whenever it collides with objects in the environment. Skills can also come in handy when taking down bosses and stronger enemies, which provide more of a challenge than I was expecting from the Lego series. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lego Horizon Adventures Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, dying in Lego games costs you some Studs and then puts you right back into the battle – but in Lego Horizon Adventures, death instead sends you back to your previous checkpoint, which is usually the start of an area. I'm torn on whether or not this system is better than the original, as I liked that it left more money in my pocket for customization, but that comes at the cost of having to grab chests and build environmental objects again as I retrace my steps after a death. Either way, the good news is that experience earned and progress in various community board challenges is retained, so dying was still only ever a minor annoyance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if it’s more obnoxious to you, Lego Horizon Adventures has five difficulty options to choose from. The lowest setting has enemies only dealing one or fewer hearts worth of damage, and things scale up well to the highest option, where machines like Corruptors or Thunderjaws could deal five or more hearts per hit, taking me down in as little as one or two swings. I almost always prefer to play on the hardest difficulty setting available, but the tough part about doing so here is the lack of mechanics for dodging attacks. You’ll occasionally get access to the Rush Boots gadget, which allows you to zip around the environment in short bursts, but that brings me to another pain point I have mixed feelings about: the unpredictability of item drops. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Favorite Lego Games Unranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Horizon Zero Dawn, equipping weapons with the correct elemental type can make a difficult fight much more manageable. While Lego Horizon Adventures adapts that same idea in the form of limited-use rare weapons and gadgets, which ones you get out of chests or from enemy drops is random for the most part. There are some great options like homing weapons or gravity bombs that pull enemies together before exploding. Weaker machines like broadheads and grazers still have tanks on their back that are vulnerable to one-hit kills with elemental attacks, too, but whether or not you're lucky enough to have it is another story. On the one hand, I like the chaotic nature of using whatever I can find mid-fight. On the other, it would have been nice to be able to select specific rare weapons to some degree, especially because certain challenges require certain weapon types to complete them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s cool that you can at least guarantee you get some item drops by breaking off the back of a Shell-Walker, but you also never know what’s inside or which battles they will appear in. Thankfully, there are a few surefire ways to get special items, like a merchant that typically shows up at the midpoint of each stage with a trio of chests containing three random items or by investing in weapon-based abilities in the skill tree. These can help by making specific items drop more often, as well as one skill that gives you a random rare weapon and gadget at the start of each level. These options help, but they still aren't a perfect solution. Granted, all of the rare weapons you <em>could</em> find are both powerful and fun to use, so there’s no going wrong in a general sense, but thinning out the herd with a precise element can go a long way when five or more enemies spawn into an ongoing battle.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Shift Up has continued to update the game and even added crossover DLC with other video game franchises, most recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nier-automata">Nier: Automata</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stellar Blade November 20 Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its financial report, Shift Up said that after Stellar Blade’s launch “sales continued at a stabilized level,” although it failed to provide an updated sales figure. It did, however, provide revenue directly attributed to the game: 25.8 billion won (approx $18.5 million) during the quarter Stellar Blade came out (April to June), and 22.5 billion won (approx $16.1 million) during the company’s third quarter (July to September). That’s a total of 48.4 billion won (approx $34.6 million) as of the end of September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, Shift Up’s other game, mobile action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/goddess-of-victory-nikke">Goddess of Victory: Nikke</a>, makes more money than Stellar Blade (approx $51.9 million during the same two quarters).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To enhance the IP value and maintain momentum, we have been consistently releasing content patches and updates, which has helped sustain the game’s popularity,” it said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up plans to keep interest in Stellar Blade on PS5 going until the game launches on PC next year, what it calls the “platform expansion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The release is being considered within 2025,” Shift Up confirmed. “Considering recent trends such as Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth: Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Shift Up raised 435 billion won ($320 million) in its first day of trade after an initial public offering. According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-maker-shift-debuts-south-220000910.html?guccounter=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>, that was the largest in the country for a gaming company since 2021, when PUBG maker Krafton Inc. raised $3.8 billion from its own IPO. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up has an unannounced multiplatform RPF codenamed Project witches in the works. It said it plans to launch it at some point after 2027, with more information due in the first half of next year. Given the success of Stellar Blade, it seems likely Shift Up is also considering a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Treyarch has shared more details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Season 1, including a look at its battle pass' rather unexpected new skins. These include a 'Raccoon Goon' skin for Niran, some kind of parasitic nightmare for Carver (see header image above) and a shark suit also for Carver, because why not.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team has released a new system for its battle pass, which will now adopt a pages system to replace the sector map. In Treyarch's words, players should think of it all like a book.</p>

<p>"The first Page displays BlackCell Instant Rewards and the second Page shows premium Battle Pass Instant Rewards, followed by 100 in-game Battle Pass rewards across 14 Pages and a Completion Page that is instantly unlocked once all other Pages are completed," it explained, adding these pages include both free and paid content.</p>
<p>As for its content, which the developer noted is pretty ample, highlights include new weapon blueprints (there are 30 of them), those aforementioned operator skins, and some new equipment skins.</p>
<p>Players can get their hands on the premium battle pass for 1100 COD Points, or scoop up the 'Battle Pass Bundle' for 2400 COD Points, "including 20+ Tier Skips".</p>
