This one's a biggie, too: it's called Celestial Guardians, and it's themed around Pokemon Sun and Moon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Celestial Guardians officially releases on April 30, and is a bigger expansion than the last couple, with two different types of booster packs themed around legendaries Solgaleo and Lunala. It primarily features Alolan Pokemon, including the three starters Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio, as well as regional variants such as Alolan Raichu and Marowak. And of course, it comes with new trainer cards, themed around popular characters from the Alola region, and new ways to display your collection such as a new binder cover and display board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the set also appears to include what looks like two versions of the starter trio, a daytime and a nighttime version, each with different stats and abilities. It's unclear how prevalent this split is going to be throughout the set, but it could make for some interesting decks if there are multiple paths to getting the same cards out on the field.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon TCG Pocket Celestial Guardians Expansion First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Celestial Guardians is the sixth expansion so far and the third major one, following major expansions Genetic Apex and Space-Time Smackdown and smaller expansions Mythical Island, Triumphant Light, and the most recent, Shining Revelry. At the time this piece was written, none of these expansions have been retired yet, but it's perhaps only a matter of time before we say goodbye to Genetic Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Pokemon TCG Pocket has kept up the pace with roughly one new expansion per month, alongside regular in-game solo and competitive events. Alongside collecting and battling, TCG Pocket also implemented trading earlier this year, but the feature was widely panned due to its high cost barrier and lack of useful trading feature, forcing the developer to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-confirms-changes-to-much-loathed-trading-system-are-coming-eventually">confirm changes were on the way</a>... months down the road. Nevertheless, the game has been successful, and is estimated to have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-made-half-a-billion-dollars-in-less-than-3-months">made half a billion dollars in less than three months</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

  </p><article itemscope="" data-type-id="1100" data-guid="1100-6531101">

            
            
  


        

  


        
        
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I'll be real: Now that I think about it, the trick I'm about to talk about is <em>incredibly </em>obvious. So I'm begging you, please don't judge me too harshly and appreciate the fact that I am majorly humbling myself by writing about this. And, for those of you who also didn't realize you could do this, rest assured that you are in good-ish company.</p><p>Earlier this year, Fields of Mistria's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fields-of-mistrias-second-major-update-march-2025/2900-6312/" data-ref-id="2900-6312">second major update</a> was released, bringing with it the lava caves biome. And did you know that, unlike me, you don't have to use your watering can and desperately hop around the cave's various rock formations to progress through it? In a post shared on the official Field of Mistria Instagram, the team behind the game revealed that players can use the game's rain spell to instantly solidify every single inch of lava on the floor. That's right. All of it. And although this feat takes a lot of mana if you want to do it on multiple levels, man oh man, it changes things--and saves my poor stamina bar.</p><p>Admittedly, I haven't played nearly as much Fields of Mistria since the game's second update dropped--I blame the absolutely wild number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">phenomenal games that have come out this year</a> for that. For this reason, I think I'm a <em>little</em> more justified in not picking up on this sooner. But as someone who delights in games that force you to think about things in more roundabout way (ie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/" data-ref-id="5000-1362">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo/" data-ref-id="5000-582009">Paranormasight</a>, etc.), I am kicking myself for not considering that I could use the rain spell down in the mines.</p><p>While this is probably the biggest "oh god, you can do that" to come from Mistria's Instagram page, I also highly recommend checking out all the other tips, too. For example, did you know that if you feed a mimic items, it will spit out valuable resources and simply disappear? I've also noticed quite a few folks who have struggled a bit with the slimes that shoot rocks at you down there. The trick to besting them? Swing your sword at the right time and send those rocks hurling right back at 'em; just two good shots should do it.</p><p>While NPC Studios remains hard at work on the already fantastic farming simulator, we at GameSpot are continuing to chug away on our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fields-of-mistria/guides/">Field of Mistria guides</a>. Right now, it's one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/most-anticipated-games-leaving-early-access-in-2025/2900-6151/" data-ref-id="2900-6151">most anticipated games</a> that's scheduled to leave early access in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/655709/hori-usb-nintendo-switch-2-camera-gamechat-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After debuting a fun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642514/nintendo-switch-2-usb-c-camera-hori-piranha-plant-privacy">Piranha Plant-inspired alternative</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">Nintendo’s own $50 Switch 2 camera</a>, Hori is back with another camera accessory for the console that’s less fun but more functional. Standing just shy of two inches tall and weighing 30 grams, the camera is small and light enough to be connected to the Switch 2’s top USB-C port without making the console feel top-heavy while playing in handheld mode.</p><p>Hori’s USB Camera for Nintendo Switch 2 is currently listed on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/NSX-023/dp/B0F5WTSW21">Amazon Japan website</a> for 3,981 yen, or around $28, making it much cheaper than the company’s $60 Piranha Plant cam. It’s not known if the tiny camera will be exclusive to Japan, but since the Piranha Plant is already listed on <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/nsx-001u/">Hori’s US website</a>, there’s a good chance this one will also see wider availability. For now, only Amazon Japan has the new camera listed with a June 5th, 2025 release date.</p><p>In addition to being small enough to perch atop the Switch 2, the GameChat-compatible camera can also be attached to an included weighted base allowing it to stand alone on an entertainment center like Nintendo’s own camera is designed to. The base also has a fold-down support on the underside so you can sit the camera on the top edge of a TV, assuming that edge is thin enough.</p><p>Hori’s latest camera seems like a better alternative to Nintendo’s in terms of portability, but like the Piranha Plant it’s limited to a resolution of only 640x480 – a significant step down from the 1080p capabilities of Nintendo’s. That’s potentially enough resolution to match the quality of Nintendo’s camera when Hori’s is perched atop the Switch 2 and right in front of your face. But when it’s zooming in on you from across the room while the camera is sitting next to your TV dock, there will likely be a significant reduction in video quality while using GameChat.</p><p>Nintendo says “any compatible USB-C camera you’d like” will work with the Switch 2 so you can probably use the external webcam you bought for work. But the company also warns that “<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessories%2Fcamera%2F" rel="sponsored">not all cameras may work as intended</a>” and it has included a testing tool in the Switch 2’s settings to make sure. If you’d rather play it safe and know ahead of time, both of Hori’s cameras are officially licensed Nintendo accessories.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a> was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sequel-to-robocop-rogue-city-sounds-more-like-dredd">just last month</a>, and despite its slightly wordy and DLC-sounding title, it was a welcome surprise. The first game was prime 7/10 material, and it's pretty rare we get an AA game of this calibre these days. Earlier today publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nacon">Nacon</a> shared a new story trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>, giving an insight into the game you probably won't care about given the whole thing here is being a robot cop that does robot cop things. Oh, and it has a release date!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Unfinished Business is currently slated to release this coming July 17th, a little under three months away now. Wait, hang on, that's less than two years since the first game came out, that can't be right can it? Seems like it is possible to release follow-ups to generally well received games in a reasonable amount of time without pouring heaps and heaps of cash into something that's ultimately a bit too shiny and full of bloat. Who could have guessed!

<p>
The story, if you are curious about it, sees RoboCop being sent out to OmniTower, which has been taken over by some armed mercenaries. They want to have complete control over Omni Consumer Products, which includes RoboCop himself, and what's in the tower is the last part of the puzzle they need to achieve that goal. It's RoboCop! You already know what its deal is.
</p>
<p>
It generally sounds like it'll just take place in OmniTower, which sounds like it'll have some great potential for some lovely level design. That was the first game's strength, here's hoping developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/teyon">Teyon</a> pull it off with the sequel.

It’s a fantastic experience and an early-game gold farm. However, all of that bloodsport leaves my character hurting. But whether you’re tackling the Arena or exploring the surrounding landscape, you’ll encounter trouble eventually—and you will want health potions readily available. <strong>You can buy plenty at The Gilded Carafe in the Imperial City Market District</strong>.

                <p>Former Xbox-console-exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-horizon-5/" data-ref-id="5000-533238">Forza Horizon 5</a> sounds like it will run great on the PlayStation 5, and will be particularly impressive for those playing on PS5 Pro, according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-forza-horizon-5-rolls-onto-ps5-and-ps5-pro-the-df-tech-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the PS5 version of the open-world racer that first released in 2021 isn't set to release on PlayStation 5 until April 29, the performance-breakdown wizards at Digital Foundry have already put the PS5 version of Forza Horizon 5 through its paces ahead of its release. The good news: They largely have nothing but positive things to say.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82ceExNpBQA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/82ceExNpBQA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While its visual performance on the base PS5 seems nearly identical to its performance on Xbox Series X|S (Digital Foundry says there's virtually no visual distinction and that they struggled to differentiate the two side-by-side), that's still an achievement given the series the franchise's ForzaTech engine has never run on PlayStation devices before. The game runs at a constant 30fps in quality mode and a steady 60fps during performance mode, and Digital Foundry says developer Panic Button's PS5 port is a "near-perfect match" to the Xbox Series X|S version.</p><p dir="ltr">It's playing the game on the PS5 Pro where the real differences can be seen. Digital Foundry notes that there is a "huge difference" in the amount of foliage when playing on PS5 Pro while running Forza Horizon 5 in performance mode. Greenery is denser and more vibrant, and can also be seen in higher detail from farther away with less pop-in. The foliage rendering while in performance mode closely matches that of the foliage on display on the base PS5's quality mode, meaning PS5 Pro players get the best of both worlds.</p><p dir="ltr">"Getting quality mode foliage at performance mode frame rates is a huge bonus for Pro users, and provides a big visual boost over the base machine," Digital Foundry said.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few other perks for those playing on PS5 Pro as well, such as ray-traced self-vehicle reflections while playing in quality mode during normal gameplay--a feature that is normally only available while using the garage and Forzavista feature on base consoles. Digital Foundry found the reflections "noticeable" for those looking for it, but that it isn't hugely impactful. Overall, Digital Foundry called playing Forza Horizon 5 on the PS5 Pro a "compromise-free experience."

Developer Playground Games and Turn 10 Studio's racing series is just the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to Sony's consoles, with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-is-doing-phenomenally-on-ps5-sells-1-million-copies-already-report/1100-6526047/" data-ref-id="1100-6526047">Sea of Thieves</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/" data-ref-id="1100-6530308">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, having also been released on PlayStation.</p>

            <p>
It seems <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s divisive Game-Key Cards - physical releases containing a download "key", rather than the full game data - will be a pretty common sight when the console launches this June. The vast majority of third-party Switch 2 physical releases currently available for pre-order in Japan come on game-key cards, and the situation is looking similar in the UK.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2's game-key-card-heavy launch window line-up was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lniuq7ix4k25">first highlighted by Gematsu</a>, which noted all third-party physical releases seen so far in Japan feature box art indicating their game-key card status. The exceptions are CD Projekt's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and all Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles - that is, original Switch games featuring Switch 2 specific enhancements.
</p>
<p>
The likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bravely-default">Bravely Default</a>: Flying Fairy, Wild Hearts, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-0-review">Yakuza 0</a>: Director's Cut, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, and Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion all feature game-key card branding on their Japanese boxes, with 11 out of 12 Switch 2-specific third-party physical releases opting for the key-on-card approach. Nintendo's own titles - namely Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza - all use standard game cards.

<p>
Furthermore, it looks like the situation will be similar in the west if the handful of third-party Switch 2 games currently available to pre-order are any indication. UK retailer Smyths <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/gaming-and-tech/nintendo-switch-2/c/SM060402">features game-key card box art</a> for Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition, Street Fighter 6: Year 1-2 Fighters Edition, and Bravely Default: Flying Fairy, while Amazon in the US shows Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, Raidou: Remastered – The Mystery of the Soulless Army Launch Edition (all from Sega) utilising game-key cards.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">unveiled its game-key cards earlier this month</a>, as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">big Switch 2 blow-out</a>. "Game-key cards are different from regular game cards, because they don't contain the full game data," it said at the time. "Instead, the game-key card is your 'key' to downloading the full game to your system via the internet. After it's downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card."

The fact many third-party publishers have so enthusiastically embraced game-key cards this early into Switch 2's lifespan isn't likely to delight physical collectors, but the scheme does at least have one major advantage over code-in-a-box releases in that game-key card downloads aren't locked to a specific user account, meaning they can be shared and resold.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 officially launches on 5th June, and pre-orders were available in the UK just days after its big reveal. US and Canada pre-orders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-guide-us">finally went live today</a> after Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">opted to delay them</a> in order to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">assess the impact of the US administration's recent tariffs</a>. But while the console itself has retained its original $450 price tag in the US for now, Nintendo recently confirmed it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raising prices for various console accessories</a> "due to changes in market conditions".

			<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/nintendo-says-demand-for-switch-2-console-in-japan-overwhelming?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a> report, analysts are expecting Nintendo to have &nbsp;6-8 million <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> units on hand for its June 5 launch. This would make it one of the biggest console launches in the video game industry's history.</p>
<p>Coming into 2025, everyone expected the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 to be one of the most significant events of the year. Demand for the Switch 2 has even exceeded Nintendo's expectations. In Japan alone, Nintendo received 2.2 million applications from consumers looking to grab a Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had to take to <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">X</a> to formally apologize to players that "<em>a significant number of applicants won't be selected</em>" because the demand exceeded expectations. Bloomberg's report also notes that Nintendo is doing what it can to increase console production to meet the demand as best it can by June 5.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 only went live in the United States and Canada today, after having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">delayed</a> due to tariffs announced by the U.S. Consumers looking to lock in their pre-orders<a href="https://x.com/spencerhakimian/status/1915257488703705328?s=46"> reported</a> that websites for retailers like Best Buy and Walmart crashed due to the overwhelming flood of traffic. The outages weren't too bad overall, as many people were still gleefully announcing they had grabbed a pre-order.</p>
<p>While the price of the Switch 2 and its games remains controversial for players, those who could grab a pre-order or buy it on day one are likely getting a better deal than those who choose to wait. Tariffs still loom over the console's pricing like a dark cloud, and we've already seen them impact the Switch 2, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">increased the price</a> of several Switch 2 accessories as a response to tariffs.</p>
<p>The price of the console has stayed the same for now, but Nintendo stipulated that it could still increase in the future, "<em>depending on market conditions</em>."</p>

Some players argue that Strategist heroes are penalized by <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ ranking system, which prioritizes kill counts over other stats like healing or damage mitigated, unfairly penalizing players for focusing on keeping their teammates topped off rather than popping heads. Support heroes have also been on the receiving end of several nerfs over the course of the game’s first three seasons. Often the only thanks they get are harassment and blame from their teammates, all while content creators like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FxkPCzRWM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FxkPCzRWM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streamer Necros</a></span> criticize support players on their platforms.</p><p>In a thread on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1k5vjdy/the_support_strike_and_necros_comments_why_this/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1k5vjdy/the_support_strike_and_necros_comments_why_this/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Marvel Rivals </em>subreddit</a></span>, user Revolutionary-Ad6480 wrote about the strike and why attitudes like the one Necros expressed on his stream have so many Strategist players disillusioned with the game, saying that it points to a growing cultural problem within the community.</p><p>“We’re not asking to be glorified or seen as the ‘hardest’ role - because I don’t think we are,” they wrote. “We just want basic respect. It’s tiring to be called brain dead or worthless when your stats are solid and you’re playing your role the way it’s meant to be played.”</p><p>The movement has spread across other social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok. However, there are a fair number of detractors casting doubts on the size of the movement, with several <em>Rivals </em>streamers making fun of the whole thing and calling it dramatic. As of yet, it’s unclear if the message is getting through to those in the community who need to hear it. Maybe those players will get it when they’ve got to swap over to Strategist themselves because nobody is healing.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The talk of the town currently in gaming is Bethesda's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, but it might not be the only RPG remaster from Bethesda. A report said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is coming</a>, and now one of the game's original designers, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/16256/bruce-nesmith/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bruce Nesmith</a>, has commented on what he'd like to see from it.</p><p>Nesmith told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-3-designer-expects-remaster-to-heavily-revise-gunplay/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20250423" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a> that he'd like to see Fallout 3's gunplay improved upon to make it more like Fallout 4's. "[Fallout 3 combat] didn't hold up to shooters at the time," he said. "Also, it's an RPG shooter; it's not a run-and-gun shooter. But a lot of work was done on that for Fallout 4. So I anticipate seeing a lot of that work go into it, assuming they're doing the same thing."</p><p>Nesmith pointed out that Fallout 3 marked Bethesda's first big stab at a shooter-style game, and the gunplay was not ideal.</p><p>A Fallout 3 remaster could also beef up the visuals of the 2008 game, Nesmith said. The Oblivion remaster didn't just make the game visually in line with the 2011 version of Skyrim--it exceeded it, Nesmith said. He said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-oblivion-dev-reacts-to-oblivion-remastered-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/1100-6531057/" data-ref-id="1100-6531057">pleasantly surprised by the work that went into Oblivion Remastered.</a></p><p>A report said the rumored Fallout 3 remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">would not launch for a long time</a>, so anyone hoping to play it soon should probably give up hope about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bethesda Game Studios plans to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/">Fallout 5</a>, but it's not coming until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>--so it's not going to launch soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Oblivion Remastered is currently on sale for 17% off at GameSpot sister-site Fanatical (both GameSpot and Fanatical are owned by Fandom).</p><p>In other Fallout news, new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-fallout-76-update-is-live-letting-players-finally-become-a-ghoul/1100-6530194/">Fallout 76 finally allows players to become Ghouls</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has introduced quite a few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/">new features and improvements</a> to Cyrodiil, but one classic feature from the original 2006 version of the game has undeniably remained: extremely cursed character faces.</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, most of the horrifying faces in the original Oblivion belonged to NPCs. Player-characters often ended up looking a bit off as well, but the player-character's face wasn't featured as prominently in the original game as it is in the remaster, nor was third-person mode as polished as it is in the latest version of the game, so the game's wonky NPC faces tended to overshadow whatever horrors players put together in the character creator. In Oblivion Remastered, however, many of the game's NPCs have had glow-ups, while the game's character creator has given players more flexibility to turn the Hero of Kvatch into an utter monstrosity. There's even a subreddit where players can share said monstrosities: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OblivionAbominations/" rel="nofollow ">/r/OblivionAbominations</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Oblivion Remastered's updated character creator makes it far easier for players to create <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6aau5/i_made_a_beautiful_orc_lady/" rel="nofollow ">visually appealing characters</a>, but it also makes it easier for players to create characters that are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6becp/you_are_the_one_from_my_dreams/" rel="nofollow ">pure nightmare fuel</a>. Almost immediately following the game's surprise release, social media started filling up with screenshots of player-character designs that make <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/167oww7/why_do_the_characters_look_like_that_im_scared/" rel="nofollow ">the bug-eyed NPCs</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> look downright friendly. Here are some of our favorites.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sir Vancelot</h3><p>Arguably the most popular horrifying player-character, Sir Vancelot has started appearing all over social media since his creator first shared him.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Dumb and Dunmer</h3><p>This delightfully horrifying dark elf is truly the stuff of nightmares.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Shrek</h3><p>This particular orc (...that <em>is</em> an orc, right?) is giving off major "Shrek had a few too many filler injections" vibes.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Yu-Gi-Oh My God</h3><p>It's nothing if not accurate.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Janker</h3><p>Some men just want to watch the Oblivion Gate burn.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Not-So-Handsome Squidward</h3><p>Someone free him from his suffering.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Jimmy No-Tron</h3><p>Depends on one's definition of gorgeous.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Orange-In-Chief</h3><p dir="ltr">"This is a really, really great Oblivion player-character. The best, really terrific. No fake news here. Other player-characters? Losers! Total disasters. Everyone agrees. Believe me."</p><h3 dir="ltr">I Have No Eyes And I Must Flush</h3><p>50% orc, 50% sleep-paralysis demon.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Crimson Chin Deathclaw</h3><p>He looks even more hilarious with his armor on.</p><p dir="ltr">Which Oblivion abomination is your favorite?

            <p>
It's been a few months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a> launched into early access, unfortunately arriving in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breaker-early-access-review">bit of a mess</a>. The game just wasn't there, which obviously is what early access is for, but it was rough. Everything was just a bit too difficult, too unbalanced, and the loop wasn't strong enough to do over and over again, none of which you want in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>. Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/heartmachine">Heart Machine</a> have been tinkering away at it though, bringing in some much needed tweaks here and there, and now the game's first big update is coming next week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This update, titled Buried Below, will be coming to the game April 29, just a few days away. We'll get to the additional stuff in a moment, because first I want to talk about the actual biggest part of the update, which is a complete rework of the game's core structures. 
</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyqU8OL8Xm8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
For starters, currently you have three lives before a run is finished. With this update, you'll get one, and when you die, you'll lose all your items as opposed to keeping them across runs. You do keep certain currencies across runs, but for the most part it's going for a more traditional roguelike experience now when it comes to dying and loot. Extracting with said loot will be easier too, you can do it at any shrines you come across, and you don't have to fend off waves of enemies to successfully get out.
</p>
<p>
SyComs, those lil robots that follow you around, now have their own sort of class-like system, with each Breaker getting one assigned SyCom with fixed stats. You'll be able to equip them with perks to give your Breaker passive abilities too. For new players, and old ones too, there's also a tutorial at the beginning of the game, something sorely needed for a game of its challenge level.
</p>
<p>
Ok, onto the part of the update where it gets its name from. There's Rondo, a new Breaker whose abilities will let you boost your flash-step and parry. Heading underground will eventually lead you to a new Crown, the game's bosses, called Maw. It's a big ole evil-looking dragon whose attack patterns have some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a> vibes about them. The underground area has been kept a bit mysterious in the trailer for the update, so I can't really tell you what there'll be down there, but you'll be finding caves across the map in general now.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, good on Heart Machine for killing their darlings and retooling the core structure of their game so much. It sounds like quite a radical change from what they were going for, and personally it's tempting me to jump back in. I haven't played since launch, bouncing off of it because it was so rough to play, so I'm quite curious to see how it feels now.

According to the console maker, while it is  “thrilled” by how many people want a Switch 2, all this demand will likely mean some consoles ordered through Nintendo’s official store won’t ship until after launch. Even worse, Nintendo warns that some people might not even get a chance to place an order on a Switch 2 via an invite e-mail until <em>after</em> June 5, aka the day the console launches. Yikes.</p><figure id="" data-id="87e8c24f5915810bfcbbb4a1881345e5" data-recommend-id="image://87e8c24f5915810bfcbbb4a1881345e5" data-format="png" data-width="1282" data-height="317" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="87e8c24f5915810bfcbbb4a1881345e5" data-recommend-id="image://87e8c24f5915810bfcbbb4a1881345e5" data-format="png" data-width="1282" data-height="317" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Instead, Nintendo says that if you “wish to increase your opportunity of obtaining” a Switch 2, you should probably just pre-order via a place like GameStop or Target. Sadly, a lot of those places have already sold out. </p><p>Overall, the vibes I get from Nintendo is that it had no chance of keeping up with Switch 2 demand. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorders-my-nintendo-japan-sold-out-1851777449&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorders-my-nintendo-japan-sold-out-1851777449">On April 23</a></span>, Nintendo apologized ahead of time for the fact it won’t have enough Switch 2 consoles for everyone who pre-ordered in Japan. </p><p>It’s looking like it might be hard to buy a Switch 2 until sometime in 2026 or later.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">If you don't play games on PC (or even if you do), you might not know that there's been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=parkour" rel="nofollow ">a run on parkour games</a> for a while now. All of these also compete with games like Roblox and Fortnite, where parkour sims carve out a major aspect of the user-generated worlds on display. But one of these parkour games stands out above the rest: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rooftops-and-alleys/" data-ref-id="5000-612233">Rooftops &amp; Alleys: The Parkour Game</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's both the highest-rated parkour game on Steam (among those with more than just a handful of reviews) and has the most Steam reviews by far, with 96% of its nearly 5,000 user reviews giving the game the illustrious "Overwhelmingly Positive" distinction on the digital storefront. Soon, it'll be leaving early access and coming to consoles as well, with a 1.0 launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S scheduled for June 17.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGtD2Kz2tH8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nGtD2Kz2tH8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During my hands-on time with the game, it was quickly apparent how much solo developer Michel Losch drew inspiration from the past. The arena-like maps and the ability to freely go wherever and chain together stylish moves felt like something right out of a classic Tony Hawk game. One of its maps, The Shed, seems to intentionally invoke imagery of Tony Hawk's beloved warehouse level. Still, I agreed with Losch's assessment that the physics and required stick skills of his game end up landing Rooftops &amp; Alleys (R&amp;A) somewhere in the middle of Tony Hawk and the more sim-like Skate series from EA.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, none of R&amp;A is performed on boards either, so it also gave me Mirror's Edge vibes (albeit, in third-person, not first-person), and Losch name-dropped Jet Set Radio Future as another inspiration. Like DICE's classic dystopian freerunning game, high-level play in R&amp;A looks so effortlessly cool, and even a beginner like me can appear skilled and stylish--provided they don't skip the tutorial. And much like Jet Set Radio Future, that sense of style in R&amp;A's gameplay extends beyond movement to influence the audiovisual experience--playable characters offer lots of colorful customization, and there's an eclectic soundtrack that Losch and his fiancée produced together.</p><p dir="ltr">I was both impressed and, at times, intimidated by the game's mechanics. Any one move itself was easy to perform, but the real magic of parkour is chaining together a long sequence of maneuvers, which wasn't as easy to pull off. Not that I'm complaining--the upward skill slope was an enjoyable climb, culminating in an incredible sense of flow when it all briefly came together (I tended to see my character come crashing down eventually).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482109"></a><figcaption>The Shed map reminded me a lot of Tony Hawk's famous warehouse level.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the true test, though, I handed the controller off to my 12-year-old son, who would probably prefer I describe him as a (virtual) parkour expert. He loved what he played and felt like, while it was more challenging than something like Parkour Reborn on Roblox--which is more like a Spider-Man sim anyway, if you ask me--he appreciated the intricacies of the controls, and how the things you could do in the game very much resemble the reality of parkour. Rooftops &amp; Alleys doesn't seem like it will stray too far from that reality, for now anyway, and instead equips players with the tools to perform feats that parkour athletes can accomplish in the real world. Maybe some future update will send players to the moon, but, for now, it's all intentionally grounded.</p><p dir="ltr">Since debuting in Steam Early Access, the game has received 30 updates, Losch told me, including two additional maps, lots of challenges, several multiplayer modes (such as Tag and Capture The Flag), and numerous enhancements to the game's foundational movement mechanics. But the game's next milestone is maybe its most important.</p><p dir="ltr">"1.0 will be the biggest update yet," Losch said. "The game will get its sixth map, a brand-new online multiplayer game mode (Tricks Battle), a lot of new time trials and trick rush challenges, new music, over 100 different customization options, a full progression system with unlockables, fun achievements, improved gameplay mechanics--such as the brand new physical sliding mechanic, which is purely momentum-based--and an amazing photo mode which I honestly could not be more proud of!"</p><p dir="ltr">To date, R&amp;A has sold more than 150,000 copies, which isn't half bad when you consider Losch set out to pursue game dev as a passion project on the side of his 15-year career as a music producer and DJ. "[2023] marked the beginning of my solo game dev journey, so I had to learn Unreal Engine from scratch and overcome many hurdles that previously kept me from going for it and making my dream parkour game," he told me.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482110" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482110"></a><figcaption>Rooftops and Alleys is not a game where you can hold a button to auto-parkour in style. Each step is earned.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Fair to say, now I am happy to have done it, and love seeing people like it as much as I do." He continued, "I have been craving a good parkour game my entire life [...] I think I honestly got lucky in the sense that my personal taste and itch for a certain pParkour game seemed to have been aligned overall with the [genre's] community and players."</p><p dir="ltr">Rooftops &amp; Alleys: The Parkour Game gets its Steam 1.0 update and debuts on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on June 17.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s second wave of physical Lego sets will include codes for in-game character skins.
</p>
<p>
The next batch of four Lego sets will drop in from the Battle Bus on 1st June - and there's a range of options to choose from.
</p>
<p>
Each contains exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> minifigures, as well codes to unlock at least one in-game skin per set - something the Lego Fortnite range did not include with its first four sets released last year.
</p>
<p>
Joining the range is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/peely-sparkplug-s-camp-77075">Peely &amp; Sparkplug's Camp, the cheapest option at £18</a> for a 250-piece set. This looks to be based on the Lego Fortnite Odyssey game mode, as it features replicas of its workbench item and wolf enemy. Minifigures included are, unsurprisingly, Peely and Sparkplug. You'll also get a code for the Sparkplug in-game skin.

Next up in size is the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/durrr-burger-restaurant-77076">Durrr Burger Restaurant, priced at £54.99</a> for a 546-piece set. This includes a corner of the burger restaurant seen on various older Fortnite maps, plus minifigures for Beach Bomber, Beef Boss and Grimey. You'll also get a code for the Beef Boss in-game skin.

Splash out a little more and you can buy the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/klombo-77077">Klombo set, priced £89.99</a>, which features Fortnite's lovable purple dinosaur as he appears in Lego Fortnite, plus minifigures for Oro and Adventure Peely. The in-game skin here is for Adventure Peely, which Lego Fortnite fans may have already from an earlier Lego Pass.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, this wave's centrepiece set is the enormous <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/mecha-team-leader-77078">£209.99 Mecha Team Leader model</a>. This is one of those big Lego sets designed to sit on a shelf and look impressive, rather than actually be played with - though at 45cm tall and weighing in at 2503 pieces, you're going to need a big shelf. 
</p>
<p>
Mecha Team Leader has been the star of a few Fortnite live events, most notably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-fortnites-mecha-vs-monster-battle-played-out">the game's monster vs mech battle</a> that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-remix-finale-event-smashes-14m-all-time-player-record">remixed last year in a fight sequence featuring Eminem</a> (standard Fortnite). Included in the box are two codes each for both the Mecha Team Leader and Mecha Team Shadow skins. But is it worth £210? Hmm. You do get a Mecha Team Leader minifigure too...
</p>
<p>
Lego and Fortnite's collaboration began several years ago, with the launch of its in-game Lego Fortnite mode that has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">grown into several modes</a> and a platform for hundreds of smaller community-made minigames. Nearly all Fortnite skins now also have a digital equivalent (though not Eminem, in this case).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus">Lego Fortnite's first four Lego sets</a> include a giant Supply Llama, a Durrr Burger, a large model of Peely Bone, and a recreation of the Battle Bus with around a dozen minifigures - that one really is very nice.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has added prices to the online store pages for Nintendo Switch 2 Edition game upgrades in the UK, confirming that there will be multiple price points, depending on the games.</p>
<p>For more straightforward upgrades like Breath of the Wild, Nintendo will be charging £7.99 / €9.99 / $9.99, while Switch 2 Edition games that also gain a significant amount of DLC content, such as Kirby and the Forgotten Land will be priced at £16.99 / €19.99 and likely at $19.99 in the US.</p>


<p>The four games with live listings are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack</a> – £7.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack</a> – £7.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV </a><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html"> Upgrade Pack</a> – £16.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-2787773.html">Kirby and the Forgotten Land – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Upgrade Pack</a> – £16.99</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I feel like the worst effect that these Switch 2 upgrades has had is to make the game titles practically unreadable. Did the Super Mario Party Jamboree content really need to be called Jamboree TV again, and have a ‘Nintendo Switch 2 Edition’ sandwiched right in the middle of it? at least ‘Star-Crossed World’ sounds like a DLC expansion, but Jamboree TV sounds like the marketing department got lost mid title and wrote it again.</p>
<p>But you pay extra for those additional words, because they add a bunch of extra stuff to each game. Jamboree TV has new camera and Mouse-Con mini-games, while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/13/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-switch-2-edition-preview/">Star-Crossed World remixes the original game with new frozen world elements</a>.</p>

<p>Given this pricing, we would expect that future cross-gen Nintendo games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which has new graphics modes and mouse controls, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which is a more straightforward resolution and performance bump, will have a £8 price bump over the Nintendo Switch versions.</p>
<p>This also suggests that third parties will likely have a good bit of freedom to price upgrades how they see fit, especially as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo is also making free updates</a> for a number of games from the Switch back catalogue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/nintendo-clarify-that-physical-switch-2-editions-will-not-feature-download-codes/">Switch 2 Edition games will be sold as Switch 2 cartridges physically</a>, though it will likely be more cost effective to buy the Nintendo Switch version and then the upgrade separately, which will work with either digital or physical copies of each game. Kirby, for example, is priced at £66 all-in on the eShop, but would be £55 if you buy the Switch game from Argos for £38 and then upgrade.</p>
