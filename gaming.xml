            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jb-smoove-is-making-and-potentially-starring-in-a-high-on-life-animated-comedy-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It’s a case of a game recognizing game!"</h2></div><section><p>An animated series based on Squanch Games’ High on Life is reportedly in the works with Curb Your Enthusiasm's J.B. Smoove attached as a producer.</p><p>These first details on the video-game-to-show adaptation come from <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/j-b-smoove-produce-star-series-high-on-life-video-game-1236031133/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Deadline</u></a>, which says that Smoove will produce the project via his Alternate Side Productions banner. He starred as Gus in Squanch’s first-person shooter upon its release in 2022, and although the site says there is a “good chance” he’ll play a part in the series, he’s not officially joined the cast yet. </p><p>In addition to live-action roles in movies like Date Night and Spider-Man: Far From Home, Smoove has provided his voice talents in projects like <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/harley-quinn/reviews">Max’s Harley Quinn</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/21/teen-titans-go-to-the-movies-review">Teen Titans Go!</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/13/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-season-1-review">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/06/j-b-smoove-1722903973702.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>J.B. Smoove. Image credit Steve Granitz/FilmMagic.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Smoove shared a statement about how High on Life will shoot its shot in animation:</p><p>“When Squanch Games originally reached out to JB Smoove (I like to talk about myself in the third person) about voicing a character in their incredible video game High on Life, my first question was what does my character look like? They told me that I would be a fish that shoots…which makes perfect sense to me! As a Vegan I feel a fish should have the right to defend itself! I mean right?! And now that I’m partnered with Squanch Games and Striker Entertainment to bring the hilarious High on Life to series it feels like it was inevitable!"</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“High on Life is wild, weird, and wonderful, and the series is going to be that and more!</p></div><p>Smoove continued: “They invited me to join them in the gaming universe and now I’m helping them move into the TV world! It’s a case of a game recognizing game! High on Life is wild, weird, and wonderful, and the series is going to be that and more! Get ready to laugh your way through space with some unforgettable characters like myself! We are locked and loaded and ready to go!”</p><p>Alternate Side is handling the executive producer role along with Striker Entertainment’s Russell Binder and Mandy Bardisbanian. Squanch is also involved in the animated show’s development, with the original game’s narrative director, Alec Robbins, attached as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>High on Life released for PC and Xbox in late 2022 and arrived on PlayStation consoles July 2023. Story DLC content, titled <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-lifes-horror-themed-dlc-high-on-knife-is-out-next-week"><u>High on Knife</u></a>, then followed in October. The animated show has no release date and has not officially confirmed who will join its cast. The game, however, is known for its list of talent, which includes notable appearances from stars like Tim Robinson, Michael Cusack, Mike Stoklasa, Zach Hadel, Tom Kenny, Nolan North, and more.</p><p>High On Life began as a video game two years ago, and in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-review"><u>8/10 review</u></a>, we explained why we loved the “laugh-out-loud funny” story it had to tell. Though its journey into animation will mark a major change from its humble start in games, it’s not quite the first time the series has explored other mediums. Robbins helped bring the franchise to comics, too, and you can learn more about its off-shoot stories <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-squanch-games-brings-the-hit-franchise-to-comics"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

<p>UFL, which has been dubbed the ‘FIFA/FC killer’, is set to be released on September 12, as confirmed by Strikerz Inc. Following a few successful test runs, which saw more than 1.5 million downloads recorded during the first beta weekend, UFL is ready and raring to go.</p>



<p>Building on community feedback from the previous beta tests, Strikerz Inc. was able to make significant improvements to the game ahead of the most recent testing period that ran from August 2 – 4 and in little more than a month, the full (free) game will be released for everyone to enjoy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-keeping-it-fair">Keeping It Fair</h2>



<p>At the heart of UFL sits the claim that the game is ‘fair-to-play’ and that it prioritises skill over spending. It’s an ambitious and realistic title that rewards strategy and it has already proven to be a hit with fans worldwide. This single- and multiplayer game boasts cross-platform functionality, create-a-club mechanics, and some of the most impressive visuals we’ve seen in a debut sports game for years.</p>



<p>If you needed any more convincing that great things are in store for UFL, consider that Cristiano Ronaldo invested heavily in the game during a fundraising round that pulled in $40 million. Not only that, but the likes of Firmino and De Bruyne have signed on as ambassadors.</p>



<p>Strikerz Inc. has a lofty goal in sight: 15 million players within 12 months. It has already been confirmed it’ll be free to play <strong>but </strong>it will of course have a battle pass system and microtransactions woven into it.</p>



<p>Will you be downloading and playing UFL when it’s released on September 12?</p>

The latest one showcases how the meat shield mechanic looks when performed on another player.</p><p dir="ltr">Whenever players sneak up behind another enemy, they can use them as a human meat shield instead of automatically performing an execution on them. As shown in a clip by<a href="https://x.com/charlieintel/status/1820554144324927648?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" rel="nofollow "> Charlie Intel on X/Twitter</a>, when using someone as a meat shield, the player will pull out their pistol and use that to defend themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Once players have someone, they can also kill them. Players will be able to perform a "Quick Kill" which presumably means they'll die right away, and they'll also have the opportunity to perform their execution.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on what the clip provides, it appears that the meat shields will still be alive during this. But if the person using them as a shield dies before them, the other player will resume playing. So you can still potentially save teammates if you aim your shots right.</p><p dir="ltr">As previously mentioned, various leaks around Black Ops 6 have made their way online. The reason is that a<a href="https://x.com/charlieintel/status/1820567152996519980?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" rel="nofollow "> version of the game was uploaded to the PSN database</a>, which allowed people to play a beta build on the PlayStation 4. So, if you want to avoid spoiling certain features for yourself, avoid looking up specific Call of Duty content for the time being.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is scheduled to come out later this year on October 25. It'll be playable on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

Tim Burton is back directing the follow-up alongside new and original cast members like Keaton and Winona Ryder. And one of these new actors, Jenny Ortega, was selected to share some depressing news: Beetlejuice is coming to <em>Roblox</em>. </p><p>Announced today, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.roblox.com/games/17811071580/BEETLEJUICE-Escape-the-Afterlife&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/17811071580/BEETLEJUICE-Escape-the-Afterlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice Roblox</em> experience is live now</a></span>. Players can hop in and play a few mini-games, unlock in-game content for their Roblox character, and explore a digital landscape inspired by the upcoming film. And yes, you can hang out with Beetlejuice, who looks like a demented knock-off mini-fig based on a kid’s cartoon drawing of the famous character. But this is just what <em>Roblox </em>looks like to me any time I’m forced against my will to learn more about this <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-gambling-robux-lawsuit-metaverse-court-kid-safe-1850751687&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-gambling-robux-lawsuit-metaverse-court-kid-safe-1850751687">horrible game filled with shady people, scam artists, and probably some actual kids</a></span>. </p><p>For those who want to get nuts (editor’s note: wrong Keaton franchise), they can line up at a fake box office in <em>Roblox </em>and buy real-world movie tickets via Fandango. And now the real reason for this odd marketing stunt is clear: to get people to buy tickets to a movie. </p><h2 id="h64366"><a id=""></a>Let’s read some buzzwords! </h2><p>“We are always looking to engage audiences and amplify our reach in new and exciting ways; this first-of-its-kind collaboration with <em>Roblox</em> and Fandango for <em>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice</em> allows for just that,” Cameron Curtis, VP of marketing at Warner Bros. totally said out loud. For real. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/warner-bros-launches-beetlejuice-roblox-experience-with-virtual-box-office/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/warner-bros-launches-beetlejuice-roblox-experience-with-virtual-box-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And not just in this buzzword-laden comment shared in a press release</a></span>. </p><p>“As we continue to test commerce, offering an opportunity to purchase tickets within the movie-inspired immersive environment is a way to explore a new consumer category and further engage users who are looking to purchase different things,” said Stephanie Latham, <em>Roblox’s </em>VP of global partnerships in a comment that feels like it was spit out by a robot pretending to be human, but failing.</p><p>Anyway, that new <em>Beetlejuice </em>movie arrives in theaters on September 6. You can visit this new <em>Roblox</em> experience now. </p><p>Or, instead, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">you can just read <em>Roblox </em>Studio head Stefano Corazza’s comments</a></span> suggesting their game helps “kids” living in the “slums” make money via content creation.

This map adding depth is a fantastic change that reminds me of the maps in the <em>Metroid Prime </em>games. Those maps are the gold standards of navigation in an interconnected 3D environment, so anything even close to them is good in my book!” The only major complaint some have is how much it spins, though past <em>Monster Hunter</em> games have usually had settings to lock the minimap to true North. </p><p>Elsewhere, the new trailers show off some of the ways that monsters <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ekqni5/the_phases_of_wounding_seen_on_doshaguma/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ekqni5/the_phases_of_wounding_seen_on_doshaguma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change their appearance</a></span> as they take more damage through each successive phase of a fight. There’s also a new focus mode that lets you aim attacks like you’re looking down the scope of a gun in a first-person shooter. The camera and your character will stay locked-on and static even as you strafe so you can repeatedly target the same weak points and do more damage. There are even focus attacks that, in addition to being more effective, just look really cool. </p><p>You can watch all three of the trailers in full below:</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I loved it so much that I even went as far as to call it the best game the genre has seen in recent memory, a game that could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a></span>. Five months later, I stand by everything I said. This is a spectacular accomplishment by developer Vanillaware that more people need to get their hands on. The main selling points are its phenomenal gameplay and beautiful art.</p><p>The quality of <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>’s art almost goes without saying, this is a Vanillaware game after all. The same team behind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-crown-the-kotaku-review-977366436&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-crown-the-kotaku-review-977366436"><em>Dragon’s Crown</em></a></span> and <em>13 Sentinels</em> delivers its signature painterly environment and beautiful character design. And, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> applies that amazing art to a medieval fantasy world, so expect to see lofty castles and plenty of knights in shining armor. The game’s world, which is broken into multiple kingdoms with different terrain, is also a delight to the eyes. Travel from one end of the map to the other and watch it change from deep blues on the coastline to verdant green forests and eventually to blistering white snowfields or burning yellow deserts. Of course there is more to do than just look at pretty art in this world.</p><figure id="" data-id="0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-recommend-id="image://0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large scale battle in front of a walled castle scene in top down view" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large scale battle in front of a walled castle scene in top down view" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-recommend-id="image://0a484ccfb84cfa5bc7e20526fa45429a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large scale battle in front of a walled castle scene in top down view" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The meat of <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> is its seemingly endless number of combat systems that meld together to make a truly thrilling tactical RPG that melds real-time and turn-based action. When large scale battles are triggered you control your units on a real-time map, directing your troops on the field against the enemy. When a unit does clash with the opponent, it turns into an automatic face-off that fans of<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-games-ranked-three-houses-engage-awakening-1850234583&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-games-ranked-three-houses-engage-awakening-1850234583"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a></span> might be familiar with. Based on how you built your unit—with position, troop makeup, and equipment, the battle will automatically be won or lost. It means that while the moment-to-moment of battle is real-time, the bulk of your success is determined before you step onto the battlefield.<br></p><p>Mastering<em> Unicorn Overlor</em>d requires getting deep into the systems that take place before battle. You must understand how each troop’s class gives them different advantages and disadvantages in battle against certain opponent types, and how positioning troops can drastically change the outcome of a battle.

Even when you start to think you are getting the hang of <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> it tests you. Battles will continue to add new gimmicks or challenges to test your knowledge of the game’s systems. If you like a tough tactics game, <em>Unicorn Overlord </em>is for you</p><p>I implore any tactical RPG fans to take advantage of the PlayStation sale while you can. Until August 15, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> available for $41.99 instead of $59.99. Trust me, it’s worth it at either of those prices, but why not get it for cheap? </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While Star Wars Outlaws isn't even out yet, the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3oDeg1rH3qrXBttnBaxN5Y/star-wars-outlaws-postlaunch-roadmap-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-launch roadmap</a> for the game, which includes a Season Pass, has already been revealed. For those who will be purchasing the game, the base game isn't the only thing players have to look forward to in the upcoming future.</p>
<p>Ubisoft have revealed in their roadmap the plans for a Season Pass which will include two story packs. This Season Pass doesn't have to be purchased right away with the game, and it can be purchased on its own.</p>
<p>For those who purchase the Season Pass in time for the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> will get the Kessel Runner character pack, which will include outfits for scoundrel Kay Vess and her companion, Nix. By getting the Season Pass, players will also get access to an exclusive mission called "Jabba's Gambit."</p>
<p>Players will meet Jabba the Hutt in the base game regardless, but owners of the Season Pass will gain an exclusive mission where they have to aid the Hutt Cartel.</p>
<p>Past launch day, the first story pack named Star Wars Outlaws :Wild Card will be released in Fall 2024. This comes alongside two cosmetic packs titled Hunter's Legacy and Cartel Ronin.&nbsp; This first story pack will be included for those who have the Season Pass.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card features missions where Kay is hired to infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament which goes well until she is introduced to Lando Calrissian, and things begin to go awry as it's not as clear cut as it seemed.</p>
<p>The Hunter's Legacy Bundle and the Cartel Ronin Bundle contains additional outfits for Kay and Nix, as well as additional cosmetics for Kay's speeder and her ship, The Trailblazer.</p>
<p>The next story pack is going to be released in Spring 2025, and is titled Star Wars Outlaws: A Pirate's Fortune.</p>
<p>In this story, it turns out that The Trailblazer's reputation precedes Kay, as she collides with Hondo Ohnaka, a veteran pirate. They are aiming to settle some scores with a deadly gang of pirates.</p>
<p>So far, this is everything we know about what is coming in the Season Pass for Star Wars Outlaws. Whether there will continue to be more content past Spring 2025 remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will launch on Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC via Ubisoft Connect and the Epic Games Store come August 30. If you preorder the game now on the Ubisoft Store, you will receive the Kessel Runner Bonus Pack, which includes cosmetics for Kay's speeder and The Trailblazer.</p>

Throughout his time at the haunted Harrenhal, he’s been plagued with twisted visions, including one where he makes love to his own mother and another where a young Rhaenyra (Millie Alcock) chides him for how he treated her. As the season has gone on, it’s been clear that his desire to wear the crown is dwindling, but it isn’t until this last episode that we’re certain where Daemon’s allegiances lie. His final vision is one that sees far into the future, so far that he sees Daenerys, and sees Aegon the Conqueror’s dream with his own eyes, validating Viserys’ decision to name Rhaenyra his heir. That vision convinces him to remain loyal.<br></p><p> In the book, Daemon fights loyally on Rhaenyra’s side in a hugely important battle, and it’s likely that the showrunners wanted to end up there—they just decided to remind us that men aren’t all that fond of women ascending thrones instead of them along the way.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7cf3ed4445fe7224bde56b9714695cfb" data-recommend-id="image://7cf3ed4445fe7224bde56b9714695cfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aemond speaks to Alicent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aemond speaks to Alicent." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7cf3ed4445fe7224bde56b9714695cfb" data-recommend-id="image://7cf3ed4445fe7224bde56b9714695cfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aemond speaks to Alicent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Basically because he’s a spiteful little brat with mommy issues. Sharp Point has no real strategic advantage in the war, but it’s very close to Dragonstone, so it’s likely that he just went to the nearest town to destroy it in a massive fiery temper tantrum after seeing how many dragon’s Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) has on her side.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="16eed596178e608d4833234c40c2cd1c" data-recommend-id="image://16eed596178e608d4833234c40c2cd1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aegon and Larys speak." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aegon and Larys speak." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="16eed596178e608d4833234c40c2cd1c" data-recommend-id="image://16eed596178e608d4833234c40c2cd1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aegon and Larys speak." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is fairly obvious, except for the fact that him leaving King’s Landing could be considered an abdication of the throne.

So yes, I’d say that Rhaena will be on dragonback in season 3.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c94b8e11372f414e8e3dabe0f9bab9a9" data-recommend-id="image://c94b8e11372f414e8e3dabe0f9bab9a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhaenyra and Alicent talk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rhaenyra and Alicent talk." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c94b8e11372f414e8e3dabe0f9bab9a9" data-recommend-id="image://c94b8e11372f414e8e3dabe0f9bab9a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhaenyra and Alicent talk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, this doesn’t happen in the book at all, but is a fantastic example of the showrunner’s weaving a clever story from a novel written like a history book. Of course Alicent (Olivia Cooke), struggling with what horrors she has inadvertently put in place both with her decisions and with the rearing of her children, would appeal to her once-best-friend (and definite love of her life). Rhaenyra and Alicent have a special bond, and they’re also keenly aware of the dangers of out of control men. “You will enter as a conqueror,” Alicent tells Rhaenyra. “Once you take the throne, this senseless war must end.” And if Aegon refuses to bend the knee, Alicent confirms that she will have to be okay with Rhaenyra beheading him over it. Oop.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cb3409b969964c70943f66968799c57" data-recommend-id="image://4cb3409b969964c70943f66968799c57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Addam bends the knee." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Addam bends the knee." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cb3409b969964c70943f66968799c57" data-recommend-id="image://4cb3409b969964c70943f66968799c57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Addam bends the knee." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A brief scene in the final montage shows a dragon soaring over troops marching in Oldtown.

Remember she was asking about him when her brother first came to King’s Landing, and was relieved to learn he is sweet and kind? Yeah, it’s that kid, but the showrunners cleverly keep the camera <em>far</em> away from Tessarion so we can’t see its dragonrider, as they likely haven’t cast Daeron yet.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5d4e17ab2b5d34bfc4b1b9a6e8260e57" data-recommend-id="image://5d4e17ab2b5d34bfc4b1b9a6e8260e57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Corlys looks off camera.

Sure, we have to wait until whenever the hell season three debuts, but I imagine that the perceived slowness of this season will be swiftly made up for. Rhaenyra, her new dragon riders, and Daemon are all going towards King’s Landing, meanwhile Aegon is heading away from it. Tyland Lannister (Jefferson Hall) is crossing the narrow sea to fight Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) and his fleet, who are blockading Blackwater Bay so King’s Landing will continue to have supply issues, which will further piss off the smallfolk. The Starks have also come down from Winterfell and are marching through The Twins.<br></p><p>War is on the horizon, my friends, and remember what Rhaenys (Eve Best) said: “There is no war so hateful to the gods as a war between kin, and no war so bloody as a war between dragons.”</p><hr><p><em>House of the Dragon </em>season 3 does not yet have a release date.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games has just revealed an image showcasing what appears to be the next Tarkov ‘boss character – <strong>Partisan</strong>. In an image posted on social media, players get an exclusive first look at Partisan, an ageing, capable-looking combatant with a solid-looking AK and what appears to be a grenade linked to a tripwire.</p>



<p>This is, of course, the embodiment of months’ worth of rumours suggesting that a ‘PMC-hunting’ boss would be making their way into Escape from Tarkov, boasting the ability to lay traps for unsuspecting players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-who-is-partisan-in-tarkov">Who is Partisan in Tarkov?</h2>



<p>Not much is known about Partisan aside from what we can glean from his image. He looks to be in his fifties, and his outfit suggests he’s more than comfortable with a combat-focused role. He wields a well-built AK-platform assault rifle complete with a ‘GP-style’ underbarrel grenade launcher.</p>



<p>Per the image, he will most likely have the ability to lay tripwire-based booby traps. In his hand, he’s holding a grenade linked to a length of thin cable, which means two things:</p>



<ol>
<li>Battlestate Games is making true to the promise to introduce traps</li>



<li>Partisan is almost certainly the ‘PMC Hunter’ boss we’ve heard about in recent discussions</li>
</ol>



<p>It was recently suggested that a PMC Karma system will be introduced with the next Tarkov wipe, and this boss will hunt down players with ‘low karma’ that comes about as a result of camping and engaging in nefarious or sly tactics. We don’t yet know how karma will be calculated or what’ll go <strong>into </strong>that calculation, but it’s another arm to the many meta games that players take part in when they boot up Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>What else do we know about Partisan in Tarkov?</p>



<p>Well, he appears to have some control over nature, as a small bird is perched on his hand. Could he be using wildlife to spot PMCs from a distance? In the shot, he’s also standing behind cover in a dense forest that has a signpost behind it highlighting a minefield, which means he’s on a map like Shoreline or Woods. </p>



<p>He also has several dog tags slung around his neck and both USEC and BEAR patches on his backpack, which means he’s not picky about what faction he takes on. </p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed when the next Tarkov wipe will hit, but it’s expected to arrive in the next two weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/i-would-live-in-this-climbing-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2107550/Valley_Peaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Valley Peaks</em></a>, a rock climbing game for PC and Switch that came out in late July. While it isn’t <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-jusant-gets-rock-climbing-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the climbing game of my dreams because maybe nothing can be</a>, I would 100% move to its setting and live there forever.</p><p>You play as a frog person who has come to finish the work your father started of placing radios on the tops of mountains to connect the area to the outside world. This is ostensibly for some corporation, and while I haven’t finished the game, I get the sense there’s more to this story than just doing a job. To get to these mountain peaks, you climb routes of varying difficulties scattered across the game’s world.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Valley Peaks – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dUmd7D2AuMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Mountains have different difficulties, portrayed by a star rating. Some of them are straightforward climbs, swinging and jumping between rocks and the occasional wooden pole. Touching these poles in order fills out a stamp card; when you have three stamps, you can trade it in for an upgrade, such as a watch that slows down time or a glider that lets you soar off peaks. Other routes are more complicated. Some have rocks that collapse if you hold them too long, or ones you can only climb on when they’re a certain color. Others have moving train cars that require careful timing to navigate, or spiked plants that push you back. Given that the game is first-person, I sometimes had trouble understanding where my body was in space and struggled with some routes. I also indulged in my fatal <a href="https://kotaku.com/mobile-game-crux-lets-you-rock-climb-without-going-to-t-1845024500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real-life climbing flaw</a> of neglecting to read a route before getting on it, and often found myself halfway up a mountain with no idea where to go next. </p><p>The routes have a lot of variety and often require some exciting jumps or risky moves, and summiting the harder ones feels like a real achievement. I tend to want realism in my climbing games (and all my games, and, well, all the media I enjoy), but I appreciate <em>Valley Peaks</em>’ flights of climbing fancy. They make the routes feel challenging and adventurous, and add a certain time pressure to some climbs that feels exciting without being too stressful–if you fall all the way to the ground, you lose the progress toward your stamp, but you’re otherwise fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The mountains you climb jut out of a surprisingly large and populated landscape, full of other climbers who brag about the local vibes and point you in the direction of things to do. You sometimes encounter people where you wouldn't expect it during your climbs, and they tell you interesting lore about the area. On the ground, there are towns where you can do tasks for the locals, like finding their missing items, delivering their mail, or fixing things up. There's also a surprising, and somewhat overwhelming, amount of collectibles to gather–screws, pictures, mushrooms, and more–some of whose purpose I suspect, as an open world game, I missed the explanation for somewhere along the line. This has made my experience of the game feel a little cluttered and busy, but these activities also provide a nice break when I get frustrated failing a climb, and make the world feel like your character has entered into a fully-formed community.</p><p><em>Valley Peaks</em>’ world is a painting-like mix of lines and splashes of color. There are forests and beaches, and from the top of a mountain, the horizon stretches on forever. It’s really beautiful, and I keep finding myself wishing I could live in its mountain town. There’s one character I keep seeing riding a bike along the area’s trail system, and every time I see them I sigh "I wish <em>I </em>were doing that." You might know that I recently moved back to New York City after some time in DC; while I’m glad to be back in a place where I have friends, I’ve found myself really missing DC’s easier access to the outdoors. <em>Valley Peaks</em>’ fantasy town feels like a version of all the things I miss: just leaving my front door and being in the woods, surrounded by other outdoorsy people eager to tell me a story or lend me a hand. I’ve been enjoying just wandering around <em>Valley Peaks</em>, taking in its lovely environment and chatting with its characters, imagining what it would be like to be able to be outside doing a sport I love all day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While running away to live permanently on my bike is one of my backup plans if Aftermath doesn’t pan out, I also know that I’m in my 40s now, burdened with a bum knee and student loans; the dirtbag climber life is probably off the table for me, though I’ll never say never. I’m glad <em>Valley Peaks</em> can let me live some of that fantasy in video game form.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are a lot of rules to remember. Those rules can change over time either through a new edition or the upcoming 2024 revision. Not to mention the demand for dramatic encounters and storytelling. Enter <em>The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes</em>.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes is a deck of game-changing, character-shifting cards designed for any game that uses <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-game-masters-deck-of-boons-and-banes-card-artwork.jpg?itok=7ZnTnVws 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-game-masters-deck-of-boons-and-banes-card-artwork.jpg?itok=njY64GIl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The deck contains 40 illustrated cards. 20 of these cards provide a boon to the player. These include blessings from a higher power, the protection of spirit wolves as they travel, or the ability to grow a pair of dragonfly wings once a day.</p>
<p>The other 20 inflict banes. A curse that strangles a character to death the more they stay active. A blight that covers the character in thick odorous mold. The list goes on.</p>
<p><em>The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes</em> also includes a companion book. This book contains descriptions of each card's effects as well as how it impacts the character who drew it. Each entry includes suggested side quests related to each cards as well as ways to scale the effects up and down for different tiers of play.</p>

It can be all boons, all banes, or something in between. Can your players resist the temptation of power, or end up drawing from a deck stacked against them? The choice is yours.</p>
<p><em>The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes</em> was written by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe5KNXqT7970K8vkHb5BQ5Q">Ginny Di</a>. Ginny Di is a cosplayer, professional Game Master, and YouTuber known for releasing helpful advice videos for new TTRPG players and how to cultivate safe, thoughtful spaces for RPG groups. The cards were illustrated by Tim Foley, the same artist behind board games <em>Maximus</em> and <em>Tori</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Game Master's Deck of Boons and Banes </em>will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. It will be available October 1.</p>

As a result, clients using those products and tools are at risk of unintentional copyright infringement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like other AI toolmakers, Nvidia needs training data for its text, video, and audio generators to "learn" how to create assets. Data scraping generally refers to the practice of feeding existing video, text, and audio into training models without securing the permission of the people who made it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technique means </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206120/runway-ai-video-generator-scraped-youtube-videos-report">YouTube</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Netflix (and the companies with media on those platforms) have copyrighted material taken without consent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regulators in the US and EU are still determining if data scraping practices violate copyright rules. 404 Media's report underscores how much tech companies play loose with copyright law when it comes to generative AI, and how other industries like entertainment and games can be affected by these choices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Employees at the company expressed concerns about this behavior in messages reviewed by the outlet. Despite these concerns, NVIDIA told 404 Media its scraping directives are "in full compliance with the letter and spirit of copyright law. [...] Fair use protects the ability to use a work for a transformative purpose, such as model training."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers and their parent companies are copyright holders, and YouTube is an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/-i-elden-ring-i-has-become-one-of-youtube-s-biggest-game-launches">important platform</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the industry.

Acquiring said footage for data sets involved collaborating with NVIDIA's GeForceNow cloud service.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In one Slack conversation, senior research analyst Jim Fan noted the service's streaming capabilities for capture and storing video. All of those "high-quality gameplay videos," he said, is "very useful" data to pull from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We'll work closely with [GeForceNow] and related engineering teams to set up live game data capture, scale up the pipeline, and process them for training," he explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, employees raising concerns were also allegedly told by project managers that scraping was an "executive decision" to not worry about. The "open legal issue" (such as breaking YouTube's Terms of Service) would apparently be resolved in the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 404's story, quotes from internal documents and Slack channels from several AI researchers show NVIDIA'S active effort to avoid bad press. Its research VP Ming-Yu Liu stressed there couldn't be "negative sentiment" if the company didn't publish any research about its download data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What we are doing here will lead to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>zero publications</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," wrote Liu. He and other staff also constructed their own YouTube data scrapers and an API account to help with the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Until regulators define what does and does not violate copyright in the world of generate AI, NVIDIA and other companies are likely to operate in a legal gray zone. As MIT's Robert Mahari told 404, proving data scraping can be "really hard technically."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The best [company] policy in terms of incentives, is to not tell people what you've trained on," he said. "So as long as you don't tell anybody, it's going to be really hard to prove."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">404 Media's full, extensive report on NVIDIA's data scraping can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.404media.co/nvidia-ai-scraping-foundational-model-cosmos-project/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/guild-esports-takeover-offer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Recently, we reported about the issues that Guild Esports is facing, with financial turmoil running rampant through the London-based organisation that’s backed by David Beckham. It was highlighted that with cash reserves dwindling, the organisation had just £25,000 on hand, and the stock value of the company was plummeting.</p>



<p>Now, in a report shared by Reuters, it has been confirmed that Guild Esports is ‘planning to agree’ to a takeover bid from DCB Sports, a Californian investment firm.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-stay-afloat">To Stay Afloat</h2>



<p>It was highlighted in the report <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/david-beckham-backed-guild-esports-set-takeover-by-us-based-dcb-sports-2024-08-05/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Reuters</a> that Guild Esports’ stock value has crashed by around 99% since the all-time high was reached in 2020. In a recent all-time low, the share price of Guild Esports touched around $0.08. </p>



<p>In a statement, Guild’s representatives said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Should the transaction complete, DCB Sports will assume and run the Guild brand, backstop future working capital requirements for the private business, provide ongoing capital sufficient to allow it to operate on a stable financial platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’ll be a complete buyout, with DCB Sports assuming control of everything – and that means the full suite of successes and failures currently sitting under the Guild banner.</p>



<p>Guild has experimented with several esports games in the past, ranging from top-tier titles like VALORANT and Counter-Strike to more emerging markets like simracing. Currently, the organisation fields teams in the likes of Fortnite, EA Sports FC, Street Fighter, and Apex Legends.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mike-ybarra-ceo-role/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mike-ybarra-ceo-role/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In January, Mike Ybarra left his role as President of Blizzard Entertainment after more than two decades at Microsoft. It came around the time that the tech titan made almost 2,000 layoffs, furthering the damage done to the industry in one of the toughest years on record for redundancies and studio closures.</p>



<p>Now, the veteran who worked in and around Microsoft’s gaming branches since 2009 has announced an entirely new role – CEO of PrizePicks, a ‘skill-based fantasy sports operator’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-still-gaming-in-a-way">Still Gaming, In a Way</h2>



<p>In the words of Matt Booty, Mike Ybarra ‘saw through’ Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard before departing the company. For almost three years, Ybarra sat at the top of the table at Blizzard Entertainment, and before that, he had a hand in managing the strategy driving Xbox Live, Xbox Game Pass, and the failed ‘Mixer’ streaming platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7226287019151257602/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On LinkedIn</a>, Mike Ybarra posted a comment about his new role at PrizePicks:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m impressed with the talent and capability at PrizePicks. I’m very excited to join this amazing team and build on our great products and business together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PrizePicks explained that Ybarra is ‘closely aligned with the PrizePicks culture, bringing an unwavering focus on fan experience and constant innovation.’ He is also joining the firm’s board of directors. </p>



<p>The company, which has a focus on operating a fantasy sports market in North America, is an app-based solution that’s headquartered in Atlanta. It’s a platform that offers users the opportunity to make money with a wide range of fantasy sports leagues, including the NHL, NBA, NFL, and MLB. It also offers a relatively unique esports fantasy product centred around CS2, Call of Duty, and VALORANT, among other games, which is a comfortable enough connection for Mike Ybarra.</p>
