			<p>Another massive batch of developers under Microsoft and more specifically under Blizzard have voted in favor of unionization under the Communications Workers of America (CWA), as 450 developers working on Diablo voted for unionization.</p>



<p>Per a press release from the CWA, those who voted for unionizing will join members of the CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, the CWA Local 1118 in Albany, and the CWA Local 6215 in Austin. Microsoft, in keeping with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">promise made to help push its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King through</a>, has recognized the union. </p>



<p>That's not to say that Microsoft has been entirely welcoming to the hundreds of game developers under it that have unionized in recent years. It took the ZeniMax QA union, the first major union to form under Microsoft thanks to the deal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">two years to reach a deal</a>, and they eventually had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/">strike</a> to help get its deal through. </p>



<p>There are still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">other unions</a> under Microsoft working for a deal, but still, it's all a step towards creating a better situation for the developers.</p>



<p>"<em>With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us</em>," said Kelly Yeo, producer on Diablo. "<em>I am overjoyed that we have formed a union—this is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear. We are ready to begin fighting for real change alongside our Diablo colleagues.</em>"</p>



<p>Nav Bhatti, senior software engineer on Diablo added, "<em>My entire career as a developer has seen my peers and I paying the ‘passion tax’ for working in an industry that we love</em>. <em>At some point you have to choose between fight or flight, and forming a union is us doing just that — standing our ground in the industry.</em>"</p>



<p>This is the latest wall-to-wall unionization effort at Blizzard since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">Overwatch 2 team </a>formed its union, and if the reports we've heard, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-king-layoffs-chaos-microsoft-mandatory-daily-ai-use/">continue to hear</a>, about working conditions under Microsoft are even half true, it likely won't be the last as workers continue to fight for a better quality of life. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The undead hordes are back in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-gtav-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-review-impre-1848652706">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>,&nbsp;</em>but they aren’t hanging out in a snowy cemetery like in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-zombies-north-yankton-halloween-survival-1851664429">last year’s Halloween event</a>. Instead, zombies have infested the tropical island of Cayo Perico in a new mode that’s bigger and trippier than the last zombie survival mode.</p> <p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3k38k52o5383/battle-hordes-of-undead-in-the-new-cayo-perico-survival?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=465:cayo-perico-zombie-survival-20250828">On August 28, Rockstar Games officially announced</a> (and then promptly added) a new zombie survival mode to <em>GTA Online.&nbsp;</em>Titled “Cayo Perico Zombie Survival,” this new mode transports players to the already existing tropical island of Cayo Perico to fight off waves of zombies. During the mode, which can be played solo or with three of your friends, players will encounter a wide array of undead foes, including DJ zombies and undead conquistadors. Remember when this was a gritty online crime simulator set in the same universe as <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>? Anyway, here’s the trailer for the new mode:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battle Undead in the New GTA Online Cayo Perico Survival" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GbuCIrZSPDk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Compared to last year’s Halloween zombies mode, this new Cayo Perico Zombie Survival is much bigger and wilder. Last year’s mode was set in one small snowy cemetery, featured a handful of zombie types, and that was it. This new mode features more enemy variety, moves players around the island to fight the undead in different spots, and just seems like a weirder and bigger thing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-zombies-mode-ludendorff-cemetery-survival-1851672030">I guess last year’s zombie event being a massive success</a> convinced Rockstar Games to invest more money and resources into this new undead survival mode. It sounds like this mode will be leaving on September 10, so don’t wait too long to hop back into <em>GTA Online,</em> earn some new exclusive rewards, and kill a bunch of zombies.</p> <p>Here’s Rockstar’s official description of the mode:</p> <blockquote><p>Your favorite island paradise just came down with a deadly case of party fever. As if a major narcotrafficking island wasn’t dangerous enough, it’s now been overrun by the undead — and maybe it’s the drugs or the tropical climate, but this time they’ve got a whole lot weirder. Cut your way through waves of undead, including conquistadors armed with muskets, Panther Trainers and their feral pets, swarms of Splitters, and more in the new Cayo Perico Survival. Fight through these hordes and make your way to the airstrip — then pray your evacuation plane doesn’t take too long.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Solo developer Immersiv Games reached out to me back in June to check out its non-linear adventure game, Arcadian Days, during Steam Next Fest, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/06/13/the-25-best-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try">it ended up being one of my favorite demos from the event</a>. Now, Immersiv Games has revealed Arcadian Days hits Steam Early Access on September 16, and if you're looking for something relaxing and unique to check out, I'd recommend giving it a shot.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2L7IvxgwNo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2L7IvxgwNo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>During the Steam Next Fest demo, I was impressed by its minimalist, free-flowing exploration and sun-kissed visuals – throughout the demo, a gorgeous sunset created a painterly backdrop to my leisurely tasks, which included collecting plants for a crop or wood in a shed. The tasks I experienced weren't too challenging, and completing them took little effort, but Immersiv Games' self-proclaimed "non-linear" and "relaxing" makes me think this is by design. Though I love me some fast-paced, high-intensity action games, Arcadian Days' demo reminded me that it's equally as rewarding to check out a game that asks you to slow down and breathe.&nbsp;</p><p>I look forward to seeing how the Arcadian Days evolves during its Early Access period. Arcadian Days launches on PC via Steam Early Access on September 16.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, check out my Arcadian Days demo thoughts in this round-up <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/06/13/the-25-best-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/arcadian-days-a-relaxing-non-linear-adventure-hits-early-access-next-month]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aside from a brief stint in covid lockdown where I dumped several hundred dollars into <em>MTG: Arena</em>, got to mythic with a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/znr/203/scute-swarm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scute swarm</a> deck and went cold turkey, I have been clean from <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> since <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Combo_Winter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mess around the Mirrodin block</a> in high school. But before then I was a regular tournament goer, spent a lot of time playing the game and still have my rare binder. I still keep up with what’s happening to <em>Magic</em> from a safe distance, far away from my wallet. That’s why I’m pleased that Vivi Ornitier from <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> is currently making the Standard format so miserable that they might have to ban the little guy. Buddy, I’m so proud of you.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: SQUARE ENIX/Wizards of the Coast. Art: Toni Infante, Jason Engle </span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivi, the diminutive black mage, was introduced as part of the wildly popular <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/final-fantasy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Final Fantasy</em> set</a>, a part of <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Universes_Beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universes Beyond</a>. Universes Beyond is a sub-brand that focuses on lassoing IP from outside of the lore of the <em>Magic </em>universe (<em>The Walking Dead</em>, <em>Stranger Things</em>, etc.) into the main game. Often this consists of simple reprints and reskins of existing <em>Magic</em> cards, but <em>Final Fantasy</em> marked a turning point because it was a totally new set that was entirely legal to play in Standard. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> set has been obscenely popular, making <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 million dollars in a single day</a>. It is a love letter to the series and a fantastic lure to new players, and one that did not feature too many overpowered cards. It was a gargantuan hit, and subsequent Universes Beyond sets coming up include <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/avatar-the-last-airbender/card-image-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a> and <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/marvel/spider-man" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Spider-Man</em>.</a></p><p>On his own, Vivi starts off powerless and gets huge as time goes on. Every spell you cast that isn’t a creature makes him bigger with counters and pings all opponents for one damage. The more powerful he is (either through this ability or other means) the more red and blue mana you can add to your deck once per turn. Even without other synergies, he’s somewhat broken mechanically: bare minimum, Vivi’s ability should have been a tap ability to begin with. The part where it becomes a problem is with another card in Standard: Agatha’s Soul Cauldron.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="We Might Have a Vivi Problem" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/erRxQzM_S3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Agatha’s Soul Cauldron is a legendary artifact. The first effect is that it allows you to spend any color mana to activate creature abilities. This is nice, but not really that interesting in this context. Where it gets nasty is that it allows you to exile (remove from the game) creature cards in any graveyard (where they normally go when they die or are discarded from your hand) to share activated abilities with every creature with a +1/+1 token, as well as place a counter +1/+1 on a creature you own. This means that if you intentionally build a deck that puts Vivi in the graveyard, then remove him with the cauldron, all your characters with +1/+1 counters become Vivis: an increasing fountain of mana that scales with the creature. Also unlike Vivi, the creatures you’d be playing in that deck do not start off as a 0/3, and thus are more powerful with this combo. When it goes off, it potentially creates an increasing feedback loop that just creates more spells, more cards, and more mana. Even if the opponent does manage to get rid of the cauldron, they often have to deal with what it created. This deck is known as Izzet Cauldron, it is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mtg/comments/1mzuwno/current_standard_state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dominating the standard format</a>, and currently costs like $700-$800 in physical cards.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Wizards Of The Coast. Art: John Stanko, Alix Brawyn, Zara Alfonso, Julie Dillon.</figcaption></figure><p>There are also other components to Izzet Cauldron that make it nasty. The spells in the deck tend to focus on graveyard abilities, tokens, and drawing and discarding cards to not only dump Vivi in the graveyard, but also find the combo. There’s <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/prices/marauding-mako" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marauding Mako</a>, a weenie that adds counters when you discard and can be discarded for a card. <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/prices/proft-s-eidetic-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proft’s Eidetic Memory</a> is an enchantment that adds counters to creatures based on how many cards you’ve drawn. <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/prices/fear-of-missing-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fear of Missing Out</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/127/tersa-lightshatter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tersa Lightshatterer</a> can occasionally have utility on their own with the Cauldron, although they are primarily there to dump Vivi or dump something in the hope of finding Vivi. And <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/67/winternight-stories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Winternight Stories</a> lets you draw and discard cards and can be played from the graveyard for a higher cost. There’s enough here that makes the cauldron fun without Vivi, but Vivi is what makes the deck a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Should Vivi Ornitier Be Emergency Banned in Standard MTG?" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8XuW3tiIN0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Izzet’s Cauldron is currently dominating the <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Standard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Standard game format</a>, which is composed of recent sets that get rotated out on a three-year cycle (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/revitalizing-standard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">although it used to be two years</a>). Standard is not the only format out there; Commander is way popular and frankly more fun, but it is a significant one. If you care about tournament play, which many players simply don’t, the question becomes if Izzet Cauldron will get so unsustainably dominant that it pushes out other decks from play, and if that’s a fun format to play in.</p><p>There’s multiple ways that <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Should-MTG-s-Vivi-Ornitier-Be-Emergency-Banned-in-Standard/c6cac280-dde2-4fef-bea4-89d5a0f70efa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wizards of the Coast could deal with this</a>. Normally bans are announced in specific and predictable timeframes. They could emergency ban the Cauldron in Standard, which would do something but not solve the fact that Vivi is wildly overpowered and would be kicking around until February 2028 (<a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/izzet-prowess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Izzet Prowess</a> decks would still be around and still be nasty). They could ban Vivi in Standard, in which case everyone who spent a lot of money on Vivi cards (currently going for like 40-55 bucks each as of this writing) would be pissed off, although I’d argue that if you bought Vivi knowing what was happening you factored that in as a possibility. They could just hang out and do nothing and hope the situation resolves itself. Or they could make some other weird attempt to fix it.</p><p>I don’t have a material stake in the current <em>Magic</em> meta: not my monkeys, not my circus. Wizards of the Coast also has no reason to listen to me, I didn’t make 200 million dollars in a day.&nbsp; But it’s a tremendously funny situation all around. As our good friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/esper.bsky.social/post/3lxdk34xst22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Esper Quinn pointed out</a>, it’s appropriate that an $700-$800 deck containing a card named FOMO represents a big part of the current Standard meta. I also just adore Vivi as a character, and the mental image of players turning him into soup and making an army of Black Mages is thematically resonant with the source material – Vivi is an experiment who escaped containment and took on a life of his own.</p><p>Though I was thoroughly impressed by the care that went into the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set (it is clearly a labor of love) I do not think making the Universes Beyond brand tournament legal represented a healthy impulse. The <em>Fortnite</em>-ification of everything is often done cynically, and slamming all the various IPs you love together in an attempt to grow your player base is tiring.

<p>On <strong>2</strong><strong>3rd November 2025 at 23:59</strong>, it will no longer be possible to buy the Nintendo-published game from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Fitness-Boxing-2-Rhythm-Exercise-1843189.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=FitnessBoxing|NULL|ProductDiscontinuation|m_id_2tBvHJYJ48|1843189">digital storefront</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Elder Scrolls Online team has had to go through a lot of changes lately. Earlier this year, the studio announced a change to the way new content for the eleven-year-old MMORPG would be released. Previously, ZeniMax Online Studios used to launch expansions (called Chapters), but now they have <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shifted to a seasonal model</a> that began this June with <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season of the Worm Cult</a>. </p>



<p>The studio itself has gone through a leadership change. Following the departure of founder Matt Firor, Jo Burba has stepped up as the new Studio Director, and now Elder Scrolls Online Game Director Rich Lambert has moved into the new role of Studio Game Director while Nick Giacomini is taking his place. I discussed all this, the state of the game, and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cancellation of ZeniMax Online's other project</a> in a chat with Rich Lambert and Nick Giacomini at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Rich, what's going on at ZeniMax Online Studios? Tell us about it.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> There's lots of change in the air. I am moving up a role, so I am going to focus more on studio-level things, and Nick is coming in and taking over the game direction. It's something that I'm really excited about. I've been working on ESO for 18 years now. It's amazing and super fun, but I'm ready to try new things and spread my wings. Nick is the right person to do that and help take Elder Scrolls Online, with the team, to new heights.</p>



<p><strong>Your role is still distinct from that of Studio Director, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> I'm the Studio Game Director and will focus more on studio-level initiatives, future projects, and things like that. I'll still be working with Nick, who is going to be 100% devoted to ESO on a day-to-day basis.</p>



<p><strong>Nick, do you want to introduce yourself and talk about what you've done before?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> I'm a huge gamer, have been my entire life. MMOs are my favorite genre by far. I've been playing Elder Scrolls Online since day one. I had just built a new computer to play the game. And in 2019, when I got the job at ZOS, I was literally jumping up and down in joy. I've been on this incredible journey since then, getting to work with incredibly talented people to create this game and continue to update and provide the experiences our players love. I joined as a Senior Product Manager and then became Project Director. I got to work very closely with Rich throughout the entirety of this time, and I've got the work with many different teams on multiple features. Stepping into this leadership role is just such an honor. </p>



<p><strong>What's your vision for the game now that you took the reins from Rich?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Rich and I share a lot. I actually love the community. When we talk about what makes Elder Scrolls Online great, by far the most important things are the players. The players are so central to the decision-making. That's, like, the first thing, doubling down on communicating with our players and being more transparent. We must do right by them and provide the experiences and stories that make ESO great. Passion and excitement are another thing. We have a lot of very passionate developers. This has never been about a single person. We are a large team of very talented developers and I want that passion to shine through. We get excited and we play the game too. </p>



<p>Another part related to that is evolution, right? So, 10 years, 11 years now, it's great that Elder Scrolls Online has been successful for so long, and we want to honor those roots. But at the same time, the expectation has changed. We've got feedback that the game has been too predictable, so another thing is how can we provide things that are more exciting? The players are choosing to invest their most precious thing, their free time, in our game, while there's so many games, there's other forms of entertainment, so why should they spend time in this game? I'm a strong believer that every second that players spend in Elder Scrolls Online should be valuable and rewarding.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>I don't think that 30 years is some insurmountable challenge, but it's also just not going to be easy. I believe we do have a core, and that's one of the wonderful things about MMOs: we have a core of very passionate players who have been playing for a long time. I think the path to 30 years lies there. That's one of the reasons we're moving to a seasonal model. Player feedback has always been a critical component of the development process, but we are now doubling down on that, and I think this is the best possible way to get to 30 years.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I was reading the <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> that went up recently, and the Studio Director (Jo Burba) said that ZeniMax Online Studios wants this to be a thirty-year-old game. What do you think you'll have to do to achieve that? Keep doing what you're doing at your best, or is there more to it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Eleven years is already a pretty incredible accomplishment. Like I said earlier in the conversation, it very much has to do with the players, right? I don't think that 30 years is some insurmountable challenge, but it's also just not going to be easy. I believe we do have a core, and that's one of the wonderful things about MMOs: we have a core of very passionate players who have been playing for a long time.</p>



<p>I think the path to 30 years lies there. That's one of the reasons we're moving to a seasonal model. Player feedback has always been a critical component of the development process, but we are now doubling down on that, and I think this is the best possible way to get to 30 years. That's not a roadmap but a perception of the mindset we're trying to impress: that we want to do right by the players.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> The players are changing, evolving, and growing, and we need to do the same. Players have said we have been a little formulaic, so we have done something different, and I think we've shown over the years that we are not afraid to make big changes and do crazy things sometimes, in order to make the game into what players are asking for. That's more of the mindset that we have right now.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that one of the big news this year in Elder Scrolls Online was the switch to a seasonal model. How is it going for you? What was the reaction of the fans compared to the Chapter model?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> It's hard because we're still in that transitional period. We knew it was going to be a little confusing because it takes a while to build the things we wanted to build, but overall, I think it's pretty cool and positive. I think players are starting to see some of the things that we talked about in the global reveal, which is that we want to iterate, change, experiment, and do different things.</p>



<p>We updated the new player experience, and we updated the returning player experience. We are doing the Writhing Wall; it was a completely new style of event for us. I think they're starting to see those things, and I think they're starting to understand and sort of gain that trust that, yeah, this might be the right way. Sure, there's some detractors right now, but I think as the year rolls on, as the next year comes in, they're going to start to see more and more of that. And I think it's going to start to make a lot more sense.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> I think it's a step in the right direction. Again, we're in a time of transition and change. That feedback is going to be critical. Part of the philosophy change is that it prevents us from getting locked into this extremely long development cycle, so we have more opportunities to try things to engage. I think this is very much a transitional year. By the next year, players are going to see more change and understand it better.</p>



<p><strong>You decided to focus more on system-driven updates maybe last year or a couple of years ago. Will that direction continue?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> I think so. One of the things that the focus on the systemic stuff does is it gives more opportunities for replayability, right? It's less one-shot, one-and-done type things, but a lot of that, too, is going to depend. If players love that stuff, we'll do more of it; if they say no, we want more of this stuff, we will try to do more of that stuff, and that's the whole point. As Nick said, building Chapters used to take us 18-ish months, so we were committed for 18 months and when players wanted some change, they had to wait until we finished that Chapter. In this new model, we have a number of smaller teams that are a little bit more agile and can go through and do things a little bit quicker.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Generally speaking, I agree with that, and we're trying to do more of that. We characterize it as systemic, but it's also just a more unified experience for our players. We have a lot of different teams with a lot of different ideas and we can bring everything together into something that is holistic and turns into a great experience for our players.</p>



<p><strong>More specifically, for example, will the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-devs-discuss-update-40s-endless-archive-infinite-dungeon-like-experience-and-its-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infinite Archive</a> still be expanded upon?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> We'll see, but we just added in the rerolling of Visions. That was a big piece of feedback there because players previously felt that it was too reliant on RNG, so now we have implemented a system that allows you to use the currency you earn while doing Infinite Archive to reroll those Visions to try to get the ones you're hunting for, and so far, it's been pretty well received.</p>



<p><strong>Another big system you added last year to Elder Scrolls Online was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-hands-on-with-scribing-plus-qa-with-rich-lambert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scribing</a>. Is that one of those you will be updating, maybe with new skills and/or modifiers?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> I think it's an avenue that we can go in. We did just give access to it to everybody, so now we've got a much wider pool of people to go in and explore the system and play with it. We'll see how that goes. If the players want us to keep working on Scribing, we'll do that; if they want us to do something else, again, we'll do something else.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> It's hard, and we're not ready to talk about specifics happening in 2026. But ESO has so many different types of players who engage in different systems, be it housing, Tribute, or PvP. That's always a balancing act since we have limited resources ourselves, and we try to apply those resources in the best way possible to provide something for all these different players. But the two specific examples you mentioned are absolutely on the table.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>I think it's a valid point of view that players are bringing up right now, feeling that in order to be competitive, they have to choose certain things. It's something that we've actually talked about quite a lot since the feature has been released and we have a lot of plans. It's too early to provide specifics, but this is something that we hear loud and clear from our community, and it's something we're going to try and address to make more builds viable for those who want to optimize.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>This year, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-subclassing-qa-power-level-will-go-up-some-but-were-fine-where-it-is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> multiclassing, or subclassing, to the game. I recently came back to Elder Scrolls Online after a period of not playing, and there's a lot of talk in the community about the Arcanist being a necessary part of the meta for DPS characters. Are you going to make any changes in that regard?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> We're looking at all of that stuff. The whole meta discussion is a very interesting and kind of detailed thought process. The meta is really what somebody says it is. Yes, it is one of the optimal ways. There's other ways to do it. But you also don't need to have that crazy level of optimization in order to do anything in the game. I get that players love to optimize everything. I do a lot of that too, as a player, right? I want to be as efficient as possible. I want to be as powerful as I can be. It's just this really interesting, nuanced discussion, but it is one of those things that we are looking at because we see that feedback, frankly. 'You have to be an Arcanist with Templar and Nightblade, that's the only way to play.'</p>



<p>It's not the only way to play. One of the things that I pride myself on as a player is like, what can I do that's off meta, that's different? I played a Stamina Templar before it was decent, right, and I was able to complete those things and do all the content in the game. But there are some outliers, things we're looking to change. This is probably the best way to say it. </p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Yeah, we're talking about it. Subclassing is a really new system, like Rich said, and it caused players to be very creative. I have been playing an elementalist build right now, which is a fantasy that I want for my main character, and it's really fun. It is fantastic. We're seeing some really cool combinations that the players are using, and it's fun and it provides a freedom for players to play the way they want, which is something that's very important to us. But absolutely, I think it's a valid point of view that players are bringing up right now, feeling that in order to be competitive, they have to choose certain things. It's something that we've actually talked about quite a lot since the feature has been released and we have a lot of plans. It's too early to provide specifics, but this is something that we hear loud and clear from our community, and it's something we're going to try and address to make more builds viable for those who want to optimize.</p>



<p><strong>Personally, I think subclassing is a great addition in general. With regular classes, in most builds, you didn't really use one of the class skill lines, so that wasn't very useful for the player. Subclassing opens up a lot more options, though there's is definitely some fine-tuning to do. But it is also understandable since it's a new system.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> The other thing that's really hard to communicate to the community as a whole is that we have to look at everything, all the data, all the things that players are doing and not just a small group. When you're making balance changes, it's not for the 0.1% of the player base, it's like, what is going to be the most effective use of our time, and improve the lives of as many players as possible when they're doing that stuff. That's where some of the nuance comes in. Maybe one group over here is saying do this thing, and another group is saying please don't do that. It's really hard to please everybody.</p>



<p><strong>Of course, everyone can choose to do whatever they want, stick with one class, or use subclassing in whatever combination available, but as a philosophy, in Elder Scrolls Online, to be competitive for PvE Trials, is it your vision that you have to subclass, or would you want players to be able to stay with just one class?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> You can stay with one class. Yes, you are more powerful when you multiclass. I think that's one of the things that we're looking at for a number of supplies, but like I said, there's nothing in the game that requires you to have that level of optimization.</p>



<p>Even for the no-death, speedrun, those kinds of things, you don't need to be that optimized. You need to be very coordinated. That's one of the reasons why we started doing the streamer Trials that we do with the communities, just to show that, yeah, you can put a ragtag team, a bunch of people together who may or may not be a little inebriated, and have fun in there and complete Veteran content.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Philosophically, we want as many builds to be as viable as possible, and for players to experience the fantasy they want and still be viable to do things. We think we can do better, and we're trying to do better. I'm sure you can imagine it's complicated and it's going to take time, but absolutely, that point of view is extremely valid. Nobody wants their build that they love to be not good compared to these others and feel like they're being penalized for not doing otherwise. Our goal is, like I said, to try to make as many builds as possible, as viable as possible. But that's going to take time; it's a lot easier said than done. </p>



<p><strong>Especially since there are a lot of new viable builds that you can do now with subclassing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> Exactly, there's billions of combinations.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>There were people that I had personally worked with on the Blackbird team for 10 years who are no longer with us. That hurts, frankly, that's a really meaningful thing. It's still raw, still emotional, but the team has rallied around and galvanized around Elder Scrolls Online.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A final question about what happened recently with the other ZeniMax Online Studios project. I don't know what you're able to say about that, but I gotta ask. Did anything change in the aftermath? From the outside, people think maybe you are more focused on Elder Scrolls Online now that you've been in a while.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> Obviously, there was a massive change, right? And it was a super emotional thing, and it was really difficult. There were people that I had personally worked with on the Blackbird team for 10 years who are no longer with us. That hurts, frankly, that's a really meaningful thing. But we do have a job to do. We do owe it to the community to continue, move forward and press on. So that's what we're doing, and we're focused on that, and that's kind of where Jo Burba came up with this idea of like, we want to support the game. This can be a 30-year MMO.</p>



<p>We are not shutting the doors and backing down and cutting, mothballing ESO to run it out; we're focused on moving ahead and forging ahead with the people we have left. We want to make ESO the best thing it can be, and that's the goal for all of us. Are things different? Well, yeah, of course, right? It's still raw, still emotional, but the team has rallied around and galvanized around Elder Scrolls Online.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Yeah, exactly. It's been hard and challenging. As Rich said, we lost friends. We're definitely looking to the future to try to make ESO as incredible as possible. This transition between Rich and me had been planned in advance, it just happened at this time, unfortunately. This year was already one of transition. We've been on this path, and we're continuing down it. We are as committed as ever to try to make Elder Scrolls Online as fun as we can.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Plenty of studios make horror videogames, but fewer are dedicated to only making horror games in the way that Bloober Team is. They've had a few stumbles along the way, but are clearly finding their stride after its stunning Silent Hill 2 Remake, and what appears to be another success with the coming Cronos: The New Dawn, which is also heading to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-september-5/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> alongside other current-gen consoles and PC.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">The Game Business</a>, Bloober Team's chief executive officer Piotr Babieno indicates that it was no mistake that the studio made the effort to put Cronos, its latest horror adventure, on the Nintendo Switch 2. Beyond the fact that it gets the game in front of players who might not have the option to grab Cronos: The New Dawn on other platforms, Babieno grew up a Nintendo fan, and wants to bring back an era where Nintendo was known for more than just the place to get child and family-friendly games.</p>



<p>"<em>I'm trying to make my personal dreams come true</em>. <em>I am a huge Nintendo fan. I grew up with Nintendo consoles. The most important horrors, like Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 4… were available on Nintendo GameCube. It was a gold time for Nintendo fans. In some ways, we would like to be the one to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now</em>," Babieno said. </p>



<p>"<em>We have some plans. We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team.</em>"</p>



<p>The Switch platform is not entirely devoid of horror games. Alien: Isolation is arguably one of the best horror games in the past two decades, and there's an excellent port of it available on the Switch. That said, the Switch isn't exactly brimming with horror games. Horror doesn't even come up as a genre filter when <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/games/#games-by-genre">browsing for games on the eShop</a>.</p>



<p>Babieno has a long way to achieve his personal dream, but it doesn't sound like he'll be giving up anytime soon. He's even looking to the Japanese company for inspiration on how to keep Bloober Team together through the tough times the video game industry is currently experiencing. </p>



<p>"<em>We didn’t cut any staff at Bloober Team for the last few years</em>.  <em>This is really important because I believe that if we have teams that are making great games and understand our DNA, it's much easier to create new projects. And I think that this is another parallel with Nintendo, because [it has] a similar spirit of how we are trying to do things.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It isn’t our goal to be the biggest player on the Polish stock exchange</em>," he added. "<em>Our goal is to be the best horror game developer.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-kamrui-mini-pc-16gb-ram-512gb-is-going-like-hotcakes-amazon-slashes-it-to-a-record-low.1283346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is going big for Labor Day and Back to School season, slashing prices on computers just as they are most in demand. This is the time of year when students purchase new items for school and professionals upgrade their rigs, so if there’s ever a time to shell out for a new system at a discount, it’s now.</p>
<p>And today, one of the hottest mini PCs on Amazon just hit a new record low: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">the Kamrui GK3Plus mini PC (16GB RAM 512GB M.2 SSD Mini Computers,12th Alder Lake N95), usually listed at $210, has dropped to $152</a>. That’s one of the steepest cuts we’ve seen on this compact powerhouse, and this is the kind of deal that won’t hang around long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved GPU and CPU</h2>
<p>The GK3Plus is a small but serious desktop replacement <strong>based on Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake N95 chip</strong>. Clocking up to 3.4GHz on 4 cores and 6MB of cache, it’s a clear performance step up from the N100 and other previous-gen chips. Benchmarks show that it’s about 35% faster on CPU workloads and nearly 80% better on GPU, so more responsive multitasking and better graphics for your everyday needs.</p>
<p>Filled with 16GB of DDR4 RAM, it can run a number of programs at once without slowing down. That’s especially handy if you live in dozens of browser windows or switch between Office, Zoom, and Photoshop. As for storage, it has a 512GB M.2 SSD which translates to speedy boot times and plenty of space for documents, apps, and media. And if down the line you realize that you’re in need of more storage space, you can expand up to 2TB using a second 2.5-inch drive.</p>
<p>
k</p>
<p>It is a mere 5.1 by 5.1 by 1.9 inches in diameter (small enough to fit in one hand) and can sit quietly on a desk without appropriating valuable real estate. You can even mount it on the back of a VESA-supported monitor and create your own all-in-one solution for an efficient workspace. For home use, you can place it under your TV and turn an ordinary display into a 4K streaming device that handles much more than most smart TVs can handle.</p>
<p>Graphics performance is provided by embedded UHD Graphics at 1.20GHz with 4K at 60Hz and three displays at once through dual HDMI and VGA support. That means sharp text, vibrant colors, and silky smooth play back whether you’re watching movies, working on multiple documents side by side, or gaming at a casual level. Having the ability to work with three screens at once is a huge productivity gain because it enables you to arrange tasks without window juggling.</p>
<p>At this bargain, Amazon’s stock could easily run out before the holiday rush is over.</p>

As we head toward the colder months, The Pokémon Company has launched something a little different from the usual spread of trainer boxes and tins: An advent calendar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon Company started releasing annual holiday calendars back in 2022, inspired by the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Countdown_Calendar_(TCG)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Countdown Calendar</a> from 2008.

<p>“I'm trying to make my personal dreams come true”</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ed5c383092fc/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>We were pleased to see Bloober Team pop up at last month's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> with the announcement that its upcoming sci-fi survival horror <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> will also be arriving on Switch 2 on <strong>5th September</strong>. It's nice to see a Nintendo system treated to the same scares as the other big players in the industry and, as it turns out, the developer has big plans to keep the relationship rolling in the future.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">The Game Business</a>, Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno said that he's a huge Nintendo fan, so bringing Cronos to Switch 2 is an attempt to make his "personal dreams come true". Citing the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_0">Resident Evil 0</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> ("the most important horrors," according to Babieno), the CEO referred to the GameCube's horror scene as a "gold time for Nintendo fans" — something he's keen to bring back.</p>
<p>"In some ways, we would like to be the one to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now," Babieno said of bringing horror games to Switch 2. "We have some plans," he teased, "We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team".</p>
<p>As the team behind last year's critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, this is an exciting prospect. Throw on top the solid previews so far of Cronos: The New Dawn, and our overall good time going hands-on with the Switch 2 version at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-cronos-the-new-dawn-on-switch-2">Gamescom</a>, and we're even more enthused by the mere prospect of more chills and thrills coming our way from the company.</p>
<p>But that's not to say any future Bloober Team plans would necessarily be 'more of the same'. Babieno hinted to The Game Business that the studio already has its eye on the strange mid-point between horror and cosy gaming that Nintendo has struck gold on in the past, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> being a stand-out example. "What Kono-san did with this title was pretty impressive," Babieno said of the ghost-busting GameCube launch title, "And I believe that there is a huge possibility to repeat such an idea in the future".</p>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ffefd508e8cef/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Could the future of Switch 2 horror be... this bright? — <em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A Bloober Team survival horror with Luigi's Mansion as a touchstone? Count us in! The CEO even drew a comparison between his studio and the Big N in terms of how the team is structured, particularly when it comes to avoiding layoffs for the greater good of the company's future projects (Bloober Team has been one of the few studios that <em>hasn't</em> seen staff cuts in recent years). “I believe that if we have teams that are making great games and understand our DNA, it's much easier to create new projects," Babieno said in the same interview. "I think that this is another parallel with Nintendo, because [it has] a similar spirit of how we are trying to do things".</p>
<p>We have just one week to go before Cronos: The New Dawn arrives on Switch 2. It's a game full of gruesome darkness, but let's hope that the future is as bright as Babieno imagines.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-team-unionizes-over-ai-remote-work-and-%E2%80%98passion-tax%E2%80%99-of-working-in-games.1283295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The team making <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680"><em>Diablo 4</em> and other entries</a> in Blizzard’s action-RPG franchise is the latest inside of Microsoft to unionize. Workers say the move is to help them negotiate fair terms around issues like like layoffs and remote work. “Passion can’t protect us from job instability,” software engineer Skye Hoefling said in a press release. “Our union allows us to focus on making magical experiences for our players instead of worrying about the unstable job industry.”</p> <p>The <em>Diablo</em> team, known within Blizzard as Team 3, joins the <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922"><em>Overwatch</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em> teams</a> in organizing with the Communications Workers of America (CMA). That national organization signed an agreement with Microsoft during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard that would keep the tech giant neutral on all internal union drives, erasing some of the barriers that usually stop workers from organizing.</p> <p>Microsoft has voluntarily recognized the <em>Diablo</em> developers’ union and they will now get in line to begin bargaining their first contract. Over 300 ZeniMax QA testers at the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">won their first contract earlier this summer</a>.</p>

 <h2>A “passion tax” for working in games</h2> <p>So what made the <em>Diablo</em> team want to jump on the union train within Blizzard? Part of it is the way companies use “getting to make games” as a kind of excuse to <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577">establish worse working conditions</a> than those often experienced by workers in competing roles in tech and entertainment. “My entire career as a developer has seen my peers and I paying the ‘passion tax’ for working in an industry that we love,” software engineer Nav Bhatti said in a press release. “At some point you have to choose between fight or flight, and forming a union is us doing just that — standing our ground in the industry.”</p> <p>Workers also laid out specific concerns around remote work flexibility, budget cuts, and the growing influence of AI in the development process. <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">Mass layoffs in early 2024</a> were one of the catalysts. A battle <a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-diablo-iv-world-warcraft-remote-work-delays-1850421033">over remote work</a> that began back in 2023 was another. A mandatory return-to-office policy forced people hired during the pandemic to relocate and limited which talent teams could hire. “There’s no real argument against remote work, except the control part, where now they know where you are and what you’re doing,” Blizzard producer Ryan Claudy <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs">told <em>Aftermath</em></a>.</p>

 <h2>AI creep is here</h2> <p>The sudden rise of AI, which Microsoft is placing $80 billion bets will completely reshape the modern economy, is also on the <em>Diablo</em> team’s mind. “[Generative AI] is starting to creep in a lot,” <em>Diablo 4</em> producer Kelly Yeo told <em>Aftermath</em>. “I can only speak for art, where in the visual development stage, if people don’t feel like they have concept art support, they’ll just toss things into Stable Diffusion or whatever and then do mood boards and stuff and give that to the teams to give them guidance.”</p> <p>She continued, “There is definitely a growing concern across most of the artists like ‘Is this going to replace us?’” Other game teams have already come under fire for AI art that makes it into the finished product. A <em>Call of Duty</em> associate director at Treyarch <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">recently told <em>IGN</em></a> that only work hand-crafted by the team is allowed into the game, but that AI slop sometimes gets through “accidentally.” And some developers at King <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use/">recently told <em>Mobilegamer</em></a> that Microsoft was pressuring them to incorporate AI into all aspects of their workflows.</p> <p>Despite notable unions forming at Sega of America and some overseas European game studios, most of the organizing in the U.S. so far has been confined to Microsoft-owned companies due to the neutrality agreement. Big publishers like <a href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-layoffs-2k-games-delay-2000618914">Take-Two</a>, which have undergone their own ruthless cost-cutting efforts in the past year, have so far remained impervious to workers organizing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">If annual mass layoffs continue</a>, that might change.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-surprise-demo-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-gets-surprise-demo-launches-tomorrow.1283292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Lost Soul Aside is getting a surprise demo just in time for launch. The upcoming RPG, set to release tomorrow, is one of PlayStation’s biggest titles of the year. While marketing has been quite silent, it looks like we now have more to go off of than before.</p>



<p>The story of Lost Soul Aside follows Kaser, an orphan who travels to different worlds and dimensions, alongside the mysterious Arena, to save his sister. The action-RPG looks like what you’d see in Final Fantasy, which is what creator Yang Bing was inspired off of. With many excited for the title, fans can get a taste of it come launch day.</p>



<h2 id="h-lost-soul-aside-free-demo-available-tomorrow">Lost Soul Aside Free Demo Available Tomorrow </h2>







<p>Launching alongside the full game of Lost Soul Aside will be <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/lost-soul-aside-demo-launches-august-29">a free demo</a>. In it, players will get to try out the game’s flashy combat. Only two bosses will be available to play (Rose Queen and Holy Knight Commander Victor), so it’s likely not a long demo. Even more so, save data from the demo does not carry over to the full game, so you’ll have to fight the two again. Still, it’s a good way to test the game out before purchasing if you haven’t pre-ordered.</p>



<p>The demo, currently, is only for PlayStation 5, so no word on if PC users will get the demo or not. As of publishing, there’s no mention of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo on Steam</a>. Select regions, such as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/HP9000-PPSA31743_00-0000000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Australia</a>, Japan, and New Zealand can download and play the demo right now. For others, the demo rolls out tomorrow, August 29th, though timing will likely vary depending on your region.</p>



<p>Having been in development for more than a decade, Lost Soul Aside has been through quite a lot. Starting as a one-man passion project by Yang Bing, the game was chosen by PlayStation to enter full development. Under the banner of UltiZero Games, the small team changed the Final Fantasy XV-inspired game to a new original IP we now know as Lost Soul Aside.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mega Hawlucha Soars Into Action In Pokémon Legends: Z-A]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mega-hawlucha-soars-into-action-in-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1283286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has announced the next Pokémon to get a Mega Evolution: Hawlucha. The highly anticipated title, set to release on October 16th, has been revealing more and more up to release. It was teased earlier this week that a new Pokémon would get a Mega Evolution. Finally, we now know which Pokémon it was, and it’s a fan-favorite.</p>



<p>The development of Pokémon Legends Z-A goes back at least a couple of years. It wasn’t until this year that we saw any gameplay, but, now, it won’t be long until we play it. Set in the Kalos region, featured in Pokémon X and Y, gameplay will be more real-time than the traditional turn-based combat. Still, many enjoyed it in Pokémon Legends: Arceus and, according to recent previews, it works quite well.</p>







<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pokemon Legends Z-A | Mega Hawlucha Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EuKTmyvwYSs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, shown above, we see Hawlucha take on a Machamp in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Towards the end of the trailer, the Hawlucha transforms into Mega Hawlucha and shows off some impressive moves. It’s a great spectacle, made even better by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iZ2dNEVQCw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another CG trailer</a> released alongside it. In that, we get a full-on wrestling match between the two Pokémon, which is fitting for them.</p>



<p>Hawlucha, first shown in 2013’s Pokémon X and Y, is a Fighting and Flying-type Pokémon. Inspired by Latin American wrestlers, it can perform the powerful Flying Press. Hawlucha has appeared in many other Pokémon titles like Sword and Shield, as well as Scarlet and Violet. Seeing the character’s popularity, it’s not surprising that many are delighted to see Mega Hawlucha enter the ring in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>

As it turns out, that was apparently by design, with Battlefield Studios saying the aim of the beta was to test the "fundamentals of gameplay," including movement, gunplay, and destruction. The new maps in upcoming Labs tests include Operation Firestorm--a remake of the popular Battlefield 3 map--and Mirak Valley. These are larger-scale maps featuring more vehicles and aircraft than what players saw in the open beta.</p><p>"We aim to validate gameplay balance on these new locations and compare it against previously tested maps," Battlefield Studios said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4558460-screenshot2025-08-28at1.17.04pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558460" data-ratio="0.56177156177156" data-width="858" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4558460-screenshot2025-08-28at1.17.04pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558460"></a><figcaption>A first look at Battlefield 6's big Mirak Valley map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4558460-screenshot2025-08-28at1.17.04pm.png"></figure><p>If you took part in a Labs test before the open beta, <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/1960037654759985489" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you're automatically in</a> for future tests.

<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b739dee15b50d/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last week or so, we here at Nintendo Life have been having a few spirited debates about when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> might <em>actually</em> launch. By all accounts, it's still scheduled for <strong>2025</strong>, but time's ticking by quickly, and we're still very much in the dark.</p>
<p>Frankly, after literal years of waiting, it feels good to finally talk about Prime 4's release date without feeling the need to plaster our faces with clown makeup (yeah, it's not just you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> fans). But here's the thing: Nintendo's schedule over the next few months is looking reasonably healthy, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</a> launching <em>today</em>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> following on <strong>16th October</strong>, and finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> on <strong>20th November</strong>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> is also due in Winter, but this rather broad window means it could potentially come out in January or February 2026.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, assuming Prime 4 doesn't get pushed into 2026 (which, by the way, is definitely possible and shouldn't be ruled out entirely), then logically, we're probably looking at either September or December. There are a couple of us here in 'Camp September' and believe that Nintendo has probably already built up enough hype for the game to pull off a quick and ferocious marketing campaign within just a few weeks.</p>
<p>The rest of us, however, are pretty convinced that we're looking at a potential launch in early December. Rumour has it that we're getting some sort of Nintendo Direct in September, so assuming we finally get a launch date during said presentation, it would afford Nintendo a good two months or so to really drive up interest around the game and launch it without anything else getting in the way.</p>
<p>Of course, it's also not out of the question that the game could launch in either October or November. Audiences for Pokémon and Kirby are quite different to that of Metroid, and while there would certainly be a bit of crossover, we're not sure it would necessarily be enough to negatively impact any of the games in question. Heck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</a> launched just one week after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, after all.</p>
<p>But we want to hear from you, dear readers. When do you think might be the most logical time for Metroid Prime 4 to finally launch? Could Nintendo pull off a release in September, or is December looking more likely? Or... <em>gulp</em>... could it be pushed into 2026?</p>
<p>Let us know your thoughts by voting in the polls below and leaving a comment.</p>

			<p>Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive have announced the Year 2 roadmap for Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, which will include the addition of a new playable class, new game modes, new operations, and more.</p>



<p>A trailer debuted today goes over everything to expect for the second year of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 updates, that'll kick off next week on September 4, 2025, which is days ahead of the one-year anniversary of Space Marine 2's launch.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new additions to gameplay, including the new modes, the new playable class, the Techmarine, and the new operations, additional weapons, enemies, and bosses, will all be added as part of free updates that will arrive throughout Saber's Year 2 plans for Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>There will also be a bevy of additional paid cosmetic content that will be delivered through the season pass for year 2, but of course cosmetics are always an optional bonus. You won't be missing out on any additional playable content if you skip out on the season pass. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 Year 2 Roadmap. Image credit: Focus Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>This past June, Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment celebrated Space Marine 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/">surpassing 7 million copies sold</a> in the game's first year, and while it's clear from this roadmap that Saber is still hard at work on keeping Space Marine 2 updated, the studio has already confirmed that work has begun on<a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/"> Space Marine 3</a>.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Wccftech reviewed Space Marine 2 last year</a>, we enjoyed it, even if the gameplay fell into a rut after some time with it. "<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a decent game, but one that becomes repetitive quite quickly, though fans of this sort of action combat could find it enjoyable.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>My favorite moment in the nearly 100 hours I’ve spent with <i>Hitman World of Assassination</i> arrived right around the 80-hour mark. I had been on a terrible streak in Freelancer, the game’s roguelike mode. Sloppy in my stealth and assassination skills, I’d taken out my target, but was seen doing it–and I still needed to extract. Freelancer mode sometimes requires messiness, a willingness to just get the job done by any means necessary. That’s hard for someone prone to perfectionism such as myself. And I had been <i>too</i> messy this time. Now the guards are after me, popping off shots as I race down the corridors of a fancy hotel in Thailand. I duck into an empty bedroom to hide. The doors burst open; the guards have followed me. I move around the corner, just out of sight.</p> <p>A lone guard wanders into the room, my gun’s sights following his head as he moves. If he sees me, I’ll need to pull the trigger with haste and precision. There’s obviously no bullet-time mechanic in <i>Hitman</i>, but the rush of adrenaline, of needing to stay alive so as to not ruin my streak of successful kills and keep the excellent equipment I’ve found on this run, make every second feel like an eternity. My gun continues to trace this guard’s head. I realize that if I pull the trigger, I’ll also need to contend with the three guards in the adjacent room. I imagine what that will look like. Several contingency plans run through my head as I consider the myriad ways I can escape this situation, and just how ugly things might get if I need to do so with guns blazing.</p> <p>The guard leaves the room. They didn’t see me. I see the rest of the guards leave my immediate area on the map and breathe a sigh of relief. I have time now to wait for the alarms to go quiet. But my disguise as a hotel worker has been compromised. I sneak into the adjacent room and grab the one guard who has yet to leave, knock him out, and steal his clothes. I tuck his body out of sight and mosey onto the extraction point as I watch folks drag some of the poor bastards who got in my way out in body bags. I extract. There were a million ways this all could’ve gone down, but on this particular run, this was the story that the various elements of the emergent sandbox that is <i>Hitman</i> told. I return to my residence, load up another job and prepare as best I can, though I have no idea how the next one will turn out.</p>

 <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000620993" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620993"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620993">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Hitman World of Assassination </i>is an epic package of three single-player campaigns, a variety of challenges both developer- and user-made strewn across several maps in its Contracts mode, and a riveting roguelike experience called Freelancer that aims to simulate the ultimate fantasy of assuming the role of the world’s most deadly assassin, with the worst members of society right in his crosshairs.</p> <p>The <i>WoA</i> update followed the release of 2021’s <i>Hitman 3</i>. The three recent and excellent campaigns from 2016 onwards are well-preserved, improved even, with tweaks made to the gameplay formula over the years. It makes for an excellent source of nearly endless stealth challenges using <i>Hitman</i>’s elegantly violent interplay of sneaking, subterfuge, stalking, stabbing, suffocating, and shooting. The violence sometimes takes on a comical role (one mission had me throwing butcher knives into the skulls of guards while wearing a friggin’ rabbit mask), but aside from some gentle sci-fi elements, the fiction is grounded in a dark reality that mirrors our own. It’s a world of brutal corporate powers, state actors with ill intentions, and secret societies aiming to construct a global order that secures the places of the rich and powerful while leaving the rest of us to be ignored or, in some cases, much worse. Agent 47 finds himself, along with his handler Diana, in a position to deal back some justice. A single assassination won’t itself change the world, but a continued pattern that strikes fear into the hearts of those who otherwise would never know it? Delivering that is your role as this mysterious, red-tye-wearing man with a barcode tattoo on the back of his head.</p>

 <h2>Deadly wetwork</h2> <p><i>Hitman</i>’s stealth is incredibly satisfying, though its mechanics are slightly less sophisticated than what you’d find in something like <i>Splinter Cell</i> or <i>Metal Gear Solid V</i>. Your footsteps, for example, won’t give you away nearly as much as they would for a Sam Fisher. But much as I enjoy the challenge of a more realistic stealth sim, realism is not always a prerequisite for a good time. (<i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, after all, didn’t have enemies hearing your footsteps until <i>Snake Eater.</i>) Besides, <i>Hitman</i> itself isn’t short on the challenge of remaining unseen, or, in Agent 47’s case, only being seen while wearing someone else’s clothes. The game otherwise contains many stealth trappings you’ve seen in other games: lockers and boxes to hide in, tall grass to duck under, the chore of hiding unconscious or dead bodies. In my 100 or so hours with the game, resources like tall grass don’t feel as easy to exploit as they do in, say, an <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> or <i>Horizon</i> game, but there’s still a familiar pattern here with their inclusion.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000620994" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620994"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620994">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I dove into <i>World of Assassination</i> by starting with the campaigns, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-hitman-experiment-has-been-a-success-1786352218"><i>Hitman </i>(2016)</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-2-the-kotaku-review-1830317433"><i>Hitman 2</i></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-3-the-kotaku-review-1846083354"><i>Hitman 3</i></a>.<i> Hitman</i>’s campaigns can make for a solid introduction, but the story-based mission structure can detract from the more-unscripted, stealth sandbox that beats at the heart of this game. On normal difficulties, each mission will prompt you with a suggestion to follow a narrative thread that, while often containing some very well-written and amusing story material, can feel a little on rails. These scenarios, often, rely on you changing outfits to disguise yourself, so you’re not so much sneaking around corners as you are committing a serious case of identity theft. Furthermore, when in an alerted state, Agent 47 can die rather quickly, so straying from that path can feel intimidating. The narrative moments are often well written and amusing, so it’s a good time, just not the kind of shadowy wetwork I tend to gravitate to.</p>

 <p>It can be hard to get out of a bad situation. <i>Hitman</i>’s environments, typically, are well populated, often packed with civilians who are quick to run to a guard if they catch you doing something weird, or even if they spot you walking around with a butcher knife. The places you’re infiltrating are unassuming locations for the most part: a dance club, an upscale hospital, a fashion show. And you always have a target, typically one who has a nefarious agenda. Even the game’s roguelike Freelancer mode, which reuses maps from the story-based campaigns, gives you targets who follow a routine. And the more challenging missions of that mode require you to pick your target out of a group of wandering suspects, looking for tells based on intel you’re given at the start. So your job involves more than just getting into some well-guarded area without drawing attention to yourself; you also need to find the right opportunity to take action after studying the behavior of your targets and determining the most efficient, or most hilarious, means of killing them. You’re going to need to adhere to some kind of structure for yourself, a routine of how you engage with enemies, how you manage your inventory, how you enter and leave rooms, and when you choose to open fire as opposed to running away. Improvisation is often only as good as the discipline you practice leading up to moments of uncertainty.</p> <p>That, to me, is key to what makes <i>Hitman</i> and many other stealth games work: It’s the joy of adhering to form, of approaching situations cautiously, with awareness, so that you’re prepared to respond to anything with a degree of competency and strategy, always aiming to get the situation under your control as opposed to just reacting to incoming action like you typically do in a standard shooter. Sure, <i>Hitman</i>’s gunplay is smooth enough that you can get into some <i>John Wick</i>-esque situations, but you’re bordering on a fail state when you do (though it’s also extremely easy to line up shots if you can force guards into a choke point where they can’t easily flank you).</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000620995" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620995"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620995">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Always having that central objective, your target(s), helps direct the stealth gameplay into something meaningful. You’re not just sneaking for the thrill of breaking into some place you’re not supposed to be: You have a purpose, and that purpose isn’t a static thing that will never move. Playing <i>Hitman</i> well is about juggling time management, staying hidden, staying <i>focused</i>, and having a willingness to exploit an opportunity that you may not have expected.</p> <p>And while the main campaigns are satisfying (though I found the nuances of the plot a little hard to follow, especially during <i>Hitman 2</i>), its roguelike mode, Freelancer, is where I’ve spent the majority of my time and will continue to do so. It’s a wildly compulsive forever-game that I still struggle to put down, even after hitting a three-digit hour count.</p>

 <p>That said, there are some pain points worth mentioning. To start, Agent 47 is <i>slow</i>. His “sprint” is a jog at best and it feels a little strange sometimes that you can’t just book it to the exit when you’re under fire. Having a faster sprint might really interrupt the flow of the game, so I get not having it, but it still feels off. There’s also a weird issue where if you grab an enemy while climbing the stairs, even if you’re directly behind them, you’ll almost always get spotted by them and thus ruin a Silent Assassin run. Also, needing to use a thrown object to make noise and distract an enemy feels silly, as if Agent 47 couldn’t whistle or knock on a wall. And lastly, you’ll probably make a ton of use of Agent 47’s see-through-walls “Instinct.” Not only am I <i>not</i> a fan of this feature in modern stealth games as I feel it removes a huge part of the challenge of keeping track of your enemies, but it also coats the screen in a dull gray tone that isn’t pleasant to look at. For a feature that gets used so much, it could’ve used something with a bit of a cooler color. Make it blue and a little shimmery or something, I dunno. Anything but the monotone gray.</p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Hitman World of Assassination           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Because Mario ain't gonna get it done!"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>IO Interactive</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Third-person stealth action game.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Endless variety of stealth challenges, engaging risk/reward experience in Freelancer.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>Reliance on "Instinct" view mode, sandbox can sometimes be unpredictable.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>January 2023: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs (played)  June 2025: Switch 2  August 2025: iOS (in episodic form)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>100 hours through the three campaigns, Freelancer, and other challenges.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p>To be fair, some of these omissions, such as sprinting fast or wall–knocking, would make for a very different game if they were present. Not being able to knock on walls or whistle, as you can in other stealth games, means you need to interact with the game’s item sandbox more. And not being able to run means there’s no get-out-of-jail-free card if you screw up. It makes sense when you consider these omissions as intentional parts of the game’s design, but when three guards are hot on your heels popping off shots, it’s hard not to think, “Why the hell can’t I run?” Oh, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-old-country-swimming-open-world-baldurs-gate-2000616867">you also can’t swim, but that’s okay</a>.</p>

 <h2>The joys of the Freelance lifestyle</h2> <p>Like most roguelikes, or extraction shooters for that matter, <i>Hitman</i>’s Freelancer mode tasks you with heading into hostile territory to get a job done <i>and</i> come out alive. Fail your mission and you lose all the sweet gear you have on you. And <i>Hitman</i> isn’t short on sweet gear.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000620997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620997"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620997">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The overall flow works like this: You’ll choose from a list of potential crime syndicates to go after. Each has a bit of fictional dressing on the side that isn’t explored much beyond an initial description that you’re going after human traffickers or organ harvesters. There’s an undeniable Batman quality to the work you’re doing, and after some successful missions, your handler will remark that your actions will make others “think twice before turning to a life of crime.”</p>

 <p>But Agent 47 isn’t Batman and isn’t content to just beat up his targets. No, he kills them. And each syndicate has a series of challenges to take on for each kill. These can range from things like only killing targets or only using silenced weapons to earning the Silent Assassin status for never being seen during your run, and more. Some challenges, like using explosives, shotguns, or other loud things, toss stealth out the window in favor of something a bit more daring. I tend not to do these as much since I prefer a stealthier playstyle, but <i>Hitman</i> can be a surprisingly fun run-and-gun game as well, albeit one that usually exists in short bursts as either you or your enemies are likely to go down pretty quickly. You can also stack some prestige challenges on top, which will ask you to use specific weaponry, never change your suit, or kill a target in a specific way.</p> <p>Sometimes these tasks step on each other. For example, asking me to get a melee kill but then also asking that I only get headshots on my enemies doesn’t exactly work. Each challenge grants money you can spend to purchase better gear, so it’s a bummer when you fail one, but sometimes you have to fail it if it means getting out alive and not losing your progress. That risk of losing progress by failing the mission, which will see you lose all the gear you have on you, means that you’ll need to be prepared to abandon a challenge if it’s asking too much. That risk and reward, combined with the scarcity of the weapons makes each gun you earn feel valuable, and it plays a significant role in how you prepare for each mission.</p>

 <p>A silenced sniper rifle, or even a silenced pistol, for example, is an incredibly useful tool. But maybe you know a certain level so well that, when a mission takes you there, you can leave those good weapons at your hideout for when you really need them on a more challenging assignment. Maybe it’s wise to save them for the more intense “showdowns,” where you have to spend more time studying the suspects to determine if they’re the target.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000620998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620998"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620998">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While the behavior of your standard targets in Freelance mode follows the flow of a <i>Hitman</i> level as it typically pans out, “showdown” missions lead up to a–you guessed it–showdown with a syndicate leader, who will be one of a few different suspects. You’ll learn what they’re wearing, what they’re likely to do during their mission, and what tells will give them away, such as whether they’re prone to allergies, like to smoke, or tend to pace nervously. It’s a fun game of cat and mouse in which you have to figure out who amongst the crowd is your mouse.</p>

 <p>Overall, the endless nature of this roguelike mode, packed with its healthy number of maps and a seemingly limitless way they can be used with different targets, weapons, and items, keeps the environments you’ll play over and over again feeling fresh. And the thrill of maintaining momentum on a run, especially as you increase your arsenal, makes for a rewarding game loop that can trap you for hours.</p> <hr> <p>As a veteran of many stealth games, <i>Hitman</i>’s endlessly unpredictable roguelike mode is what appeals to me the most. It’s an experience I can’t easily replicate elsewhere. But there are other challenges that are definitely worth exploring in the <i>World of Assassination</i> package as well, especially as they’ll help you better learn maps and strategies for staying unseen.</p>

 <p>Arcade mode, for example, sees you taking on “Elusive Targets,” who, upon failure, can’t be pursued again for several real-world hours. Many of them are only available during certain times as well. These targets might also have specific ways they’ll need to be killed or their levels may come with unique constraints. Contracts mode features both preset and user-made contracts from any of the game’s many levels, often with optional challenges such as the need to use a sniper rifle or explosive device, or to execute someone while wearing a specific disguise.</p>

 <p>I haven’t spent nearly as much time on these modes, but they can serve as helpful ways to practice very specific ways of playing, which will teach you skills and techniques that’ll come in handy across any of the game’s modes.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000620999" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620999"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620999">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Hitman World of Assassination</i> offers up an exquisite buffet-style set of amusing and challenging stealth challenges with such an abundance as to be virtually endless. The moment-to-moment stealth gameplay is as challenging as it is rewarding. Agent 47 may feel a little stiffer and slower than someone like Venom Snake from <i>MGSV</i>, but once you get used to the pacing of <i>Hitman</i>, it reveals itself as an engaging stealth game that invites mastery over its interlocking and sometimes unpredictable systems. Time spent in this game is about getting better at the game itself, not just unlocking and collecting cool suits. Whether emerging victorious or suffering defeat, playing the role of Agent 47 is a thrilling and challenging experience that can last for countless hours.</p>

<p>Another major union is forming in the video game space as over 450 developers of Blizzard’s Diablo franchise have voted to unionize. </p>



<p>The Communication Workers of America (CWA) has announced that the developers will be a member of one of three available unions—CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, Calif.; CWA Local 1118 in Albany, N.Y.; and CWA Local 6215 in Austin, Texas. The employees joining include developers, artists, engineers, designers and support staffs.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/hundreds-diablo-game-developers-join-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to the CWA,</a> the new union is <strong>“one of the largest wall-to-wall unions at a Microsoft-owned studio.”</strong> It also comes just weeks after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-story-and-franchise-developers-vote-to-unionize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development teams</a> voted to unionize.</p>



<p><strong>“I grew up playing Diablo, and I feel lucky that I get to work at Blizzard on a game that’s very special to me and the gaming community,”</strong>&nbsp;Diablo software engineer Skye Hoefling said.&nbsp;<strong>“But passion can’t protect us from job instability. Our union allows us to focus on making magical experiences for our players instead of worrying about the unstable job industry.”</strong></p>



<p>Designer Ryan Littleton added that the last round of Microsoft layoffs had him more determined to make sure employees are taken care of.</p>



<p><strong>“[None] of us should have to live with that constant worry that we might be let go at the drop of a hat,”</strong> he said. <strong>“A union allows us to organize across the industry to make great games and protect the developers who create them from the constant pressures of layoffs, passion tax, and crunch.”</strong></p>



<p>CWA says Microsoft has recognized the union’s formation. Since July 2024, CWA says that over 3,500 Microsoft employees have unionized with the group.</p>
