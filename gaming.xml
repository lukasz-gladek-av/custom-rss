            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new patch for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, and judging by the wording in the official patch notes, this looks to be the game's final major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>website, EA says it was "so happy with the game's stability at launch" and that the game is now "in a stable place". As such, the development team is now "moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs", which rather sounds like there won't be any more significant content updates.</p>

<p>This patch isn't exactly massive, either; it doesn't add any new quests or content, but brings more quality-of-life changes, like recommended levels being added for lower-level quests and a number of bug fixes as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5-emmrich.jpg?itok=oKL7F_el 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5-emmrich.jpg?itok=x98jW0H- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>doesn't look to be getting any more big updates after its latest patch.</figcaption></figure><p>I'm speculating a little here, but it also sounds a bit like&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any major expansions like previous&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games did, so if you're expecting&nbsp;this game's version of <i>Awakening&nbsp;</i>or even DLC packs like&nbsp;<em>Trespasser</em>, you might want to save your disappointment now.</p>

<p>While the wording of the post seems to suggest EA and BioWare want to put a positive spin on ending updates for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, the fact remains that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">sold disappointingly</a> for the company, coming in at around half of EA's expectations for the quarter in which it released.</p>

<p>Along with&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>,&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s underperformance caused EA to adjust its financial expectations for the 2024-25 fiscal year, which in turn led to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/ea-shares-plunge-19percent-on-track-for-worst-day-since-dot-com-bubble.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">drop</a> in the company's stock value of almost 20%. Yeowch.</p>




<p>It's also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">departed BioWare recently</a>, and while her departure isn't necessarily related to the game's underperformance, the timing of the two announcements seems a touch too coincidental for them not to be connected.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-age-the-veilguard/bsdx4fnnc0dk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Patch 5 is out now.

<p>The director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows has revealed that the game was delayed a second time due to ‘polishing’ and ‘complex roofs.’</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is finally set to arrive on March 20, 2025, and now we know why the game was delayed a second time. During a conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-says-recent-delay-was-to-polish-parkour-especially-on-super-complex-roofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Charles Benoit, AC Shadows’ Game Director, revealed that the month-long delay was “mostly about polishing,” “a couple of things in progression” to make the game more engaging and balanced, and Japan’s “super complex” roofs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game director explained that Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ roofs and other Japanese architecture might be the “most complex thing” he has worked on compared to AC Odyssey and Syndicate. The developers had to work on “specific codes and specific animations” to make the parkour transition for these areas more fluid. The roofs and parkour around Japanese Architecture were feedback they wanted to address, and they believe that they have “improved since the last few months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was initially scheduled to be released in November 2024, but two delays pushed the release to February 2025 and the second to March 2025. Players hope this month-long extension will end up being the final obstacle in the game’s release. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-sniper-elite-games-in-release-order-release-dates/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve crafted a comprehensive list of every Sniper Elite game, their release dates, and a little bit about why they’re so significant. The series isn’t lauded like other third-person shooter contemporaries, but it deserves acclaim. 2025 brings the latest sequel, so let’s give Sniper Elite its dues after 20 years of World War warfare.</p>



<p>Sniper Elite’s niche combat mechanics and sometimes punishing difficulty make it unique. This is a good thing in a market saturated and overpopulated with hero shooters (look what happened to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a>) and FPS gameplay. Missions usually take around an hour or so, with your mileage varying based on how thorough you are and how often you give away your position—causing half of Germany to rain down its wrath on you.</p>



<p>The scenery has changed from time to time, as has reality and the aliveness of the inhabitants. But Sniper Elite constantly retains its identity, and it’s been a hell of a journey so far, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> being the latest target in our sights.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-sniper-elite-games-are-there">How Many Sniper Elite Games Are There?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 10 mainline Sniper Elite games with two mini-Zombie Army expansions.</strong></p>



<p>The franchise has ebbed and flowed throughout history from the first <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. We’ve had VR and Zombie games, explored tropical climates, and even more Zombies games. Nazi Zombie Army and Nazi Zombie Army 2 are not considered full releases and joined Zombie Army Trilogy anyway.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-sniper-elite-game-in-order">Every Sniper Elite Game In Order</h2>

<figure><figcaption>The beginning of something beautiful. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>It all started with 2005’s Sniper Elite. Rebellion tried something new, and it was a different take on other war shooters like Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Medal of Honor. It’s very primitive compared to its successors and a product of its time, but we’ll always be thankful it was made.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-v2-released-on-may-2-2012">Sniper Elite V2 — Released on May 2, 2012</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’re back again. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sniper Elite sequels became more frequent as time went on, but it wasn’t always the case. Rebellion was dipping its toes in several properties, so it took <strong>seven years before Sniper Elite V2 saw the light of day</strong>. The title’s clever wordplay aside, the now-famous X-Ray bullet feature played a prominent role in the sequel’s gameplay and marketing, and the series was starting to hot up.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-3-released-on-june-27-2014">Sniper Elite 3 — Released on June 27, 2014</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Boy, sure is a hot one today. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sniper Elite 3 only needed two years, not seven. However, we get a big change of location here as we venture into North Africa’s sizzling scorch. The third game proved to be <strong>my entry point</strong>, and its inconsistent AI and focus on gameplay rather than character development and story are complaints I still have with sequels to this day. However, Sniper Elite had a market, and as a result, more games were commissioned.</p>



<h3 id="h-zombie-army-trilogy-released-on-mar-6-2015">Zombie Army Trilogy — Released on Mar. 6, 2015</h3>

<p>Zombie Army Trilogy arrived a few months later to revamp the formula. I reviewed this elsewhere in my early writing days, and it was an effort to capitalize on the growing Zombie game trend. It packaged all three Zombie Army games in a more linear and narrow-sighted effort. Repetition does creep in as you progress, but it was a welcome change to the Sniper Elite name.</p>

<p>The Zombies are asleep for now as Sniper Elite 4 brings back the classic sandbox-based gameplay from the dead. The fourth mainline entry is the best-received release to this point from a critical standpoint, with reviewers enjoying the improved AI and enhancement of X-Ray kills. It sold well, meaning Sniper Elite 5 was an absolute given to be the next game.</p>

<p>Had you for a moment, didn’t I? Zombie Army 4: Dead War comes next and adds many new ideas compared to Trilogy. New enemy types look to mutilate you (see the image above) and you gain ways to combat demons. We’ll see if <strong>Rebellion ever does another Zombie spin-off</strong>, and if not, Zombie Army 4 is a fine auf Wiedersehen. </p>

<p>It’s time for another Sniper Elite first with VR! Rebellion understands trends, and 2021 had the PSVR headset in full flow with competing headsets. When it comes to VR, how do you make the thrill of looking down the lens of a Sniper Rifle more immersive? The short and sweet affair wouldn’t be the last in the virtual space.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-5-kraken-awakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite 5</a> represents the series’ next-gen bow. The graphics are noticeably sharper (as is Karl’s aim) and the content hits harder in all the right places. Yes, I sound like a broken record, but the gameplay feels consistent and fun. I had a great time, but it feels like some key improvements are needed to elevate the franchise. SE5 is a great starting point for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S era, and Rebellion has used the hardware well.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-vr-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Winter Warrior</a> arrived two years later, featuring a limited release schedule on Meta Quest devices. It’s the first time a SE title has embraced snow. Like the Zombies spin-offs, we’ll have to see if Rebellion goes cold with future Sniper Elite VR titles.</p>

<figure><figcaption>And here we are. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p>And now we’ve come full circle to Sniper Elite Resistance. The sequel is a spin-off of sorts of the fifth main game, putting us in the shoes of Harry Hawker. Whatever happens, the Sniper Elite legacy is established at this point. Millions of copies have been sold, countless fans are vying for new releases, and as long as Rebellion is about, a Sniper Rifle won’t be too far away.</p>

<p>BioWare seems to be moving on from Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Just three months after its release in October, BioWare has released a new update for the game featuring a number of bug fixes. While that’s not out of the ordinary, it’s what the post on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a> says that suggests EA and BioWare are done with the game.</p>



<p>“Thank you all for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard; we were so happy with the game’s stability&nbsp;at launch and hope you have enjoyed our Quality of Life patches since then,” the post reads. “With the game being in a stable place, we are moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs should those occur. Dareth shiral!”</p>



<p>“Dareth shiral”, for those unaware, translates to “farewell” in the game’s language.</p>



<p>The idea that BioWare and EA are moving on from the game shouldn’t come as a surprise. Recently, EA confirmed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">missed its internal expectations</a> by nearly 50% with roughly 1.5 million players during the three months after the game’s release.</p>



<p>You can check out the full notes for the latest Dragon Age: The Veilguard update below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p-threatens-legal-action-against-stalking-mod<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In early 2025, a Final Fantasy 14 mod sparked "stalking" fears amid <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-14-communities-panic-as-it-turns-out-change-to-blacklisting-meant-to-help-reduce-stalking-also-lets-players-use-mods-to-track-their-alts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports</u></a> it was able to scrape hidden player data, including details like character information, retainer information, any alternate characters linked to a Square Enix account, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mod, named “Playerscope,” allows users to track specific player data of anyone in the vicinity of the person using it. This information is then sent to a centralized database managed by the mod author (no matter if you are looking at a specific player, or just happen to be around other players), and tracks information that players would usually not be permitted to see via in-game tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, the mod offers information on “Content ID” and “Account ID,” which can be used to track players across characters. This was done by manipulating the Content ID system introduced in the Dawntrail expansion, which in turn let players blacklist others across their service account and multiple characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only way to prevent your account data being scraped by the tool is to join the private Discord channel for Playerscope and opt out. Theoretically, every single Final Fantasy 14 player who is not in the Discord channel is having their data scraped. Obviously this is a significant privacy risk, and the community has been vocal in its response: “the purpose is obvious, to stalk people” one commenter noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shuggler123/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on Reddit</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several weeks ago the mod author posted on Discord that the plugin was found on Github, which led to an explosion in popularity. Due to terms of service violations, Playerscope has now <a href="https://github.com/sicakbirtebessum/PlayerScope/tree/master/PlayerScope" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>been removed from Github</u></a>, but it was allegedly mirrored on similar websites Gittea and Gitflic. IGN has verified that a Playerscope repository no longer exists on either alternative platform. Theoretically, the mod could also still be circulating in private communities.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/gettyimages-1232398922-1737727396150.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Final Fantasy 14 producer and director Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida. Photo by Olly Curtis/Future Publishing via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 14 producer and director Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida has now issued a statement on <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/515102" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Final Fantasy 14’s official forum</u></a> regarding third-party mods, clearly referencing the emergence of Playerscope. The statement reads:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have confirmed that there exist third-party tools that are being used to check Final Fantasy 14 character information that is not displayed during normal game play. The tool is being used to display a segment of an Final Fantasy 14 character's internal account ID, which is then used in an attempt to further correlate information on other characters on the same Final Fantasy 14 service account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Development and Operations teams are aware of the situation and the concerns being raised by the community and are discussing the following options:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Requesting that the tool in question be removed and deleted.</li><li>Pursuing legal action.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">"Aside from character information that can be checked in-game and on the Lodestone, we have received concerns that personal information registered on a user’s Square Enix account, such as address and payment information, could also be exposed with this tool. Please rest assured that it is not possible to access this information using these third-party tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools. We also ask that players do not share information about third-party tools such as details about their installation methods, or take any other actions to assist in their dissemination.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The use of third-party tools is prohibited by the Final Fantasy 14 User Agreement and their usage could threaten the safety of players. We will continue to take a firm stance against their usage."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the use of third-party tools is prohibited in Final Fantasy 14, the likes of Advanced Combat Tracker is regularly used by the game's raiding community and cross-referenced using websites like <a href="https://www.fflogs.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FFlogs</u></a>. Yoshida's legal threat, however, is a significant step up in rhetoric. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The FF14 community responds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy 14 community has responded to Yoshida’s statement in damning fashion. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1i8rn8v/comment/m8vv5ch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: “fixing the game to break the mod isn’t on the list of options they’re considering I see.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1i8rn8v/comment/m8w9nnq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>: “or you could just see how not to expose the information on [the player’s] client side. Ofc this means extra work which they did not plan for, but is Final Fantasy 14 really on such a tight schedule and budget they can't deal with these things properly?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Kind of a disappointing statement that really fails to acknowledge the root cause of the problem,"  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1i8rn8v/yoship_forum_post_regarding_external_tools_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another person said</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The author of Playerscope has yet to respond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Olly Curtis/Future Publishing via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1’s big Conan the Barbarian update launched this week and with it came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-secret-floyd-fight-isnt-just-a-cool-easter-egg-it-unlocks-a-brand-new-stage">the arrival of a secret fight with Floyd</a>, the pink ninja developer Ed Boon had been teasing for years. Not only that, but if you defeat Floyd you unlock cool exclusive rewards, including a coveted new stage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how exactly do you trigger the secret Floyd fight? Players are working together to try to crowdsource the answer. This community effort, led by Mortal Kombat modder and dataminer <a href="https://x.com/thethiny" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thethiny</a>, has done much to unravel the mystery, but the exact process remains unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s what fans have worked out: a number of Floyd challenges must be completed before the fight with Floyd triggers. How many, no-one knows. Which challenges must be completed, and in which order? No-one knows that either. Worse, it appears different for each player. That’s not much help, is it?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What is helping is thethiny’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh5hLG2oi85zvyFvLkl4cCNViDRHX83y-Qn1LdlGozg/htmlview#" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Doc</a> that lists the various challenges players have discovered and the requirements for each. When you’ve completed a challenge the Floyd icon will pop up on the left of the screen and you’ll hear a guitar riff. Requirements include taunting four times in a match, winning without jumping, and winning using sweeps only. Some of these challenges can be completed using any character, some with certain characters only. 37 Floyd clues have been discovered so far. Maybe there are more!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears to be the case that you do not have to complete all 37 Floyd challenges to fight Floyd. It also appears to be the case that players have different “active” challenges, so there isn’t a single process fans can rely upon. It's all a bit confusing, but the best advice right now is to do as many of these challenges as you can, and eventually, hopefully, you'll fight Floyd.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Occasionally, Floyd himself will appear at the start of the match to give you a clue (klue?) to one of your active challenges. Thethiny's data suggests it can take hundreds of ladder matches to get one of these clues from Floyd to pop up. Players are working through all this right now, and some are spending a lot of time doing so. Some are trying to increase their chances by restarting matches, but that comes with the risk of missing the Floyd clue because they only appear at the end of the match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is clear is that the Floyd fight has breathed new life into Mortal Kombat 1. The new stage, the field seen in Mortal Kombat 1’s announcement trailer, is gorgeous, so the reward for all this effort is a good one. And Floyd himself is sparking a deeper dive as modders try to work out the details of his moveset and which characters from the Mortal Kombat games have inspired it. It’s just a whole lot of fun to be a part of and watch unfold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc">we’ve got the T-1000 guest character to look forward to</a>, and potentially more DLC to come, although NetherRealm has yet to confirm that. Hopefully whatever happens, the developer will throw in more secret fights over time, perhaps with Mortal Kombat’s iconic Pit stage as a reward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Fans apparently took this to mean the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director was officially chiming in on a longstanding discussion about the game's love triangle between Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa. But now Hamaguchi is saying that isn't the case at all.</p><p dir="ltr">"Again, I would like to convey to the fans that the characters’ relationships are portrayed through content," Hamaguchi told Automaton.

                <p dir="ltr">Over four years after its undeniably rocky launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s recent Steam reviews have reached the coveted "overwhelmingly positive" rating.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow ">Steam's user-review data</a>, 95% of the 12,818 reviews written by users over the past 30 days were positive. (Cyberpunk 2077's overall score--the average of all 716,126 of its reviews--is still sitting at "very positive.")</p><p dir="ltr">When Cyberpunk 2077 launched back in 2020, it was in pretty rough shape. So rough, in fact, that it led to developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-rough-launch-led-to-a-massive-structural-overhaul-at-cd-projekt-red/1100-6519510/">CD Projekt Red's near-total restructuring</a>. But the studio was quick to learn from its mistakes, and spent years working to fix the game's broken bits, and improve on its strengths.</p><p dir="ltr">The end result of this effort was the 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty DLC, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-rebuilds-its-gameplay-to-make-a-fantastic-rpg/1100-6517704/">completely restructured gameplay</a> and added a compelling new storyline featuring voice work from Idris Elba. Phantom Liberty was well-received by critics and players alike (GameSpot gave it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/">a rare 10/10</a>), and after years spent working to create--and then fix--the game, CD Projekt Red seemed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-deems-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-a-commercial-success" rel="nofollow ">pleased with the result</a> as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Phantom Liberty released just over a year ago, in September 2023. Given the positive player reception, it's not too surprising that the game's user reviews on Steam have become increasingly positive as well.</p><p dir="ltr">So what's next for the Cyberpunk 2077 franchise? Well, the game's core development team has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-core-team-moving-to-boston-to-start-work-on-sequel/1100-6508035/">moved to Boston to begin work</a> on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-be-more-authentically-america-dev-says/1100-6524584/">"more authentically American" sequel</a>. (Here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/">everything we know about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>.) Both a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-the-latest-on-cyberpunk-2077-live-action-and-anime-projects/1100-6528068/">live-action Cyberpunk project and a new anime</a> are in the works, though details are currently sparse.</p><p>As for the game itself, CD Projekt Red has indicated that aside from the odd bug-fix, Cyberpunk 2077 won't receive any more updates--so players were caught off-guard when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-what-cyberpunk-2077s-unexpected-2-2-update-is-bringing/2900-6052/">a surprise update launched</a> last month, adding several new features to the game …including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-update-adds-balatro-crossover-quest/1100-6528375/">Balatro-based quest</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-need-a-ray-tracing-card-at-minimum.1091064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-pc-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After yesterday's Developer Direct deep dive, Bethesda and id Software have announced the&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>PC specs, and it turns out you're going to need quite a beefy machine even to run it at a minimum level.</p>

<p>During yesterday's presentation, we got to see more of&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>' gameplay, and we also got a release date for it: May 15th. Now, on the game's official <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Bethesda has unveiled the game's PC specs, and even the minimum preset might prompt you to upgrade.</p>

<p>Often, when it comes to PC gaming, you can get away with older graphics cards if you're just looking to run games with fairly modest visuals. Not so with&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, though; it needs you to have a ray tracing-compatible card even for its lowest tier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-gameplay.jpg?itok=H8Yrp4co 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-gameplay.jpg?itok=XsAivQ6z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>won't let you get away with a potato PC.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a rundown of the specs you'll need at each tier for&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. All of these tiers require Windows 10 or 11, as well as a 512GB or higher NVMe SSD with 100GB available.</p>

<h3>Minimum (1080p, 60fps, Low)</h3>

<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X,&nbsp;Intel Core i7-10700K, or better</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super, AMD Radeon RX 6600, or better</li>
	<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1440p, 60fps, High)</h3>

<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X, Intel Core i7-12700K, or better</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, AMD Radeon RX 6800, or better</li>
	<li>32GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 4K (4K, 60fps, Ultra)</h3>

<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X, Intel Core i7-12700K, or better</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, AMD Radeon RX 7900XT, or better</li>
	<li>32GB RAM</li>
</ul><p>id Software calls&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>its "most ambitious" game to date, and it looks like the recommended PC specs will match that ambition. Better make sure you upgrade your machine in time for the game's launch if it needs it!</p>




<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>launches on May 15th for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>A new report suggests NHL players are increasingly turning to video games and weed edibles during their downtime, as opposed to boozing like players of past generations took part in regularly.</p><p>Twenty-two-year-old Maple Leafs forward Matthew Knies told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078563/2025/01/24/nhl-weed-gummies-video-gaming-alcohol/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that because technology has advanced so much, it's very easy to "live a virtual life instead of a real one." Buffalo Sabres forward Peyton Krebs, 23, said, "We'll all go out for dinner, but then guys will generally go back to their rooms to play video games."</p><p>One anonymous defenseman told the site that playing video games with teammates can help with camaraderie. "You just have to be more open," this person said. "I'll try to drag guys out of their comfort zone, and then I'll play video games with them."</p><p>Beyond video games, NHL players appear to be increasingly turning to weed edibles over booze during downtime. The Athletic spoke with more than three-dozen current NHL players and asked if they took an edible during the season, and 38% "indicated" they did. Hockey players are known to be big boozers, but this trend may be on the decline. Floridan Panthers defenseman Nate Schmidt told the site he was told when he entered the NHL a decade ago, "If you can't play hungover in this league, you don't belong in it."</p><p>That attitude may be changing, especially with younger players. Schmidt said it's unacceptable for players to show up to practice at anything less than 100%. Alcohol-fueled partying during the season is on the decline, it seems, as players look to mellow out instead and take better care of their bodies.</p><p>A veteran NHL forward who asked to remain anonymous said he's sad about the lack of boozing as a means of team-bonding. "When I came into the league, we were going out for beers the night before games," he said. "I think (the NHL) used to be more fun back in the day."</p><p>Cannabis is not banned for NHL players, and it is legal in many cities across North America where NHL teams play.</p><p>As for EA's NHL video game series, the newest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nhl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-640627">NHL 25</a>, was just recently updated with a new 4 Nations Face-Off update themed around the real-world tournament.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-pass-the-2m-mark.1091037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone, further adding to what has been a pretty good year for the Blue Blur and his dark and edgy rival so far.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/en/release/250124_2.html?year=2025&amp;category=1&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Sega reveals that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has hit two million sales, which means it's sold another million copies since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million" rel="nofollow">hit the million mark</a> back in October (on the day of its launch, no less).</p>

<p>Once again, Sega puts the sales figure down to&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow</em>'s range of language options, allowing many players from different regions to experience the game, as well as the "large-scale global promotions" the company engaged in to promote its platformer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m-sonics.jpg?itok=y4lV-qkE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m-sonics.jpg?itok=26_PeGLX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well for Sega, surprise surprise.</figcaption></figure><p>The past twelve months, it seems, has been the year not only of Sonic, but of Shadow as well.</p>

<p>Played by Keanu Reeves, Shadow made an appearance in the third&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie, which was released late last year and which helped the movie franchise as a whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">cross the $1 billion mark</a> at the box office. A fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie has already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">earmarked for March 2027</a>.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>itself, it's the latest 3D platformer in the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>series...well, sort of. It marries a remaster of 2011's&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>with a brand new campaign revolving around Shadow, complete with several new levels and boss fights.</p>

<p>It might be better to think of this one as the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>rather than as an entirely new game; it's not on the same scale as something like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sonic-frontiers" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic Frontiers</em></a>, but it does have some new stuff to check out, even if you rinsed the original&nbsp;<em>Generations</em>.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-x-shadow-generations/9mvlzdh2fh05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-cloud-and-aerith-relationship-comments-were-misinterpreted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi has said his previous comments on the nature of Cloud and Aerith's relationship were misinterpreted and that no member of Square Enix will comment officially on the character's relationship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A December interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-game-awards-interview-aerith" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inverse</a> quoted Hamaguchi as saying "Aerith has always been this sort of sisterly character pulling Cloud along and encouraging him," leading many fans to complain or question the director about the true nature of their relationship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7, both the original and the first two games in its Remake Trilogy, has always portrayed Cloud's relationship with Aerith and Tifa rather vaguely. Player choice can influence their interactions, prompting things like a date with different characters depending on how the player, as Cloud, treats  them. The "canon" relationship has long been debated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were therefore shocked when Hamaguchi appeared to have essentially dismissed Aerith as a romantic partner in his comments, though he has now told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/cloud-and-aerith-are-not-like-brother-and-sister-final-fantasy-vii-rebirths-director-speaks-out-about-misinterpretation-of-his-statement/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> this was a misinterpretation and that he, nor anyone at Square Enix, would convey the nature of their characters' relationships beyond the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As creators, we will continue to convey [the relationships between our characters] through our content," Hamagucho said. "For example, no one will make any official statements about who Cloud likes, who Aerith likes, and so on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added that the misunderstanding may have come from subtle differences in language and culture between his native Japanese and the article's publication in English.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all comes as the modern retelling of Final Fantasy 7 hasn't concluded yet. More answers, or more questions, could emerge in the third and final part of the Remake Trilogy, though fans will be waiting a while for them as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027">Square Enix doesn't hope to release it until 2027 at the earliest</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix">The story has now been wrapped up internally</a> though, and Final Fantasy series producer Yoshinori Kitase previously said he's "sure fans will be satisfied with the final chapter."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last game</a>, IGN said: "Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action role playing game full of exciting challenges and an awe inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

    <p><span>The Mikawa Flower Festival returns to Inazuma with new character Yumemizuki Mizuki.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [121 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Moonlight Amidst Dreams,” will launch on February 12, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-940256"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This time, players will knock on the doors of the centuries-old Mikawa Flower Festival once again, sharing this grand occasion with youkai as they explore a variety of gameplay experiences. What’s more, the versatile and capable Yumemizuki Mizuki joins the roster as a playable character. This update also includes a host of optimizations for increased convenience.</p><p>The Mikawa Flower Festival, a symbol of the bond between humans and youkai, returns with more reunions, challenges, and rewards for all to cherish and savor the moment. Raiden Shogun will also attend the gathering, and she seems to be investigating a mysterious nightmare. The fun and exciting games from the “48-hour game development competition” are sure to keep players entertained. For instance, try “A Little Fox’s Daydream,” where players must guide a little fox through its dreamscapes, collecting Fried Tofu and reaching its destination. For those up for a brain-teasing challenge, dive into “Bunshin Phantasm.” In this unique experience, Muji-Muji Daruma will mimic the player’s actions from the previous round. Players need to use the Daruma’s imitated actions to unlock the bridge to the goal within three rounds. The beloved “Akitsu Yuugei” is also back with a twist as the new “Akitsu Harpastum.” In this game, players must dodge a barrage of bullets while returning their harpastum to keep their vitality above zero. Join the games to earn Festival Stamps and exchange them for rewards, including a new 4-star polearm, “Tamayuratei no Ohanashi.”</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_940257"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>The dedicated clinical psychologist and major shareholder of the Aisa Bathhouse, Yumemizuki Mizuki, will soon join the roster as a 5-star Anemo Catalyst user and showcase her special treatments in her latest Story Quest. Her Dreamdrifter state, activated by her Elemental Skill, is one of her key combat features. While in this state, she deals AoE Anemo DMG and further enhances her team’s Swirl DMG when nearby party members hit opponents with Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro attacks. Her Elemental Burst summons a Mini Baku that creates Yumemi Style Special Snacks. When party members with less than 70% HP pick up these Snacks, they recover HP. If their HP is above 70%, the Snacks explode instead, dealing AoE Anemo DMG. Additionally, if Mizuki is in the party, using healing food items has a chance to restore an extra 30% HP to all characters.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Yumemizuki Mizuki will debut in the first half of Version 5.4’s Event Wishes with Sigewinne’s rerun, followed by reruns for Furina and Wriothesley in the second half. Mizuki will join the Standard Wish banner after the Version 5.5 update.</p><p>More exciting events are soon to follow in the update’s wake. “Travelers’ Tales: Anthology Chapter” offers players a glimpse into the captivating slice-of-life stories of their favorite characters. Additionally, mini-games, including the film editing challenge “Reel Ad-Venture,” the fishing game with cooperative and competitive modes “Invasive Fish Wrangler,” and the combat event “Realm of Tempered Valor,” will be available in this update.</p><p>To make adventuring and combat easier, this update also introduces several system optimizations. Players can now set Level-Up Plans for their characters in the Training Guide. Once these goals are set, the required materials and their sources will be clearly displayed. The filter systems for both Characters and Weapons have also been streamlined, reducing the steps needed to navigate the interfaces. Lastly, an Auto Add button has been added to the Weapon Refinement interface to speed up the process.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,708 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,620 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,200 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

                <p>A regular library typically doesn't have a section devoted to out-of-print video game magazines and promotional materials, but that's a gap that the Video Game History Foundation is looking to fill next week when it opens the doors to its virtual library. The non-profit organization has been steadily collecting video game materials for several years, and its public library will be accessible starting January 30.</p><p>"After years of collecting, cataloging, and digitizing video game history materials, the VGHF is finally opening the virtual doors to its library--wherever you are," the group said in a statement (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-video-game-history-foundation-makes-its-digital-library-available-to-the-public-next-week" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). Some of the materials teased by the organization include high-resolution scans of Final Fantasy 7 artwork and more than 1,500 video game magazines.</p><p>The VGHF added that its library will be home to "never-before-seen game development materials," and with powerful search options teased, it could become an invaluable resource for video game historians to make use of.</p><p>If you're interested in seeing more of the VGHF's work--and supporting its efforts to preserve the past--<a href="https://gamehistory.org/" rel="nofollow ">you can check out its main website for more details</a>. The group has faced a few obstacles in its video game preservation mission, as last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-preservation-efforts-just-got-some-bad-news-from-us-copyright-office/1100-6527411/">its petition to the US Copyright Office</a> to allow libraries to share out-of-print video games in their possession with researchers remotely was denied.</p><p>The VGHF is one of several preservation efforts that have sprung up over the years, with one of the other notable examples being GOG's program to keep classic video games compatible with current and next-gen systems. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-put-together-a-new-team-focused-on-game-preservation/1100-6522463/">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-has-set-up-a-new-game-preservation-department/1100-6502798/">PlayStation</a> have also reportedly set up their own preservation programs for their game libraries.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-54-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-5-4-release-date-revealed-for-february.1091004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-54-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4 release date, and the latest update for the gacha RPG is landing next month, bringing the Flower Festival back to Inazuma.</p>

<p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4 lands on February 12th, just in time for Valentine's Day. Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">this month's Version 5.3</a>, this update's main attraction is the return of the Mikawa Flower Festival, which gives you the chance to engage with a variety of exciting minigames and exchange the rewards you get from them for some cool stuff.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to the addition of a brand new five-star character in the form of Yumemizuki Mizuki, a "dedicated clinical psychologist and major shareholder of the Aisa Bathhouse".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.4-release-date-yumemizuki-mizuki.jpg?itok=aaVKXSCH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.4-release-date-yumemizuki-mizuki.jpg?itok=EimxpOvU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll get the chance to recruit the five-star character Yumemizuki Mizuki in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4.</figcaption></figure><p>Yumemizuki Mizuki is a five-star Anemo-using catalyst wielder who can enter a Dreamdrifter state, in which she'll deal area-of-effect damage and buff allies using different elements.</p>

<p>She can also create snacks that can either heal party members or explode to deal further damage, depending on how much health your party has left. It sounds like she'll be a pretty valuable addition to your team.</p>

<p>You can expect Yumemizuki Mizuki to debut in the first half of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4, alongside a rerun of Sigewinne. The second half will bring reruns of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-furina-gameplay-video" rel="nofollow">Furina</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-wriothesley-gameplay-demo" rel="nofollow">Wriothesley</a>, just in case you haven't added them to your roster yet.</p>

<p>As well as the new character and the Flower Festival, Version 5.4 will also bring new slice-of-life vignettes that will revolve around some of your "favorite characters", and of course, you can expect system improvements and gameplay optimizations too.</p>




<p>As always, HoYoverse has released some new codes that will net you some nifty free stuff for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>as well, and here they are.</p>

<ul><li>GISpecialProgram54 - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>Mizuki0212Mizuki - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>

                <p>Circana has shared new video game data that shows how challenging 2024 was for video game hardware. Total spending on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch devices in the US declined a gargantuan 25%, dropping to $4.9 billion (down from $6.45 billion in 2023).</p><p>For December 2024 specifically, spending on new video game hardware fell 29%, declining to $1.1 billion. PS5 hardware sales in December 2024 dropped by 18%, with Xbox Series X|S and Switch sales each declining a more precipitous 38%.</p><p>A major drop in spending on video game hardware is expected, of course, given PS5 and Xbox Series X|S being past their prime selling peaks and the Switch's maturity in the market, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggacbcepk2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana's Mat Piscatella said</a>. That said, Piscatella commented that the decline was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgh33abqkc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bigger than he expected.</a></p><p>PS5 was December 2024's best-selling console platform in terms of units sales and dollars, with Switch coming in second place. For 2024 overall, PS5 led the way in unit and dollar sales, followed by Xbox Series X|S for dollar sales and Switch coming in at No. 2 for unit sales.</p><p>Also of note is that 49% of all PS5 consoles and 43% of Xbox Series X|S devices sold in December 2024 did not have a disc drive. For 2024 overall, all-digital consoles made up 45% of PS5 units sold and 44% of all Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggkcxfw3c2f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Something else to know</a> is that, while the PS5 is pacing 7% ahead of the PS4 in terms of unit sales after its first 50 months on the market, Xbox Series X|S sales are down 18% compared to Xbox One.</p><p>Another key statistic was that PS5 is now the No. 3 best-selling console in US history of all time based on dollar sales, only behind Nintendo Switch and Xbox 360. PS5 is now the No. 11 best-selling console in US video game history based on unit sales.</p><p>Nintendo is launching the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2025, and that should help improve hardware spending this year.

            <p>
BioWare appears to have bid farewell to any further updates for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, following the launch this week of the game's Patch 5.
</p>
<p>
Patch <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes">notes</a> for the update thank fans for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the past few months while some small additional quality of life features have been implemented. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare goes on to state that it is now happy the game is in a "stable place" and will move to monitoring for any reports of game-breaking bugs, should these occur.
</p>
<p>
The patch notes finish with "Dareth shiral!" - meaning '<em>farewell</em>', or '<em>safe journey</em>' in the game's Elvish language. It really sounds like this is it.

<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA said Dragon Age: The Veilguard had missed the publisher's own internal targets</a>, after it "engaged" 1.5 million players between October 2024 and the end of the year, "down nearly 50 percent from the company's expectations".
</p>
<p>Last week, Eurogamer published the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware">first statement from Dragon Age: The Veilguard game director Corinne Busche</a>, discussing her exit from the studio.</p>
<p>
While large updates to Dragon Age: The Veilguard were not expected and BioWare had already ruled out the prospect of DLC, fans have still reacted in surprise at the sudden end to any further small additions.
</p>
<p>
There had been some hope of a New Game Plus mode being added, for example, as well as further cosmetic options for character clothing designs.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Patch 5 contains a number of small bug fixes, and one final quality of life change: "Recommended levels have been added to side quests that players may receive at significantly lower levels."
</p>
<p>
Dareth shiral, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. On the upside, here's hoping this helps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">BioWare get work spun up more quickly on Mass Effect 5</a>.
