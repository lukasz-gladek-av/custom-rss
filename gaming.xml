            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psvr2-pc-adapter-release-date-revealed-for-august.888180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/psvr2-pc-adapter-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that the PSVR2 PC adapter, which will allow you to use your PlayStation VR2 headset to play VR games on Steam, will launch later this summer.</p>

<p>We first learned that PSVR2 would get PC support <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-vr2-pc-support">back in February</a>, but now, thanks to a new PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, we know that the adapter will arrive on August 7th and will set you back $59.99 or your regional equivalent. Never knowingly underpriced, eh, Sony?</p>

<p>If you want to use the adapter, you'll also need a DisplayPort cable that meets the DisplayPort 1.4 standards, as well as a Steam account and a PC that meets the minimum hardware requirements for PSVR2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-alyx-psvr2-pc-adapter.jpg?itok=TqV7LzIK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-alyx-psvr2-pc-adapter.jpg?itok=Df8APyVY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to use your PSVR2 headset to play&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>? Soon, you'll be able to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the specs your PC will need to have if you want to avail yourself of the PSVR2 PC adapter.</p>

<ul><li>Windows 11 or Windows 10, 64-bit</li>
	<li>Intel Core i5-7600 or AMD Ryzen 3 3100 with Zen2 architecture or later</li>
	<li>8GB RAM</li>
	<li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 with Turing architecture or later, or AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later</li>
	<li>DisplayPort 1.4</li>
	<li>Direct USB connection</li>
	<li>Bluetooth 4.0</li>
</ul><p>You'll also need to download the PlayStation VR2 app and the SteamVR app, but once you've done that (and assuming your PC meets the aforementioned requirements, of course), you just need to connect the adapter to your PSVR2 and your PC and you'll be ready to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/psvr2-pc-adapter-in-situ.jpg?itok=AdLQ0ycR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/psvr2-pc-adapter-in-situ.jpg?itok=1ORjClT_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This could be you, but imagine that the PS5 is a PC and you've bought the PSVR2 PC adapter.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there are some caveats to using PSVR2 on PC. Naturally, you won't be able to play any <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-vr2-launch-window-lineup-detailed-13-new-games-announced">PS5 VR games</a> on Steam; this adapter is just so that you can play Steam-based VR games with your headset.</p>

<p>You also won't be able to take advantage of PSVR2 features like haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, HDR, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tobii-is-negotiation-with-sony-for-psvr2">eye tracking</a>. However, you'll still feel the rumble of the controllers, and features like the headset's 4K visuals and finger touch detection should still work.</p>

<p>The PSVR2 PC adapter launches on August 7th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

UK high street retailer GAME will shutter its long-running reward programme on 31st July 2024, the chain has announced. This applies to the standard GAME Reward scheme and also the Elite membership tier. 
</p>
<p>
No further reward points will be earned from purchases made in GAME stores or GAME's website from two weeks' earlier - on 15th July. 
</p>
<p>
As of 31st July, you will no longer be able to redeem reward points, either.

<p>
"We would strongly urge you to redeem your GAME reward points prior to the closure date on purchases in game store or online to avoid disappointment," GAME wrote today. 
</p>
<p>
"After the closure date, GAME reward points will be reset to zero and the GAME reward account will be closed, you will no longer be able to access it and you will no longer be able to redeem your GAME reward points." 
</p>
<p>
Per GAME's terms and conditions, you can redeem 400 reward points for £1 off of a purchase. You will also need to redeem a minimum of 400 Points to use up any remaining balance.
</p>
<p>
The end of GAME Elite, meanwhile, will mean the end of its monthly offers, prize draws and other promotions. Any outstanding paid Elite membership months will be eligible for a refund.
</p>
<p>
An FAQ on the changes poses the question of what existing GAME reward card holders should do with their soon-to-be-worthless membership card. "They can be destroyed as they will no longer be in use," the FAQ states. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer was told of the likely end to the GAME reward programme earlier this year, as part of the chain's ongoing changes which have seen it take up residence largely within Sports Direct and other Fraser Group outlets as concessions, rather than their own bespoke high street stores. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">Eurogamer reported how GAME staff had been moved to zero-hour contracts, with others made redundant</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the changes to GAME reward schemes are part of further moves to standardise the business to operate within concession units, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">after the end of GAME's long-running trade-in scheme</a>. Going forward, GAME will be able to sell stock through Fraser Group till software, without the need for a bespoke GAME till with the chain's trade-in product database, or need to accomodate GAME reward points.

            <p>Following news earlier this year it was planning to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-testing-ps-vr2-compatibility-with-pc">roll out PS VR2 support on PC</a>, Sony has announced the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter.</p>
<p>With this adapter in play, users' VR headsets will become compatible with PCs, which in turn will allow them to expand their libraries with a large number of games on SteamVR. Yes, that includes titles such as Half-Life: Alyx.</p>

<p>In addition to the adapter itself, players will also need to ensure they have a DisplayPort cable that is compatible with DisplayPort 1.4. A Steam account is also required, and you will need to ensure your PC is up to the task of supporting the hardware.</p>
<p>Here are the minimum requirements for PS VR2 gameplay on PC, as shared by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/?sf273420909=1">PlayStation</a>:</p>

<p>Sony notes there will be some differences using its PS VR2 set on PC compared to on consoles. For example, HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble) will not be available when playing on PC.</p>
<p>It will still support high-fidelity and sensory immersion features, however, with Sony highlighting its 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games. </p>
<p>"While the most immersive way to experience PS VR2 gaming remains on PS5, we hope players will enjoy the ability to play an expanded lineup of VR games on PC using the same headset," PlayStation closed.</p><p>

The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter is set to arrive on 7th  August, retailing at £49.99/ $59.99 / €59.99.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s gonna get pretty funky in Faerûn with official mod support coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Larian Studios announced that official mod support will roll out in phases, starting today with a closed alpha, before a closed beta test in July, culminating with the official release of Patch 7 in September. According to Larian, the staggered testing phases will give the community ample time to test the new mod tools before making them available across PC and consoles.</p><p>If you have experience with official mod support in games like <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>Fallout</em>, Larian’s approach will sound similar. On PC, mods will be tested to ensure terms of service compatibility and overall stability before approval. Those mods will then undergo additional approvals before coming to console. While PC players will have access to the full suite of mod creation tools, and mods can still be made, downloaded, and played without using the official mod browser, console players will only be able to browse and install mods officially approved by Larian.</p><p>You can check out the full <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> mod FAQ page <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4179982568653520452">here</a>, and players interested in testing mod support during the closed beta in July will have the opportunity to sign up at a later date. As Larian has stated, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">it has no plans of creating DLC or a <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> sequel</a>, so offering official mod support is the studio’s way of letting the community take over the reins of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> development to ensure the game stays fresh for years to come. </p><p>Patch 7 isn’t just introducing mod support tools. It’ll also contain substantial content updates for the game, including improved evil endings, tons of small narrative additions (Wyll romancers, your time is coming), and bug fixes. Beyond Patch 7’s release in September, Larian also said it plans on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4172097464031362567">adding crossplay and photo mode</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/megacopter-blades-of-the-goddess">Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess</a> is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking "AZ-TECH" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.</p><!--more-->
<p>I'd do a plot summary for Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess, but it feels like this would be missing the point - like introducing a party clown to the kids by making them read his LinkedIn profile. So let's jump straight into the act of slithering through the skies of those gaudy comicbook maps, switching between air-to-air and air-to-ground cannons while avoiding a bevy of unguided or homing projectiles that are ineffectual enough individually, but murderous in dozens. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>There's a touch of latter-day open worlding in the form of radar stations you can hack with your cybernetic crane to clear away fog of war. There are explodables to detonate, often positioned so that you can spark off a line of blast clouds right through a base. And there are special moves bestowed by the aforesaid blood-drinking goddess, like briefly transforming your helicopter into a sizzling green shuriken.</p>
<p>It's a great on-the-go game, based on 30 minutes with the demo over the weekend. The colour palette scrubs up nicely on a Steam Deck, and your carnivorous chopper has a nice sense of inertia when dancing through that ever-thickening canopy of bullets. I was frustrated, then engrossed by how Megacopter handles switching between shooting at aerial targets and those on the ground: this forces your brain to reckon with the fact that the distinction doesn't "really" exist because the world isn't "true" polygonal 3D, a quirk of many 90s isometric games I sort of miss.</p>
<p>Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is out 21st June - you can find it and the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228360/Megacopter_Blades_of_the_Goddess/">Steam</a>. Developers Pizza Bear Games consist of Gabe Miller and Nicholas Hunter, with Robin Ogden of OGRE Sound supplying some rad period music. If you like this kind of thing, you might also get a kick out of the antique <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-renegade-ops">Renegade Ops</a> or the much more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/go-mecha-ball-out-today-on-steam-and-game-pass-is-a-swish-blend-of-twin-stick-shooting-and-pinball-physics">Go Mecha Ball</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168972/haikyu-coach-ukai-best-anime-crushes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oGPVgQ">One of the best parts of the human experience, if I do say so myself, is having a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22929389/best-anime-crushes">big ol’ crush</a> — the pitter-patter of your heartbeat, the swell of euphoria when you see the object of your affection, the desire to just squeal with joy! At Polygon, though, we’re very flexible about how we interpret “crush.” After all, brief yet intense infatuations <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2019/11/6/20944180/69-biggest-movies-tv-games-crushes-decade">don’t necessarily have to be on real people</a> (or even on people!), nor do they have to be romantic. Since I have many many (many) crushes, I’ve decided to share the energy of writing their names over and over again in sparkly gel pen in a journal.</p>

<p id="gFkzSW">Watching <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24162810/haikyu-the-dumpster-battle-review"><em>Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle</em></a> reminded me what a hottie the Karasuno boys’ volleyball team’s coach is. There are a lot of good boys (and a couple of girls!) in the sports anime and manga, which follows an underdog volleyball team on their quest to greatness. But watching the movie affirmed to me that my biggest crush in the series is the man who was initially reluctant to mentor the team, coach Keishin Ukai.</p>
<p id="CLzDRa">Ukai is a bit prickly, but he has a big heart. He only agreed to serve as the team’s coach for a practice match between the their historic rival Nekoma (incidentally, the team featured in <em>Dumpster Battle</em>). But eventually, he agrees to stay on, reminded of his love of the sport. (And his desire to finally beat Nekoma in a game!) We love a good character development! Once a member of the Karasuno High School volleyball team, Ukai was initially hesitant to go back because he didn’t want to cloud his own nostalgia for his high school days. That’s a nice little touch of backstory that immediately lets me imagine how his high school days went, and concoct elaborate stories for what his life has been like in the intervening years. </p>
<p id="rfY62K">His gruff personality balances out faculty advisor Ittetsu Takeda, who is polite, plucky about everything, and a bit clueless about volleyball. I just think they have a great vibe as co-workers and eventual friends! </p>

<p id="g8WTrf">On the most superficial level, Ukai is blond — or rather, anime blond, in that he has yellow hair. I have a weakness for blond fictional men — one of these days I’ll try to pinpoint the origin of that response, but for now, I’m simply letting it dictate where my heart lies. And Ukai is hot in that <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-bear-hulu-sexy-dirtbag-cook">“sexually competent dirtbag line cook”</a> way, in that he’s a bit surly but definitely not unkind, maintains a certain edgy appearance, and also drinks and smokes, but in a sexy way that shows he knows how to have fun. To me, this is only attractive when the guy isn’t real — but boy, does it hit!</p>
<p id="cSNwFY">In one episode of the show, a few of the players who are struggling with their schoolwork come to Ukai for advice. He lights a cigarette and glares at them with a cocky grin, saying “Does it <em>look</em> like I was good at school?” That’s when I fell for him.  </p>
<p id="AfUHDm">Coach Ukai isn’t heavily featured in <em>Dumpster Battle</em> — or heck, even in the TV show. But seeing him in the background of the movie still reignited my crush. Sometimes less is more when it comes to latching onto a fictional character. </p>
<p id="ONSB4o">Or maybe not! Maybe your crush of the week is the main character of your latest TV obsession, or the featured protagonist in your favorite video game. Or maybe, like me, you’ve decided to be really into a gruff guy with a secret soft side, even though he mostly stays in the background. Let me know who you’re crushing on this week! </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-codename-spiral-may-be-splatoon-4-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1797415318631104801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X from reliable leaker @MbKKssTBhz5, Nintendo may have the next Splatoon project in the works under codename Spiral.</p>



<p>The leaker explains that after “researching the data I have received in the last month,” the project is “very likely” the next Splatoon installment. @MbKKssTBhz5 had no further details about the game. </p>



<p>Notably, the leaker <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1797461652713168966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also mentioned</a> they will have to be “careful now with Nintendo information.” So, they may not offer many more updates about Spiral. </p>



<p>@MbKKssTBhz5 has reported a variety of key leaks, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEGA’s upcoming projects</a> for Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. Recently, the leaker also supported claims about a potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-frontiers-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic Frontiers sequel</a>.</p>



<p>For now, Splatoon fans can now enjoy the new <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1796980295222104112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sizzle Season 2024</a>. This update adds new weapons, stages, and gear. There will also be a Summer Nights Splatfest event, an Ultra Stamp Festival, and more.</p>



<p>Nintendo recently confirmed that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Direct showcase</a> is coming in June, though it won’t be a platform for the Switch 2 announcement. It’s intended to cover a lineup of Switch games for the “second half of 2024.” So, Nintendo may not confirm anything about Codename Spiral or Splatoon during the event.</p>



<p>At this time, Nintendo has not officially confirmed anything about a new entry in the Splatoon series.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has revealed Project G-Assist, a program designed to help PC users by giving them access to more game knowledge through the use of generative AI.</p><p>"Whether it's a new player trying a game for the first time, and overwhelmed by massive skill trees, or a seasoned veteran looking for that perfect weapon to min-max that DPS build, many of us spend hours researching, scouring the internet to learn, to dig deeper and ultimately enjoy more of what the game has to offer," Nvidia senior project manager Guillermo Siman said in the Project G-Assist pitch video. "This is where Project G-Assist comes in. It uses AI to make sure information is readily available whenever we need it."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsyJQWUUSs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RdsyJQWUUSs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Siman added that G-Assist works by by taking in speech or a text prompt from a player and then adds context from the screen. This is then fed into a large language model enhanced by the developer's game-knowledge database, and these AI models can run on the cloud or can be locally accelerated by a GeForce RTX GPU. To demonstrate its potential, Nvidia has partnered with Studio Wildcard to demo the technology through Ark: Survival Ascended. Project G-Assist will help answer questions about creatures, items, lore, objectives, difficult bosses, and more in the survival game.</p><p>Where G-Assist could come in more handy on PC is through the optimization of games. While Nvidia does offer a PC-optimization tool through its GeForce Experience app, Project G-Assist could potentially fine-tune a gaming system for optimal performance and efficiency based on an individual user's hardware. Nvidia says that depending on the system, Project G-Assist could apply a safe overclock and even intelligently reduce power consumption while aiming to reach a performance target.</p><p>This wouldn't be the first time that a company has attempted to evolve gaming guides and walkthroughs. The PlayStation 5 console launched with a Game Help feature meant to provide assistance in titles, although only a few games have provided in-depth guides through this option. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-game-help-feature-expands-expands-with-auto-recorded-clips-to-help-others/1100-6522150/">Sony also announced Community Game Help for PS5</a> in March, a new "enhancement" for Game Help utilizing user-generated content to help players out of difficult situations in games. It'll be going live later this year.</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 already has plenty of mods, but they can be fiddly and difficult to install at times. Now, developer Larian Studios has said that the hit RPG is getting an official modding toolkit in an upcoming patch, and it's being released in a closed alpha so that mod authors can test it out and (ideally) adapt their existing mods to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" rel="nofollow ">blog post announcing</a> the upcoming patch clarifies that the closed alpha starts on June 3, to be followed by a closed beta targeting roughly 1,000 players in July. This official mod toolkit will release first on PC and roll out to Mac, PlayStation, and Xbox "shortly after," which is great news for console players. Larian is targeting a September launch for Patch 7, which will also include a number of other improvements and additions, including new evil endings and a number of other bug fixes.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The post also features a lengthy Q&amp;A explaining what Baldur's Gate 3's native mod support will look like; in it, Larian notes that while the curated and officially supported mod channels will help these projects reach more players, some mods (such as NSFW ones) will have to remain outside of the pipeline. The studio also emphasized that it has no plans to limit modding outside of these official channels.</p><p dir="ltr">Larian also stated that other improvements will be coming to Baldur's Gate 3 in upcoming patches, including a photo mode and crossplay. Studio CEO Swen Vincke recently said the company's next game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/">codenamed Excalibur</a>, and that the team doesn't quite know what it is yet, so don't expect to play it anytime soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/03/the-pc-adapter-for-playstation-vr2-arrives-this-august-with-some-drawbacks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/02/22/sony-testing-pc-support-for-playstation-vr2">After teasing PC support tests earlier this year</a>, the PC adapter for PlayStation VR2 arrives this August, the company has revealed. More specifically, the device will cost $59.99 and hit select retailers and PlayStation's online store starting August 7. With this device, you can use the PlayStation VR2 hardware to play SteamVR games, including the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ironically, PlayStation gamers have been asking for a Half-Life: Alyx port for PlayStation VR (and now PlayStation VR2) for years. Though that still isn't happening, this PC adapter at least allows players to use their PlayStation VR2 device to play the game through Steam. They can do the same with hundreds of other SteamVR games, like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/fallout-4-vr">Fallout 4 VR</a> and War Thunder.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here's a look at the minimum PC requirements to use PlayStation VR2 on your PC</strong>:&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1380234a-5522-4dfe-aa1b-5df298c33dda" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>However, as exciting as being able to use your PlayStation VR2 device on PC is, it comes with some distinct drawbacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"PS VR2 was designed from the ground up specifically for PS5 – so you'll notice that some key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble), are not available when playing on PC," the PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">post</a> reads. "However, other high-fidelity and sensory immersion features on PS VR2 are supported, including 4K visuals (2000 x 2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games."&nbsp;</p>

<p>PlayStation says the most immersive way to experience PlayStation VR2 will remain the PS5, even after this PC adapter is available for purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To set up the PC adapter, you will have to connect PlayStation VR2 to your PC using the adapter and the DisplayPort 1.4 cable. After that, download the PlayStation VR2 App and the SteamVR app from Steam. This will allow you to set up the device on PC, customize your settings, and play SteamVR games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will be available for purchase starting August 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="363" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> launches its next expansion, <em>Dawntrail</em>, in just a few weeks, and it’s already announced some rather strange partnerships to celebrate Version 7.0 with brands like KFC and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-adds-the-mountain-zu-a-mountain-dew-themed-bird-mount/">Mountain Dew</a>. Though perhaps a little more appropriately, the MMORPG just revealed its collaboration with Secret Lab, the company behind all those flashy gamer chairs. </p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">The <em>FFXIV</em> gaming chair takes inspiration from some classic<em> Shadowbringers</em> iconography, using the <a href="https://secretlab.co/finalfantasy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secretlab Titan Evo</a> model as a base for its dark blue and gold flare. It’s also the first chair from Secret Lab to come with a few extra <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-fantasia-lalafell-doors/">glamour options</a>. You can change out the little magnets on the top left side, representing <em>FFXIV’s</em> Tank, Healer, or DPS Roles — thus making the chair a more flexible party member than me. </p>

As for this chair, I’m not sure if you’ll have this thing in time for the big update, but we’ll update later as those details clear up. </p>

<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It wasn’t that long ago that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-teases-illuminate-faction-again-following-incident-that-spaghettified-scientists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Earth successfully (?) spaghettified a team of scientists </a>to develop a new type of weapon, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> players have already gotten around to using it. Specifically, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-charged-with-completely-destroying-a-planet-an-irreversible-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent planetary destruction campaign</a> was a resounding success, and Meridia is now a black hole.</p> <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">Over the past couple of days, Helldiver forces were tasked with a unique Dark Fluid mission type. It consisted of <em>Helldivers 2</em> players taking the fight to the Terminid super-colony on Meridia and injecting canisters of the Fluid into the planetary core. While the operation was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d6oil2/gone_but_not_forgotten/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no simple feat</a>, Helldiver fireteams were successful in the end, and Meridia is now permanently spaghettified, from the looks of it. According to Super Earth, what was once Meridia is now a <em>humongous</em> black hole, but something may be amiss here.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-s-meridia-is-now-a-black-hole-or-something-like-it" data-injectable="false">Helldivers 2’s Meridia is now a black hole or something like it</h2> <p data-characters="643" data-current-count="943" data-injectable="true">While the jury is still out on whether the former planet of Meridia truly is a black hole or not, the visual representation of the anomaly itself may remind veteran <em>Helldivers</em> players of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-helldivers-content-is-missing-from-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the infamous third faction from the first game</a>: the Illuminate. The aesthetic is, broadly, on point, as the Illuminate used to leverage dark energy portals to move around the battlefield, and this is most definitely <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-cant-take-all-the-illuminate-teases-from-the-devs-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>not</em> the first hint of Illuminate presence </a>we’ve seen so far. The Meridia operation’s Dark Fluid had to come from somewhere, right? To say nothing of the strange murmurs that can be heard coming from the “black hole”.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">Depending on how (un)lucky you are, you may have already fallen victim to one of <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s biggest question marks yet: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-capture-footage-of-mysterious-assailants-striking-them-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the strange blue lasers</a> that strike players down out of nowhere every so often. There’s a <em>lot</em> to suggest that the long-anticipated return of the Illuminate faction is almost upon us, then, even if we don’t <em>really</em> have any hard information on the when, what, how, and why of the event. As with many such things, developer Arrowhead Games is keeping cards close to its chest, but the writing seems to be on the wall at last.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">It’s a good thing, too, as <em>Helldivers 2</em> is yet to receive its next major update, which is supposed to revert the game’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-dev-plans-to-tone-down-heavy-enemy-spawn-rates-and-health-following-balance-patch-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excessive enemy spawns</a> among other ongoing issues. Between <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-new-mech-is-a-hotly-contested-topic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the relatively mild reception to the new mech</a> and the aforementioned spawning problems, there’s a lot of stuff that requires Arrowhead Games’ attention.</p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Since the studio usually keeps <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/why-undocumented-patch-notes-should-be-the-norm-for-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tight lid on the most exciting pieces of content</a> coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em>, it’s entirely possible that the Illuminates could be a part of this future update. Certainly, all the pieces have fallen into place by now, but pushing out a whole new faction might prove to be particularly risky at this time. Only one way to find out what happens next!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sgf-2024-big-games-no-show</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-of-the-biggest-games-are-skipping-sgf-2024.888114/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sgf-2024-big-games-no-show<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The opening presentation for 2024's Summer Game Fest is due to air later this week, and host Geoff Keighley has taken to Twitch ahead of the show to set the record straight on what you should (and shouldn't) expect.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch stream</a>, Keighley fielded questions from excited gamers about which games would be appearing at the show, whether there would be any big reveals or surprises, and more.</p>

<p>If you're expecting major tentpole games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-announced"><em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater-remake-reveals-first-spectacular-gameplay-in-unreal"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>&nbsp;</em>to appear at the show, then Keighley says you'll be disappointed. None of those games will be part of SGF 2024, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-no-show-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=h0kgC67u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-no-show-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=ppi_g2NM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>fans, but&nbsp;<em>Delta&nbsp;</em>won't be shown during the SGF 2024 opening show.</figcaption></figure><p>Several fans asked Keighley about other games, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolf-among-us-2-new-screenshots">recently-resurfaced</a>&nbsp;<em>The Wolf Among Us 2&nbsp;</em>and Ken Levine's&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>, but Keighley said neither game will be appearing during the showcase.</p>

<p>These no-shows tie into another question that a fan asks Keighley, namely whether SGF and The Game Awards are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-is-officially-dead">replacing E3</a>. Keighley says this isn't the case, and given the apparent lack of major showstopping announcements during this year's Summer Game Fest opener, it's hard to disagree.</p>

<p>Although there may not be any major reveals, Keighley says there will be shadowdrops during the presentation, and he also says that we should get to hear about some games we didn't already know about, which is always nice.</p>

<p>However, Keighley points to recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-10k-layoffs">industry-wide layoffs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">studio closures</a> as proof that the industry in general has been struggling recently, which could be one of the reasons we're not getting quite as many big names at SGF this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-studio-closure-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=KQT4aYk1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-studio-closure-sgf-2024.jpg?itok=fvU6EQfH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several high-profile studios have been closed down in recent months.</figcaption></figure><p>Keighley <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1797506575818797291" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> that the Summer Game Fest show itself will be around 2 hours long, and that it'll be followed by a Day of the Devs show, with Devolver Direct following on immediately after that.</p>

<p>During SGF 2024, we can expect to see a mixture of new game reveals and games we already knew about, although Keighley says the show will focus mainly on existing games, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-release-date"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-capcom"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-gameplay-characters"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's worth watching Keighley's full Q&amp;A session, as he's got some interesting tidbits to share not only about SGF itself, but also about some of the other presentations you might see during the summer period. Stay tuned for all the big (or otherwise) SGF announcements as and when we get them.</p>

In addition to the new adapter, Sony says players will need a DisplayPort cable to work with Steam titles on PC. (As well as a Steam account, obviously.) You can check out the minimum system requirements <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">right here</a>.</p><p>In a blog post, Sony explains that there will be some feature differences depending on whether you’re playing on PS5 or PC:</p><div><blockquote><p>PS VR2 was designed from the ground up specifically for PS5 — so you’ll notice that some key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble), are not available when playing on PC.

At the time, it didn’t reveal any timing beyond a vague 2024. That reveal came almost exactly a year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">after the headset launched</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>An artist is working on an unofficial The Legend of Zelda NES remake within Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>YouTuber and digital artist '<a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LloydEmpty">Lloyd Empty</a>' is working on his own fan remake of the original The Legend of Zelda within Epic's most recent gaming engine, and although this is a work-in-progress, this early footage shows promise. The art style is comparable with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-as-good-as-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019's Link's Awakening Remake</a> for the Nintendo Switch, and in all honesty, it looks quite great.</p>
<p>According to the French artist, in order to create this remake, he used Blender, Gimp, and FMOD (and of course, Unreal Engine). Those who've played the original NES game from 1986 will surely recognize the footage.</p>
<p>We've included the new gameplay footage of this The Legend of Zelda NES fan remake below. Be sure to check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda Nes Remake Gameplay Beta v0.7.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3wywTYTFJA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two years ago, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdfCaPKHm6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artist already released footage</a> of a playable beta, but as far as we know, this beta hasn't been released publicly. Whether a full release will ever be made available for the public is unclear.</p>
<p>Released in 1986 for the original NES, The Legend of Zelda is considered as one of the most influential games ever created. The game was ported to various other Nintendo platforms and is currently available on the Nintendo Switch as part of Nintendo Switch Online. Although we don't have exact numbers, the first entry in the Zelda series has sold well over 6 million copies.</p>
<p>In case you're into these Unreal Engine-remakes of Zelda entries, be sure to check out this <a href="https://wccftech.com/ocarina-of-time-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UE5 remake of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, which looks astonishing in Epic's engine complete with water physics and more.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation VR2 headset will finally become usable on PC soon, thanks to an official adapter that will be released in a few months.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC adapter</a>, which will be released for an estimated retail price of $59.99 / €59.99 / £49.99 at select retailers and PS Direct on August 7th, will also require a DisplayPort cable that is compatible with DisplayPort 1.4 as well as a Steam account and a PC that meets the minimum system requirements, which are not particularly high, although for the best results, Sony recommends an RTX 3060 or Radeon RX 6600XT or later graphics card. Setup also promises to be painless, as users will only be required to connect the headset to a PC and then download the<br>
PlayStation VR2 App and SteamVR App from Steam.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using the PlayStation VR2 headset on PC won't deliver the same experience as on PlayStation 5 since some of its key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking and adapting triggers, and haptic feedback, won't be supported. However, 4K visuals, a 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering, will be supported.</p>
<p>The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will launch on August 7th worldwide. You can learn more about the headset and some of its unique features in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/">review.</a></p>

Whether it’s because the titular character remains a beloved, recognizable face in the <em>Spider-Man</em> canon or lead actor Tom Hardy remains committed to the bit, people like these movies. The third one, <em>Venom: The Last Dance</em>, is coming out on October 25, and today we got the first trailer for it.<br></p><div data-video-id="196032" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="270" data-playlist="196032,196923,196922" data-current="196032"><div><p>Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21556.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p><em>The Last Dance</em>’s trailer starts out simple enough. Eddie Brock and his symbiote partner in crime Venom are shown beating up (and eating) baddies just like they always have. But it’s clear the third movie is going to escalate not once, but twice, as Eddie and Venom’s antics have caught the attention of some government forces and they’re forced to become fugitives But that’s the least of their worries, as aliens from Venom’s home planet have also come to Earth in pursuit of the duo. There’s a whole fight scene between the two and a real ugly beastie on top of of a plane. So it seems like these aliens will make their getaway plans a bit more complicated.</p><p>A lot of the dialogue in the trailer and the movie’s title makes it sound like this could be the last <em>Venom </em>movie, but given that these are the only movies Sony has been putting out in its store brand MCU knock-off that do well in the only way studio suits understand (money), I’d be surprised if that ends up being the case. But whatever happens to the <em>Venom</em> franchise, at least <em>The Last Dance </em>will give us a sick scene of Tom Hardy riding a symbiote horse. That’s fun.</p><p> The real question is: how much do we think <em>The Last Dance </em>will bring up Eddie and Venom’s cameo in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/let-s-talk-about-those-spider-man-no-way-home-post-cre-1848236860&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/let-s-talk-about-those-spider-man-no-way-home-post-cre-1848236860"><em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em></a></span>? There’s a shot in the trailer of what looks like Chiwetel Ejiofor’s character retrieving the piece of symbiote left at the end of that movie, which I would have thought would have far-reaching effects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but now I’m curious if it will close that thread. It was a real fucking bummer that Tom Hardy spent that entire movie nowhere near the plot, and if <em>The Last Dance </em>ends up essentially erasing that from the MCU, that would be a shame. We’ll find out if that little detour had any real tangible effect on Eddie and Venom’s life when <em>The Last Dance </em>premieres on October 25. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirts pre-orders for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One will be going live soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new turn of events, we see one of PlayStation’s titles come over to Xbox instead of the other way around. Ember Labs is releasing Kena: Bridge of Spirits on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One physically and digitally on August 15, 2024. The devs are collaborating with <a href="https://x.com/MaxEnt_Retail/status/1797614812706271484/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Maximum Entertainment Retail</a> for the physical release, which provides the player with some bonus content. Xbox hasn’t provided a price tag for the game yet, but we should expect pre-orders at major retailers to go live soon.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kena Coming to Xbox -  August 15" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrqpJuUfYKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Moreover, through the physical copy, players can expect the base game, along with some bonus content. An official soundtrack and retail exclusive sticker sheet are available to add to your collection. In terms of in-game cosmetics, players can explore the world of the game while rocking a Unique Kena Staff and Golden Rot skins. Also, to celebrate the launch on the new platform, players will see an Xbox Exclusive pirate-themed Rot hat to claim too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a narrative-focused adventure. You play the role of a young Spirit Guide called Kena, who has set foot on a detailed journey towards the sacred Mountain Shrine. Along the way, you find trapped spirits that need to be rescued with the help of Rot. Rot is your cute companions that help you surpass various obstacles in your journey. Furthermore, the game also includes enjoyable, fast-paced combat, with some light platforming and engaging boss fights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits will be released in 2021 for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</a>, along with PC via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kena-bridge-of-spirits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Epic Games Store.</a> Similar to what we have seen with other PlayStation titles such as Sifu, Stray, and Deathloop, to name a few, the game was a timed exclusive.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1797629397777948847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, Sony announced that the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will officially launch on August 7, 2024.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corresponding blog</a> from PlayStation, Sony also mentioned that the anticipated PC adapter will have an estimated retail price of $59.99. It will be available “at select retailers and direct.playstation.com where available.”</p>



<p>This news shortly follows reports of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s certification license</a> for the adapter, which surfaced last week.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today’s blog also reveals what users will need for the adapter. This includes a DisplayPort cable that works with DisplayPort 1.4, a Steam account, and a PC that meets minimum requirements.</p>



<p>Some of those requirements will include 8 GB of RAM, an Intel Core i5-7600 or AMD Ryzen 3 3100, and a USB direct connection. And although the adapter was built for PlayStation 5, some key features are absent when you play on PC. Some examples include headset feedback and adaptive triggers.</p>



<p>The blog further warned fans that “performance may vary depending on your PC setup” and individual SteamVR title requirements.</p>



<p>In August, the new PlayStation PC adapter will give fans access to Steam’s extensive library of VR games. That includes titles such as Half-Life: Alyx, Fallout 4 VR, and more.</p>



<p>Most recently, Sony also held a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a> that teased over a dozen games coming to the PlayStation 5.</p>

                <p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it will be releasing a PlayStation VR 2 PC adapter on August 7 at select retailers, including the PlayStation Direct store. The device will cost $60.</p><p>In order to use the adapter, players will also need a separately sold DisplayPort cable that's compatible with DisplayPort 1.4, as well as a Steam account. The PC also needs to meet some minimum specifications.</p><ul><li><strong>Operating system:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit/Windows 11 64-bit</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5-7600 / AMD Ryzen 3 3100 (Zen 2 or later architecture is required)</li><li><strong>RAM/memory:</strong> 8 GB or more</li><li><strong>GPU:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or later (Turing or later architecture is required) -NVIDIA RTX series-AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later/AMD Radeon RX 6500XT or later</li><li><strong>DisplayPort:</strong> DisplayPort 1.4 (must have a standard DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort output port)</li><li><strong>USB:</strong> Direct connection only</li><li><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Bluetooth 4.0 or later</li></ul><p>To set this up, plug PSVR 2 to the PC using the adapter, then download the PSVR 2 and SteamVR apps from Steam.</p><p>The biggest difference between playing PSVR 2 on PS5 and PC are the available features. Ones like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (apart from rumble) are not available when playing on PC. However, 4K visuals, 110-degree field of view, 3D audio, finger-touch detection, and other sensory features are supported.</p><p>Back in February, Sony announced that it was testing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-adding-pc-games-support-in-2024/1100-6521290/" data-ref-id="1100-6521290">PC compatibility to its PSVR 2 headsets.</a> While the PC compatibility expands the market, the headset is quite expensive for console users, as it requires a PS5 and the total cost for the two devices is around $1,000.

                <p>If you were hoping to see one last surprise at the end of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6521816/">Summer Game Fest Live</a>, Geoff Keighley has some bad news for you: What you see is what you get. In a <a href="https://m.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent stream</a>, the host acknowledged that while a last surprise is often a tradition at game showcase events, this year's SGF will not have one.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's not really one of those shows," Keighley explained. "Our shows don't typically have that." He noted that neither Gamescom Opening Night Live nor The Game Awards (two events that he's known for hosting) do not feature those sort of "bonus" announcements. However, he did say that the organizers put "a lot of thought" into the order of the reveals and trailers, from the first game to the last game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ2Clscn0Jg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FZ2Clscn0Jg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">He then cited a humorous example, saying that those who expect Gabe Newell to walk out at the end and announce Half-Life 3 will be disappointed. "It'd be cool, but it's not happening on this show," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Summer Game Fest 2024 will take place on Friday, June 7 at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. The show will now take the spot formerly held by E3, the long-running video game trade show once seen as the premier event in gaming, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-is-permanently-canceled/1100-6519882/">permanently canceled</a> last year. While we don't know much about the event, we do know that it will feature a full reveal of Batman: Arkham Shadow, a VR game.

The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.</p>

<p>The new video shows off the game's spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjQ5hyo-Jkk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge/old-school-thrills-new-school-polish">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>.

<p>When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today's trailer confirms that it's also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Cyan Worlds has announced the release date of the Riven remake, set for June 25th, with the game being available on PC, Mac, Meta Quest 2, and Meta Quest 3. This complete overhaul of the classic 1997 game brings back many of the original creators to re-envision Riven for modern audiences. The original itself was the sequel to Myst and had built upon the foundations of that influential puzzle game too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Riven Launch Trailer PC 16x9 4k FINAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LN1TQm942_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remake of Riven will have new content, such as additional puzzles and an expanded storyline beyond the original game. It will also feature an enlarged world encompassing environments like jungles and caverns across the game’s five islands, offering both familiar secrets for veteran players and fresh content for all players to enjoy. The flatscreen and VR versions of Riven are being developed concurrently to ensure a consistent experience across all platforms. The release date for PC and VR has been announced, but the console release date remains unconfirmed at this time.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2646460/view/4150709171067099848" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam over the weekend</a>, developer CampFire Studio and publisher Qooland Games announced that&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>sales reached a total of 100,000 in just 31 hours.</p>

<p>The two studios go on to say that the game reached the number two spot on Steam's global bestseller list in just four hours, and that after eight hours,&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>was in "the top 1 position for paid games worldwide".</p>

<p>CampFire and Qooland also point to&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>'s 80% Very Positive review rating on Steam, with the two studios saying they're "immensely grateful" for the support and pledging to "do our utmost to improve the quality of&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>" in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>The game's meteoric rise has been impressive indeed.&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-steam-survival-crafter">released on Friday</a>&nbsp;and quickly found itself climbing the Steam player charts, attracting a peak of almost 17,000 players within a few short hours.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the game's 24-hour player total, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2646460/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to SteamDB</a>, stood at 38,746, which is also its all-time peak player count. Suffice it to say this one's not going away any time soon.</p>

<p>Promising over 500 hours of content in its current state (yes, really),&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>tasks you with building a tribe, exploring the world around you, and scavenging for supplies and resources to help you survive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game offers a "vast world" to explore, with plenty of different biomes to discover and creatures to fight. It's in Early Access right now, where the devs say it will remain "for one year at least".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2646460/Soulmask/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>
Since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/e3-is-officially-dead-say-esa">the death of E3</a>, June has descended into a chaotic clusterfunk of trailers, broadcasts, announcements, and a generalised frenzy of publicity-seeking barking noises. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest</a> has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q &amp; A. "There will be, definitely, new announcements," he said, "but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans." He's mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.
</p>

</iframe> </p>
</figure>
<p>
During the session, Keighley confirmed that a lot of games wouldn't be on show. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will not by shown, for example. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> is also off the table, as is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-wolf-among-us-2">The Wolf Among Us 2</a>. Neither should we expect anything about upcoming BioShock-like shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, nor anything on future <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights At Freddy's</a> games. Keighley contrasted the Summer Game Fest with his other big show, The Game Awards, which is normally the place for reveals, he says.
</p>
<p>
"[The] Game Awards has a lot of usually big surprises - we're thankful for those - and big, new reveals. This [Summer Game Fest] is largely focused on announced stuff...
</p>
<p>
"There definitely are things that are being announced but this is not a show that has a lot of like 'coming in 2026' or '2027', or teasers for games that are years and years out... That's generally what I would say in terms of expectation setting."
</p>
<p>
It makes sense that the largest reveals will not automatically flock to Keighley's flag, given the splintered state of the summer games bonanza in recent years. Even before E3 itself was entirely dissolved, many publishers have been hosting their own events in which bigger announcements are traditionally made. 
</p>
<p>
Keighley did highlight some games that would make an appearance, however, including dino-punching hunt 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: Refantazio</a>, the upcoming fantasy JRPG from the creators of Persona. So that's something! It's worth noting that Geoff's Jambalaya is followed by indie-focused showcases such as Day of the Devs and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolvers-e3-showcase-was-again-a-highlight-in-an-underwhelming-year">historically excellent</a> Devolver Digital Direct.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/riven-preview-everything-old-is-new-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a solid 27 years since the release of <em>Riven</em>, the adventure follow-up to the much-acclaimed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/myst-remake-xbox-and-pc-release-confirmed"><em>Myst</em></a>. Like <em>Myst</em>, <em>Riven</em> is about to see a remake of its own, bringing the original up to scratch using the current generation graphics technology of Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>It’s not an easy task – the original <em>Riven</em> has a lot of history behind it, and as such, expectations need to be set properly in place. <em>Riven</em> is important to its developer, Cyan, who had used the resources Myst provided to really tell a story. To them, they wanted <em>Riven</em> to feel like Lord of the Rings to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/realmyst-masterpiece-edition-pc-review"><em>Myst</em></a>’s Hobbit.</p>

<p>After watching the technology change over the years, and their ability as a company, Cyan felt the time was right to do a revisit to <em>Riven</em> justice.</p>

<p>The goal was simply this: let’s make a 3D version of the original <em>Riven</em> without messing with anything. But then, the team started questioning things and realizing they could change things to make them more coherent. Thus, the changes made had to make sense. It was a meticulous process, but not one done from a corporate standpoint. This was done for the fans.</p>

Whilst the game is 3D, there is an optional 2D and VR mode, with mobile VR also supported throughout.</p>

<p>We had a chance to attend a preview presentation showing off a little bit of the game, as well as take our own turn exploring for ourselves with a special demo build ahead of <em>Riven</em>’s just-announced release date of June 25.</p>

<p>The demo begins with a cutscene, and you, the player character of sorts, are given a mysterious book. This book seems to be important for some reason or another, so it’s best to pay attention. Paying attention is a key aspect of <em>Riven</em> after all.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that things aren’t exactly the same as the original <em>Riven</em>, so for those old fans, rest assured that things have been added for good reason. Expect little details from the start, such as items on the desk in the opening scene. These details are meant for continuity and story reasons prevalent throughout <em>Riven</em>.</p>

<p>This was done so that old players can hopefully get a clue that this isn’t just the same game – it’s a chance to look at it with fresh eyes.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-screenshot-02.jpg?itok=B4o91D3_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-screenshot-02.jpg?itok=FAvoSiWm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the demo continues, you’re thrown in jail immediately, and a man speaks to you in an unknown language. He takes the book you were given and seems excited about it, but his joy is short-lived as he falls and drops the book. Another person appears and sets you free, but not without taking the book with them.</p>

<p>At the jump, with free roaming now available, it’s important for original players to avoid assuming this is the same <em>Riven</em>. Details from the original may have changed and little things like this are part of the enhanced narrative.</p>

<p>Specifically, a lot of effort went into delineating the different areas while still maintaining the visual feeling of the original <em>Riven</em>. So, while there are those changes, the main essence is the same.</p>

<p>For example, you can look through portals and see a bit more than what you could before, and areas with a window to the outside are visible from the exterior.</p>

<p>Exploring around the cliff face in the demo, we eventually come upon a golden room, and outside of it, there is a button you can press to sort of spin it around to open up other places. The room itself has a reason for being there, and the main challenge is figuring out how to use the room to advance through the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-screenshot-03.jpg?itok=qBYUjRIc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-screenshot-03.jpg?itok=9SrbJeYj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There’s a lot more attention to detail throughout this remake, as is the essence of <em>Riven</em>. You can find little daggers, for example, that might suggest some rebels are trying to draw your attention to something. Maybe they’ll help you get around a locked door – it’s important to examine everything you can.</p>

<p>On the presentation side of things, there are a lot of sounds and performances that carried over from the original <em>Riven</em>, including some of the original voice actors. The level crafted in Unreal Engine 5 is beautiful, and the modeling of the rockery and textures are detailed throughout.</p>

<p>It’s these details that allow you to be more observant, which can certainly help when things don’t go the way you expect them to. Be sure to pay attention to what you interact with as the ability to look around in real time is encouraged. It's also noteworthy to express just how relaxing moving around the world of <em>Riven</em> feels to be. You can spend a lot of time just taking in the details, or taking out your journal and reading some of the entries found within. It seems like there will be a lot more to uncover on the narrative side of things in the full release.</p>

<p>While we’re not able to check out the VR capabilities for <em>Riven</em>, the team at Cyan has told us that there will be comfort settings available including a snap camera, teleporting to different areas, smaller windows in some enclosed areas, and even environment settings.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-screenshot-04.jpg?itok=2TRJZESM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-screenshot-04.jpg?itok=8vYoJpg0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The default settings should be comfortable, and there are further accessibility settings overall for things like colorblindness, and a lot of other considerations the team tried to address.</p>

<p><em>Riven</em> will be available for PC, Mac, and Meta Quest 2 and 3. Additional platforms will be forthcoming, but Cyan wasn’t able to say what those are quite yet. The playable demo featured in this preview will be available during the Steam Next Fest this month.</p>

It has upgraded battery life, RAM, storage, and a more ergonomically friendly chassis design, as well as improved cooling and connectivity.</p><p>Internally, you'll find a 1TB M.2 SSD, 24GB of LPDDR5X-7500 RAM, and a monstrous 80Wh battery alongside improved joysticks--rated for 5 million rotation cycles-- and a more precise D-pad. The PC gaming handheld will still be using a Z1 Extreme chipset and the same seven-inch 120Hz VRR screen, but these parts of the original model's design were lauded for offering a powerful gaming experience.</p><p>These changes have made it slightly heavier as it now weighs 678g, but alongside a custom cooling system, lighter circuit boards, and other improvements, the ROG Ally X is aiming to be a longer-lasting and more comfortable device to play your games on. Thanks to its design, the internal storage space can be upgraded easily, and the SD card reader has also been replaced. Hopefully, this will fix the issue of the ROG Ally randomly ejecting Micro SD cards.</p><p>Last year's ROG Ally was a great device when it first launched, even with several issues like the aforementioned poor battery life and its bad habit of weaponizing Micro SD cards. The Z1 Extreme version proved to be more than capable of running demanding games once you'd made a few graphical concessions, and in our own testing, we had titles like Marvel's Spider-Man, Cyberpunk 2077, Street Fighter 6, and Forza Motorsport running very smoothly on it.</p><p>The other big plus was the adoption of a Windows operating system, which gives you more room to download your favorite games from a variety of digital marketplaces, like Steam, Ubisoft Connect, the Epic Games Store, and the Xbox store. If you have a Game Pass subscription, it's quite nice to have a massive library of games right out of the box. Admittedly, Windows on a small screen isn't the best to use, but in terms of performance, it runs pretty smoothly on the ROG Ally.</p><h2>Asus ROG Ally X specs</h2><table dir="ltr"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>Windows 11 Home</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme Processor: Zen 4 architecture, 8-core/16-thread (up to 5.1 GHz boost)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>AMD Radeon Graphics (AMD RDNA 3, 12 CUs, up to 2.7 GHz, up to 8.6 Teraflops)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>APU Power Draw</strong></td><td>9 to 30 Watts</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>7-inch IPS panel (Glossy finish, 500 nits peak brightness, 7ms response time, touch screen)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1920x1080 @ 120 Hz refresh rate (AMD FreeSync Premium)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>24 GB LPDDR5X</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD (2280)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ports</strong></td><td>1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack<br>1x Thunderbolt 4 support DisplayPort / power delivery<br>1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C support DisplayPort / power delivery<br>1x UHS-II microSD card reader (supports SD, SDXC and SDHC)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>80WHrs, 4S1P, 4-cell Li-ion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Power Supply</strong></td><td>65W AC Adapter, Output: 20V DC, 3.25A, 65W Input: 100~240V AC 50/60Hz universal</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>678 g / 1.49 lbs</td></tr></tbody></table>

                <p dir="ltr">The renewed interest in the Fallout franchise has led to one person playing the first game in the post-apocalyptic RPG series on a platform discontinued years ago: Nintendo 3DS. That's right, it's now possible--thanks to a mod--to visit the wasteland in its original form on the handheld system.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-first-game-3ds-mod/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a> spotted that someone is playing through Fallout in a way that didn't seem possible. The RPG is technically only available on PC, without any sort of port on Switch, PlayStation, or Xbox. However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicfallout/comments/1d22ukh/finally_gonna_play_through_and_finish_fallout_1/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-first-game-3ds-mod/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reddit user</a> transferred their "original, legally purchased copy" over to 3DS and says it's "running great." The only issue they've experienced is the fact you have to "cycle between left and right click with [the] L button."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/03/kena-bridge-of-spirits-guides-players-to-xbox-in-august<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is making the leap to Xbox in August. The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.</p>

<p>As the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/22/kena-bridge-of-spirits-anniversary-update-out-next-month-alongside-steam-debut">Anniversary DLC update</a>, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrqpJuUfYKI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>We awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kena-bridge-of-spirits/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review-one-of-the-best-adventures-of-the-year">his review,</a>&nbsp;"Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits." The game was also a sales success, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/10/25/kena-bridge-of-spirits-has-already-recouped-its-development-costs">recouping its development costs</a> a month after its initial release in September 2021.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-official-mod-support-this-september/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=baldurs-gate-3-to-get-official-mod-support-this-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="430" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Larian Studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed in a Community Update</a> on Steam today that the already massive cRPG <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> will soon be getting even bigger with official mod support as part of Patch 7. The Patch will be split into two phases with the first beginning today in the form of a closed alpha for established mod authors in the community. In September Patch 7 will release publically adding the highly requested feature.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-a-universe-of-possibilities-for-baldur-s-gate-3-via-mods" data-injectable="false">A universe of possibilities for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> via mods</h2> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">Even though you can technically download and install mods in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> today, the process is a bit monotonous, especially for those not familiar with modding. Official mod support will streamline the process while also improving compatibility across the various platforms you can play <em>BG3</em> on.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">Support will be implemented via Mod.Io, a popular modding solution that allows developers to integrate modding into their title in a more managed format, allowing the mods to be downloaded and utilized on a variety of platforms.</p> <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">At first, modding will launch on PC via Steam with support coming to Mac, PlayStation, and Xbox shortly after.</p> <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">The Patch 7 update will also implement the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> Toolkit which will enhance the modding process for modders and players alike with the following features:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Access the editor to create your own mods.</li> <li>Upload mods directly to mod.io servers.</li> <li>Load levels read-only to look at all the local entities, as well as the setup, and test your mods in-game while creating them.</li> <li>Get access to our internal editors for supported asset types such as textures and visual models, allowing you to override them directly in your mod through the developer interface.</li> <li>Publish your mod via the editor where it will be moderated and made visible in the in-game browser, or pack your mod locally to upload to a third-party site.</li> <li>Mod UIs through file editing. We will provide documentation that will explain how our internals are set up to solve mod loading/compatibility issues.</li> <li>Within Baldur’s Gate 3 itself, you’ll be able to: <ul> <li>Download and manage your mods directly.</li> <li>Manage multiplayer and save game files through a verification UI.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="false">The Patch 7 update for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 which will include official mod support but also implement new evil endings, bug fixes, and a trove of quality-of-life</em> improvements is set to release this September.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-to-get-crude-ring-in-wuthering-waves.888033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-get-crude-ring-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-to-get-crude-ring-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="205" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Crude Ring in Wuthering Waves is a vital resource. You will need it to level up characters, so prepare to get a lot of it, especially if you have multiple characters in your party who need it for upgrades.</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">Crude Ring is used as an ascension material for Calcharo, Yangyang, Yanwu, and Danjin. At the moment, you do not need it for any weapons in the game.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-get-crude-ring" data-injectable="false">Where to get Crude Ring</h2> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">Crude Ring can be obtained in several ways. Some cost resources, while others are free. I always suggest farming these the free way, where possible, and saving resources for harder-to-get things. It just makes sense to hold on to resources as much as you can, especially when the item you want really isn’t very hard to get.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Farming from enemies</h2> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="195" data-injectable="false">You can farm Exile enemies anywhere on the map, and they have a chance to drop the Crude Ring on death. There are numerous types of Exiles in the game, and they are pretty standard human enemies.</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false"> <li>Exile Leader – normally armed with dual blades and capable of channeling Electro energy.</li> <li>Exile Technician – a caster who can create shields for themselves and others and cast blades of damaging enemies.</li> <li>Standard Exiles – will be armed with either a melee weapon or a gun. They are not a very serious threat.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true"><strong>You can find Exiles all over the map, but they are quite common on the Central Plains, and the Desorock Highlands.</strong></p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Purchase from the weapon shop</h2> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">Crude Rings can also be purchased from the weapon shop in Jinzhou. The weapon store is found in the northeast of the city, near the Synthesis console. It will cost 1500 Shell Credits to buy Crude Ring, and there will be a limit to how many you can purchase each day. Getting your resources this way can get expensive quickly, so it is not really the best way to do things.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Purchase from the in-game store</h2> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">Hands down, the worst way to get anything is to buy it from the in-game store. You really do not need to do this. You can spend 15 Oscillate Corals to get 5 Crude Rings, but it is absolutely not worth it. The inventory for this store also rotates, so they may not be available when you need them. If you are tempted to go this route, I implore you to just go farm some Exiles.</p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">An important note on Crude Ring is that you can use it at the Syntehsiser to make the higher ranked Rings at a rate of 3 to 1. So, you can use 3 Crude Ring to make a Basic ring, and so on. Keep that in mind as you get later into the game and need higher rarities of Ring for ascensions.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-arrive-with-patch-7-in-september.888006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian has announced that official&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod tools will arrive in September, as will everything else that's coming as part of the hotly-anticipated Patch 7.</p>

<p>We first learned that official mod support for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>would arrive as part of Patch 7 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-patch-7">back in April</a>, but we now know roughly when we can expect it, although no final release date has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>The closed alpha for mod support kicks off today, according to a&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4179982568653520452" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community update on Steam</a>, and another test will open up registrations in July, allowing Larian to work through player feedback for the rest of the summer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-aylin.jpg?itok=e2YYe5xO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-aylin.jpg?itok=WTTD3wh- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod tools are just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned community update, Larian also sets out what mod tools and modding support will mean for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, it's possible to mod&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>right now, but implementing an official mod pipeline should make things much smoother and allow for better compatibility between each mod, as well as between mods and the game itself.</p>

<p>You'll still be able to mod&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>outside of Larian's official system if you want to, of course. Modding will use the <a href="https://mod.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mod.io</a> platform and will be PC-only at first, but Mac support, as well as modding support for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S players, is on the cards too.</p>

<p>With that said, PlayStation and Xbox players won't have access to the&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod toolkit, so if you want to make your own mod for the game, you'll need to have a PC to do it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-party.jpg?itok=1GruCJg0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-party.jpg?itok=9nLRutF- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to mod&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>with Larian's official blessing.</figcaption></figure><p>The toolkit will let you create, edit, and upload mods, as well as loading in-game levels on a read-only basis, accessing internal editors, and more. It's set to be a fully-featured mod toolkit that should help you realize whatever crazy dreams you've got for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mods.</p>

<p><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>is out right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/baldurs-gate-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/baldurs-gate-3/9nd58lqtg09t" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Modding support is scheduled to arrive this September.
