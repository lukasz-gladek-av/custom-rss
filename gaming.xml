<p>In a <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/eu/en/topics/18262/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notice on its official website</a>, Konami confirms that <i>Early Days Collection&nbsp;</i>will launch on February 27th on both Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam, bringing "several retro&nbsp;<em>Yu-Gi-Oh!&nbsp;</em>digital titles from the late 1990s and early 2000s" to modern systems.</p>
<p>The collection was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yu-gi-oh-early-days-collection-revealed-for-switch-and-pc-western-release-confirmed">first revealed back in February</a>, at which point it was also confirmed that the package would include games that have only previously been released in Japan. Three more of the collection's games have been announced today as well.</p>

It’s down to $21.99 ($8 off) at Amazon for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJTKYLCB?tag=theverge02-20">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-4-Xbox-X-PlayStation/dp/B0BJTSN9ZC?tag=theverge02-20">Xbox Series X/S</a>. That’s the lowest price we’ve seen for a physical copy, and it’s just in time for Halloween and to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24247055/2004-tech-internet-gadgets-phones-pop-culture">reminisce about 2004 with us</a>.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 4</em> stars series favorite Leon Kennedy, who’s been tasked with infiltrating a cultish compound in Spain to rescue the president’s daughter, one Ashley Graham. It quickly becomes apparent that the cannibalistic desires of the townsfolk aren’t due to sheer psychosis and viral mutation alone. The <em>RE4</em> remake is very faithful to the original third-person action shooter, which was a stark departure from the pure survival horror feel of preceding titles. It won’t have many surprises for those who obsessed over the original nearly 20 years ago. </p><p>That said, if you thought the graphical fidelity of the original is a little too dated to make your skin crawl, you’ll be happy (or terrified) to once again fight your way through hordes of las plagas. Capcom enhanced several scenes and environments to considerably dial up the creepiness. There are also several new gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to crouch and parry, plus new side activities, accessibility tweaks, and several quality-of-life changes like an overhauled attaché that lets you craft ammo. Trust me, you’ll be glad to have it.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam">Read our <em>Resident Evil 4<strong> </strong></em>review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The 2023 version of <em>RE4 </em>is a remake of the 2005 GameCube classic.

It’s down to $799.99 ($400 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-27-Inch-StanbyME-Portable-27LX5QKNA/dp/B0CF44ZMLG?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-stanbyme-go-27-class-led-full-hd-smart-webos-touch-screen-with-briefcase-design-2023/6563000.p?skuId=6563000">Best Buy</a>. The 27-inch wireless TV literally collapses into a briefcase, allowing you to carry it wherever. Inspector Gadget could <em>never</em>. It comes with a bevy of WebOS apps built-in, plus HDMI and USB ports for connecting your own media. The original price tag was a lot to ask for something with aging display tech (it’s an average 1080p TV, albeit one with Dolby Vision and Atmos) and enough heft to deter you from taking a TV literally everywhere you go, but today’s discount helps for those with peculiar needs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24109258/lg-stanbyme-go-portable-suitcase-briefcase-tv-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li>You can get an <strong>Anker Prime 20,000mAh 200W power bank with its charging base</strong> for $109.99 ($75 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0BYP45YVF?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAnker-Prime-Power-Bank-200W-20K-Portable-Charger-3-Port-100W-Charging-Base-Smart-Digital-Display-Compatible-iPhone-15-15-Plus-15-Pro-15-Pro-Max-14-Se%2F5188824224">Walmart</a>, which is matching the combo’s all-time low. Each of its two USB-C ports can handle up to 100W when used alone, and there’s a third USB-A port for other light charging needs. The integrated display clues you in on remaining capacity, charging time, and power draw for each port. You can recharge the portable battery over USB-C, but the charging dock can be convenient if you frequently use it.</li><li>If your phone’s electronic stabilization isn’t keeping your footage steady enough, you can give the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/22/23366496/dji-osmo-mobile-6-smartphone-gimbal-features-price-release-date"><strong>DJI Osmo Mobile 6</strong></a> a try.

The smartphone gimbal attaches to a magnetic clamp that grips your smartphone, an action that’ll automatically launch the DJI Mimo app if you have it installed. The Osmo Mobile 6 introduced a new status display that’ll let you check battery levels and gimbal modes, plus a new control wheel that makes navigating those options easier. With the Mimo app, you can even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24182680/you-can-now-control-your-dji-smartphone-gimbal-from-your-wrist">control it remotely</a> or use Active Track panning to have the phone automatically keep you in-frame.</li><li>Oh yeah, didn’t I say we’re partying like it’s 2004? We wouldn’t recommend you buy a 50-pack spindle of <strong>Maxell CD-R discs</strong> otherwise, which you can get for just $8.14 (about $13 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AL8QC?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. Sure, we were all <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24238184/apple-ipod-mini-2004-retro-tech-steve-jobs">clamoring for iPods</a> by then, but if you happen to have the requisite CD burner, burning your favorite mixtape would be a fun way to commemorate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24270606/2004-week-tech-internet-gadgets-phones-pop-culture">the nostalgic trip we’re on this week</a>. Good luck finding a working copy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169908/napster-would-have-been-25-years-old-yesterday">Napster</a> or Limewire (and virus protection strong enough to handle them).

            <p>Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-hate-to-admit-it-but-i-wish-halo-infinite-had-a-battle-royale-mode">Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode</a><a></a>. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."</p>
<p>Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/halo-infinite-support-studio-hint-at-a-big-project-that-could-be-rumoured-battle-royale-mode">rumours bubbled up a few months later</a> that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".</p><!--more-->
<p>That's pretty much all Clopper had to say, sadly. Here's the full quote from his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-clopper-9300811/">LinkedIn</a>, as passed along by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dev-claims-cancelled-halo-infinite-battle-royale-could-have-been-game-changing/">VGC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>I led a large team of designers working on a cancelled Battle Royale mode for Halo. I believe this product could have been a game changer for the franchise. We loved playing it and working on it, was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancelation.</blockquote>
<p>In the absence of anything further from Clopper, who is now design director at Call Of Duty developer Raven Software, I guess I'll echo Ed's sentiment that Halo battle royale could have been fabulous. The battle royale's star is thoroughly sunk, of course. Everybody's sick of them, even the millions who play Fortnite, which I barely comprehend as a game any longer: it's more of a giant intellectual property festival. Did you know they have an Edward Scissorhands now? Nonetheless, Halo's existing big team modes feel like a natural foundation for an excellent battle royale.</p><p>As Edders argues, one of the genre's virtues is its capacity to act as a flexible hangout space: you can decide exactly how intense you want the experience to be simply by choosing your initial landing site. It reminds me of how I'd chill out on Blood Gulch simply by avoiding the bases and heading for the caves or the deeper dunes. The key thing would be preserving the physics, with such large groups of players involved, because what would a Halo game be without the joy of flipping a Warthog with a surgical grenade throw? </p>
<p>Certainly, I'll take this over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/halos-future-as-an-unreal-engine-game-looks-both-handsome-and-boring-going-by-these-project-foundry-videos">Halo Studios's current visions for Halo as an Unreal Engine series</a>, which seem overly cautious and dedicated to more cosmetic questions of texture and lighting, possibly because the videos in question were designed for the purposes of recruiting Unreal Engine developers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ex-PlayStation executive blamed nine-figure development costs for less willingness among big publishers to take risks. The result is games getting greenlit based on how well their revenue can be modeled instead of whether they feel fun and innovative. </p><p> “You’re [looking] at sequels, you’re looking at copycats, because the finance guys who draw the line say, ‘Well, if <em>Fortnite </em>made this much money in this amount of time, my <em>Fortnite</em> knockoff can make this in that amount of time,’” Layden said. “We’re seeing a collapse of creativity in games today [with] studio consolidation and the high cost of production.” </p><h2 id="h568"><a id=""></a>A ‘hard reset’ on the console arms race</h2><p>During the event, Layden <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-says-console-arms-race-has-plateaued/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-says-console-arms-race-has-plateaued/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was also asked by<em> VGC</em></a></span> if the incremental improvements recently demonstrated in the controversial $700 PS5 Pro show the limits of new hardware.

It has to be super optimal…you have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things.”</p><p>The executive said the console power chase has hit a “ceiling” and called for companies to compete on content rather than specs. “It’s time for a real hard reset on the business model, a hard reset on what it is to be a video game,” he told <em>VGC</em>. </p><p>This isn’t the first time the former Sony veteran <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-acquisition-preservation-1850951069?_gl=1*mdse6v*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTE3MDc1OC4xNzguMS4xNzI5MTc1NzM1LjQwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-acquisition-preservation-1850951069?_gl=1*mdse6v*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTE3MDc1OC4xNzguMS4xNzI5MTc1NzM1LjQwLjAuMA..">has sounded the alarm</a></span> about the long-term health of the gaming industry.

We need to get more people making games.” He suggested companies look to empower up-and-coming developers in growing markets like Indonesia and India.</p><p>But even as many bemoan the death of AA gaming, a middle ground between low-budget indies and $200-million blockbusters, it’s clear some studios are still able to find success in that increasingly precarious sweet spot. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/remnant-2-soulslike-shooter-steam-ps5-crossplay-update-1850686140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/remnant-2-soulslike-shooter-steam-ps5-crossplay-update-1850686140">Last year it was <em>Remnant II</em></a></span>, a <em>Dark Souls</em>-infused loot shooter.

</p><p><strong>Melee Perks</strong>: Chainsword, Power Fist, Combat Knife charged attacks perks get significant damage increase.
</p><p><strong>Basic Auspex Scan</strong>: bonus damage on bosses is reduced by 30%.
</p><p><strong>Melta Charge</strong>: damage to bosses is reduced by 70%.
</p><p><strong>​Enemy Spawn Director PvE</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Tweaked idle spawns.</li><li>Enemy variety within waves is now less random while enemy variety between waves is bigger.</li><li>Extremis enemies can now spawn with additional enemies.</li></ul><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ruthless: Ammo crates have limited refills per player.</li><li>Ruthless: Player's armour reduced by 20%.</li><li>Substantial: Player's armour reduced by 10%</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s worth highlighting the change to fencing weapons’ perfect parry window (Space Marine 2 combat is all about well-timed perfect parries, indeed they’re essential for success on the harder PvE difficulties because they let you follow up with a high damage shot from your pistol).</p><p>Fencing weapons were by far the most popular weapon type in the game due to their more generous perfect parry window compared to the balance weapon type (block weapons can't perfect parry). But Update 4.0 limits fencing weapons' active parry frames to the first half of the parry animation (frames 1-10), whereas pre-patch it covered the entirety of the animation. This means fencing weapons now revolve around parrying at the last moment; indeed it may be the case that the developers wish for fencing weapons to lean on last moment parries.</p><p>In contrast, balance weapons parry frames 11-20, and so require players predict a parry in advance. There are trade-offs here, but the perception of this change right now is currently a negative one, given it halves the active parry frames of all fencing weapons.</p><p>Then there’s the significant nerf to the basic Auspex Scan, which was a popular, some say essential method of doing bonus damage on enemies and bosses (some of the Operations mode bosses are incredibly tough, especially on harder difficulties).</p><p>The change to the Melta Charge has also sparked a backlash. This one-hit high damage piece of equipment (you can only carry one at a time) was often used against bosses to give Space Marines a fighting chance on higher difficulties. Now, players say, they’re next to useless.</p><p>And then there are the changes made to the ruthless and substantial difficulties, which make Operations mode a lot harder for everyone chasing rewards tied to those tiers.</p><p>Even on the new Lethal difficulty, which is designed to be brutally hard, players have complained about its exclusive mechanic that only restores armor from finishers if you stay close to your teammates (restoring armor through finishers is essential to survival in Space Marine 2).</p><p>Anyone who has played Space Marine 2’s Operations mode will know it’s not easy to stick together, especially when playing with randoms. Some of the more raid-style mechanics in the Operations require player coordination while Space Marines do their thing in different spots on the map. Players are now reporting that the radius players must be within to restore armor is tiny. This change, then, feels like a particularly harsh kick in the teeth.</p><p>The backlash has been aggressive and swift. The official Space Marine 2 discord is packed with complaints, as is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1g5ocmw/whats_with_all_the_bullshit_nerfs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Space Marine subreddit</a>. “STOP THE NERF GIVE US FUN,” declared Wyndolll. “Haven't you learned from Helldivers 2 experience? Nerf player = negative reaction.”</p><p>“‘Thanks for the nerfs in my PvE powerfantasy game,’ said no one ever,” said a clearly disgruntled Aspharr. “What’s with all the bullshit nerfs,” added Old_Competition8765. “Extremely disappointing to see this game going the way of Helldivers. Hope they do proper balancing and not this lazy nerf shit.”</p><p>The mention of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is of course a reference to the backlash Arrowhead suffered from doing pretty much what Saber Interactive has done here: nerf the game at a time when players were hoping for buffs. Arrowhead spent a great deal of time, energy, and resources getting its playerbase back on-side, culminating with a recent update that rebalanced the entire game.</p><p>Will Space Marine 2 end up stumbling down the same path? There are early signs players may review bomb the game to voice their displeasure. On Steam, Space Marine 2's recent user review rating remains ‘very positive,’ but at the time of this article’s publication, 181 new negative reviews were left so far today, October 17. That number, many more than is usual for a single day, seems likely to grow.</p><p>For Focus and Saber’s part, in today’s Patch 4 notes they admitted the changes would make Operations mode harder and promised to keep an eye on feedback. The developers made the changes, they said, because they felt Operations mode was too easy, especially after the release of Patch 3. “This is not the last change,” they promised.</p><p>Here’s the statement:</p><p>"With Patch 3 we have noticed that Operations mode became noticeably easier, especially Chaos operations. We are happier with what we have right now compared to what we had on release, because before Patch 3 Chaos missions were unpopular. Still, we think that currently Operations mode is a bit too easy.</p><p>"Overall these changes are going to make Operations mode harder, but it is difficult to measure by how much. We will continue to monitor those changes and will continue to adjust the balance of Operations mode. This is not the last change."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/unknown-9-awakening-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unknown-9-awakening-review.1012239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/unknown-9-awakening-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It only took 10 minutes of playing Unknown 9: Awakening for me to feel a keen sense of deja vu. Taking out enemies in small arenas, watching an emotional story of personal growth, and squeezing between plenty of tight cracks in walls – it’s a formula that feels all too familiar, sticking to the well-established traditions of the "Crevice Crawler" genre. It does try out one or two unique ideas to set itself apart, like mind-control powers that let you play puppet master with your enemies, but the problem is that it executes on the fundamentals significantly worse than its contemporaries. There are certainly glimmers of hope within that new stuff, but any novelty quickly wears off, resulting in a generic and underwhelming slog full of performance issues and other jankiness to boot.</p><p>Set in an alternate-reality version of the early 20th century, you play as Haroona, a distrustful woman who loves spouting trite platitudes that has been imbued with the power to tap into an unseen dimension called the Fold. Her powers let you do typical magic stuff like go invisible for a brief period of time, Force push and pull baddies around like an off-brand Jedi, and enter a ghost form so you can walk around and solve the easiest puzzles ever conceived. You'll use them to worm your way through a series of small arenas separated by cutscenes clearly pining to be the next HBO adaptation – if you’ve played <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-i-review">The Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War</a> then you already get the idea, but instead of finely-tuned combat encounters and nail-biting stealth sections, Awakening offers sloppy fisticuffs and barebones crouch-fests.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Unknown 9: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Despite the extremely generic setup, the worldbuilding here is actually not half bad, and there’s clearly been a lot of time and effort put into establishing this universe’s timeline, lore, and supernatural rules. Like a knock-off Indiana Jones, this alternate version of Earth is home to mystical secrets and hidden histories kept just out of reach in parts unknown, including a mysterious cycle of extinction, a race of beings who cheated death by making themselves immortal, and secret societies vying for paranormal knowledge. Unfortunately, that promising foundation doesn’t do the story itself much good, as Haroona’s predictable tale is full of cliches and unremarkable characters, eventually getting horribly lost in a sea of magical jargon and convoluted references that completely whiffed on any attempt to make me care about what was happening.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Haroona’s predictable tale is full of cliches and unremarkable characters, eventually getting horribly lost in a sea of magical jargon.</p></div><p>A lot of that wonky journey will provide opportunities for sneaking about to dispatch enemies discreetly, but the stealth is extremely run of the mill and offers few innovations. You’ve got a ghostly rock you can throw to distract people and you will, of course, spend plenty of time hanging out in tall grass where no guardsman has ever thought to look. Unfortunately, the hopelessly dumb AI has a hard time detecting you even when you’re making things explode and leaving bodies in plain view. Still, there’s some small enjoyment to be had in the subpar stealth, as feeling like a master of the shadows who can clear an entire area without being spotted is still rewarding to pull off. Plus, your companions will sometimes comment on how sneaky you are if you can get through a section without being caught – that’s a nice touch.</p><p>Sadly, you’ll have fewer opportunities to engage with stealth than you might think, as Awakening railroads you into outright combat frequently and with great relish. This weirdly seems to happen more and more as you get deeper into the roughly eight-hour story, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if it weren't for the false choices it sets up in its skill trees. This simple three-pronged upgrade system makes you better at combat, stealth, or mind control abilities as you collect barely hidden “Gnosis Points,” and does basic things like allow you to remain invisible for longer or make your melee attacks do more damage. After spending the vast majority of my skill points on the stealth abilities tree only to see those encounters dry up, I began to wonder if I’d wasted my efforts and started hedging my bets by investing in other playstyles.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat is easily one of the things Awakening does worst.</p></div><p>It’s really unfortunate that you’ll find yourself in more straightforward combat as you go, too, because it’s easily one of the things Awakening does worst. These wimpy encounters pit you against the same handful of enemy soldiers who wield guns and melee weapons, and they mostly amount to the typical dodging, light attacks, and heavy attacks recipe you’ll have seen in dozens of games before, only less polished. I played my entire run on the hardest difficulty and the AI is so stupid that the vast majority of the time I was able to fudge my way through battles by spamming the same set of attacks and effortlessly moving out of the way of highly telegraphed moves.</p><p>Whether you’re squatting behind crates or punching dumb minions, at least you’ll be able to enjoy Awakening’s best feature: mind-control powers. You can leap out of your body and into others with the press of a button, then use those dim meat puppets to carry out your twisted designs, including activating that unit’s special ability to wreak havoc on the environment or their fellow villains. For example, you can possess one of the big bruisers and use his ground pound ability near a cluster of his friends to deal a ton of damage, or you can take over one of the sniper enemies and have him shoot at a piece of surveillance equipment to make your stealth job easier.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>TieGuyTravis’ Favorite Crevice Crawlers</h3><p>If you enjoy sad stories that incorporate slowly sidling through rocks, then this playlist is for you!</p></div><p>As you progress, you’ll eventually be able to chain-possess multiple enemies in a row, instructing them to perform various misdeeds, then watch it all play out in slow motion, which can be a lot of fun. It’s not exactly revolutionary stuff and starts to grow a bit tiresome by the time you reach credits, but it’s definitely the most entertaining part of an otherwise disappointing adventure. Also, quite hysterically, if you start making your foes kill each other while remaining hidden nearby, they seem only vaguely aware that you’re messing with them and quickly go back to what they were doing – because, again, they are so very stupid. That's definitely not a <em>good</em> thing, but it did at least crack me up with regularity.</p><p>If sloppy encounters and a weak story aren’t discouraging enough, Awakening also suffers from various performance issues, bugs, and general jankiness throughout. The framerate dipped on a regular basis while I was playing on a Ryzen 9/RTX 4090 PC, including during combat in moments that might get you killed. Haroona likes to get stuck on objects and bounce in place bizarrely, and cutscenes do this really weird thing where they jump abruptly between a bunch of shots that only last a couple seconds each, like they storyboarded the scene but never bothered finishing it. That last one is mostly kind of funny, but it also adds to a general lack of polish that makes an already subpar game feel even more feeble.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Unknown 9: Awakening is the kind of routine action-adventure game that probably wouldn't blow me away even if it was executed well – and the fact that it isn’t just makes the whole thing fall completely flat. Everything from the formulaic story to the shallow and dull combat and stealth are well below the standard set by genre peers, and the consistently disheveled performance and bugs don’t do Awakening any favors. There’s at least some fun to be had in its interesting reality-bending powers, especially the mind-controlling abilities that let you briefly play as your foes and sabotage the enemy in clever ways, but these bright spots run their course quickly, leaving us with a wholly underwhelming adventure.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Former 30-year Sony veteran Shawn Layden, who served as one of Sony's top gaming bosses during his tenure, has commented on the state of video game hardware advancements. He said at Gamescom Asia this week that he believes increased power alone no longer moves the needle.</p><p>"It has plateaued. We're at the stage of hardware development that I call, 'Only dogs can hear the difference,'" he said, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-says-console-arms-race-has-plateaued/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported by VGC</a>. "If you're playing your game and sunlight is coming through your window onto your TV, you're not seeing any ray tracing. It has to be super optimal… you have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things."</p><p>Layden went on to say Microsoft and Sony are "fighting over teraflops," but he believes this is not the right approach. Instead, he wants to see game companies "compete on content" because he believes video game consoles have "reached the ceiling."</p><p>The real winner of the so-called console war, Layden said, is AMD. The company's chips help power both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Looking to the future, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">recent report said Sony will partner with AMD once again for the PS6</a>, after Intel reportedly courted Sony for a deal.</p><p>While Sony has yet to officially confirm plans for a new PlayStation console, Microsoft has discussed its intention to create the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">"biggest technological leap"</a> ever for any video game console. It remains to be seen what that means in practice, but a recent report said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">next Xbox could be paired with a handheld device. </a></p><p>Instead of focusing on improvements to gaming hardware, Layden said the video game industry has "reached the precipice" for how games are made, and it's no longer sustainable.</p><p>"We cannot continue to do things that we have done before," he said. "It's time for a real hard reset on the business model, a hard reset on what it is to be a video game."</p><p>Also during his Gamescom Asia speech, Layden spoke about what he believes is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-talks-about-the-collapse-of-creativity-in-aaa-game-development/1100-6527223/" data-ref-id="1100-6527223">"collapse of creativity" in the video game industry</a>.</p>

It's one of Bohemia's most successful game series, and Arma 3 was supported by a number of DLC releases through 2021. The most recent game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arma-reforger-announced-for-pc-and-xbox-launching-today/1100-6503524/" data-ref-id="1100-6503524">Arma Reforger</a>, was released in 2022 and intended as a bridge between Arma 3 and Arma 4.</p><p>Arma 4 will be available on PC and consoles, but further details about the game have yet to be revealed. There are bound to be some upgrades and changes from Arma Reforger, but it may take the better part of three years before we fully know what to expect from the next sequel.</p>

			<p>As the long dark nights set it what could be more attractive than some warm Arizona Sunshine? Sure, you are going to fight past hordes of zombies to get a sun lounger by the pool, but that’s a small price to pay if you want to top up your tan.</p>
<p>The original Arizona Sunshine launched in December 2016 with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/27/arizona-sunshine-playstation-vr-review/">favourable reviews</a> and was followed by a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/arizona-sunshine-2-review/">sequel last year.&nbsp;</a> Vertigo games have now taken all the improvements from that sequel and applied them to a total remake of the original, bringing new graphics, new mechanics and even a few tweaks to the maps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arizona Sunshine Remake Compared –&nbsp;An essential upgrade?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gM9UPrBeUkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story remains the same. Our unnamed protagonist wakes up in their cave seemingly months or years into a zombie apocalypse, but has his spirits lifted when he hears a radio message. Could there be more survivors? A five hour campaign follows which can be played solo or with online co-op as our man works his way through caves, train stations, and factories in a bid to locate the source of the broadcast. </p>
<p>The gameplay loop is fairly predictable, a few zombies at the start of each level and then you reach a blocker of some kind which will require a specific item to let you continue. From then on it’s some exploring, more zombie culling before returning, unblocking the doohicky, and being swarmed by a huge number of zombies.</p>

<p>When I say I huge number I am not exaggerating, the difficulty spikes through the roof. One one encounter I used every single bullet I had but the zombies were still coming and I had to run an lap of the map to lead them away from the exit so I could make a dash for it. You do need to play tactically and take out the fast moving critters first, then the armoured zombies and leave the shamblers till last.</p>

<p>The new graphics allow for plenty of gore with limbs popping off and blood gushing from wounds, plus new lighting, explosions effects. The realistic gun reloading mechanic from the sequel is now in place which really adds the tension, fumbling around for a new magazine, inserting and then cocking the gun may just take a second but when you are being chased by zombies, every second counts.</p>
<p>Arizona Sunshine is fairly simple but a lot of fun, casually head-shotting a zombie in the distance is immensely satisfying and the co-op mode is a laugh, whether it’s waving a bendy sausage at your friend or watching their pained ‘I really need to go to the toilet’ walking animations. </p>
<p>The script is also good. While our man does that video game trope of talking to himself so the player knows what to do, it’s not over used and there’s incidental dialogue which really make you warm to the character. He feels like someone that’s spent a good long while alone and started talking to the Zombies. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the remake has also inherited some of the problems of the sequel, most notably that you can stick you head through certain objects and walls and the screen goes black. When you are being chased by rabid zombies you do not want to lose your vision just because you have backed into the arm of a cactus. The engine does seem to have been improved upon as the pop in that was really annoying in the sequel is not present, although the levels are much smaller. I’m also happy to report I didn’t encounter a single bug, a relief given that the sequel was a bit of a mess when it launched.</p><p>
[agallery ids=”453858,453857,453856″]
</p><p>On top the base game you also a get a Horde mode and both DLC packs in the price which makes up for the shorter campaign, and you can upgrade from the original for $10 which seems very reasonable consdering the huge improvements that have been made.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		It seems odd giving a remake of game a higher score than it's sequel but the Arizona Sunshine Remake takes all of the good elements from it's sequel and thankfully, very few of of the bad elements. Great fun in co-op mode, but playing alone makes it more tense, scary and certainly more of a challenging. 	</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/denuvo-discord-suspended-inappropriate-content</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-denuvo-discord-temporarily-suspended-after-deluge-of-hate-messages.1012203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/denuvo-discord-suspended-inappropriate-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Denuvo moderators have had to temporarily suspend a recently-opened Discord server created to answer community questions, and I'm pretty sure you can guess the reason for that suspension.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Denuvo <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846185023650582821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that it was opening a new Discord server to, ahem, serve as a "platform" for users to express their queries and "receive the answers [they] have deserved all along".</p>
<p>The server featured a mixture of preset FAQs collated from "dozens of users" and "hundreds of...messages" with the ability to ask your own questions directly, with a real member of the Denuvo team stepping up to answer those questions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/denuvo-drm-discord-closed-inappropriate-content-screen.jpg?itok=egsh0JqV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/denuvo-drm-discord-closed-inappropriate-content-screen.jpg?itok=ehVnQP_7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Denuvo is not exactly popular online, as a recent Discord experiment appears to have proven.</figcaption></figure><p>In a move that will surprise precisely nobody who's familiar with Denuvo's reputation online, however, the DRM maker has now <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846897589527912744" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paused the sending of messages</a> on said Discord server.</p>
<p>Upon its opening, it seems that the Discord server was flooded with "nearly 2,000 people", many of whom wanted to ask Denuvo questions. Some, however, just wanted to express their hatred of Denuvo, and others likely just wanted to post memes or jokes.</p>
<p>Disappointingly but predictably, Denuvo points to the "amount of inappropriate content" received on the server as one of the reasons for the pausing of messages; the DRM maker says its "small team" has found moderation of these messages <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846897627905896676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"quite challenging"</a>.</p>
<p>It's for this reason that <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846897647635865995" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"changes" to the server are coming</a>. They'll be implemented across the next few days, although Denuvo doesn't say exactly what those changes are yet. I suppose we'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-denuvo.jpg?itok=y9xwbum_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-denuvo.jpg?itok=GkLkcOeA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games have used Denuvo, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, I'm a little surprised Denuvo itself doesn't seem to have seen this response coming.</p>
<p>It's fair to say Denuvo is probably one of the most hated entities in gaming; <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reveal-of-dying-light-2-denuvo-drm-angers-fans">players hate it</a>, yes, but it's also been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-director-says-denuvo-behind-recent-performance-issues-on-pc">blamed by developers</a> for causing technical issues, so I can't think Denuvo doesn't know its reputation.</p>
<p>Either way, right now, you can't ask Denuvo questions via the aforementioned Discord server, but you can still <a href="https://discord.com/invite/dQs2DKGAjq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">join it</a> if you want to see what prompted the suspension or prepare for the next round of questioning.</p>

                <p>EA has announced a significant change for Plants vs. Zombies 3, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news/soft-launch-announcement-15-oct" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirming</a> that the game is undergoing a "major overhaul" and will be taken offline as the developer reconfigures the game.</p><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3 had a soft-launch earlier this year, and EA said it feels grateful for the "enthusiasm and feedback" that players sent in during this early testing period. With that feedback in mind, EA said it has decided to "re-tool the game" with the aim of making an "even better" experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4386107-zombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386107" data-ratio="0.58587257617729" data-width="722" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4386107-zombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386107"></a><figcaption>Plants vs. Zombies 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4386107-zombies.jpg"></figure><p>EA turned off in-app purchases for Plants vs. Zombies 3 on October 15, and the game is no longer available to download. November 15, 2024 will be the final day to play Plants vs. Zombies 3 in its current iteration. After this, servers will go down and the game won't be playable to anyone, anywhere.</p><p>Players who earned or bought coins with real money will have those balances saved for when the game comes back. However, all game progress, boosts, and narrative elements are being reset.</p><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3 had its soft-launch earlier this year in the UK, Netherlands, Australia, and the Philippines. The original aim was to have the game's full release later in 2024, but those plans have now changed.</p><p>Unlike the more recent Garden Warfare series of shooters, Plants vs. Zombies 3 goes back to the series' roots and is another tower-defense game. Players must protect Neighborville from encroaching zombies, setting up the usual sorts of garden-based traps and defenses with returning favorite plants alongside new ones.</p><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3, from developer PopCap, was first announced in 2019, so it's been a long time coming, and now the wait is even longer for the final product.</p><p dir="ltr">Plants vs. Zombies first released in 2009, and the brand became a hit for PopCap. Plants vs. Zombies 2 released on mobile devices in 2013, centering around a time-travel plot. It received a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/plants-vs-zombies-2-its-about-time/">mostly positive</a> critical reception, but the Garden Warfare spin-off the following year quickly became the new face of PvZ for the last several years. The studio also released a card battler, Plants vs Zombies Heroes, in 2016.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmongold, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch for over half a decade, began his week with <a href="https://kotaku.com/asmongold-twitch-ban-youtube-gaza-israel-hasan-piker-1851672928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a racist rant</a> against Palestinians and then evidently spent at least part of it doing some soul searching. On Wednesday, he announced that he plans to step away from leadership duties at OTK, a streamer organization he co-founded, as well as Starforge, a PC company he co-owns. He also intends on streaming less. His goal: self improvement.</p><p>"I've been an asshole,” he said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSI-N-QHNTQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a YouTube video posted yesterday</a>. “I think that I've devolved for the last two years. I think that I've negatively affected other people too, in ways that I hate– I don't even hate to say this. I think I need to say this. I need to say it more: I've negatively affected people in ways that I regret."</p><p>He also discussed his experience of the past few days, since his rant went viral.</p><p>"I'm getting all these people making negative comments toward me,” Asmongold said. “Everyone is telling me 'Oh, go kill yourself, I hate you' – everything like this. You know who reached out to me? And they wanted to talk and have a conversation and see if I was OK? People that were Islamic and people that had family in fucking Palestine. How humiliating is that? How absolutely humiliating is that? And these are the people I was trying to say were bad.

But I want to do it for myself, because I don't like believing what people tell me. I think that when I do, I end up being a fool. And I want to see it. I want to see it for myself and experience it.”</p><p>It is a whiplash-inducing about face for Asmongold, whose comments earlier this week got him suspended from Twitch and also prompted statements from <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1846690831261945954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OTK</a>, <a href="https://x.com/StarforgePCs/status/1846625010456105071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starforge</a>, and affiliated indie publisher <a href="https://x.com/MadMushroomGG/status/1846691386361274622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Mushroom</a>, as well as <a href="https://x.com/TipsOut/status/1846302400988303489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lengthy missive from OTK CEO Tips Out</a>, who is of Syrian descent. (OTK, which also includes other big names like Mizkif, Esfand, and Emiru, began in 2020 with a core crew of edgier streamers but has spent the intervening period chasing brand-friendly legitimacy via the aforementioned additional companies, as well as regular events like an annual award show. This is <a href="https://www.jacobwolf.report/p/otk-cofounder-rich-campbell-resigns-amid-sexual-assault-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not its</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-mizkif-mma-brawl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first controversy</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>“If you want to consider a genocide as a systematic killing of a group of people, they have genocide built into Sharia Law right now,” Asmongold said <a href="https://x.com/CapriSunnPapi/status/1845897719203737655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during his initial Monday stream</a>. “So no I’m not going to cry a fucking river when people who have genocide that’s baked into their laws are getting genocided. I don’t give a fuck. They’re terrible people. It’s not even a question. It’s crazy people don’t see it that way. They’d be doing the same thing.”</p><p>He also insisted that Palestinian culture was <a href="https://x.com/HasanabiProd/status/1845889127629176966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“inferior”</a> when compared to Western cultures. Negative reaction from the Twitch community was swift.&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey Asmongold, what about my 'culture' makes it okay to genocide my friends/family?" CapriSunnPapi, a Palestinian and Lebanese streamer, <a href="https://x.com/CapriSunnPapi/status/1845897719203737655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>, echoing a sentiment shared by many others.</p><figure><blockquote><p>You know who reached out to me? And they wanted to talk and have a conversation and see if I was OK? People that were Islamic and people that had family in fucking Palestine. How humiliating is that?</p></blockquote></figure><p>Also on Monday, Asmongold proceeded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukVFg1OlA0M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spend hours</a> navigating the labyrinth of contradictions that is his worldview with leftist politics streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, who to his credit largely used the conversation as a teachable moment. In the face of Piker’s history lesson about Israel’s decades-long oppression of Palestine and how something like that can take people’s focus away from social progress, Asmongold repeatedly argued that Palestinian culture is nonetheless inferior because Hamas is incredibly regressive when it comes to issues like queer rights – never mind that Hamas is not Palestine and that Palestine’s people are not a monolith.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the same Asmongold who has spent the better part of a year <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crusading against perceived “DEI” initiatives in games</a>, something that has involved whipping <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AsmonTV/search?query=dei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of viewers</a> into a frenzy over so-called “woke” games, which often include queer characters or explore queer themes. During his conversation with Piker, Asmongold seemed to care more about people’s freedom to practice or express LGBTQ+ ideas than said people – something which, in fairness, he acknowledged has been eroded in the United States, potentially turning America’s culture “inferior” as well. Despite clear evidence that cultures change over time for good and for ill, however, Asmongold expressed skepticism that such a thing could happen in Palestine, even if its people were not under the threat of constant violence and oppression. He also spoke in the sorts of absolutes characteristic of somebody who spends too much time online and not enough time touching grass.</p><p>"I agree with you that [Palestinians cheering when those oppressing them are harmed] is understandable,” Asmongold said to Piker. “But I think that understandable bad behavior in a lot of cases is still, in fact, bad behavior. It's impossible to know what somebody else would do in a circumstance they're not part of, but what I do know is, when I see a group of people that are celebrating a bunch of innocent people getting killed, then I think that group of people is doing something that's wrong. And I think that it's universally wrong."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"You'd be the one teenager in Gaza being like 'Hold on, guys. Let's not celebrate the Iranian retaliation against this country that has, like, literally eviscerated my family,’" replied Piker.</p><p>“I would be cheering it on,” said Asmongold. “I’d be like ‘Yes! Fuck yes!’ But I wouldn’t be sitting on a soapbox, saying that I’m the good guy.”</p><p>“They’re not the good guys in this situation,” said Piker. “They’re the victims, and that’s the point.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="DEBATING ASMONGOLD ON PALESTINE" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukVFg1OlA0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Perhaps seeing more of the world will help Asmongold recognize the complexity of these situations – and of the real human beings who’ve experienced them, rather than the hypothetical concepts of human beings. Disavowing some of his own preconceived notions, as he did in today’s video, is a solid first step. Demonstrations of contrition like this are rare on today’s internet – especially from big-time content creators with millions of followers who’ve espoused reactionary viewpoints – which means they’re more important than ever. There’s also evidence that they can move the needle for viewers. Stories of far-right radicalization via content creators are common, but de-radicalization happens too. Piker even used it as an example of people – and, as a result, cultures – changing during his conversation with Asmongold.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a shit ton of people that are in my community that used to be right wing on one issue or many other issues that have, over time, understood and demonstrated empathy and have changed their minds on these issues – and no longer consider themselves to be conservative,” Piker said.&nbsp;</p><p>If Asmongold is curtailing some of his own worst behaviors, that could prove good for the many viewers who look up to him, too. In addition to pernicious reactionary stances, Asmongold has over the years become synonymous with a brand of messy degeneracy that even he, himself, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWqIhkiJk9A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has acknowledged</a>. In his new video, he acknowledged that he’s over-prioritized his online life at the expense of all else.</p><p>"Streaming is my entire life,” he said. “Doing this is my entire existence, and I think that the process of that has been extremely unhealthy for me. It's allowed me to become such a one-dimensional person that I'm not even a person anymore. It's like in <em>Dark Souls</em>; I'm going Hollow or something. … I’m going to try to clean up part of my house, and I’m not going to hire a cleaner."</p><p>"I think I need to do this for myself,” he continued. “I need to take accountability for things that I've done and for letting my life get this out of control. ... I want to live for the idiots out there who are looking to me to be a role model. Not a good idea! But there are people that will see that and they'll think maybe to themselves 'Maybe I should do the same thing.' And if I can do that for one person, well, I've already done it for myself. I've already done a good thing, and so it can only get better."</p><p>Many viewers are excited to see Asmongold clean up his act, in some cases literally.</p><p>“Cleaning room stream would be the most viewed of all time,” reads one YouTube comment with over 7,000 upvotes.</p><figure><blockquote><p>If you think that means my first stream back is going to be playing <em>Dustborn </em>and promoting Sweet Baby, I think you'll be very disappointed.</p></blockquote></figure><p>But for these measures to be effective, they must be considered and consistent. Asmongold’s ability to stick with them remains in question. It doesn’t help that the audience Asmongold has built up by publishing anti-”woke” ragebait has, predictably, reacted to his apology with horror and shock.</p><p>“Never apologize to the mob,” reads one comment on his video with over 11,000 upvotes.</p><p>In the video, Asmongold urged viewers to hold him accountable – to drag him back onto the path to decency if he once again goes astray.&nbsp;</p><p>"I hope that this is the next part of the rest of my life, and I want you guys to hold me accountable to that,” Asmongold said. “So if I'm being a fucking asshole again – if I'm being mean, if I'm just being callous, acting like a psychopath, just treating people awfully, outside of a <em>WoW </em>raid when they get killed by fire, but really laughing at people's misfortune – try to say 'Man, just chill the fuck out. Stop it. Just stop.' And I'm gonna do my best to listen."</p><p>But the problem with Asmongold’s audience is that it is, well, Asmongold’s audience. Listening to them is, to some degree, how Asmongold got here in the first place. He acknowledged that issue earlier in the same video.</p><p>"When you get lost in the sauce and you get fixated around listening [to] and reading feedback – just getting hyper-fixated; this is, like, your entire life – you lose a perspective on reality," he said. "And you lose a perspective on the world."</p><p>Streamers are often emboldened by their own self-created echo chambers, and Asmongold has built a machine that’s at odds with his new goals. After reactions to the video flooded in on Wednesday, Asmongold published a post to his subreddit titled “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1g574c2/why_apologize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Apologize?</a>” In it, he further outlined why he felt he’d reached a breaking point, but also made sure to add that “if you think that means my first stream back is going to be playing <em>Dustborn </em>and promoting Sweet Baby, I think you'll be very disappointed.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Take a break,” one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1g574c2/comment/ls8xa82/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in response</a>. “Us Chuds will be here waiting for you to make streaming great again.”</p><p>“Don't worry, I'll react to a DEI=DIE gaming video first day back to stream,” Asmongold replied.</p><p>“Thank God,” replied another fan. “I hope this side of you never change[s].”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ever been in a position where two people are really going at each other, hurling pointed jabs and insults back and forth, and you're stuck in the middle? Well then, perhaps you'll empathise with the enemies in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/archons">Archons</a>, a twin-stick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-like where you control two characters at once, and attacks bounce between them automatically as they move about the arena. I gave the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.</p>

<p>Archons doesn't try to hide its influences. The developer very clearly asked themselves one day: what if you took Vampire Survivors, and substituted the main character for two High Templar from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>? Also, each character is independently controlled by one gamepad stick, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons</a>.</p>

<p>It sounds like a gimmick, and it is. But it also feels nicely put together. The attacks are punchy and precise, the chaos is pretty, and I could always tell what was happening on-screen despite the oodles of juicy bugs flinging themselves at me the whole time. Best of all though, every single attack is synced up to the music. Goddamn, I love it when things are synced up to the music.</p><p>It certainly requires a lot more active thought than the far simpler Vampire Survivors. My first attempts to split my attention between both my archons at once were laughably blunderous. It feels like a muscle I'd have to work out often before it becomes second nature. That also means Archons will likely never recapture the same popularity as the granddaddy of this fledgling sub-genre. It's simply far easier to reach those dopamine highs in Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>That's fine with me though, because I'm pretty much done with Vampire Survivors, and I'm glad games are cropping up which offer their own spin. I imagine for a lot of people, the added finnickiness of Archons flies in the face of why people play these fairly mindless Survivor-likes. But it hits just right for me. I like that you have to be a lot more thoughtful and focused in Archons if you want to survive more than a minute or two.</p>
<p>If you want to give Archons a go, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3192850/Archons_Demo/">check out its demo on Steam</a>. I just played it one more time, and survived for 10 minutes, finally dying to the boss of the first area. If you survive longer than that (or beat the boss), you're officially better at video games than me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebuchadnezzar">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, which Nate Crowley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nebuchadnezzar-is-two-thirds-of-the-perfect-historical-city-builder">called</a> "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/county-of-fortune">County Of Fortune</a>, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a>, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> later. 
</p>
<p>
"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3204330/County_of_Fortune/">Steam page</a>, and here's a trailer.

<p>
"In County of Fortune, you're not just managing a single city, but an entire county," the press release continues. "The game focuses on the bigger picture: managing multiple settlements and their development, overseeing logistics, and making sure resources flow effectively across your region without worrying about individual buildings.
</p><p>
"Furthermore, as your county expands, unique cultural traits will emerge, based on the characteristics you cultivate in each settlement," it continues. "These traits influence how your communities develop, making each region or even village in the county unique. And it also brings interesting interactions between settlements and even between their leaders."
</p>
<p>
My thoroughly piqued interest is heightened by the discovery that the game is set in (procedurally generated) England, made up of towns like Winchelsea and Chipping Campden that sound like they've been AI hallucinated based on episodes of I'm Alan Partridge, but then you fire up the Googlebox and my word, there <em>is</em> such a place as Chipping Campden. No, there really is! It's in Gloucestershire. 
</p>
<p>
If you're from Chipping Campden, don't get chippy - I've got nothing but good things to say about Gloucestershire, home of the Witcombe Music Festival. It's not like you're from Cheshire. The only things I know about Cheshire are that it consists of cheese and cats and is on the other side of stinking, sewage-drinking Manchester. And don't get me started about Cumberland. They share a border with my own county of birth, North Yorkshire, and we have never forgiven them for allying with the Picts in, er, I think it was 300 AD.
</p>
<p>
As all this hopefully indicates, I can see how a game based around understanding and manipulating the relationships between villages and counties could be entertaining, perhaps even radical. The builder/management genre is vast, mind you, and it's likely something similar has been attempted before.</p><p>I am hungry for specifics. What kinds of social organisation or leadership style will the game support? How extreme will the disparities be - could we end up in a situation reminiscent of Ursula Le Guin's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed">The Dispossessed</a>, with villages of anarchists and capitalists treating each other like alien planets? Is warfare a feature? 
</p>
<p>
The press release will not say. It merely concludes that "we believe County of Fortune will resonate with players looking for something new in the genre - a deep, adaptive experience that challenges them to plan across the entire map, rather than focusing on individual cities." Fine, keep your secrets. But please, enough killing of genres. That's the kind of thing they get up to in Cheshire, when they're not making cats out of cheese.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/megalopolis-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Megalopolis </em>has a lot of mind and more on its shoulders. It is the presumptive capstone to Francis Ford Coppola’s 60-year career in film, the showpiece for which he has traded his long-running wine business, an 85-year-old’s sincere message of hope for the future of this world, and–unexpectedly, tragically–a dedication to Coppola’s late wife and collaborator of 61 years, Eleanor. It’s hard not to be moved by that dedication as the credits roll. But there’s also a brief pang: of all the films Coppola could have dedicated to her memory, <em>Megalopolis </em>is the one offered in tribute, a deeply silly paean to traditional virtues and structures, comforting itself that in the face of seemingly terminal decline and advancing evil, love will save us. “Dover Beach” but self-financed to the tune of 120 million dollars and featuring a scene where Aubrey Plaza plays a character named Wow Platinum who gets eaten out by Shia LeBeouf.</p><p>There is perhaps nothing quite so ominous about the opening minutes of <em>Megalopolis </em>than its clear debt to <em>The Fountainhead, </em>and specifically King Vidor’s misguided 1949 adaptation starring a thoroughly out-of-his-element Gary Cooper as Rand’s great hero, Howard Roark. Coppola’s equivalent is Adam Driver’s Cesar Catilina, shown here bestriding the skyline like an Olympian god before heroically dynamiting public housing.</p><p>Catilina, a polymath architect and engineer, has discovered a marvelous new material, megalon, that will enable him to build an urban utopia–a megalopolis, if you will–thanks to megalon’s power to resist and even reverse entropy, outlive the doomed decadence of his New Rome. (New Rome standing in here for New York, apparently in an alternate timeline where Tinto Brass’s <em>Caligula </em>remade American culture so thoroughly that forty years later the hottest thing going is still two girls with Roman maiden perms making out on top of a limo.) Megalon enables new architectural forms, like towering buildings that grow from the land like sequoias and coral, and incredible experiments in urban mobility like… moving walkways and escalators. But it is also the stuff of the gods, a sticking plaster for the body and spirit that can restore a shattered body and mind to perfect health.</p><figure></figure><p>Who would fight against re-founding society on the basis of megalon? Catilina’s adversary, Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), the mayor of New Rome, who is rooted in the material present in contrast with Catilina’s focus on the immortal future. He is a well-meaning but overmatched functionary: late in the film, his daughter Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel) sees him not as a powerful ruler but a man mired in quicksand filling his office, blissfully doing paperwork at a desk that is canted downward like the deck of a sinking ship.</p><p>Julia becomes the chief point of contention between the two men, as she falls in love with Catilina right after he tells her what a vapid piece of crap she is. Here we must give credit to <em>The Last Jedi:</em> it recognized that Adam Driver or no, this is not the play. But here, Julia is a high-spirited woman-child who lets herself be guided by Catilina and in return functions as his muse. Grimly, the thing that breaks through their impasse is when she spies a child’s playset in Catilina’s office and he encourages her to play with it herself, awakening her to the beauty of his vision while revealing that she is sufficiently elevated to understand the future he seeks to build.</p><p>But Julia discovers that far from being a man of the future, Catilina’s eyes are locked on the past. In this he faintly echoes Coppola’s version of George S. Patton, another lonely visionary alternately inspired and haunted by what he sees through the veil of history: a world of Roman and Carthaginian triumphs and the glorious, pitiful dead baking in the Mediterranean sun. As the forces of reaction line up against Catilina and his brilliant creations, I was reminded most strongly of <em>Tucker: A Man and His Dream</em>, a movie I’d forgotten Coppola directed, where a lone auto designer finds himself the enemy of his industry because he dares to build the kind of better, safer car that Detroit loathes. </p><figure></figure><p>That film, more modest in its goals, was a more persuasive portrait of a capable dreamer with all the forces of malicious complacency and greed aligned against him–in part because his dream was easy to understand. Catilina’s vision of megalon and megalopolises is juvenile in its principles and its specifics: he is going to build a great, 15-minute city with moving walkways and buildings that look like Krypton by way of Hudson Yards’ Vessel. But the city doesn’t really matter, Catilina hastens to assure Julia and the audience at one point. What matters is the conversation <em>about </em>the city. At the climax of the film, Catilina wins the people over with a direct address from atop a coral-like prominence in his model megalopolis, intoning that what we need is a great debate about the future, in which all take part. It’s a prayer for democratization and civility from a character who seized control of the public square and public space and remade it in his image, but who thinks in opening the comments section he is saving civilization.</p><p>Driver and Esposito are good enough performers to make horrendous material almost workmanlike if they fully commit, and indeed, they prove a pair of sirens who lured Coppola away from the salvation of a rewrite. A good moment, suggestive of a better picture, arrives when Julia attempts to bring Catilina and Cicero together over a family meal. Catilina decides to engage the old man in a debate. His opening salvo sounds neat enough, and Cicero smiles appreciatively at the gesture before informing Catilina that he’s misidentified who he is quoting. “Mis-quoting, actually,” Cicero adds with a condescending little smile, before offering a rebuttal from Marcus Aurelius. For a moment the characters have the gravitas the film so often struggles to attain. If you have the option of putting Driver, Esposito, Emmanuel and Kathryn Hunter (playing Cicero’s wife) around a table to hash out their litany of issues, couldn’t that be 80% of the picture? Shouldn’t it be? You wonder how much better it might have been if the film had given free rein to its Shakespearean impulses rather than settling for quotation and pastiche.&nbsp;</p><p>But the intellectual pretense of <em>Megalopolis </em>is just that. The characters have so little to actually say. They just keep quoting Aurelius, the Roman philosopher-king who became so fashionable in recent decades, especially among the super-rich of Silicon Valley. Immediately you can see why Coppola fared so much better with <em>The Godfather</em>. Puzo’s novel had Machiavelli and Caesar and Augustine lurking in the background of every scene, but he knew it’s better if instead of quoting them a character just pulls out a gun and whacks somebody. Adapting him, Coppola threw out most of the speeches in the book and trusted filmmaking and acting to get the thrust across. With <em>Megalopolis</em>, it’s the opposite. When the character's have an idea, it feels like to get it across they have to sneak glances at copies of <em>Bartlett’s</em> between shots.</p><figure></figure><p>Coppola’s love for the material is evident. <em>Megalopolis </em>is bursting at the seams trying to fit in all the bits of moviemaking he adores. The element of Coppola’s filmmaking that I think is most satisfying here is that frequently and unashamedly works with the kinds of shots and sets that defined the silver screen filmmaking that the death of the studio system and the arrival of Coppola’s generation helped consign to history. If so much of <em>Megalopolis </em>is going to be filmed on soundstages with digital mattes, the scenes might as well evoke old movie sets: Catalina’s office is dressed and redressed to be a lavish Art Deco study, a cozy floating nest, and a bustling dream factory. An evening drive through the city takes on an otherworldly cast using reverse projection, the characters seeming to drive through a movie playing outside their windows.&nbsp;</p>

It was pulled so damn hard that Sony wiped it from their web pages and literally deleted it from the scant few customers’ accounts, as if trying to salt the earth from which it had once grown. It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before.</p><p>So why, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to <em>SteamDB</em></a></span>, is <em>Concord</em> still regularly being updated, most recently on October 10?</p><p>The game is no longer available on Steam, and with the servers shut down, it’s not possible for anyone who <em>did</em> buy a copy to play any more. Not that this really interrupted many people’s schedules, given the multiplayer shooter somehow never managed more than a miniscule 697 playing at the same time. For context, at the time of writing, <em>Dune Awakening</em>, a game that <em>isn’t out until next year</em>, saw a peak of 696 people playing in the last 24 hours, while 2013's barely-known racing sim <em>rFactor 2 </em>saw 698. <em>Concord</em> was a AAA first-party Sony game released alongside an international advertising campaign. It’s <em>bemusing</em>.</p><h2 id="h1561"><a id=""></a>Someone, somewhere, is still playing <em>Concord</em></h2><p>Yet, someone, somewhere is still tweaking at its code. In fact, some people are still playing it. Admittedly only two of them in the last 24 hours, but five people were playing at once on October 5. They, logic dictates, can only be people from within Firewalk Studios, the in-house Sony development team who made the game.</p><p>Does this confirm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s vague allusion toward one day reviving the game</a></span>? It’s not impossible, obviously, and you can bet your teeth there are people at Sony in very expensive suits asking other people in very expensive suits how they can possible claw back some of the better part of half a billion dollars. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/sonys-failed-shooter-concord-has-been-updated-dozens-of-times-on-steam-in-october-and-im-starting-to-feel-a-comeback/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/sonys-failed-shooter-concord-has-been-updated-dozens-of-times-on-steam-in-october-and-im-starting-to-feel-a-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> certainly seems to be more optimistic about this possibility.</p><p>My take is slightly different. I think there’s an office inside Firewalk’s Bellevue, Washington headquarters that’s been abandoned since the closure of the game. There’s still paperwork on various desks, a few small plushies hanging from the side of a monitor yet to be reclaimed, and a collection of old coffee mugs now growing mould. The lights haven’t been switched on for weeks, and there’s one ceiling tile hanging loose that no one’s pushed back into place. But if you were to walk past the glass doors of that room at 2 a.m., you would see the faint, blue light of a single monitor, casting its gloom on a hunched individual, a hoodie pulled up over their head, tapping away at the keyboard between furtive glances toward the door.</p><p>That’s Dave. Dave cannot let <em>Concord </em>go, no matter what is bosses have told him. Dave is going to save his game, you’ll see.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>GSC Game World, developers of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, have confirmed that the game will run at 30 fps on the Xbox Series S at launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/stalker-2-interview-xbox-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-dlc-expansions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, the developers revealed that Stalker 2 will ‘stick to 30 fps’ for the Xbox Series S. On the Series X, the game runs at 60 fps, dropping to 55 at times. In some situations, the developers hit the 60 fps mark for the Series S, but the consistency did not match the likes of the Series X. However, GSC is “looking to get a performance mode for Xbox Series S, to get it to 60 FPS”, and they think “it’s possible”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers initially thought it would be “impossible” to release Stalker 2 for the Xbox Series S due to the game’s mechanics and “huge amount of things.” However, after they started optimizing, using Unreal Engine’s features for steaming information, and squeezing up “every megabyte from every piece of system content,” things began to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers added that, after optimizing Stalker 2 for the Xbox Series S, they believe any game can reach the platform’s “memory limits.” At the same time, they understand that not every developer has the time and resources to optimize. But GSC’s optimization efforts have also helped the PC build for the game, “making it a lot more performant.” Due to that, Stalker 2 has “quite low minimum PC requirements for a modern game.”</p>

                <p>During a Gamescom Asia panel, former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden spoke about the current state of the gaming industry and how the disappearance of AA studios had contributed to a "collapse of creativity" in modern games. Layden explained how the rise in development costs had led to studios placing a stronger emphasis on post-launch monetization plans and following trends to remain risk-adverse.</p><p>"You didn't worry so much about the end piece, for better or for worse. Of course back then you didn't make a game for millions [of] dollars. So your risk tolerance was fairly high, Layden said (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-aa-is-gone-and-thats-a-threat-to-the-ecosystem-going-forward" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesIndustry.Biz</a>). "Today, the entry costs for making a AAA game is in triple-digit millions now. I think, naturally, risk tolerance drops. And you're [looking] at sequels, you're looking at copycats, because the finance guys who draw the line say, 'Well, if Fortnite made this much money in this amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this in that amount of time.' We're seeing a collapse of creativity in games today [with] studio consolidation and the high cost of production."</p>

<p>Layden added that while the quality of indie games had risen, the AA space that had been dominated by companies like Interplay, Gremlin, Ocean, and THQ has seemingly vanished. With the options being either indie games or AAA blockbusters, Layden believes that this is a dangerous situation for the gaming industry to be in right now.</p><p>"Now if we can just get a bit more interest and excitement and exposure for these lower-budget, but super-creative and super-unusual [types] of games. I'd like to see more of that.

The reviews run positive (when you filter out the bigoted weirdos with an axe to grind), but the sales ran so soft Ubisoft </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-delays-assassin-s-creed-shadows-promises-day-one-steam-launch">delayed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> its next open-world action-adventure game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why are sales so sluggish? I have my theories, but they have far more to do with the saturation of the open-world genre and some bad pre-release word of mouth than the bigoted brigading. And as much fun as I'm having, I can't help but notice there's a certain "X factor" missing from parts of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What is that "X factor?" Well, if I knew exactly what it was and how to execute it, Disney would probably have hired me already to team up with Dave Filoni. But it's something that's been scratching at me as the series has advanced, a question I keep asking: why do people love Star Wars, and what about it drives such intense reactions?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I quizzed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creative director Julian Gerighty about this at Gamescom. "This is our shared mythology," he said. "It's 100 percent George Lucas's obsession with the monomyth...it is so refreshing, so familiar, but with the alien twist."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, Star Wars itself is some kind of universal experience, and its alien elements burn it into our memories.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/star-wars-outlaws-lead-actor-humberly-gonz-lez-made-her-character-a-dreamer-" target="_self">Star Wars Outlaws lead actor Humberly González made her character a 'dreamer'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/how-mythologist-joseph-campbell-made-luke-skywalker-a-hero-1.5262649">familiar</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> analysis. Unfortunately, it's also lacking. Lucas and The Hero with A Thousand Faces author Joseph Campbell have done a great job branding Star Wars as this film that supposedly taps into universal myths about humanity but I've only grown skeptical of that idea as I've gotten older. Brian Jay Jones' book </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29775340-george-lucas">George Lucas: A Life</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> paints a different picture of the beloved director's creative influences, and I personally think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Graffiti">American Graffiti</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a better reference text for the power of the galaxy far, far away than Campbell's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Q9zR4lWyVN8?si=75C9v8orZiTiOW93">sometimes-misogynistic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> philosophy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But I'm wandering off track. Let's look closely at the idea of "familiar, but with a twist" idea that Gerighty described. It's a common bit of advice for creative direction in all forms, especially game development. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is, if nothing else, a fantastic case study of this philosophy. The game is a massive success in so many ways, but its reliance on this conceit often loops back around to being "familiar, but familiar."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's dig into how a Weequay sheriff and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-outlaws-nd-5-hot-droid-reaction-2000481524">an unexpectedly hot droid</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> show the possibilities and limits of this philosophy.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A Weequay sheriff ain't as surprising as it used to be">A Weequay sheriff ain't as surprising as it used to be</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I must admit I take a perverse joy in deploying Star Wars proper nouns on unsuspecting readers. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don't anger me or I'll start bombarding you with the names of various </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong">Yuuzhan Vong</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> characters.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the clearest example of an attempt at "familiar, but with a twist" comes in the form of Sheriff Quint. She's the sheriff of a small town called Wayfar. She's old, grizzled, and has a secret past with the Hutt Cartel harassing the town. She's also a Weequay, a species first seen in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, one of many </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">rubber-forehead aliens</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> populating the posse of the slug gangster Jabba the Hutt.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A brief diversion here: The Weequay are unfortunately one of many alien species first introduced on Tatooine that draws on tropes and stereotypes from pulp cinema. Tatooine is a simultaneous cinematic ode to Wild West films, pulpy adventures set in the Middle East, and the dreary Kansas farm of The Wizard of Oz. In Return of the Jedi, the Weequay are among a sea of dark-skinned alien goons inspired by the tropes of pulp cinema that first intimidate, then are killed off by, the predominantly white cast.</span></span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Weequay have been expanded since then in various spinoffs and licensed stories, the most beloved being the fabulous backstabbing space pirate </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hondo_Ohnaka">Hondo Ohnaka</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If the year were 1986, she'd be a revelation. But in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, she is not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her flaws begin with her visual design and run right through how she interacts with the player. Ubisoft's artists seemed to have been given limited technical boundaries in their character design choices, so she and many other "experts" the players aren't that visually distinct from regular NPCs. At a distance you can clearly she fits the cowboy archetype, but her appearance only stands out at a close distance—and even then, she's not that distinctive from other generic Weequay that fill out the game.</span></p><p>Image by Bryant Francis, via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She's a familiar sheriff archetype, but she's a spiky-faced alien. "Familiar but with a twist" in theory, but "familiar but familiar" in practice if you consider how audiences are probably used to spikey-faced aliens like her across many mediums. It doesn't help that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is stuffed to the gills with Star Wars aliens made more "human" by their fluent grasp of English.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her story arc, unfortunately, also feels "familiar but familiar." As mentioned, Wayfar is being harassed by gangsters demanding its impoverished residents pay them money. She and the player character Kay Vess fend off a pair of raids by the bandits, the kind we've seen time and time again in films like High Noon. My heart dropped as the first of these setpieces stepped through the familiar tropes. The town is empty. The sheriff ventures onto the main street. The gangsters ride in. Everyone's hands drift to their guns. Then she quickdraws, blasts them dead, and gameplay begins as more rush in. "Familiar, but familiar" strikes again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sequence plays out similarly later on, when Quint teaches the player how to improve their own quickdraw ability, Adrenaline Rush (which works like the quickdraw ability from Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption series).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft Massive unfortunately undercut its own "high noon" scenes by giving the player a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>far better</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> experience with Adrenaline Rush, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>is</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a great example of "familiar, but with a twist." Ubisoft did a fantastic job bringing in rapid camera swings and making it the core combat while racing on a speeder bike. It's dynamic, punchy, and far more interesting to do than watch it play out in a cutscene.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rest of the player's time with Quint, unfortunately, is stuck in the same gunslinging tropes. Her relationship to the Hutt Cartel is also dulled by the fact that the player can become very good friends with the Hutt Cartel, meaning they're no worse than the sheriff, who's remorseful about her time as a hired killer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All the familiar tropes of the Wild West sheriff are meant to be juiced up with that Star Wars alien vibe—but just making her a Weequay isn't enough to stop her from blending into the gorgeous backgrounds of the Great Chott Salt Flat.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="ND-5 is a droid like no other">ND-5 is a droid like no other</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All right you've eaten your vegetables and now it's time for dessert. And that dessert is ND-5, a BX-series droid commando (first seen in the Star Wars: Clone Wars animated series) assigned to Kay by gangster Jaylen Vrax. The second he walked onscreen, my spouse exclaimed—and this is a word-for-word quote—"Why does he have a slutty waist?!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yes, as you may have heard, ND-5 has joined the ranks of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-outlaw-ubisoft-hot-droid-video-game-1850545405">attractive robots in the video game canon.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> He's a character that shows where Ubisoft Massive does succeed with "familiar, but with a twist." What makes ND-5 work is that he bridges the familiarity gap across Star Wars and other stories—he's not just a familiar archetype shaped by Star Wars, he's a Star Wars archetype shaped by other influences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">ND-5 is a "familiar" character in adventure stories, in that he's the brooding, gravelly-voiced muscle assigned to the heroine whose cold exterior hides a comforting core. Some stories might cast him as a romantic interest, but this one only allows the player to lust after him from the other side of the screen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "twist" is that he's a droid. But then he's "familiar" again, because he's a droid the audience has likely seen before. Even if you don't know about the BX-series commandos (they were introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, seen in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but never depicted in any films or live-action shows), he's close enough in design to the comic relief B1 battle droids introduced in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace to strike that sense of recognition. There's something potent about taking a character design designed to evoke comedy and gently nudging it towards brooding gruffness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>are</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> familiar with BX commandos, "familiar but with a twist" strikes again. BX droids are often depicted as hunched forward with slim profiles. ND-5 stands tall and wears a trench coat that gives him artificially broad shoulders. The coat standing open also casts a contrasting silhouette for his body, which draws the eye to the uh, "slutty waist."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And let's not beat around the bush, his always-open coat and scars across his chest look vaguely inspired by a romance novel cover. A familiar look made fresh on this droid's body.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The trend continues with his role in the story. Because he's a machine bound by a restraining bolt, his relationship with Kay takes a different relationship than if it were human. He repeatedly rejects Kay's offers to help him reclaim his independence, at one point telling her emphatically, "I am not broken."</span></p><p>Image by Bryant Francis via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Except when he says it, you can't help but feel he might mean the opposite. Actor Jay Rincon really put some grit into that line. It's only made all the more heartbreaking by an encounter with a dying (deactivating?)

            <p>Unity has today launched its new engine globally, Unity 6, which its CEO wants "at the heart of game development for years to come".</p>
<p>The company promises its new suite of tools will allow for quicker and more efficient game development, with a focus on "end-to-end multiplayer workflows", tools for targeting mobile web, and "new graphics capabilities" to boost CPU performance.</p>
<p>The announcement follows a tough time for Unity as it aims to turn around its reputation with developers after last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reveals-plans-to-charge-per-game-install-drawing-criticism-from-development-community">controversial Runtime Fee debacle</a>.</p>

<p>That fee was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-developers-react-to-astonishing-scumbag-move-of-unitys-new-install-charge">heavily criticised by game developers</a> and then, last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-cancels-controversial-fees-to-use-its-game-engine-tools-a-year-after-introduction">cancelled entirely</a>.</p>
<p>With that cancellation, CEO Matt Bromberg described the company's aim of "democratising game development" by allowing games to be built by anyone. "I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form," he said.</p>
<p>Unity 6 has been "built, tested and refined in partnership with developers from all over the world", with the company committed to long-term support.</p>
<p>"We are relentlessly focused on delivering tools to help game developers build games more quickly and efficiently while also facilitating innovation," said Bromberg. "We're going to do everything we can to ensure that Unity 6 is at the heart of game development for years to come."</p><p>Unity has also released resources to show off the new toolset's capabilities. That includes the conceptual cinematic demo Time Ghost, you can watch for yourself above, as well as two playable demos: mobile game <a href="https://unity.com/demos/fantasy-kingdom">Fantasy Kingdom</a> and cross-platform multiplayer game <a href="https://unity.com/demos/megacity-competitive-action-sample">Megacity Metro</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-starts-2024-by-laying-off-1800-employees-as-part-of-ongoing-reset">Unity also began the year with a round of layoffs</a>, eliminating around 25 percent of its workforce as part of a "company reset".</p>
<p>Interestingly, there's no mention of AI in Unity's initial announcement, despite the fact it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-6-engine-will-launch-next-year-with-expansion-of-responsibly-sourced-ai-tools">previously stated Unity 6 would arrive with "responsibly sourced" AI tools</a>. </p>
<p>In a report earlier this year, Unity claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">62 percent of studios are using AI</a> at some point during game development, with animation as the primary use case.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
