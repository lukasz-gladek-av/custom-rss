            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-30th-anniversary-prices/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A leaker has revealed some of the prices for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pre-order-playstation-30th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 30th anniversary collection</a>, which includes the limited edition PS5 slim and DualSense controller.</p>



<p>The information comes from reputable dataminer and leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-les-prix-de-quelques-references-des-editions-limitees-du-30eme-anniversaire-playstation-59567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> (via dealabs), who has revealed the prices for the PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) console bundle and the DualSense 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Wireless Controller. According to the leaker, the prices are as follows:</p>



<p><strong>PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) console bundle</strong> – <strong>$499.99 USD</strong> (rumored to cost €519.99 and £449.99)<br><strong>DualSense 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Wireless Controller</strong> – <strong>$79.99 USD</strong> (rumored to cost €79.99 and £69.99)</p>



<p>As rightfully pointed out by the community, the prices don’t appear to be as high as expected and while this information is nearly leaks at this stage and should be taken with a pinch of salt, the leaker does obtain his information from the backend of website stores, so it’s almost certain accurate.</p>



<p>While the dataminer couldn’t find any information on the other limited edition items, including the hotly anticipated PS5 Pro console bundle and PlayStation Portal, the prices of the two items suggest that they won’t be as high as people were hoping. However, it should be stressed that the 30th anniversary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro</a> console bundle, which will include a PlayStation 5 Pro (already retails for $699), DualSense&nbsp;Edge wireless controller, and more will almost certainly be over the $1000. Hopefully, us UK and European folk won’t get burned to hard on the conversation rates there (wishful thinking, I know).</p>



<p>What do you think of the prices so far on the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Edition PlayStation 5 and wireless controller? Did you expect them to be higher? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-preview-a-delicious-delight.988404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-shire-preview-delicious-delight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frolicking through the Shire used to be a dream, but <em>Tales of the Shire</em> brings those dreams to reality. With an adorable art style, a world that feels alive, and excellent cooking mechanics, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is shaping up to be everything cozy <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fans were hoping for.</p>
<p>I was able to preview <em>Tales of the Shire</em> for 90 minutes earlier this week, and it was better than I could’ve hoped. The story follows a Hobbit moving from Bree to the Shire. Some Hobbits aren’t big on change, and the player will need to win everyone over and help build the Shire up. And what better way to get Hobbits to warm up to someone than by sharing a meal?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-gandalf.jpg?itok=I4wR2XeP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-gandalf.jpg?itok=OhczKYdz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The introduction in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is everything a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>fan could want.</figcaption></figure><p>There are a ton of things to do, like farming, foraging, helping other Hobbits, and – of course – cooking. Cooking and sharing meals is a staple in the life of a Hobbit (after all, who can forget about Second Breakfast).&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=-90uNJz9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=LhvXt9du 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cooking isn't as simple as it is in most other games.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cooking is actually fun in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>Preview</h2>
<p>Preparing meals has a few different components to it that make it complex enough to keep your attention. Texture plays a big part in meals, along with flavor, just like in real life. Players have to choose the best ingredients possible while also cutting and cooking things just right to get the best texture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was much more interactive than I was expecting, and it fit perfectly in for a game centered around cooking. The act of sharing meals was also more complex – the Hobbits all have specific things they like, and it’s not as easy to figure out as most would expect.</p>
<p>Everything centered around the home was incredible, including home design. I enjoy decorating in games, but it generally feels a bit stiff. However, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> had a delightful decorating system, and the decorations were so cute that I spent a bit too much time in it for the 90-minute preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t regret it, though – between the cooking and home decorations, it’s my definition of cozy to the max.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hobson-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=6PChEK1x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hobson-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=AOpcs2Re 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hobbits in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>are full of life and expression.​​​​​</figcaption></figure><h2>The other great things to do in <em>Tales of the Shire</em></h2>
<p>That doesn’t mean that you want to spend all your time inside. Between exploring, helping other Hobbits, fishing, and collecting ingredients, there’s not a lack of things to do outside the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world is gorgeous. When the first looks at <em>Tales of the Shire</em> were released, people were skeptical about the art style. However, it works beautifully in-game. The world is dazzling, and little details are scattered everywhere that make it feel full of life. What better way to represent the Shire?</p>
<p>The music is also what you’d expect in a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> game. The soundtrack was calming and charming, and it matched the vibes of the Shire perfectly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bridge-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=o0J_oomZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bridge-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=j3Twh82n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Shire is so full of beautiful details.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Tales of the Shire</em> had a few small problems</h2>
<p>There were a few bumps in terms of gameplay. The guiding system is really clever and uses birds to help guide players to objectives. However, it never seemed to work right. Birds would appear after I’d go down the correct path, so they weren’t really helpful for leading. There was also a moment when the game just stopped working.</p>
<p>However, the game is six months away from release. I’d be amazed if I ran into no hiccups in 90 minutes of playtime.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>All in all, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is one of 2025’s most anticipated cozy games</h2>
<p>The first 90 minutes of <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is more than I could’ve dared hope for. The small issues I encountered didn’t drag the game down. I’m very excited to see how the game continues to improve, and how it progresses in terms of complexity when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-the-shire-delayed">releases early next year</a>.</p>

In my late teens, I grew content with remaining human so long as I got the chance to swoon over Aragon. But now, at the wise age of almost-31, I know the truth: The greatest being that you could ever hope to be in Middle-earth is a hobbit. Fortunately, Tales of the Shire lets you do just that.</p><p dir="ltr">Wētā Workshop's Tales of Shire is a cozy life-simulation game that revolves around Tolkien's coziest creatures, hobbits. Considering the high-demand for wholesome titles and the enduring love for the Lord of the Rings series, I always felt it was simply a matter of time until a game celebrating these jovial and endlessly hungry creatures was developed. After all, what do hobbits do but tend to their land, drink, dance, be merry, and, occasionally, set off on an epic quest to save the world? I recently had the chance to do almost all these things while playing a two hour preview build of Tales of the Shire, but unfortunately, I didn't walk away from the experience as content as a Gamgee snug in their hobbit-hole. While Tales of the Shire is charming and has some good fundamentals, Wētā Workshop will need to embark on a journey filled with several quality-of-life improvements and a few major overhauls if it wants to make this game something special.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Tales Of The Shire Hands-On: Concerned About Hobbits</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The preview follows your created character leaving their hometown of Bree to start a life of their own in one of The Shire's quaintest villages, Bywater. When you get there, however, your first series of quests involves proving that Bywater actually <em>is </em>a village, as a local curmudgeon implies the village is more "Backwater" than Bywater.</p><p dir="ltr">This storyline serves as a sort of tutorial for the game, as it introduces you to some of your neighbors and the game's core features: fishing, cooking, gardening, foraging, and nurturing relationships. Many of these features really worked for me. The game's fishing mechanic, while not novel, is a fun, tension-based mini-game that avoids being annoying or grueling. Despite not being someone especially fond of in-game cooking or crafting--generally I do those things out of necessity--I actually found myself wanting to spend a significant amount of time in my kitchen. Rather than just hitting a few buttons to make a meal, you are encouraged to chop and cook your ingredients to create a more textured dish.</p><p dir="ltr">This ties in with gardening and foraging, as high-quality ingredients, spices, and herbs help elevate the meal's overall flavor. I adored mindlessly wandering through the woods, picking up hops, puffball mushrooms, and currants. Another system I really enjoyed in Tales of the Shire is Companion Crops, which gives certain crops bonuses if they are grown next to a crop it gets along with. Conversely, there are some crops that should be kept in different beds, lest their quality decline. After harvesting, collecting, and fishing up ingredients, it was easy to throw 'em all into my massive pantry that you can seamlessly pull from while cooking. In short, the more "free-form" elements of Tales of the Shire work together splendidly.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the "nurturing relationships" aspect is a different story. Though one of the ways you can improve your relationships--inviting your neighbors over for a dinner party that will satiate their cravings--is fun, that is unfortunately about the extent of what I enjoyed. While I liked the game's writing overall, many of the town's villagers felt same-y to me, each offering the same cheeky banter and, more gratingly, frustrating fetch quests. So much of my time in the village was spent going back and forth between a select few hobbits, with a particularly egregious quest seeing me going back and forth between the same two hobbits upwards of four times.</p><p dir="ltr">And while the overall environment is lovely and evocative of The Shire we know and love--quaint, comforting, and verdant--I found myself continuously irked by the game's quirks. Bywater is filled with hobbits, a clear effort to make the town feel lived-in that I understand completely. But it quickly grew frustrating when I was trying to walk around and meet my neighbors and just about <em>every</em> hobbit I bumped into was an NPC whom I could not interact with. Despite being filled with people, it began to feel a bit scarce.</p><p dir="ltr">In lieu of a traditional mini-map, compass, or some other form of "breadcrumb trail" to follow, Tales of the Shire chooses to immerse players by having them follow blue birds that will perch themselves atop fence posts and signs every so often. While cute in theory, it would often get a bit frustrating when I was going faster than the birds would appear, or when I was traversing through a denser area--such as the town square or woods--and would simply lose track of them. Considering Bywater is so deeply embedded in nature and filled with small bridges, winding roads, and only a couple handfuls of NPCs you can interact with, scattered about the map, not being able to fully rely on the birds was frustrating. Despite the game clearly not wanting you to be constantly pulling up your map and losing that sense of whimsical adventure, I felt like I had to. And these are just a couple of my gripes.</p><p dir="ltr">Between the fetch quests, my growing frustrations with certain features, and the lack of compelling characters or plot points, I eventually found myself not particularly interested in leaving my little hobbit-hole. However, unlike a game like Stardew Valley in which being fairly reclusive and focusing on creating your own little slice of paradise is viable, Tales of the Shire seems reliant upon you interacting with your neighbors. Partly because you'd be hard pressed to actually fill your entire day doing all the truly fun things, even if you do decide to spend a chunk of time giving your home a fun little makeover.</p><p>This then relegates you to doing quests that are not particularly unengaging for neighbors who are not particularly engaging. It's also worth pointing out that, at least in the preview, there was no calendar filled with birthdays, festivals, or any other events. This gave me pause, as without something to break up the mundane aspects of the game, I am not sure that I would be compelled to keep playing. Ultimately, that is the biggest issue with Tales of the Shire right now: Even a life sim sicko like me (don't ask how many hours I've put into Moonstone Island and Fields of Mistria this year) doesn't feel pulled in by this game. Though it has some great features, lovely music, an art style that, while a bit clunky, feels suiting and adds a great deal of charm, <em>and</em> an incredible IP behind it, the whole package offered doesn't quite work. Fortunately, the game was delayed out of 2024 and will instead be released in early 2025, hopefully giving the team a bit of time to polish the game into something Gollum would covet.</p>

Compared to our first test build, the current Tokyo Game Show demo features more optimized character models, including better facial details and color schemes. These tweaks allow characters to show more dynamic facial expressions, which helps bring out their personalities and make them feel more alive—closer to their original designs.</p><p>“We’ve also optimized models, textures, and lighting for environments, which greatly improves the overall visual presentation and immersion of the game world. We’ve enhanced character ultimate skills and weapon attack effects as well, making ultimates look more powerful while shortening the cutscenes to avoid interrupting combat flow. Weapon hits also feel more responsive now, and the visuals make attacks look more powerful.

<p>Over the weekend, hours-long streams of <em>both</em> games are popping up online, most of which have been chopped up into small, social media-friendly pieces and shared to sites like X/Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok, often without spoiler warnings.</p>

<p>It's unclear how the streamers acquired their copies, or if the early streams will remain live and online, but at the time of writing, there are many, <em>many</em> clips of both games making the rounds.</p>
<p>If you are hoping to go into either game without any prior knowledge, now may be a good time to start that social media detox or, at the very least, update your list of muted/banned words…</p>

These games have allowed players to import their choices from previous entries in order to keep a consistent world state that feels shaped, to some degree, by your actions. The process by which players do that has changed over the years, with the <em>Mass Effect </em>games reading your old saves and <em>Dragon Age </em>getting a separate app to craft your world state for <em>Inquisition</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> will handle this differently, allowing you to make a few key decisions in the character creator that reflect choices made in <em>Inquisition </em>before you get started on your next journey. Still, for all its apparent concern with making players feel like their decisions have lasting impact, BioWare’s track record is arguably a bit spotty in this regard, and at times the studio has outright undone the effects of major choices players have made. At a preview event earlier this month John Epler, creative director on <em>the Veilguard</em>, talked a bit about the studio’s philosophy for handling these decisions. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*1gwgbb5*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjkxNjk4Mi45OC4xLjE3MjY5MjQzMDQuNTkuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*1gwgbb5*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjkxNjk4Mi45OC4xLjE3MjY5MjQzMDQuNTkuMC4w">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-recommend-id="image://e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1501" data-height="845" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook talks with Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook talks with Neve." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-recommend-id="image://e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1501" data-height="845" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook talks with Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When you boot up BioWare’s long-awaited RPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> on October 31 and create your custom character, you’ll be asked what Faction your protagonist Rook came from before the game starts.

            <p>New details about Assassin's Creed Invictus have leaked online.</p>
<p>According to X/Twitter user j0nathan - a leaker with extraordinarily good prior form for Assassin's Creed information - Invictus will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>' inspired multiplayer game in which players will assume the avatars of different Assassin's Creed characters and fight to get through each round.</p>

<p>"Among the game [types], we find Team Deathmatch, another free-for-all, and a speed game where you have to go to light points scattered on the map. If you qualify for the next round, you can choose types of powers to form a build in the final game."</p>
<p>Interestingly, j0nathan belives they can "confirm" two characters - Ezio and Cesare Borgia - and says the gameplay will be "arcade" like in nature, "with hits without real impact and even a 'bubble' shield like in Smash Bros".</p>
<p>Maps will be inspired from Assassin's Creed games, such as Mirage's Baghdad, Shadows' Japan, "a map in a paradise island" likely inspired by Black Flag. There's also a map based on Pompeii, complete "with rising lava".</p>
<p>Without formal confirmation from Ubisoft either way, all we can do is take this as a rumour for now, but even the moderation team on the subreddit admits Jonathan has been "somewhat accurate" with prior Assassin's Creed-flavoured leaks.</p>
<p>"We don't know how much or little is true of it so maybe don't come to conclusions?" the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fmbohk/comment/lo9e5xi/">moderator</a> cautioned. "Sure Jonathan has leaked in the past that has been at least somewhat accurate. But this info could be old or incomplete. Or just not true."</p>
<p>In June, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot condemned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">"the malicious and personal online attacks" directed at the game's developers</a> after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' initial reveal.</p>

The executive had been speaking at a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gran_turismo_7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gran Turismo</a> event, where the latest in the series at the time, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/gran_turismo_sport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gran Turismo Sport</a> on the PS4, was being demoed alongside the PlayStation originals. “The PS1 and PS2 games look ancient,” he exclaimed. “Like, why would anyone play this?”</p><p>As frustration among PlayStation fans grew, these off-the-cuff remarks from Ryan took on a life of their own: many assumed Sony, under his leadership, hated its legacy. The executive <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2021/06/actually_playstation_boss_jim_ryan_doesnt_hate_old_games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later clarified</a> in an interview with <a href="https://www.axios.com/signup/gaming?utm_source=axios&amp;utm_medium=house-ads&amp;utm_campaign=subs-house-ads-hpside-gaming&amp;utm_content=gaming-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axios Gaming</a> that he “wasn’t trying to be disrespectful of our heritage”. He explained: “I guess my big learning from all of this is when [Gran Turismo creator] Kazunori Yamauchi unveils his next game side-by-side with its history, I will keep my mouth shut.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/classics-1-1726851878109.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Mister Mosquito is an obscure Japanese game now available via PS Plus Premium. It's also referenced in Astro Bot!</figcaption></figure></output><p>But actions speak louder than words and many fans have been waiting for Sony to actually <em>do</em> something with its back catalogue that proves it cares about the games from its past. I believe, while far from perfect, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS Plus Premium</a> is quietly amassing a catalogue of deep cuts from PlayStation’s history that fans absolutely <em>should</em> be paying attention to. And as nostalgia builds ahead of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/jaw-dropping-30th-anniversary-ps5-pro-console-and-accessories-will-bankrupt-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the brand’s 30th anniversary</a> – with that sumptuous collection of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/how-to-pre-order-ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new PS5 hardware available to pre-order soon</a> – it’s something that both long-time fans and newcomers should be paying attention to.</p><p>For example, this week saw the release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/mister_mosquito" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mister Mosquito</a> on PS5 and PS4, a largely forgotten 2001 title from Japanese developer Zoom which <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps2/mister-mosquito" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encapsulates everything great</a> about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/playstation-studios-all-sony-first-party-developers-and-what-theyre-working-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation first-party</a> in the PS2 era. As its name implies, this game sees you buzzing around the unsuspecting Yamada family’s home, drawing blood without arousing suspicion in some of the zaniest gameplay you’re likely to find on <em>any</em> format today. The original was brought overseas by Eidos under license from Sony, but is reproduced with Trophies and various quality of life features here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While there’s clearly more Sony could be doing here, I really appreciate how many games are being given a new lease of life with the inclusion of Trophies.</p></div><p>Many games are also making their European debuts as part of Sony’s hushed retro push. Earlier in the year, Level-5’s legendary PSP tactics game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/jeanne_darc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeanne d’Arc</a> launched into PS Plus Premium, marking <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/psp/jeanne-darc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first time it’s been officially available</a> outside of Japan and North America; Sony famously passed on publishing the game in Europe, despite its story being loosely inspired by Joan of Arc and the Hundred Years’ War in the 15th Century. Similarly, cult PS2 aerial combat game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/sky_gunner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sky Gunner</a> was ported to the PS5 and PS4 this week, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/dont-sleep-on-ps2-secret-gem-sky-gunner-coming-to-ps5-ps4-next-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marking another European debut</a>.</p><p>While there’s clearly more Sony could be doing here, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/05/ps5-ps4s-brand-new-ps2-emulator-features-up-rendering-rewind-quick-saves-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with its official emulator in particular</a> lacking the upscaling capabilities of third-party rivals, I really appreciate how many games are being given a new lease of life with the inclusion of Trophies. The fan favourite PS2 <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/timesplitters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TimeSplitters</a> trilogy was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/ps-plus-premiums-timesplitters-titles-now-all-have-trophies-on-ps5-ps4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated this week to incorporate Platinums</a>, and for many this is all the incentive needed to revisit old favourites. Iconic PS1 games like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/g-police" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G-Police</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/jumping_flash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jumping Flash!</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/intelligent_qube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intelligent Qube</a> all come with a list of achievements to unlock as well.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/classics-2-1726852027065.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Jeanne d'Arc has finally made its European debut, 18 years after it was first released.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Even lesser known instalments from classic PlayStation properties are getting a second shot in the spotlight; <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/play-the-worst-ratchet-and-clank-on-ps5-ps4-with-ps-plus-premium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wouldn’t exactly recommend</a> spin-offs like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/secret_agent_clank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secret Agent Clank</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/jak_and_daxter_the_lost_frontier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jak &amp; Daxter: The Lost Frontier</a> over their mainline counterparts, but I like that they exist in an easily accessible form on modern hardware. The real goal for Sony will be to ensure the original trilogies accompany them; you can play all of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/jak_and_daxter_the_precursor_legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jak &amp; Daxter</a> games with Trophies on the PS5 and PS4, but we’re still awaiting the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/ratchet_and_clank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> releases.</p><p>While I suppose I could criticise Sony for dragging its heels, I’d rather it do that than nothing at all. The catalogue of PlayStation classics on PS Plus Premium is growing, with many available a la carte on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/tags/ps-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS Store</a> if you don’t want to pay out for the pricey subscription. The emulation could admittedly be better, and the software could be coming quicker – but quietly the Japanese giant is embracing its heritage and making it available for veterans and newcomers alike.</p><p>If you’re thinking, “Like, why would anyone play this?”, it’s because, as we approach PlayStation’s all-important 30th anniversary, there’s a lot of love for its back catalogue. And gradually, month by month, Sony is actually beginning to acknowledge that.</p><p><em>Sammy Barker is the Editor of </em><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Square</a><em>.
