<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/64541">Famitsu</a> has shared the latest look at physical sales in the region, and it's Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> that has come out on top with 23,428 units sold in its debut week. That's not a particularly high number, it's true, but considering that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> came in second with almost 14 thousand, it's not bad going.</p>
<p>A couple of other new releases also broke into the top 10 this time, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> and Broccoli's <strong>UN:LOGICAL</strong> making the cut at fifth and sixth, respectively.</p>
<p>Here's the latest top ten physical sales in Japan:</p>

<p>Expectedly, the Switch 2 has remained on top of the hardware side of things, with an additional ~72,000 units under its belt. The standard Switch model sold marginally more than the OLED this week, interestingly, but neither was enough to overtake the PS5 Digital Edition or the Switch Lite.</p>
<p>Combining the three SKUs for Switch this time gives us a total of 17,515, while the trio of PS5 models combine for 9,766.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong> is certainly ramping up, as we've just had another <strong>three casting announcements</strong> after two new cast members were announced just yesterday. A report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-alastair-duncan-mimir-brok-sindri-1236645903/">Variety</a> confirms previous rumours that <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> <strong>will</strong> <strong>reprise his role as Mimir</strong>, while <strong>Danny Woodburn</strong> (Seinfeld, 90210) and <strong>Jeff Gulka</strong> (The X Files, Once Upon a Time) will play the dwarf brothers <strong>Brok</strong> and <strong>Sindri</strong>, respectively.</p>



<p>Duncan, Woodburn, and Gulka are the sixth, seventh, and eighth additions to the cast that we've heard about, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> was cast as <strong>Kratos</strong></a>, followed by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer </strong></a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">getting tapped to play <strong>Sif</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/"><strong>Max Parker</strong> getting cast as <strong>Heimdall</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong> accepting the role of <strong>Thor</strong></a>, and last night's latest addition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong> stepping in to play <strong>Odin</strong>,</a> replacing The West Wing's <strong>Richard Schiff</strong>, who voiced him in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>All of these casting announcements have happened within the month of <strong>January 2026</strong>, with Ryan Hurst being named as Kratos kicking things off just two weeks ago. We may not get the rest of the cast revealed today, but it certainly feels like we have more announcements coming, and that Amazon is trying to get all of these reveals out before the show starts filming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">which is reportedly due sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>With Brok, Sindri, and Mimir now settled, other remaining casting choices include <strong>Freya, Baldur</strong>, and, of course, <strong>Atreus</strong>. There are more characters we could see cast for the series, though we can't exactly speculate that we're waiting on casting choices for characters like <strong>Tyr</strong>, <strong>Magni,</strong> <strong>Modi</strong>, <strong>Freyr</strong>, <strong>Thrúd</strong>, and <strong>Angrboda</strong> until we know a bit more about the show's plot direction.</p>



<p>Right now, we know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be pulling from the Norse mythology-based games from 2018 and 2022, but that's about it. The character descriptions included in Variety's report don't include any new information that those who've played the games don't already know, so for now we're left waiting until Amazon, <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong>, and Moore can start talking about the show they're planning.</p>



<p>Even though it is focusing on the Norse-based games, it would be exciting to see callbacks to Kratos' days running around Olympus. It seems unavoidable for the show not to address Kratos' past, which opens up an even bigger can of worms regarding which characters are left to be cast. Hopefully, we'll have more concrete information soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Tarkov Competitor ‘Road to Vostok’ Gets Release Date and New Trailer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok-early-access-date-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1421290</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Road to Vostok, a highly anticipated first-person survival shooter from a lone developer, is hitting early access in April. This news follows years of development that have yielded multiple demos, scores of evolutions, and the emergence of one of the most exciting games in the hardcore shooter space.</p>



<p>Fans of games like Escape from Tarkov will be enthused by Road to Vostok. While it’s not an extraction shooter, it boasts a very similar aesthetic and core concepts, and it’s set in a ‘post-apocalyptic border zone between Finland and Russia.’</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-road-to-vostok-coming-out">When is Road to Vostok Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Road to Vostok, being developed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by a one-man Finnish team</a>, is the culmination of years of work. Before putting his head down and creating this all-new survival game, ‘Antti’ served in the armed forces and taught visual game design. His efforts have come to life in Road to Vostok, a single-player survival title with hardcore mechanics.</p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1963610/Road_to_Vostok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blurb on Steam</a>, where you can wishlist the game in anticipation of its early access release, tells you all you need to know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Road to Vostok is a hardcore single-player survival game set in a post-apocalyptic border zone between Finland and Russia. Survive, loot, plan and prepare to cross the border into Vostok, a permadeath zone where one mistake can end it all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Antti uploaded a new trailer for Road to Vostok earlier today, confirming that the game will hit early access on <strong>April 7, 2026</strong>. It will be priced at €14.99, including a 25% discount that starts at launch and runs for two weeks, at which point it will become €19.99.</p>



<p>We’ve been covering Road to Vostok for years, and our impressions of the demos this solo developer has produced have always been stellar. It’s sure to be a hit with fans of games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Tarkov</a>, which you can more or less gauge by the game’s new trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Road to Vostok has first-person shooter mechanics aplenty, but it also has a hideout system, multiple maps, in-game traders, dynamic events that unfold as the game’s lifecycle evolves, and a looter-shooter gameplay loop, all of which are applicable to Tarkov fans everywhere.</p>



<p>There’s weapon and character customization, weather systems, a day-night cycle, and survival mechanics that involve elements like eating and drinking, as well as inventory and health management.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to explore Road to Vostok when it launches, you won’t have long to wait, as it comes out on April 7th in early access. For now, there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/road-to-vostok-public-demo-2-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo on Steam</a> that you can explore right now.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if Road to Vostok sounds like your kind of game.</p>

<figure data-uuid="f3fc8a98f2e28"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Peach Winking" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f3fc8a98f2e28/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-peach-winking.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 is approaching its eight-month anniversary, and developers across the world are interested in getting their games on the newest gaming system out there. At least, that's what <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">GDC's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a> reveals (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/twice-as-many-developers-surveyed-by-gdc-say-they-want-to-make-games-on-ps5-or-switch-2-than-on-xbox/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>The report shows that 39% of developers surveyed are at least interested in the Switch 2. That puts it fourth, but barely, as the PS5 and Steam Deck are both at 40%, while PC is way ahead at 80%.</p>
<p>Looking at a few other platforms, the Switch 2 is almost twice as popular as the Xbox Series X | S, which only 20% of the sample of developers are apparently interested in. The original Switch console still has some eyes on it, too, with 13% of developers still keen to develop for the system</p>
<p>In terms of platforms that developers have used to release their most recent games, the Switch consoles are a little lower down — 21% of devs have released a Switch game, with 18% getting their game on the newer Switch 2, from those surveyed. Both are behind the Xbox One, which sits at 23%.</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch is a much-less powerful system than other consoles, and the Switch 2 has only been out since June 2025, so those numbers will likely go up this time next year, and as more developers get their hands on dev kits.</p>

<p>But the numbers for the Switch consoles here are a little closer, because more people have a Switch 1 than Switch 2. And that's backed up by a further poll, where developers and companies surveyed were asked what they consider most when choosing a platform to release their game on.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the top result was audience reach, with 78% of developers picking that option. Business model success and discoverability also ranked highly, with 44% and 43% of votes respectively. So it's all down to easy-of-access and past successes, then.</p>
<p>So, it's a pretty good start for the new console, in our eyes. And with a third-party-stacked 2026 ahead of us, we think things can only go up from here. Or, we hope, at least.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezone</a> in a red carpet interview at the <strong>Guldbagge Awards</strong> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>), Fares confirmed that he had seen the first finalized version of the script, and confirmed that he's met Sydney Sweeney in a meeting, but he's not holding his breath about anything just yet. </p>



<p>"<em>I got the first version of the script today," </em>Fares told Moviezone<em>, "but you know, there’s so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this ‘I believe it when I see it.'</em>" Regarding Sweeney, Fares didn't have much to add beyond, "<em>I’ve had a meeting with her and she seems super chill</em>."</p>



<p>We first learned that a Split Fiction movie was in the works back in April 2025, but it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/">June 2025 that Amazon MGM won the bidding war</a> to get the film's production rights that it had found a home. Now, it has a script, and while there are plenty of steps to go before we can really start to look forward to the movie, it's better to hear some updates instead of nothing, which is currently the case with <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-is-coming-to-tv-and-movies-thanks-to-dj2-entertainment-deal/">the <strong>It Takes Two </strong>film that was announced back in 2022,</a> and we haven't heard anything about it since.</p>



<p>Split Fiction isn't the only video game adaptation Sweeney is working on, as she's also signed on to <a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/">produce an adaptation of <strong>Out Run</strong> alongside <strong>Michael Bay</strong></a>. As for Amazon, it is currently days away from the premiere of the season two finale for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/"><strong>Fallout </strong>TV show adaptation</a>, and lately we've been hearing a lot about the cast for the coming <strong>God of War </strong>TV series, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Mandy Patinkin</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Teresa Palmer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Max Parker</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong> all confirmed to be a part of the cast.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Yesterday, Google revealed its Project Genie AI-generation tool, allowing people to make “interactive environments” in seconds using just prompts. Today, in response to this, a bunch of investors seem to think this is the future of game development and are bailing on big game companies. This has led to stocks tanking for companies like Take-Two and <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174">Roblox</a>.</p> <p>On January 29, Google started rolling out early access to a new “experimental research prototype” AI tool named Project Genie. It is powered by Genie 3 and Gemini and allows users to create 3D worlds you can move around in simply by inputting a text prompt, like “Cartoonish 3D racing game with toy cars.” <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227">As reported by <em>The Verge</em> on Thursday</a>, the tool can also be used to create “games” that look a lot like <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, something I imagine Nintendo won’t be happy about.</p>

 <p>While Genie’s creations aren’t games at all, just 3D environments that you can explore for a short amount of time, it seems many investors believe that tools like Genie will soon magically be making entire games. There’s been a bunch of sudden stock sell-offs across the gaming industry on Friday as a result.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ijzk33hik37peth6s45vndeb/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdnsxei4lk2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiaijody4fvos6knzduiwmseo2dgu7b5imtxilea5fnkgaiara4uny"> <p lang="en">Video game stocks are suddenly crashing today with the launch of Google's Project Genie as investors think games will start magically getting made with AI</p> <p>➡️ ca.investing.com/news/stock-m… </p> <p>#GoogleGemini #TakeTwo #CDProjektRED #Roblox #videogames</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ijzk33hik37peth6s45vndeb?ref_src=embed">Shinobi602 (@shinobi602.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ijzk33hik37peth6s45vndeb/post/3mdnsxei4lk2w?ref_src=embed">2026-01-30T17:23:17.949Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><a href="https://ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unity-stock-falls-alongside-taketwo--roblox-after-googles-project-genie-launch-4429665">As reported by <em>Investing.com</em>,</a> the stock price for numerous publishers and console manufacturers is tanking today after Genie’s reveal. As of 1:05 p.m. EST, <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> publisher Take-Two Interactive was down over nine percent. Roblox’s stock price had slid nearly 12 percent. Video game engine company Unity’s stock is down a whopping 20 percent. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTDOY/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG7DeRlALEalto-xnKvXTp7KQFjICvRwxzk5IiImf36NuZ2544k6LSSE4RRCuiQ4hR08ut2AtuKtmdnAuNNNmMmyD8VAc89FQQzP8_97U5BPHLDgp7uWBsLjJqa7C3K-DeXSsmw3cVeevxwUJ0Knf4DrbMbSdGoTxdyOfUhcNN1p">And even Nintendo stock is down</a> nearly five percent. These tumbles all happened today, which seems to directly connect the slides to the reveal of Google’s new Genie tool.</p>

 <p>At the moment, the interactive experiences Google’s tool can produce last only one minute, run at 24 frames per second, and cap out at 720p. They also lack stability, with one demo featuring a race track changing mid-gameplay. The tool can also be used to create replicas of games like <em>Mario 64</em>, though Google seems nervous about this ability, with the AI tool eventually stopping a <em>Verge</em> reporter from making more Mario “games” over concern for “the interests of third-party content providers.” Meanwhile, other people are already using the tool to make ugly, horrible versions of <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/genie-3-ai-video-games-gta-6-dark-souls/"><em>GTA 6 </em>and<em> Dark Souls.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

 <p>But for the people with all the money, none of this matters. They see a future where game devs and companies aren’t needed, and this magic AI tool can save money and quickly produce the next <em>Call of Duty </em>or <em>GTA.</em> Good luck with that.</p>

              <p>You were just checking the time. That’s all. But there was a notification, and it could have been important, but it turned out to be a link to a funny post on BlueSky. And now it’s 47 minutes later and you’ve doomscrolled through page after page of news and reaction to the seemingly unending torrent of horror being visited upon the country and world, and you feel helpless, wound up, and sad. Oh, and what time is it? Stop! Stop this madness! Your phone is a whole gaming console in one tiny slab! So next time you pick it up, click onto one of these fabulous games instead.</p> <p>All the following games are selected because they’re such incredibly good ways to spend those spare moments of time when you’d otherwise be tempted to look at the algorithm’s horror. These are the games that’ll fit in on the train ride, during coffee, or as you’re sitting outside waiting for your kid to emerge from the school, and they’re also a great way to while away the last hour before you fall asleep at night. As such, I’m not selecting games like <em>Honkai Star Rail</em> or&nbsp;<em>Warframe</em> because firstly they’re just better on a bigger screen, and secondly because that sort of game is an entire second job in itself. This is all about the perfect way to distract your brain and fingers in a fulfilling, non-terrifying manner.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Slay the Spire</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slay-the-spire/id1491530147">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.humble.SlayTheSpire&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>Mega Crit’s legendary <em>Slay the Spire</em> might be more immediately associated with PC and console, but in the years after its 2019 release it was brought to iOS and Android in an absolutely perfect port. The pioneering roguelite deckbuilder remains as all-consuming today as it did seven years back, and the shorter battles and ability to quit out and pick back up where you left off make it ideal for quick plays on your phone. Or indeed entire evenings consumed with mastering a deck to defeat everything in your path. It’s one of the few properly priced mobile games at $10, but remember you’re buying one of the best games ever made, with a minimum play time of infinity hours.</p> <hr> <h2>Balatro</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balatro/id6502453075">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstack.balatro.android&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>2024’s smash hit took its time coming to mobile, but arrived in glorious style. The poker-ish game took the world by storm on PC and console in February 2024, and then became the entire planet’s meta when it reached iOS and Android that September. It remains one of the finest ways you can occupy your spare time, each run a unique experience as you shape your deck and Jokers to win your way through the rounds and challenges. Like <em>Slay the Spire</em>, it’s $10, and worth every cent.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Polimines Deluxe</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polimines-deluxe/id6473717385">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.penguinpopgames.poliminesdeluxe&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>Spanish indie developer Molter Games might not be a household name, but puzzle game&nbsp;<em>Polimines&nbsp;</em>deserves to be. This combination of puzzles like&nbsp;<em>Picross</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hexcells</em> and&nbsp;<em>Minesweeper</em> creates a unique and enormously clever challenge. This mobile version combines both the PC’s <em>Polimines 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2</em>, which works out perfectly since the sequel pretty much picks up where the difficulty for the first game left off. Every solved puzzle in the second half will make you feel like a complete genius. And the whole thing is only $5.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Sparklite</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sparklite/id1553922886">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.sparklite&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>RPG&nbsp;<em>Sparklite</em> was generally liked when it came out in 2019, without blowing anyone away. It’s a gorgeous roguelite in which you play as Ada, on her broken airship, making trips to the world of Geodia below to gather items and “patches” and battle mighty Titans. Each failure is an opportunity for a new attempt, with the progression of creating new stores and crafting stations on her floating island, and applying the patches into machines that create a unique set of skills and attacks to shape how you play. It got a bit lost on console, even the great version on Switch, but it just works so incredibly well as a mobile game. A good run can fill a commute, and there’s a constant sense of progression that makes you want to pick it back up for another try on the way home.</p> <hr> <h2>The New York Times Games</h2> <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nyt-games-wordle-crossword/id307569751">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.crossword&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>No, not technically a game, but by far one of the very best ways to spend time on your phone. <em>Wordle</em> and others are free, but if you pay the sub (and you can get it incredibly cheap—I’m paying around $3 a month), you get access to the daily <em>NYT</em> crossword alongside <em>Connections</em>, <em>Strands</em>, <em>The Mini</em> (crossword), <em>Pips</em> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ALGL4Hm5g8">Spelling Bee</a>, as well as access to their archives. There are now bots for a bunch of these that’ll analyze your play, and it just added two-player Crossplay, the most blatant, bare-faced Scrabble rip-off since <em>Worlds With Friends</em>. I start each day with <em>Wordle</em> and <em>The Mini</em>, end each day with the crossword and <em>Spelling Bee</em>, and the others sneak in for coffee breaks. (Bonus game: check out the amazing <a href="https://squaredle.app/"><em>Squardle</em></a> which also has an app.)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Stuffo the Puzzle Bot</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stuffo-the-puzzle-bot/id6444358789">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Hapatus.Stuffo&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>There’s a good chance you’re familiar with the extraordinary old-school dungeon crawler&nbsp;<em>Legend of Grimrock</em>. But the next game from one of its two main developers deserves to be equally lauded. <em>Stuff the Puzzle Bot</em> is one of the most brilliantly clever puzzle games you’ll ever play, one of those where discovering the solution makes you feel like you’ve made a momentous breakthrough and simultaneously want to buy flowers for the creator. The component parts look familiar—using a little robo to pick up and rearrange blocks of various types such that he can reach a level’s exit—but rarely has this been so exquisitely executed. The mobile version is perhaps even better than the PC build, with fingertip controls making so much sense.</p> <hr> <h2>Shattered Pixel Dungeon</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shattered-pixel-dungeon/id1563121109">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p><em>Pixel Dungeon</em> by Watabou (Oleg Dolya) was originally released for mobile in 2012, and was a delightful micro-dungeon crawler. But best of all, it was released as free software, with anyone else welcome to lift its entire code and create their own versions, even for sale. The result has been a huge range of splendid variants, and it’s generally agreed the best of these is <em>Shattered Pixel Dungeon</em> by Evan Debenham—it’s certainly my favorite. A project that was meant to last a few months has eventually led to 12 years of work so far, with new content added roughly every three months, and yet the game feels uncomplicated and welcoming to play. It’s $5, and will occupy you for the rest of time.</p> <hr> <h2>Loop Hero</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loop-hero/id6464048549">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.loophero&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>Another PC roguelite that found its way to mobile three years later, <em>Loop Hero</em> feels so very at home on your phone. This is a game that’s essentially about walking around in a circle, but what a circle it is. Instead of controlling your character, you play “cards” that lay obstacles, enemies and advantages, as well as mountains and marshes, around the circuit of road on which the character walks. He or she then battles the path’s foes, with each loop more dangerous than the last, and you left deciding if you’ll risk another go-around or chicken out and bring your hero back to base with the loot to develop farms and structures and their resulting advantages. Making its game a literal loop creates a perfect one-more-go mobile game. It’s free to download, and then $7 to unlock the full game.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Holedown</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/holedown/id1297270249">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grapefrukt.games.bore&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>The brilliant minds at Grapefrukt Games have brought us some all-time classic mobile games, like&nbsp;<em>Rymdkapsel</em> and&nbsp;<em>Twofold Inc</em>, and most recently&nbsp;<em>Subpar Pool</em>. But it’s&nbsp;<em>Holedown</em> that permanently lives on my phone. This brilliantly clever variant on the&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em> format has you bouncing squillions of balls around the screen, trying to destroy strangely shaped blocks by hitting them until their number is reduced to zero. And really interestingly, the core game is designed to be finished, a series of levels you will progress through, rather than presenting you with a <em>Tetris</em>-like increase in difficulty that increases until you inevitably game over. But it has that too, via an infinite mode with bragging rights for how far you can reach. It’s a sublimely satisfying game to play, and a very reasonable $4.</p> <hr> <h2>Crying Suns</h2>  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crying-suns/id1511788295">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altshift.cryingsuns&amp;hl=en_us">Android</a></p> <p>If you’re after something a bit more strategic to stop those doomscrolling fingers, then it’s worth remembering 2019’s&nbsp;<em>Crying Suns.</em> Inspired by&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>, but putting you in charge of a far larger, far more involved ship, with several hundred crew members to worry about. With multiple sectors to explore, and deep tactics required for combat, this is perhaps one of the more involved games in the list, and yet as a roguelite it’s still intended to be played in more controlled bursts. It’s generally far better to be distracted by the peril of your fictional crew than anything going on outside the window just now. $9 for all that.</p>

 <hr> <h2>And now you…</h2> <p>This is a list that could continue on until it reaches the bottom of the internet; mobile gaming is a wonderful source of fantastic entertainment, and in between all the more involved and longer-term <em>Diablo Immortal</em>s<em>, </em>revamped Square Enix RPGs,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>s are a billion options that’ll provide the perfect shorter-term alternative to a doomscroll. I picked these 10 because I thought of them first, but another day it could easily have been any number of other collections. So please, drop suggestions to any games you’d recommend into the comments!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WWE 2K26 Is Going To Have A “Ringside Pass”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-is-going-to-have-a-ringside-pass/</link>
            <guid>1421230</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>News about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> is rolling in, and one of the most significant changes this year is the introduction of a Ringside Pass, which alters the DLC rollout and more.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 is slated to release on March 13, and ahead of the 2026 Royal Rumble, news has begun to surface officially about this year’s WWE video game offering. As part of several news items released in a <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/cm-punk-liv-morgan-bron-breakker-talk-wwe-2k26-as-new-game-info-released" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">write-up from the Takedown on SI, </a>it has been confirmed that WWE 2K26’s DLC will be funneled through a ringside pass.</p>



<p>Similar to other battle passes in popular video games, the Ringside Pass offers players additional incentive to play, and there will be XP earned across all offline game modes. The battle pass will include 60 free tiers and 40 premium tiers. Players who reach tier 40 of the Ringside Pass Premium Season will be able to unlock Superstars, cosmetics, customizations, exclusive content for game modes like The Island, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-superstars-than-ever-before-will-be-playable-in-wwe-2k26">More Superstars Than Ever Before Will Be Playable in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Speaking of unlockable Superstars, newly released information confirms that WWE 2K26 will have over 400 playable characters. This makes this year’s offering historic as it contains the largest roster in history. Not only will modern-day stars like CM Punk and Cody Rhodes be joined by legends such as Andre the Giant and Bret Hart, but new Superstars will also join the roster, including Rey Fenix and Blake Monroe.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it has been confirmed that the King of Kings deluxe edition of the game will include the Standard Edition, Joe Hendry Pack, Ringside Pass Premium Season 1 and 32,500 VC, and more. The Attitude Era Edition will include access to Ringside Pass Premium Seasons 1-4, plus additional playable characters specific to the Attitude Era, such as Chyna ’97.</p>



<p>The Monday Night War Edition, the most expensive edition of the game, will include access to six seasons of the premium Ringside Pass, playable versions of some specific legends such as Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage, and there will be a playable arena for WCW Thunder from 1998.</p>

<p>WWE 2K returns to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a>, and with it comes a number of new features exclusive to the platform.</p>



<p>This year’s game will include several options that weren’t available to players in WWE 2K25.</p>







<p>Thanks to the design of the system, WWE 2K26 features touchscreen and mouse support on the console. There will also be the ability to play with a single Joy-Con as well GameShare and GameChat support.</p>



<p>Circling back on the mouse support, players will be able to use the built-in Joy-Con mouse within Creation Suite for face and body paint. </p>



<p>And one feature that was missing last year that makes its way to the game is image uploading and cross-platform community creations.</p>







<p>WWE 2K26 launches on March 13. However, if you buy one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/" id="172964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more expensive versions</a> of the game, you will get access a week before everyone else on March 6.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gamestop-ceo-has-a-plan-to-earn-his-35b-bonus-acquire-a-massive-publicly-traded-company-in-a-genius-or-totally-foolish-move/</link>
            <guid>1421209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>GameStop</strong> chief executive officer <strong>Ryan Cohen</strong> has the chance at a major, major payday if he can make good on a goal set for him by GameStop's board of directors. Amidst discovering that GameStop would be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-reportedly-shutting-down-hundreds-us-stores/">shutting down hundreds of stores in the United States</a></strong>, we also learned that if Cohen successfully turned the company that's worth a staggering <strong>$100 billion</strong>, then he would earn a <strong>$35 billion bonus</strong>. And now, it seems that Cohen has a plan on how to make that happen.</p>



<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/gamestop-ceo-plans-e8440c4b">Wall Street Journal</a>, the plan is essentially to buy his way to that growth by expanding beyond more than just being a video games retailer. Cohen plans to acquire a publicly traded company in a "<em>big</em>" deal, with the Journal identifying he'll be looking "<em>likely in the consumer or retail industry</em>."</p>



<p>On his plan, Cohen added, "<em>It's ultimately either going to be <strong>genius or totally, totally foolish</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Currently, GameStop is worth about <strong>$11 billion</strong>. To earn the full $35 billion bonus, Cohen would have to turn GameStop into a $100 billion market-cap company and reach a <strong>$10 billion</strong> EBITDA measure. Even when <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/">GameStop had its meteoric meme-stock rise back in 2021</a>, the company's market cap peaked at <strong>$33.7 billion</strong>, which falls more than a few billion short of Cohen's goal.</p>



<p>That said, the Journal's report adds that Cohen could still earn a partial bonus by increasing the company's market cap beyond <strong>$20 billion</strong> and reaching a <strong>$2 billion </strong>EBITDA measure. It won't be the full $35 billion, but if Cohen can manage to recreate some of the success that the company lucked into in 2021, he'll be able to take some sort of bonus home. </p>



<p>"<em>There are a lot of diamonds in the rough…that have sleepy management teams</em>," Cohen said about his plan and the layoffs GameStop has already been through. "<em>I didn’t fix GameStop to stop there</em>." The jury is still out as to whether Cohen did actually fix GameStop, which seems more interested <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">in making meme and troll-centred comments online</a> and closing stores than selling video games, but since Cohen did this interview with the Wall Street Journal, the company's stock was up <strong>3.5%</strong> this morning.</p>

            <guid>1421206</guid>

			<p>A <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16830?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <strong>Baldur's Gate 3 mod</strong></a> aims to <strong>restore several deleted scenes</strong> from the game's early access version, which ran on PC for nearly three years before the full launch. Aptly titled '<strong>Early Access Scenes Restored</strong>', the mod created by Nexus user HyperspaceTowel has managed to reinject a lot of cut content and even create brand new cutscenes. Here's the overview:</p>



<ul>
<li>More NPC encounters and camp events</li>



<li>More companion reactivity</li>



<li>More approvals (or disapprovals)</li>



<li>Brand new content: some of the cutscenes were made from scratch</li>
</ul>



<p>The Baldur's Gate 3 mod adds back these NPCs and camp events:</p>



<ul>
<li>Visiting the camp for the first time</li>



<li>Enthralled fishermen</li>



<li>Nerela</li>



<li>Rurik</li>



<li>Seashell kid</li>



<li>Gale's deer stew</li>



<li>Gale's loss</li>



<li>Post-Druid civil war</li>



<li>Shadowheart's ultimatum</li>



<li>Ceremorphosis beckons...</li>
</ul>



<p>Several of the companions already available in the game's first Act, like Astarion, Gale, Lae'zel, Shadowheart, Karlach, and Wyll, now react to specific story events once again. The modder also claims to have reworked some scene cinematics to improve the camera work and timing. Some Early Access cut lines were spliced into the full release dialogues, some Origin dialogue options were added here and there, and brand new scenes were created for Wyll and Karlach.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to the modder, there's still more cut Baldur's Gate 3 content to restore, including Thralls on the Nautiloid, even more Wyll and Karlach reactivity, and additional voiced dialogue for Tav.</p>



<p>In other Baldur's Gate 3 news, earlier this month, <strong>Larian</strong> CEO <strong>Swen Vincke</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-would-have-loved-baldurs-gate-3-switch-2-wasnt-our-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented on the lack of a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> version</a>. He said the developer would have loved to port the game to the hybrid console, hinting that the reason it doesn't exist is due to the IP owner, <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>.</p>

If you wanted to go wireless, your best option was the 8BitDo 64 which offered a similar button and joystick layout as the N64’s original controllers, but with a modernized design. For a more authentic but conveniently wireless N64 experience, <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/2017266637154435335?s=61">Analogue has released an update for the 3D</a> today that adds support for Nintendo’s modernized N64 controller.</p><p>Nintendo’s wireless controller was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers">announced in 2021 alongside N64 games</a> coming to the Nintendo Switch Online platform. Coming from Nintendo it’s about as accurate a recreation of the N64’s original hardware as you can find, but at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-64-controller%2F" rel="sponsored">$54.99</a> it’s more expensive than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Analogue-Windows-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DK6VCGBC/ref=sr_1_1?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$39.99 8BitDo 64</a>, and it can only be purchased if you’re already subscribed to the Nintendo Switch Online service. The only way to get a more authentic wireless N64 controller is to upgrade the original wired versions using <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-mod-kit-for-original-n64-controller?variant=42794771415217">8BitDo’s $39.99 Mod Kit</a>.</p><p>The Analogue 3D version 1.2.0 firmware update is <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/3d/firmware/1.2.0">available for download now through the company’s website</a> and <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/3d/guide/getting-started#updating-3dos">can be installed</a> by either copying it to the console’s memory card, or connecting the 3D to a PC with a USB-C cable.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/persona-metaphor-refantazio-kazuma-kaneko-card-game-ai-art-tsukuyomi-2000664583</link>
            <guid>1421191</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Kazuma Kaneko, the legendary “Demon Designer” and art director behind the </span><i><span>Shin Megami Tensei </span></i><span>series, every mainline </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>game and, most recently,</span><i><span> Metaphor: ReFantazio</span></i><span>, has just revealed his new card game with AI-generated card art, </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span>. Like with the earlier game </span><i><span>Tsukuyomi: The Divine Hunter</span></i><span>, Kaneko isn’t just involved in aspects like game concept and character design but actually appears in-game, or at least an AI recreation of him does.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Coming from mobile game developer Colopl, it’s set to land on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on April 23, and it’ll cost you $24.99. Or roughly $640, if you want to shell out for the special “Shinma Artist Box” edition.</span></p> <p><span>This reveal was made alongside the announcement that Colopl’s previous free-to-play partnership with Kaneko, </span><i><span>Tsukuyomi: The Divine Hunter</span></i><span>, will be coming to a close on April 22 (a day before the release of </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span>). This was all announced during a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzuen_-vCa8"><span>livestreamed event</span></a><span> on Colopl’s official YouTube last night.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Tsukuyomi: The Divine Hunter</span></i><span> allowed players to create their own AI artwork cards through the use of its “AI Kaneko” mechanic. The in-game Kazuma Kaneko would analyze players’ playstyles and gift them AI-generated cards, based on a library of Kaneko’s work. </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span> won’t feature the same mechanic, but will instead port 3,600 of the developer’s favourite AI Kaneko-produced cards over to the new version of the game.</span></p> <p><span>We know this because a Colopl representative reached out to </span><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/kazuma-kanekos-tsukuyomi-announced-for-switch"><i><span>Gematsu</span></i></a> <span>to clarify: “The Switch version takes a curated amount of those AI generated cards from the previous game and includes them in the new game. The Switch version does not include the generative AI model to create new cards beyond the cards that the team has put into the Switch version.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Worse still, as noted by </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shin-megami-tensei-artist-kazuma-kanekos-free-to-play-ai-card-game-to-end-services-and-immediately-resurrect-as-full-price-nintendo-switch-exclusive/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>, the official </span><i><span>Kazuma Kaneko’s Tsukuyomi</span></i><span> website states that the “game uses generative AI in the creation of images, videos, and music.” The same statement says that the devs will “strive to prevent unauthorised use and rights infringement,” but it’s still confirmation that generative AI tools are being used in almost every facet of this game’s development.</span></p>

<p>Updates have been announced for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6 </a>in version 1.1.3.6</p>

<p>Another major update listed is a fix to player movement issues, including excessive Sprint jumps and unintended movements. It is emphasized that this will not affect movement on a large scale but will address the specific issues reported by players.</p>







<h2 id="h-map-and-mode-fixes-coming-to-battlefield-6-in-new-updates">Map and Mode Fixes Coming to Battlefield 6 in New Updates</h2>



<p>Map and mode issues are also addressed. Three issues related to Eastwood have been fixed. First, the issue of drawing a building near the A flag, which caused unintended green and purple visual effects, has been addressed. Also, the issue where destroying the B flag could potentially cause a blackout has been fixed.</p>



<p>Additionally, the update addresses a PlayStation 5 issue where ownership validation failed during system events, causing connectivity problems. Plus, the update has resolved an out-of-memory crash on Xbox Series S when loading Daily and Weekly Challenges.</p>







<p>Other issues related to the Battle Royale mode and other areas have been addressed. Players can check out the full statement <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2017266697183412713">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Nioh 3 Have Early Access? Demo Status, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a few years since the last Nioh game. Team Ninja has been sharpening its blades and skills with other projects, but it’s time for the company’s main Soulslike to return. The latest information on Nioh 3’s early access is interesting.</p>



<p>The question of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nioh3.jpg" id="147929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh</a> being the best non-<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/fromsoftware/" id="87617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware</a> series rages on. The Nioh franchise is dripping in Yokai-infested excellence, and each game is more refined than the last. Nioh 3 has gone bigger and bolder with its open-world approach, and it’s no wonder that so many of you want it now.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-there-nioh-3-early-access">Is There Nioh 3 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strike your anger down. Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Ninja is not offering early access as an incentive for Nioh 3 early adopters.</strong></p>



<p>Why should people who pay a bit more get to see those game-over screens sooner? This is the motto for Nioh 3, as even though the game has multiple editions, none of them feature an early access bonus.</p>



<p>There <em>are </em>cool perks, such as a Season Pass and exclusive gear, but you get to use them on Nioh 3’s launch day—like everyone else.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-nioh-3-have-a-demo">Does Nioh 3 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>If you simply need to play Nioh 3 before release, there is a lengthy demo you can download for free on all applicable gaming platforms.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no Xbox version of Nioh 3, sadly, but if you are on PC or PS5, you can download a free demo to give you a fairly hefty look at the game, how it plays, and if it’s for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-download-nioh-3-demo">How To Download Nioh 3 Demo</h2>



<p><strong>Go to the PlayStation Store or Steam, search for Nioh 3, and you can buy and download the free Nioh 3 demo.</strong></p>

<p>“It’s a net positive to instil that fear"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="565241a6496cf"><a title="Yoko Kamiya" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/565241a6496cf/yoko-kamiya.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/photo">Nintendo Life / Square Enix / Hideki Kamiya</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>In a recent episode of Cafe Four Leaf on CLOVERS' YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR</a> creator Yoko Taro has heaped praise on fellow game developer and friend Hideki Kamiya and his approach to gamers online who "say things seriously out of line." (Thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hes-a-net-positive-for-the-game-industry-nier-creator-yoko-taro-on-why-hideki-kamiyas-famous-social-media-blocking-sprees-actually-work-i/">Automaton</a>.)</p>
<p>Kamiya — the veteran game director who is currently working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/okami-sequel-announced-will-be-directed-by-hideki-kamiya">an <strong>Okami</strong> sequel</a> following his departure from PlatinumGames <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/hideki-kamiya-is-leaving-platinumgames">in 2023</a> — is infamous for taking no prisoners on social media, blocking people on a whim and replying in kind when someone disrespects him.</p>
<p>Where other developers are more diplomatic and retiring online, Kamiya has a history of getting stuck in and giving as good as he gets, an approach that Taro finds inspiring and which "makes Kamiya-san a great guy to have in your corner."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you’re a game creator and you're a public-facing personality, you draw attention from a lot of people, including some real weirdos. Some of them say things that are seriously out of line. Just very nasty stuff. And because they're your audience and your customers, you can’t really clap back with full force. Unless you're Kamiya-san. "Go away, you insect!" [laughs]</p>
<p>Just like how some people in real life will tell you off if you provoke them, I think it’s a net positive to instil that fear that there are some game creators who do have that edge, so be careful how you treat us. [...] That’s why I think having you around is super reassuring as one of your industry peers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"A lot of people assume we’ll sit there and be their punching bags," Kamiya agreed, "and if we suddenly sock them one, they're stunned."</p>

<p>Taro also talks about how the way Kamiya acts online is very different to his in-person demeanour or how he is in the workplace. "There's how you behave on X, there's who you are at work, and there's the version of you that's shy around people. There's a huge disconnect between those three aspects of your personality."</p>
<p>Kamiya has had some fun with his online reputation in the past - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/02/random_back_the_wonderful_101_remaster_on_kickstarter_and_get_blocked_by_hideki_kamiya">one of the rewards</a> for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wonderful_101_remastered">Wonderful 101</a> Kickstarter campaign was to get blocked by him. He has also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/hideki-kamiya-expresses-remorse-over-harsh-treatment-of-kami-fan">expressed regret</a> over some of his responses, but as these creators mention in the video, navigating the volume — size <em>and</em> loudness — of the "nasty stuff" sent their way on a daily basis must be a challenge.</p>
<p>The whole episode is only 15 minutes long and covers other topics in a very relaxed environment (weekly episodes are planned, and this one was filmed in Korea rather than at Clovers' Japanese studio), so if your only experience of Kamiya is his games and his social media persona, take a look at the series and enjoy hearing him discuss games and other wide-ranging topics, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F13YDNNOKNg">model kits</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbttSAGcs2s">mesh underwear</a>.</p>

            <p>Are you more of a supervan wrecker or a bone stock maniac? Can you be best described as a British couch racing champion, or is your calling more in the realms of Finnish folk? These are the sorts of questions you'll have to pose to yourself whenever you fire up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>'s still-in-the works career mode, which devs Bugbear Entertainment have just laid out a bunch of plans for.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/492715550584078981">lengthy dev blog</a> in which they've done so is an estimate 10 to 20 minute read, so I'm going to have to get my summary pants on. Basically, Bugbear reckon a lot of racing game career modes - the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a>'s included - fall into the trap of following pretty samey structure. You start off with a slow car, you complete all the events, you end up with many fast cars.</p>
<p>So, with the fact different players come to Wreckfest with different types of wheeled mayhem in mind, the second game's career mode is designed to cater to you deciding where you fit into three broad player profiles. Folks who want to do regular clean racing is the first, demolition derby and contact-heavy racing buffs make up the second, and the third's a wild card of sorts dubbed "The Bonebreaker". The last group prioritise fun mucking about above all else, via the likes of "ridiculous vehicle scenarios". The last time you had a race that was lawnmowers vs motorised toilets vs motorhomes. Yeah, that.</p>
<p>Those three profiles break down even further into this monstrosity:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>From the sounds of it, rather than being locked into one alignment, you'll be able to choose what you want to focus on every time you fire up the career mode. Depending on what you pick, you'll be working on progressing up the ranks in the mode's four divisions: European Racing, Demolition Derby, Banger Racing, and American Racing. Each of those boasts three or four difficulty/complexity tiers, and progressing up through them doesn't just revolve around winning every event. Here's how Bugbear explain what you'll do to move up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each division features a collection of accomplishments, and to meet their requirements, you need to accumulate enough of specific type of score across those events. While the exact way to earn score varies depending on the discipline and game mode, here's the beautiful part: at the end of the day you decide how to earn that score and which events to play.</p>
<p>This is now getting into the nitty-gritty details but to illustrate our point, let's use a practical example. Imagine an accomplishment called 'Finnish Folk Racing Champion' that requires 10,000 points of racing score across six available events. A skilled racer might earn those points in just three events by winning and getting a bonus by posting fastest laps. A player who's less skilled at racing but enjoys the challenge might need to complete four or five events finishing somewhere mid-pack. Someone who sucks at racing but really loves drifting might earn points by finishing near the back of a race but throwing their car sideways in style.</p></blockquote>
<p>In line with that, the sort of things that score you points change depending on the type of event you're in. Racing-focused events, reward high finishing positions and fast laps. Contact-focused events balance those with congratulating you on crumpling fenders. Demo derbies only car about how good you done crashed up your foes.</p>
<p>It all sounds pretty good to me, assuming each section of the mode is equally fleshed out so that one segment of Wreckfest 2's chaotic evils doesn't feel a bit shortchanged.</p>
