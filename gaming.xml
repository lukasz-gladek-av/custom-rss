            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following Alinea Analytics' report that Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had sold more than six and a half million units</a>, publisher Electronic Arts has now confirmed that the game has indeed sold more than seven million copies just in the first three days.</p>



<p>This means Battlefield 6 is officially the biggest franchise launch ever. Over 172 million matches were played online during the first weekend, and players accumulated over 15 million hours of streaming. As previously reported, the game also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered the most concurrent players in Battlefield history</a>. </p>



<p>Byron Beede, General Manager of Battlefield, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>First and foremost we want to thank our players. Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we've had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning - our first season of new content is just 12 days away.</em></p>



<p>Vince Zampella, Executive Vice President, added:</p>



<p><em>We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point. We appreciate you joining us for Battlefield 6’s momentous launch. We have so much more to come in the weeks ahead.</em></p>



<p>The game earned an 8.5 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's review by David Carcasole</a>, who pointed out that while the single player campaign is lackluster, the multiplayer modes are rock solid, marking the franchise's comeback after Battlefield V and 2042.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the developers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-naval-warfare-reportedly-in-development-ea-battlefield-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly already working to add naval warfare</a>. On the live servers, they have also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-conquest-mode-players-arent-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced the starting ticket count on Conquest maps</a>, although that change didn't go over too well with the community.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/iracing">iRacing</a>'s always scared me a bit.

<p>"Funlop", reads the parody-centric text scrawled across a bridge over the game's version of the Japanese Tsukuba Circuit. To be honest, the simple fact developers Original Fire Games and iRacing have opted for a classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo">Gran Turismo</a> track as the venue for the single Porsche one-make race which makes up the Next Fest demo had me 90% sold before I'd even turned a wheel.</p><p>First up was a two-lap qualifying session, with each 911 out on track at the same time, but separated by intervals. As I quickly found out, getting close to another car in one of these sessions just sees it turn into a ghost to prevent collisions, so even if you race up to those in front, there's no danger of being blocked. However, you can very much get a track limits penalty which slaps you with a temporary forced slowdown period as punishment for your corner cutting. It's a reminder in case you needed one that this is still iRacing, so you'd better locate the brake pedal rather than trying to bounce at full speed off of walls, sonny Jim.</p>
<p>Provided you keep it between the lines, driving the licensed GT racer with a controller is brilliant. The model's a cute mini-me of a full-size 911, but packs the same punchy soundtrack of straight-six screaming. It feels great to fling into one of Tsukuba's tight hairpins, and tricky to balance on the edge of adhesion as you try to maximise velocity through the flowing chicane midway through the lap or hang on for dear life through the sweeping right of the final corner.</p>
<p>Once the grid's decided, it's on into a six lap race, which sadly doesn't allow you to test out the cartoon pit crews standing vigilant watch along the pit lane. To be fair, Tsukuba's a less than 30 second tour in a iRacing Arcade's Porsches, so there's hardly enough tyre wear in this length of sprint to warrant fresh rubber. Things get nice and chaotic right away if you're running mid-pack, with the AI drivers glomming together like swarms of hornets to try and dice your way through.</p>
<p>Shhh. Come here so I can whisper this without big iRacing hearing. You can drive into people. You won't get penalised. Each minor hit will only cost you a single one of your car's very generous hundred health points. These bumps and scraps are nowhere near as satisfying or played up as they are in more anarchic arcade racers, only offering a dull thunk resulting in little to no visible damage on contact, but this is progress. Who knows, in ten years time we might get iRacing's take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a>.</p><p>Admittedly having not double checked the assigned handbrake button, I also couldn't manage to get the rear-wheel-drive racer drifting all that much. Please keep that quiet too, I don't want to get a letter in the post which reads 'LOOK AFTER YOUR TYRES. GRAINING, MARBLES, CONTACT PATCHES, SIDEWALLS. DO THESE HOLY TERMS MEAN NOTHING TO YOU, HEATHEN?'. I apologise, o racers of the lowercase i. </p>
<p>iRacing Arcade's due to release on December 2nd this year, and you can grab the keys to its Next Fest demo from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3226450/iRacing_Arcade/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, folks! I’m back after my week-long vacation. A big thanks to Ethan for handling Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about, for the last week. But the vacation is over, and I bring you news about Nintendo getting hacked, another Sony franchise leaping to PC, 2K not giving up on that extraction shooter it announced last year, Sakurai’s manga, and a report that Jim Carrey might star in an upcoming <em>Jetsons</em> movie.</p> <h2><strong>Nintendo Claims Nothing Was Leaked Following Recent Hack Attempt</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/nintendo-allegedly-hacked-by-crimson-collective-hacking-group-screenshot-shows-leaked-folders-production-assets-developer-files-and-backups">Earlier this month,</a> hacker group Crimson Collective claimed to have gained access to private, unreleased Nintendo information and data. However, the company behind Mario has pushed back against these claims, <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">sharing in a statement</a> that no “personal” or dev-related info was leaked, though the company did confirm some external servers that display Nintendo’s website were affected.</p>

 <p>“We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information,” claimed Nintendo.</p> <h2><strong><em>MLB The Show</em> Might Be Getting A PC Port In The Future</strong></h2> <p>Sony’s San Diego Studio, the company behind the long-running and popular baseball sim <em>MLB The Show</em>, is currently looking to hire a “Senior PC Graphics Programmer” for a “AAA PC” game. Hmmmm. What could that game possibly be? Oh, it’s probably <em>MLB The Show</em>. The franchise has become the de facto MLB game over the last few years and even made the leap to Xbox and Switch due to a lack of other baseball sims and pressure from the MLB. So it would make sense that Sony’s baseball series would land on PC, too.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">PlayStation Studios – San Diego Studio (MLB The Show) is seeking a Senior PC Graphics Programmer for a "AAA PC title" <a href="https://t.co/arat0yL1W2">https://t.co/arat0yL1W2</a> <a href="https://t.co/WsMRDaFKD9">pic.twitter.com/WsMRDaFKD9</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1978574996575490486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><strong>2K Isn’t Giving Up On That Extraction Shooter You Already Forgot About</strong></h2> <p>Remember colorful, <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-ethos-2k-games-twitch-f2p-fortnite-overwatch-1851675279"><em>Fortnite</em>-like extraction hero shooter <em>Project Ethos</em></a>? Probably not. I write about games for a living, and I forgot about this thing until just now. <em>Project Ethos</em> is from 2K-owned 31st Union and was announced last year to a resounding “meh” from folks online. <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173">We’ve not heard much about the game since then</a>, but as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2k-reaffirms-support-for-project-ethos-names-apex-legends-executive-producer-as-head-of-31st-union">reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, an internal memo indicates the game isn’t dead. In fact, 2K has brought on Ben Brinkman, a longtime executive producer on<em> Apex Legends</em>, to help develop the game. I’ll be curious the next time we get a look at <em>Project Ethos</em> and see what’s changed since its big reveal in 2024.</p>

 <h2><strong>A New Manga Based On The Life Of Masahiro Sakurai Is Out Soon</strong></h2> <p>Masahiro Sakurai, the creator behind <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby, is getting a manga adaptation of his life. <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/images/202510/55235/506460">As reported by <em>Famitsu</em>,</a> the 160-page book will be released in Japan on November 18. There are currently no plans to release the manga in the United States. Sakurai supervised the creation of the book, which will launch two days before <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a>, directed by Sakurai, arrives on Nintendo Switch 2. Here are the six chapters, according to <em>Famitsu</em>.</p> <ol> <li>Young Sakurai and Games</li> <li>The Birth of Kirby</li> <li>The Beginning of Super Smash Bros</li> <li>The Founding of Sora, Inc</li> <li>The Legacy</li> <li>A Beacon for the Future</li> </ol> <h2><strong>Jim Carrey Reportedly In Talks To Star In Colin Trevorrow’s <em>Jetsons</em> Movie</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jim-carrey-jetsons-movie-colin-trevorrow-live-action/"><em>The Wrap</em> is reporting</a> that <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797">Jim Carrey</a> and director Colin Trevorrow (<em>Jurassic World</em>) are teaming up to make a live-action<em> Jetsons</em> movie. Sure! I guess. I mean, why not? They made a <em>Flintstones</em> live-action movie (and it got a sequel), so I guess it’s only fair that <em>The Jetsons</em> get their own Hollywood movie. I’m not sure how many people are chomping at the bit for this reported adaptation, which might explain why the studio is going after Jim Carrey for the starring role. As someone who doesn’t care at all about <em>The Jetsons</em>, I’m mildly interested in seeing this movie simply because it might have Jim Carrey in it, and I’m always down to see him be a cinematic buffoon.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-theater-return-halloween-2000635744"><em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em> Is Coming Back To Theaters&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">Xbox’s new handheld device is fine, but expensive</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-plants-vs-zombies-remastered-replanted-trailer-cringe-fake-twitch-stream-2000635689">This new trailer for the remastered PvZ game is hard to watch</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Z-A Shinies Don’t Disappear, Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shinies-dont-disappear-ever/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-shinies-don%E2%80%99t-disappear-ever.1326733/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like other games, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has Shinies. These are extremely rare and differently color-paletted versions of their regular counterparts. If you’re worried about the game’s auto-save ability making it so that you miss out on rare Shiny encounters, then you can breathe easy and use Sleep Power on yourself.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-starters-shiny-locked-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shinies</a> are the holy grail of Pokémon. Legendaries are great, but the feeling of finding a Shiny version of a Pokémon is like pulling a Charizard from a Pokémon pack—wilder than anything that inhabits Viridian Forest. Shinies are usually liable to disappear if you don’t reach them in Pokémon games, but this isn’t the case in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Shiny indeed. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Players are learning that if you hear or see a Shiny Pokémon in Legends: Z-A and it’s in your game world, you have infinite time to catch it—providing you don’t go over the Shiny limit.</p>



<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AustinJohnPlays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Austin John Plays</a> does a great job of explaining how Z-A approaches Shinies. Despite the game’s auto-save system, once a Shiny appears in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, it will remain until you interact with it: Fighting it or trying to catch it.</p>



<p>Austin John Plays explains that “Up to 10 Pokémon, who are Shiny, will be preserved in the game’s memory.” This means you have ample time to catch or reach a Shiny Pokémon,</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The mechanics and theory have been tested by other Pokémon Legends: Z-A players, too. A subreddit thread explained how the OP encountered a Shiny Magikarp, went away, changed the time of day, came back, and it was still there.</p>



<p>They did several other actions—also involving the passage of time and/or traveling—and the Shiny Magikarp didn’t budge.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is what we call a good quality of life feature. You don’t have to worry about games or loss of connection ruining your chances of capturing a rare Shiny.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Quantic Dream, the developer of narrative-based single-player games such as Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls and Detroit: Become Human, has announced its first ever multiplayer project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spellcasters Chronicles will be a drastic departure for the studio, as a free-to-play competitive team-based 3v3 action strategy game set to launch in closed beta via Steam before the end of this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Quantic Dream boss David Cage confirmed the studio would still work on single-player projects, including its long-gestating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars Eclipse</a>. But the company will now operate as a multi-project studio, Cage said, with Spellcasters Chronicles its first attempt at a multiplayer title. An official reveal trailer lies just below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team," Cage explained in a statement today. "We now look forward to shaping the game further with players' feedback and to perfecting this journey together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Spellcasters Chronicles might be unlike anything Quantic Dream has made before, Cage suggested the project actually reflected both the "creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Describing the game as a blend of action and strategy genres depicted with an animated fantasy aesthetic, Cage said Spellcasters Chronicles would allow the famously story-led Quantic Dream a chance at "exploring community-driven narrative." A more in-depth look at gameplay follows:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spellcasters Chronicles matches will see two teams of three players compete in "fast paced 25-minutes" matches, the developer said, as "teams must capture altars to gain territory and destroy their opponents' Lifestones to claim their victory."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll play as Spellcasters, described as "archetype-driven mages with distinct identities" that fight with spells and summoned creatures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After years of development, we can't wait to finally share the world of Spellcasters Chronicles with players," said game director Gregorie Diaconu. "We are starting our closed beta phase with our core-loop focused on arena battles and will introduce community narrative and other elements of our macro-loop in the following months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heavy-rain-and-detroit-become-human-developer-quantic-dream-insists-star-wars-eclipse-development-continues-despite-competitive-multiplayer-game-plans">Cage offered the briefest of updates on Quantic Dream's highly-anticipated Star Wars Eclipse</a>, confirming the game remained in development. "Of course, development of Star Wars Eclipse continues," Cage confirmed, "and we are eager to share more with you in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Tributes to the Dead or Alive creator have been pouring in from fans and fellow game developers alike, especially in his home country of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The following post was made in Japanese on Itagaki’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4120822378181849&amp;id=100007623816758&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=DODdRsfRJWqEWKWB#" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Facebook</u></a>.</p><blockquote>“My Last Words:</blockquote><blockquote>The flame of my life is finally about to be extinguished.</blockquote><blockquote>The fact that this message has been posted means that the time has finally come.

Image credit: Tomonobu Itagaki / Facebook.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Joining Tecmo in the early 1990s, Itagaki created Dead or Alive, working on seven titles in the fighting series, including its move into beach volleyball. He also played a key role in reviving Ninja Gaiden, with 2004’s Xbox-exclusive Ninja Gaiden reboot and subsequent games. However, he made a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/03/itagaki-resigns"><u>dramatic exit from Tecmo in 2008</u></a>, suing the company for damages in Tokyo District Court, a matter that was eventually settled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He subsequently went on to found Valhalla Studios with former members of Team Ninja and directed Devil’s Third, which released in 2015. In 2021, he established Itagaki Games, with the aim of producing a new work, but unfortunately this never happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tributes poured in from fellow game developers. On the Facebook post, Tekken series producer Katsuhiro Harada commented: “No way Itagaki-san- You said to me we’d go out for a drink next time” — which apparently was their last exchange. Harada followed this up with a <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1978773188034109651" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy post</u></a> on Twitter / X in English, describing the full history of his sometimes rivalry-fuelled relationship with Itagaki. Despite working for different companies on competing fighting game franchises, Harada recounts that Itagaki referred to him as a “comrade-in-arms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken 8 director Kohei Ikeda <a href="https://x.com/nkt_dreamer/status/1978762395796279378" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lamented</u></a> Itagaki’s passing at only 58 years old: “Rest in peace Itagaki-san, the fighting game legend who shaped an era.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja Studios also posted the following response on <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X / Twitter</a> in both English and Japanese: “We are deeply saddened by the passing of Team Ninja's first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki. We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Super Robot Wars series producer Takanobu Terada <a href="https://x.com/TakanobuTerada/status/1978763505768792410" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recalled</u></a> that “although we had no professional connections, Itagaki reached out to me quite a while ago and said ‘let’s meet’ and we ended up having dinner together.” Terada also recounted that Itagaki encouraged him, saying: “please keep on enthusiastically creating things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Likewise, former Dragon Quest producer Ryutaro Ichimura <a href="https://x.com/RyutaroIchimura/status/1978769650046693880" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reminisced</u></a> about fond memories of discussing the future of the game industry with Itagaki over food and drink. He recalled Itagaki’s warm words of encouragement, and remembered when Itagaki asked him for his autograph to give to a relative who was Ichimura’s fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I felt Itagaki’s kindness in that moment, which made me even more of a fan of his,” he said. Hearing of Itagaki’s passing, Ichimura noted that “it didn’t feel real at first but once the truth hit me, I couldn’t stop crying. Carrying Itagaki’s words with me, I want to keep pushing forward and continue to create new works without any regrets.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Kirby and Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai also took to <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1978773161777766864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> to comment, simply saying: "May his soul rest in peace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

                <p>Windows 11 has been out in its current form since 2021, but Microsoft has grand visions of transforming its operating system into an even more AI-friendly system. Starting today, Microsoft is adding AI features to Windows 11 PCs that encourage users to utilize Copilot by speaking to their computers and allowing AI to perform some basic functions for them. These updates are being rolled out alongside an ad campaign that invites people to "meet the computer you can talk to."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgQMcwhq334" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KgQMcwhq334" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We think we're on the cusp of the next evolution, where AI happens not just in that chatbot and gets naturally integrated into the hundreds of millions of experiences that people use every day," Microsoft consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/799768/microsoft-windows-ai-copilot-voice-vision-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>. "The vision that we have is: Let's rewrite the entire operating system around AI, and build essentially what becomes truly the AI PC."</p><p>The new features sound similar to the Cortana voice options on Windows 10. For example, users will be able to bring their PC out of standby by saying "Hey, Copilot!" as a command. Mehdi also shared his belief that users will embrace voice controls on a greater level than they have in the past.</p><p>Windows 11 users will have to give AI permission to take actions on their behalf before it can do so. As part of its rollout strategy, Microsoft is using Copilot Vision to scan everything on-screen and provide users with help or prompts about documents, photos, and programs. However, Copilot Actions--the AI assistant that can perform actions for a local PC--is still in the testing phase, and not ready for a full release at this time. In the meantime, Copilot is being integrated into the Windows taskbar for easier access to the voice commands.</p><p>Earlier this week, prominent game developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI tools should be embraced</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Eclipse Reveal Trailer | Game Awards 2021</p>
      </div>
<p>The game takes place during the High Republic era. That period, set before any of the Star Wars films, finds the Republic at its peak, but there are threats to the galaxy that players have to deal with.</p><p>"See the galaxy through the eyes of an ensemble cast of multiple, charismatic playable characters, each with their own morality, personality, motivations, and impact upon each other and the story at large," reads a line from the game's description. The game will take players to an uncharted region of the galaxy in the Outer Rim. The game also will include new characters, and like other Quantic Dream games, will include a branching narrative that's heavy on dialogue and moral choices.</p><p>Quantic Dream is making Star Wars: Eclipse in partnership with Lucasfilm and Disney. Not all of the upcoming Disney game projects are going forward, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">EA's Black Panther game has been canceled</a> on the Marvel side.</p><p>Quantic Dream is also making its first multiplayer game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantic-dream-announces-its-first-multiplayer-game/1100-6535455/" data-ref-id="1100-6535455">Spellcasters Chronicles</a>, with a closed beta test lined up for later this year.</p><p>To support the multiple projects, Quantic Dream has doubled the size of its development team since 2018 and opened a new studio in Montreal. NetEase acquired Quantic Dream in 2022.</p><p>Since Quantic Dream's formation in 1997, the studio has released five games: The Nomad Soul, Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, and Detroit: Become Human.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The launch of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 29 (or on October 24 if you buy the more expensive Premium Edition). Ahead of that launch, and as part of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/09/18/cover-reveal-the-outer-worlds-2"><em>Game Informer's </em>cover story coverage for the game</a>, we spoke to Obsidian Entertainment about the lessons it learned from the first <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-outer-worlds/the-outer-worlds-review-good-company">Outer Worlds</a> that it applied to developing this sequel.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest takeaway is that even before the release of The Outer Worlds, Obsidian knew that if it were to create a sequel, it wanted to go bigger in every way. Director Brandon Adler tells us, "The cool part about the reaction [to the first game] was people were really kind of enthusiastic about the world and the IP itself [and] that naturally lends itself to people wanting a sequel.</p><p>"When they're talking about it, they want more. When we did user research, when we talked to people, what came back was the biggest – I wouldn't call it a complaint – but the biggest things they wanted from future products were to make bigger areas, 'make more stuff for us. We want to experience more of this, we want a little more gameplay length.' And so those were easy things for us to target as we were kind of going through it all."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Adler continues, explaining that even before The Outer Worlds launched in 2019, Obsidian had a large list of things it wanted to do in a sequel. He says, "We wanted to allow for more reactivity towards either the player builds or things that were going on, in terms of role-playing things. And so for me personally, it was very important that we have very detailed, not only character creation, but character progression, as you're going through the game. That goes for our perks, our flaws, everything else you can build around your characters, and that's really important to find those cool and fun combinations and ways to role-play your character." Adler says it's not enough to have a few gameplay effects in combat and dialogue based on your build – Obsidian wants the whole world reacting to you.&nbsp;</p><p>He says The Outer Worlds 2 will constantly be checking your RPG stats, whether that's skills, perks, your background, items held, equipment you have, and information you've discovered. "We started from the beginning, making sure we hit really, really hard on those things, and I think we've done a really good job of making that work throughout the entire process."&nbsp;</p><p>Creative director Leonard Boyarsky responded by explaining that the lack of restrictions in The Outer Worlds 2, compared to the first game, is a big highlight.&nbsp;</p><p>"I keep going back to, unfortunately, on the base game, we were very restricted in what we could do," he says. "We can't have a decision you make cut off 10% of the game when the game's 20 to 30 hours long. That's just not going to happen, but we couldn't make a much bigger game because of where we're at. We were like, 'If we do a sequel, we know it needs to be bigger. We know we need to go back to our roots in terms of deeper RPG reactivity.' So we had all these things we couldn't do in the base game that we were just waiting to tackle in this next one."</p>

<p>Boyarsky remembers discussing what the team wants to do next when diving into The Outer Worlds 2 development and how easy the conversation went because Obsidian already had a laundry list of things it couldn't do in the first game it wanted to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Adler chimes in to say that's why working on a sequel is easier in a lot of ways. "We have a base, we know what the tone of the game should be, we know basic stuff, like how to build out a level and what the player's going to be doing in them," he says. "We don't have to spend a lot of time prototyping, [so] we can instead spend a lot of our time looking at where we were, where we want to be, and figuring out how to bridge that gap."</p><p>Boyarsky agrees with Adler, noting that the first game was harder because he and co-creator Tim Cain had to create the vision and tone of the universe. With that established, it no longer has to point to other properties or references to help people understand what this series is – it can point right to the first game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Obsidian prepares for The Outer Worlds 2 to be in people's hands this month, <em>Game Informer </em>asked Boyarsky and Adler about their thoughts on the reception to the first game. Boyarsky says he was really hopeful that people would like The Outer Worlds, but also concerned because of its size compared to other Obsidian games. "I knew one of our goals was to ship a really polished game, which, when making a hardcore RPG, can be very difficult at times; to get that polish when you have so many paths through.&nbsp;</p><p>"Some people were a little bit disappointed in the length or some of the lack of complexity that they associate with Obsidian games in the past, but there was a huge outpouring of love and appreciation for the game, just for what it was, and that was really heartening. I really was thinking it was going to live or die on our writing and our characters and a lot that Obsidian is known for, and people seemed to respond to that stuff really well, so it was a great reaction for us."</p><p>Though Adler didn't work on The Outer Worlds, he says he's always naturally pessimistic about any game's release because it's impossible to ignore the things he couldn't do or fix in time. "We always think, 'Oh my gosh, it's the worst game in the world, how could anybody ever love this thing?' and then it comes out and you get this huge outpouring of love, and then you think, 'Oh that's right, we know how to make good [games]."</p><hr><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/09/30/the-outer-worlds-2-cover-story"><em>Game Informer's </em>cover story for The Outer Worlds 2</a> is available to read right now if you're a subscriber (and this issue is shipping to mailboxes as we speak).

            <p>Quantic Dream, the studio behind narrative games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, has revealed its first-ever multiplayer game.</p>
<p>Earlier today, studio founder David Cage shared a blog post on forthcoming projects, mentioning it was working on a new multiplayer game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-is-still-in-development-quantic-dreams-assures-alongside-new-competitive-multiplayer-game">alongside continued development of Star Wars: Eclipse</a>.</p>
<p>Now the studio has revealed Spellcasters Chronicles, a free-to-play team-based multiplayer game of 3v3 third-person arena battles. Check out gameplay in the teaser trailer below.</p>

<p>Players will take on the role of the titular Spellcasters, mages of distinct archetypes split between support, tank, or damage dealer. Further, a strategic deck-build system will allow players to select from over 50 spells and summons, plus there are summonable Titans too.</p><p>"We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios," said Cage. "Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players' feedback and to perfecting this journey together."</p>
<p>"Spellcasters Chronicles began as a creative experiment, an opportunity to channel our passion for storytelling into a shared, living world," explained game director Gregorie Diaconu. "While very different from our previous titles, it builds on what has always driven us: giving players the power to shape stories - this time in a collective manner."</p>
<p>A closed beta for the game will take place on PC (Steam) by the end of 2025, with <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/en-US/beta">sign-ups now open</a>.</p>
<p>Before then, the game will be shown at TwitchCon this weekend, which will also be streamed on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lan">Twitch LAN channel</a>.</p>
<p>Spellcasters Chronicles will be the first game from Quantic Dream since Detroit: Become Human in 2018. The studio is  also working on the long-in-development Star Wars: Eclipse, though Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">confirmed earlier this year it wasn't impacted by cuts at NetEase</a>.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has addressed recent server breach claims made by hacking group Crimson Collective, insisting no "development or business information" has been leaked from its servers, and that it's so far found no evidence any personal information has been compromised.
</p>
<p>
Crimson Collective <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hackers-claim-to-have-breached-internal-nintendo-data">claimed to have "breached" Nintendo's servers and stolen internal data</a> in a message widely shared on social media earlier this month. The claim was accompanied by an image purportedly showing a digital depository of Nintendo manuals, admin and development assets, and more.
</p>
<p>
Now, in a statement provided to <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">Japanese publication The Sankei Shimbun</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-responds-to-reports-its-servers-were-breached-while-keeping-silent-on-pokmon-teraleak">IGN</a>), Nintendo has downplayed the incident. "We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information," the company said.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo did not, however, address <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-devastating-pokemon-leak-reveals-plans-for-future-games-but-its-the-reported-development-budgets-that-have-left-players-stunned">this week's major leak of new Game Freak data</a>, including artwork and other details related to the studio's future Pokémon games. This latest leak stems from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reels-from-unprecedented-gigaleak-of-significant-internal-data">last year's "teraleak" hack</a>, which was confirmed to include personal details of Game Freak employees.
</p>
<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-want-to-force-discord-to-reveal-pokemon-teraleak-source">filed a request to subpoena Discord</a> for the hacker's identity in April, but it's unclear if its investigation has progressed any further since then.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right, before we get started here, I am making a big point to announce this article is going to be incredibly spoiler-heavy for both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-walkthrough-tips-tricks">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. We've got late-game spoilers for Arceus, and I'll be chatting about something you discover in one of the (sadly quite limited) locations in ZA's Lumiose city. You've been warned.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Pokémon Legends Arcues and Pokémon Legends: Z-A spoilers follow.</h2>
<p>Right, some context. Back in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-x-and-y">Pokémon X and Y</a>, when you finally got to Lumiose City, you could explore various sectors of the large settlement. Over on the North Boulevard, one key tourist trap was the Lumiose Museum which was home to a nice little collection of objects that seemed to point cheekily to  other regions of the Pokémon world - whether that was Sinnoh’s Battle Frontier or Unova’s Castelia City, this little Parisian-esque cultural collection was a nice, knowing nod to wider Pokémon lore.</p>
<p>But, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, it seems the museum has expanded a bit, and now explores not just the horizontality of the Pokémon world, but the verticality of it, as well, as there are new collections in the museum's halls that explore the world's peculiar timeline. As you gain access to this museum, one of the collections stands out: it's a little exhibition of 'formal attire', that Arceus players will recognise as Volo's outfit from the previous game in the spin-off series.</p>
<p>Volo, who bore a striking resemblance to Cynthia and even used many Pokémon she'd later use in her team, was a key figure in the last game. The loner cropped up quite a lot, always seeming to be one step ahead of you in your journey, and was fixated on the rich mythology of the Hisui region (with a particular interest in the Plates held by the special and Legendary Pokémon around the region).</p><p>As it turns out, though, Volo was never really there to help out. He was actually pretty vexed at you, and the schism in space-time that teleported you to the region in the first place. Why? Because, well, he wanted to create the universe anew, shaped with his own ideals and values. A bit heavy for a kid's game, if you ask me.</p>
<p>Volo was a peculiar character: he had a relationship with Cogita, a member of the 'ancient Sinnoh people', and claimed to be one himself. But, in-game, this was never really verified. He'd say things like he was willing to even take centuries to locate and conquer Arceus, but you'd be forgiven for chalking that up to dramatic villain talk. Turns out, he genuinely could.</p>
<p>In Legends: Z-A, interacting with Volo's outfit proffers the following text:</p>
<blockquote><p>Formal Attire. This outfit is said to have been worn by the ancient Sinnoh people during their rituals. This group worshipped the Pokémon Arceus as an almighty deity. It is thought that they showed their respect by mimicking Arceus' appearance - even reflected in the way that they styled their hair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much on its own, sure. But then the curator adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was told that the person who wore this outfit donated it to the collection personally. Apparently, he gazed a while at those sketches by Professor Laventon with this nostalgic air, too…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What can we infer from this? Well, the collection is new - added between X and Y and Legends: Z-A, which occurs later in the timeline (Lumiose City is redeveloped compared to its first appearance). That means Volo has, in the interceding years, appeared in the city - alive and well - and donated his old ritual clothing. What's more, he doesn't appear to have dethroned God just yet. Maybe the actions of our heroes in Hisui/Sinnoh knocked that wind out of him for good. Or maybe not…</p><p>It's a small little nod that wraps up one dangling thread from the last Legends game, and I'm actually quite pleased to see it manifest in-game. There's not a lot of exploration and depth to the city in Legends: Z-A, so at least Game Freak has added some little nuggets for the lore-heads, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Volo and Cogita aren't the only immortals in the game; X and Y - and, hence, Z-A - also have the enigmatic AZ, the former king of the Kalos region, the creator of the ultimate weapon, and the current owner of Hotel Z. Quite the CV, eh? He's also got a portrait in the museum. Whether his longevity is linked to that of Volo/Cogita remains to be seen, and I wonder if it's something Game Freak is set to explore in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc">the upcoming Pokemon Legends Z-A Mega Dimension DLC</a>...</p>

			<p>The Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT mod breathes new life into the visuals of the classic game, but the performance cost is considerable—even on a top-end GPU like the RTX 5080.</p>



<p>The mod, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/">first work-in-progress release</a> was launched earlier this month, uses RTX Remix to overhaul the visuals of the iconic No Mercy campaign with realistic lighting, high-resolution PBR materials, and full compatibility with ray tracing technologies. </p>



<p>A fresh comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts the original game and the RTX Remix modded version running side-by-side, highlighting how the massive visual overhaul comes at a significant performance cost</p>



<p>While the performance difference varies between different scenarios, the hit is always dramatic. In one sequence (at the 1:10 mark), the modded Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT runs at an average of around 30 FPS at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode. This is in sharp contrast to the vanilla game, which exceeds 500 FPS on the same RTX 5080 GPU.</p>



<p>The performance hit is similarly massive in another sequence (at 1:29), dropping from the high 500 FPS range down to the 50 FPS range. Once again, it’s clear that <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">current gaming hardware can still not handle full path tracing</a> without heavily relying on upscaling and frame generation to hit playable framerates.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/quantic-dream-is-making-a-competitive-multiplayer-game-work-on-star-wars-eclipse-%E2%80%9Ccontinues%E2%80%9D.1326682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Quantic Dream, the studio co-founded by David Cage and known for single-player, story-driven games like Detroit: Become Human, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls, and is currently working on Star Wars: Eclipse, has announced that it is making a competitive multiplayer game.</p>



<p>"<em>For over 28 years, Quantic Dream has been pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling,</em>" co-founder David Cage writes in <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">the opening of a blog post on the studio's website</a>, which announced the new competitive multiplayer title, a genre not exactly known for its storytelling.</p>



<p>"<em>After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step. Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been a part of our DNA.</em> <em>We know how demanding it is to create something new. Earning the trust of players, standing out in such a competitive space, and introducing fresh concepts is incredibly challenging. And since we have no legacy in this genre, we know we have everything to prove, which is why your support and feedback will be essential. Together, we believe we can create something truly unique</em>."</p>



<p>The singular mention of Star Wars: Eclipse comes in the following line, where all Cage says is, "<em>Of course, development of Star Wars: Eclipse continues, and we are eager to share more with you</em> <em>in the future</em>." The last update we got for Star Wars: Eclipse before this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/">was in 2023, when the game was "<em>simmering</em>."</a> Since then, it's lead writer, who had been with Quantic Dream for years and led writing on games like Detroit: Become Human, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg/">left and formed his own studio</a>.</p>



<p>To call this announcement a "<em>surprise</em>" is a grave understatement, since Quantic Dream is arguably the last studio anyone would expect to make a competitive multiplayer game. It's also a major risk, since we've seen multiple single-player, narrative-game-focused studios try to pivot to multiplayer games before, and failing miserably.</p>







<p>Of course, there's always the chance that the stars align for Cage and Quantic Dream, and whatever competitive multiplayer game they make becomes a huge success. We can always hope for the best outcome, but if the history of studios making a pivot like this can teach us anything, it's that Quantic Dream has a difficult, and more than likely ruinous path ahead of it.</p>

            <p>Huh. It turns out Quantic Dream, makers of such decision-heavy dramas as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, haven’t just been tinkering with their long-teased <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars: Eclipse</a>. They’re also taking a sharp turn into competitive multiplayer, announcing Spellcasters Chronicles: a 3v3, third-person, free-to-play MOBA full of aerial magefights and big stompy demon lads. <em>Huh</em>.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine a starker departure from the studio’s previous work, or a riskier one. The modern Multiplayer Online Battle Arena isn’t so much a genre as a graveyard, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> ambling around and occasionally sharing a knowing look between the headstones. Still, Spellcasters Chronicles seems determined to try, offering shorter, punchier matches and bigger maelstroms of hero-shooter spectacle.</p>

<p>To wit, everyone can fly. Everyone, from the gothy shamans to the vaguely Druidic witches that make up the game’s roster of multicultural magic-spewers. While the map looks like a fairly conventional three-lane affair, Spellcasters Chronicles encourages zip-zooping through the air above, three-dimensionally duelling other players, and raining down an assortment of (often screen-filling) arcane attacks on creeps.</p>
<p>Summoning your own minions is a focus as well. Capturing territories affords you more opportunities to call forth a powerful familiar, like the Astral Monk’s battle elephant, and eventually, players can spawn even bigger beasts called Titans: magic kaiju that will rampage down a lane unless stopped by either massive combined firepower or, more likely, an opposing Titan. At which point the objective effectively shifts from lane dominance to a noisy game of wizard conkers, buffing your own big guy to punch harder while chipping away at the other big guy’s health.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Quantic Dream</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another novelty is the deckbuilding element to spell loadouts. Characters fit into archetypes – tank, support, or damage dealer – but you can customise their skills (and summons) before each match, choosing from abilities and monsters that you’ve unlocked in previous battles. This is also where Spellcasters Chronicles draws its tactical flexibility, as although there’s no shopping system to gain strength through items, min-maxing spell upgrades can still create distinct builds to press a character’s natural advantages or counter those of an enemy.</p><p>It's still all very strange to be witnessing this stuff in a Quantic Dream game, though the studio claim that Spellcasters Chronicles will still have some kind of meaningful narrative across its season. And that, in places, it may even branch out in response to player decisions. How, exactly, remains vague: game director Gregorie Diaconu says that "Spellcasters Chronicles began as a creative experiment, an opportunity to channel our passion for storytelling into a shared, living world. While very different from our previous titles, it builds on what has always driven us: giving players the power to shape stories - this time in a collective manner." Which doesn’t explain much.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Quantic Dream</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A blurb I found elsewhere in the announcement paperwork is slightly clearer, stating that "Each season, you will face a choice that impacts the gameplay and lore of the game." I still don’t know how that’d be executed as a series of "collective" choices – voting, maybe? Storytelling by democracy? Not sure about that, no sir. I’ve spent thousands of hours around Dota players and am convinced most of us shouldn’t even be allowed to choose when we leave the house.</p>
<p>I’m also not sure what Spellcasters Chronicles’ chances are in a corner of online play that’s hard enough to break into, let alone survive in. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> is already doing the highly mobile, third-person MOBA thing, and besides Valve pedigree, that offers a generally more interesting and distinctive world than what so far seems like just another broadly-defined fantasy setting. And while the sense of scale looks impressive, especially with two Titans slapping each other about, I worry that summons might be a little <em>too</em> important: a good MOBA satisfies when you gain mastery of your hero, not when you run backup for an AI entity so it can win the game for you.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Quantic Dream</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Still, I haven’t played the thing. Frankly I haven’t played Deadlock in months either, so maybe deep down I’m just a puritan codger who thinks MOBAs should stay top-down like God intended. No release date for Spellcasters Chronicles yet but a closed beta is planned for sometime later this year.</p><p>Both this and Star Wars: Eclipse come as Quantic Dream try to patch together some goodwill, following French media reports in 2018 of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dream-deny-abusive-working-conditions">abusive workplace behaviour</a> and financial irregularities at the Paris-headquartered studio. As our sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/quantic-dream-wins-one-libel-case-loses-another">GI.biz</a> reported in 2021, co-founders Guillaume de Fondaumière and David Cage successfully sued newspaper Le Monde for libel, but lost a similar case against Mediapart after the court ruled that the journalists involved "had, for each of the accusations, enough factual evidence."</p>

            <p>
Unionised EA workers and senators have spoken out against the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> publisher's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">recently announced acquisition by US and Saudi-backed investors</a>, which (assuming it's approved by regulators) will leave the resulting privately-owned EA with a $20 billion debt. The two sets of complainants appear equally cheesed-off, but for mostly different reasons.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In a statement shared with RPS and other sites, the United Videogame Workers-CWA - a direct-join union that spans the whole US and Canadian games industry - criticised company management for neglecting to consult EA workers and risking future mass layoffs as the new owners scrape to pay off the bank.</p>
<p>They note that EA was prosperous prior to the acquisition, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520290/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-ea-bioware-layoffs/">previous rounds of job cuts</a> notwithstanding, and conclude that "if jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".
</p>
<p>
"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world. EA's success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place. Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed. 
</p><p>
"We are particularly worried about the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation," the union statement adds. This could be an allusion to studios like BioWare, who have an outsized cultural influence but have struggled to meet EA's financial hopes - a former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive has suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-exec-thinks-eas-new-owners-might-sell-bioware-and-use-other-studios-for-saudi-arabian-pr">BioWare could be gutted, sold off or even closed</a> by the acquiring consortium.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," the statement continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."
</p>
<p>
tldr: Gondor cries for aid. And Rohan will answer! Though more because they're worried about Saudi Arabia's rulers having their fingers in another pie, than because they're concerned about potential job losses. In <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">public letters</a> to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson earlier this week, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren called for a public investigation of "the foreign influence and national security risks" of flogging a major US games publisher to a group that includes Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. 
</p><p>
Warren and Blumenthal offer the familiar argument that the PIF's investment - which will give it a majority stake in the firm, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">according to the Financial Times</a> - is about improving Saudi Arabia's repressive and authoritarian public image and extending its influence overseas.

The senators suggest that Saudi Arabia might use access to EA consumer data for surveillance and propaganda purposes, and are concerned about what the country's rulers might do with EA's proprietary generative AI technologies (which have reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">been deemed crucial to paying off that staggering loan</a>). They allege that Affinity Partners founder Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, is only involved with the transaction to ensure that it gets past the US regulators.

<p>
Finally, they note that as a private company, EA would no longer be obliged to report their financial status and plans to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Warren and Blumenthal fear this will allow the new bosses to get up to all kinds of anti-American shenanigans behind the scenes.
</p><p>
"The PIF's control over EA's operations could extend to influencing or directing the company's design, features, and product decisions to advance the Saudi government's specific and long-term objectives," the senators write. "PIF would be well positioned to dictate or veto what stories are told to Americans through the popular medium of video games, controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture. In short, the Saudi government's ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide."
</p>
<p>
I can see the argument that Saudi Arabia's investments in videogames are designed to deflect criticism of its terrible human rights record and clean up its profile overseas. It's also hard to deny the proposed sneaky logic behind Kushner's involvement. I have to say, though, the alarm over Saudi Arabia potentially "controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture" makes my eyes roll back into my head. The US entertainment industry has global reach, and examples of powerful American media publishers creating slanted representations of other cultures aren't exactly rare. 
</p>
<p>
EA's own Battlefield 6, for example, explicitly lumps together thinly referenced geopolitical aggressors into one all-purpose US-hating bogeyman, washing its hands of their distinctions. Admittedly, the story does portray said bogeyman as a monster of the USA's cultivation, but that's a cheap and belated piece of self-reflexivity that is never seriously explored. Read all about it in my swivel-eyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6 review</a>.

</p>
<p>The letter from Warren and Blumenthal doesn't touch on any of the concerns shared by the unionised games industry workers in their own appeal for greater scrutiny of the deal. Being a mucky old Limey, I'm not particularly familiar with the political background here, but both senators appear to be pro-union - perhaps they and the United Videogame Workers-CWA should get in touch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-will-go-down-swinging-against-windows-11.1326661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On October 14, Microsoft ended security support for Windows 10. I’ve known this was coming for ages, but kept telling myself I had plenty of time to think about what to do about it. The decision I made was to… do nothing except occasionally get kinda pissed about it, and now that the moment is here, it seems like I’m going to do nothing <em>but</em> get pissed about it.</p><p>My anger at this transition up to this point had mostly been personal. I built (“<a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built</a>”) my PC, and while its hardware is Windows 11 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compatible</a>, there are a couple things I have to screw with to set up secure boot and enable TPM 2.0. I have only the vaguest grasp of what these are, but I’m&nbsp; 80% sure I can enable them in my BIOS, a place I have rarely visited. I watched some YouTube videos about all this and it seems achievable, I just haven’t worked up the courage or found the dedicated time to venture unsupervised into my PC’s guts.</p><p>I have also not worked up the motivation to do all this just to end up with Windows 11, an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-laden</a> system that I have zero desire for. AI has already forced its way into my daily software like Google suite and Quickbooks, both of which also rolled out obligatory price increases with the addition. I’ve subjected my Aftermath colleagues to multiple furious rants about this: I don’t <em>want</em> AI fucking around in my emails and balance sheets; I <em>certainly</em> don’t want to become a statistic in Gemini or Copilot’s user numbers. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/799768/microsoft-windows-ai-copilot-voice-vision-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> today quoted Microsoft executive VP and marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi in saying the company’s vision is to “rewrite the entire operating system around AI, and build essentially what becomes truly the AI PC.” Do you want this? I sure as shit don’t want this, and I especially don’t want to be strong-armed into it so Microsoft can fudge the numbers on its AI products’ popularity.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also BDS’ <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft boycott</a>, which <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">includes</a> the company’s operating system. I’ll be honest that this is a tough one for me: I have no love for Microsoft and Windows as a concept, but the alternative is open source OSes that you can probably tell from this blog are a bit above my pay grade. Windows is the platform that works the best, or at least the most straightforwardly, for the gaming I use my PC for, for fun but also for work. I’ve gone back and forth with myself between “I need this to do my job” and the fact that, however intimidating it might feel, learning Linux is a meaningless inconvenience compared to doing the right thing to actively face my own complicity in Israel’s war crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>All of these factors have contributed to my procrastination, now become a decision point. I learned this week that I can extend Windows’ security support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/windows-10-support-has-ended-but-heres-how-to-get-an-extra-year-for-free-125118875.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another year</a>, either for free if I can remember my Microsoft account login and be willing to engage with OneDrive, or for a fee (haha, no).&nbsp;</p><p>But here’s where my thinking turned. As <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-end-of-windows-10-support-is-an-e-waste-disaster-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 pointed out yesterday</a>, this extended support offer suggests “it would be trivial for [Microsoft] to continue to offer critical security updates for free.” As I grumbled over this change for a year, I usually figured there must be <em>some</em> good reason for all this. After all, I’ve had to upgrade Windows OSes in the past; while I don’t remember any of them being this onerous, I also hadn’t built my own PC for any of them. But realizing the company <em>could</em> keep offering support, it just doesn’t <em>want </em>to, started to make me realize that maybe this is all bullshit.</p><p>404 goes on:</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft’s decision to sunset Windows 10 support is particularly concerning considering that <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 42 percent of all Windows users</a> are currently using Windows 10. When Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 8, just 3.7 percent of computers were using it, and just 2.2 percent of Windows users were using Windows 8.1 when Microsoft stopped supporting that operating system.&nbsp;</p><p>“More than 40 percent of Windows users still use it,” [PIRG campaign director Nathan] Proctor said. “So to cut support for something that is legitimately a flagship product is bizarre. No one expects Microsoft to do software updates forever, but when 43 percent of your customers are using it, it’s not obsolete.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Seeing the numbers laid out like this really hit me: since I’m surrounded by very <a href="https://aftermath.site/iem-recommendation-hardware-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">techy people</a>, I figured my foot-dragging on upgrading was just me being an 18th century Shaker trapped in the body of a 21st century games journalist. But plenty of people besides me are still happily ("happily") using Windows 10–especially, as 404 points out, schools and other institutions that are now over a barrel if they own machines that aren’t compatible with Windows 11–making this forced change utterly arbitrary and needlessly severe. 404 and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-openly-promotes-tossing-your-laptop-into-a-big-pile-of-e-waste" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others</a> have pointed out the immense amount of e-waste this all stands to create; putting this on schools and government institutions at a time when both are under attack seems like it stands to do nothing but further degrade essential services. And that’s to say nothing of all the individuals who might find themselves feeling squeezed to buy a new computer at a time when money is tighter than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no <em>reason</em> for any of this to be happening the way it is beyond forced obsolescence and for Microsoft to flaunt its useless AI products and pump its bottom line. New OSes happen, but this whole rollout doesn’t need to be going the way it’s going. I’ll admit to finding something grimly comforting in seeing what I thought was just my own inadequacy at computers despite working with them as having at least some systemic roots I can rail at instead of feeling bad about myself. There’s even something inspiring, if not a bit exhausting, in learning there are always new things I can get motivated to fight back against. I'm full of piss and vinegar! I'm alive!</p><p>But, like so many things in our lives these days, realizing it’s all bullshit doesn’t get you <em>out </em>of the bullshit, as our billionaires and tech overlords go full masks off about how much they just don’t care about the average person and their needs. 404 points to a <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/why-the-end-of-support-for-windows-10-is-uniquely-troubling/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">petition for Microsoft to extend Windows 10 support</a>, even while noting it's a long shot. As ever, this whole thing mostly inspires me to want to abandon all my electronics on a street corner and start riding my bike to Alaska; while it would be a lot harder than learning Linux, at least it would be a lot more fun.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch"><h3>I Can’t Believe We’re Still Talking About This</h3></a><p>CollarGate is one of the internet's dumbest psychosis events yet</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-saudi-arabia-buyout-faces-fresh-backlash-from-senators-and-developers.1326655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have called on the Treasury Department to hit the brakes on Saudi Arabia’s private-equity-backed buyout of Electronic Arts over national security concerns, including the deal giving a foreign country unfettered access to “sensitive consumer data.” They’ve demanded an investigation into the risks associated with the unprecedented agreement which is expected to earn a $500 million windfall for the banking partners involved in the fees alone.</p> <p>“We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company and request that you provide the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs information on how CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) plans to ensure that the national security risks arising from the proposed acquisition may be mitigated,” the Democratic senators <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">wrote in a letter</a> to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week.</p>

 <p>It goes on to outline some of their concerns:</p> <blockquote><p>The PIF’s control over EA’s operations could extend to influencing or directing the company’s design, features, and product decisions to advance the Saudi government’s specific and long-term objectives. PIF would be well positioned to dictate or veto what stories are told to Americans through the popular medium of video games, controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture. In short, the Saudi government’s ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide. As one analyst observed, “Saudi Arabia clearly recognizes the political and cultural influence of video games, especially among young people.”</p></blockquote> <p>In addition to asking for guarantees from the Trump Administration that it’s investigated national security risks associated with the deal and how to mitigate them, the letter also calls for information about any communications the Treasury Department had with Jared Kushner ahead of the buyout’s announcement. Trump’s son-in-law is one of the members of the “consortium” that’s acquiring EA and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">prior reporting claimed</a> his connections to the president would be instrumental in helping it avoid regulatory scrutiny.</p>

 <h2>“EA is not a struggling company”</h2> <p>United Videogame Workers-CWA, a direct-join, industry-wide video game union with the Communications Workers of America, has also called for regulators to investigate the threat of mass layoffs associated with the acquisition. “If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors’ pockets—not to strengthen the company,” the group <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">wrote in a statement</a> on Thursday.</p>

 <p>It continued, “We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful.” The group is now <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">circulating a petition</a> for fans and developers to write to the Federal Trade Commission in support of investigating the terms of the deal more closely.</p>

 <p>While the CWA has made major in-roads with unionizing game workers at Microsoft-owned studios thanks to a <a href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa">soon-to-sunset labor neutrality agreement</a>, that organizing effort hasn’t yet resulted in unionized shops at places like EA. The leveraged buyout, set to complete sometime in mid-2027, could be the catalyst for teams at Respawn Entertainment or other EA-owned studios to seek union membership.</p>

 <h2>A $500 million windfall for Wall Street</h2> <p>While the exact terms of the buyout are still unknown, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-13/ea-buyout-why-jpmorgan-and-other-banks-have-so-much-riding-on-deal?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that the banking partners involved are set to make a small fortune just from the fees associated with it. Roughly $20 billion of the $55 billion acquisition will be debt-financed, with JP Morgan organizing the loan. <em>Bloomberg c</em>alls it the “biggest debt commitment ever by a single lender for an LBO [leveraged buyout].”</p>

 <p>That’s a lot of risk for EA, which would need to begin servicing high interest rates on the debt as part of the deal, and it’s led to fears that a new round of mass budget cuts and staff layoffs will follow if the merger is approved. While some analysts have argued that going private could free the publisher to pursue longer-term creative visions, it could just as well be an anchor that makes it more cash-hungry than ever.</p> <p>Banks, on the other hand, could make out either way. Anyone helping JP Morgan underwrite the debt will be in line for a piece of the roughly $500 million in banking fees that <em>Bloomberg</em> estimates the deal will bring in. EA’s c-suite will also be in position for a premium payout on all of their stock awards over the years. Most of EA’s employees, on the other hand, will be rewarded with fresh fears of layoffs.</p>

              <p>Specialty <em>Street Fighter s</em>andwiches are coming to select McDonald’s restaurants in Japan. The collaboration was revealed earlier today with a slick SNES-looking promo that made me want to grab my old 16-bit console back out of the closet. But while the food is inspired by<em> Street Fighter II</em>, there’s also a burger voting contest in <em>Street Fighter VI</em> right now complete with a new McDonalds-themed costume for Vega.</p> <p>The “Street Burgers” go on sale next week for a limited time, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55254">according to <em>Famitsu</em>,</a> and feature a teriyaki burger with an egg on it, a sweet and sour fried chicken sandwich, and a triple cheeseburger. What exactly do those combinations have to do with <em>Street Fighter</em> icons like Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li? No idea. But it’s neat and I want them.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">喰らえ！うまいやつを！ <a href="https://t.co/GpdKbCU5QN">pic.twitter.com/GpdKbCU5QN</a></p> <p>— マクドナルド (@McDonaldsJapan) <a href="https://twitter.com/McDonaldsJapan/status/1978634498175639955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately, they’re only available in Japan and I don’t have any international flights coming up. I’ll settle for watching someone on Instagram do the taste test in the weeks ahead. While the promo is supposed to get people to buy from McDonald’s, it’ll probably just get me to dip back into the <em>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</em> for a mini-impromptu arcade session instead.</p> <p>In addition to the sandwiches, the “Street Burger” event also features an “Overflowing Energy” McFizz that appears to be sparkling apple juice, and a McFloat that adds a scoop of soft-serve ice cream on top. That one you can definitely make at home if you’re feeling tempted.</p>

Together, with our players we’ve had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning – our first season of new content is just 12 days away.”</strong></p>

<p>"It's closer to Call of Duty-tier numbers than any of EA's premium-shooter efforts so far. But the question now is whether or not EA can foster this successful launch into a platform that stands the test of time," Anliena Analytics' Rhys Elliott said.</p><p>On Steam specifically, Battlefield 6 is putting up big numbers, reaching a peak concurrent-player record of more than 747,000. That's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/" data-ref-id="2900-6301">most concurrent players on Steam for any EA game</a>, even eclipsing the free-to-play Apex Legends (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">624k</a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1 launches on October 28</a>, which is also the day the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode is rumored to launch</a>. Season 1 will continue with Phase 2, Rogue Ops, on November 18, followed by Winter Offensive on December 9. These updates will add new maps, modes, and guns.</p><p>While Battlefield 6 may have had a hot start, it remains to be seen if it'll be able to, for the first time, outsell a Call of Duty game. Experts said prior to Battlefield 6's launch that they believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">that will not happen</a> and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> will outrank EA's game.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420"> Battlefield 6 review</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-guides-hub/1100-6533950/" data-ref-id="1100-6533950">Battlefield 6 guides hub.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">"I traveled with members of my team to Shenzhen, China, in July 2024 to discuss a variety of partnership opportunities with Tencent and its game studios, including Aurora Studios. With respect to Aurora Studios, we went into the meeting under the impression that they wanted to do a potential collaboration for The Last of Us," Courtemanche said in the filing.</p><p dir="ltr">No other specifics regarding the possible Last of Us project were disclosed in the document. Instead, Courtemanche says that Aurora presented a slide showing images of a Horizon collaboration in that 2024 meeting, which he argued Sony had already soundly rejected previously.</p><p dir="ltr">In late 2023, Naughty Dog announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/">The Last of Us multiplayer game had been canned</a>, with the developer focusing on single-player games going forward.

                <p>Like tennis, Sony has lobbed the ball back at Tencent with a fiery shot, claiming in a new court filing that the Chinese conglomerate's defense in the two companies' ongoing legal battle over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Light of Motiram</a> is "nonsense."</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Sony alleges in a recent court filing that Tencent is doing everything possible to avoid legal liability for Light of Motiram, a mobile game revealed in December 2024 that bears striking similarities to the Horizon franchise. While Tencent sought to have the lawsuit (which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">filed in July 2025</a>) dismissed over Sony's attempted "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-attacks-sony-lawsuit-over-game-accused-of-copying-horizon/1100-6534865/" data-ref-id="1100-6534865">monopoly on genre conventions</a>" in September 2025, Sony now claims that the damage has been done and Tencent is simply "playing a shell game."</p>

<p>"Tencent remarkably contends SIE's claims are unripe because--despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months--Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiram's release until 2027 after SIE sued," Sony said. "This is nonsense. The damage is done--and it continues. Although the public expressed confusion and outrage upon discovering Light of Motiram for the knock-off that it is, Tencent remained undeterred. Tencent continued promoting its infringing game over SIE's objection, and Tencent refused to accept any responsibility over its conduct."</p><p>You probably know what a shell game is. It's a public gambling game involving a sleight of hand in which participants guess which cup is hiding the object--whatever the "object" may be--after the cups have been shuffled around. It's popped up in several video games, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" data-ref-id="5000-566271">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/watch-dogs/" data-ref-id="5000-143712">Watch Dogs</a>, and more.</p><p>This is what Sony is accusing Tencent of doing, particularly since the Japanese company claims that the Chinese conglomerate is using various Tencent-owned studios to promote Light of Motiram. To Sony, it doesn't matter which studio promotes the game when Tencent Holdings, the parent company, is "at the helm" and holds the US trademark for the game and its official domain.</p><p>"After SIE was forced to sue, Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities," Sony said. "Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings. Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that 'own[s] Aurora Studios'--the Light of Motiram development studio. Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram--without distinguishing between subsidiaries."</p><p>All of this, in Sony's point of view, will "[jeopardize] Horizon's continued success," claiming that Tencent's copying of Horizon and the franchise's protagonist, Aloy, was "so egregious" that everyone--critics, fans, journalists, the industry writ large--took notice.
