            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>sales have almost hit the two million mark since its release last year, and the studio has also unveiled some more info about an interesting new direction in which&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is headed.</p>

<p>Speaking to investors <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on its recent Capital Markets day</a>, Remedy revealed that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-has-been-slightly-delayed" rel="nofollow">released in October last year</a>, has reached "over" 1.8 million sales, although the company doesn't give an exact figure.</p>

<p>Last we heard,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow">almost recouped its development and marketing costs</a>. Presumably, this is still the case, as if the game had done so since that announcement, it's likely Remedy would have told its investors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=wvtB6L7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=dSndfuWZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>has hit 1.8 million sales since its release last year, Remedy has revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had sold 1.3 million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>&nbsp;(apparently making it the fastest-selling Remedy game thus far), that means a further half a million copies have been sold since that point, which isn't too bad for a game that is, in the end, fairly niche.</p>

<p>Remedy also had some info to share about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>&nbsp;on its Capital Markets day. The game, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">produced in conjunction with Annapurna</a>, will apparently be "an action RPG".</p>

<p>It's worth saying that the phrase "action RPG" is a fairly broad one; this could mean pretty much anything from a light leveling system all the way through to a full looter-shooter framework, so we'll have to wait and see exactly what Remedy means by that.</p>

<p>However, it does represent a shift in direction from the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, which is perhaps best described as an action-adventure game tinged with Metroidvania elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=ssxjKL7A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=pTFbYKoa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>will head in a more RPG-ward direction than its predecessor.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, a free update for the original&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>is coming in early 2025, and it will unlock "some previously released content", although Remedy doesn't specify exactly what that content might be. Better watch out for that one, I suppose.</p>

<p>As a reminder, we still don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, nor do we know exactly when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">recently-announced multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">FBC: Firebreak</a>&nbsp;</em>will be arriving. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Remedy-related.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Real-Life Minecraft Immersive Attractions Announced by Legoland Company]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/real-life-minecraft-immersive-attractions-announced-by-legoland-company.1039446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legoland parent company Merlin Entertainments has announced a series of real-life immersive&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions, with the first set to debut in the UK and US sometime between 2026 and 2027.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.merlinentertainments.biz/newsroom/news-releases/2024/merlin-minecraft-in-real-life/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an official announcement</a> on the Merlin Entertainments website, the attractions will involve "<em>Minecraft</em>-themed guest accommodation, retail, and food &amp; beverage", as well as "a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-themed ride" at existing Merlin locations in both countries.</p>

<p>In the long term, Merlin says it intends to extend these experiences to other countries as well, but they'll just be in Merlin locations in the US and UK to start with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=1S9kkGKx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=0xX1eR7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be visiting this&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction (or something like this mockup, anyway) sometime in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the experiences themselves, Merlin says it'll be introducing "touchpoints" that you can use to augment your&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experience and add "exclusive in-game content".</p>

<p>The rides and experiences will be costing Merlin somewhere in the region of $110 million to start with, and that number will obviously climb as more rides and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions are introduced around the world.</p>

<p>We're a long way away from the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>theme park map that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-theme-park-map-released-as-part-of-10-year-anniversary-celebration" rel="nofollow">created as part of the game's 10th anniversary celebrations</a> back in 2019; these are proper, physical&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences you'll be able to enjoy at actual brick-and-mortar Merlin locations.</p>

<p>Naturally, Merlin hasn't announced exactly what the attractions will be yet, nor when they'll actually be arriving. It's likely we'll be waiting a little while for that info, since the rollout is at least a year and a half or so away.</p>




<p>It's quite possible the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences will find their home in Merlin's Legoland; after all, you can't say that doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>However, Merlin also owns the likes of Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, and Chessington, all of which are very popular UK theme park destinations, so the rides could be appearing in those locations, too.</p>

<p>Given that Legoland has US locations in New York and California, though, my money's on there for the inaugural&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction rollout. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>A long while ago I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-likes needing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-likes-need-to-cut-through-the-clutter">stop overwhelming you with visual clutter</a>. I've since played a few games of a similar ilk that don't hammer you with a chaos that's impossible to dissect with your eyeballs. One of these is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodshed">Bloodshed</a>, an old school <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> take on the VS formula that actually works pretty well and did have me thinking the treacherous phrase "just one more run".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Bloodshed's not actually out just yet, but there's a demo for it over on Steam, and it's sort of Vampire Survivors meets Doom. You pick between a lad with a pistol or a lad with a sawed-off shotgun and you're to head into a grim little town with a raging bonfire at its heart. The aim? Survive for 20 minutes against an ever-expanding horde of occultists and demons (at least, that's the one mission available in the demo).</p>
<p>It's Vampire Survivors in the sense you auto-shoot or (if you're holding a melee weapon) stab whenever you hover your cursor over an enemy, though you can manually shoot and stab, too, if you'd like. And as you slaughter the horde, they drop EXP orbs that level you up. Ding upwards and you'll get to pick from a randomly generated assortment of upgrades, all VS-coded fare: lightning bolts that rain from the sky, eldritch traps, spooky homing-missile skulls, better ammo capacity.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/bloodshed-demo.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Headup</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's Doom, meanwhile, in the way it looks and feels. You've got that nippy cornering and the low hop that's frightfully fast. The shooting is punchy, with enemies bursting into green gunge or red goblets that splatter all over the floor.</p><p>Both the VS and the Doom influences combine pretty well, making for quite the hurried dash around a map that quickly becomes a ripe field of blood and orbs. I liked the fact that losing or finishing a run meant you could spend the cash you accrued on permanent upgrades, or you'd just unlock new in-game upgrades like the bazooka. I'd say, though, that the pace of a run might feel a bit slow at the moment, taking a while to really ramp up. And it's a shame that the upgrades don't appear to combine with one another. So far, they all seemingly exist as separate entities. So no pairing the sawed-off with the lightning for some bolt-slinging shotgun.</p>
<p>Still, it might be worth giving the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2747550/Bloodshed/">Bloodshed demo</a> a go if you're after something Survivory that isn't the usual top-down fare.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inaugural-indie-game-awards-announce-full-list-of-nominees/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Indie Game Awards have announced the full list of award categories and nominees for its inaugural show on December 19.</p>



<p>In total, there are 15 awards up for grabs at the event with 63 games vying for awards in music, gameplay design, innovation, narrative, and more. Two awards, Storyteller and Industry Impact, didn’t have a list of nominees announced. Instead, those two awards will be announced specifically during The Indie Game Awards show.</p>



<p>“Narrowing down 365 days of remarkable indie games across the 15 categories was a gargantuan task for our curation jury,” The Indie Game Awards co-creator Mike Towndrow told Insider Gaming. “But the list we’ve landed on is a killer reflection of how much the indie scene has stepped up this year. </p>



<p>He added: “Take the Game of the Year category, for example. Those 10 games represent an incredibly diverse range of elements we all look for when discussing some of the greatest games of all time. They’re a perfect snapshot of how indies continue to push the boundaries and drive the industry forward.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, Game of the Year, the biggest award of the show, has 10 games nominated. Those games include 1000xRESIST, ARCO, Animal Well, Balatro, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Neva, Nine Sols, UFO 50, Mouthwashing, and Crypt Custodian.</p>



<p>“Our goal is for The Indie Game Awards to become the definitive annual celebration of the indie scene,” Towndrow said. “That endgame vision is made possible through the deep collaboration we’ve built with fellow indie showcases, organizations, journalists, content creators, and, of course, the developers themselves. </p>



<p>“And this is just the beginning. We’re more motivated than ever to expand that collaboration and scale, bringing even more individuals into the fold to make The IGAs a staple of the indie scene—a celebration that breaks through into the wider gaming industry.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of nominees below. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of The Indie Game Awards when they air on December 19 at 7pm ET.</p>

Longer-term, Merlin will expand these experiences to other destinations globally," the company said.</p><p>Merlin runs the Legoland theme parks, as well as theme parks in the UK, Italy, and Germany, including Alton Towers Resort and Gardaland Resort.

                <p dir="ltr">Sony, parent company of PlayStation, is reportedly in discussions to purchase Kadokawa, parent company of Elden Ring maker From Software. The two companies have been talking, and it's apparently possible an acquisition could be announced in the weeks ahead.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, a possible acquisition would see Sony own the rights to Elden Ring and future games from From Software, also known for Demon Souls (already owned by Sony) and Dark Souls (controlled by publisher Bandai Namco). Acquire, behind Tenchu, and Spike Chunsoft, behind Danganronpa, also sit under <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/business/game.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kadokawa's umbrella</a> and presumably would be part of any merger.

            <p>
Microsoft has detailed the Xbox Game Pass titles set to be added to its subscription in the latter half of November.
</p>
<p>
This includes the launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-release-times">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> from Ukrainian studio GSC Gameworld, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aliens-dark-descent-review-more-stand-up-fight-than-bug-hunt">pretty decent tactics title Aliens: Dark Descent</a>, originally launched last year, if you have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. 
</p>
<p>
You'll also need Ultimate or PC Game Pass if you want to play Nine Sols, an arty action-platformer that's inspired by Sekiro's combat. But, as you can see below, vanilla Game Pass members do get some new additions too.
</p>
<p>
Here's everything included with Xbox Game Pass in late November:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass - 19th November</li>
<li>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass  - 20th November</li>
<li>Little Kitty, Big City (Console), now with Game Pass Standard  - 20th November</li>
<li>PlateUp! (Console), now with Game Pass Standard  - 20th November</li>
<li>Nine Sols (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass  - 26th November</li>
<li>Aliens: Dark Descent (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass  - 27th November</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to all of those, Game Pass Ultimate members will also get a smattering of in-game rewards when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> finally arrives for Xbox tomorrow, Wednesday 20th November. (I'm not well-versed on the Hoyoverse, but Microsoft lists you getting two Intertwined Fate, one Northlander Billet Trove, 10 Hero's Wit, 100k Mora, and 15 Mystic Enhancement Ore, which should help you on your way.)
</p>
<p>
As Microsoft gives, so it also taketh away. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-is-set-to-lose-these-6-games-at-the-end-of-the-month">partially announced yesterday</a>, here are the next set of titles due to exit the Game Pass catalogue on 30th November: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Conan Exiles (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Coral Island (PC)</li>
<li>Hello Neighbor 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Remnant: From The Ashes (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Rollerdrome (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Soccer Story (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Spirit of the North (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: The Final Season (PC)</li>
<li>While the Iron's Hot (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you missed the announcement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cheeky-tweet-hints-at-the-next-big-franchise-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Microsoft added Spyro Reignited Trilogy to Xbox Game Pass</a> just a week ago.
</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has responded to claims it removed datamined details and anonymous comments from staff who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> at developer Deck Nine Games.
</p>
<p>
The claims arose in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pricefield/comments/1gq3hq8/an_open_letter_to_square_enix_regarding_editorial/">open letter from fans</a> posted to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> reddit r/Pricefield, which described recent content removals by "undue DMCA strikes" as attempts by Life is Strange's publisher to exert "behind-the-scenes editorial control".
</p>
<p>
Square Enix has now acknowledged it was behind the DMCA strikes, but said that "all steps were in accordance with appropriate legal requirements". 
</p>
<p>
The spat comes amid a period of tension between some diehard Life is Strange fans and both Deck Nine Games and Square Enix, sparked by story elements in last month's Double Exposure. Specifically, some fans - particularly those who post on the r/Pricefield reddit - were left disgruntled by the game's handling of fan-favourite character Chloe. ("Pricefield" is the relationship name of returning series protagonist Max Caulfield and her blue-haired BFF Chloe Price.)
</p><p>
Disapproval for how the game handles Chloe began before Double Exposure first launched, thanks to pre-release leaks that popped up from fans datamining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">the game's early access version</a> and pointed posts on social media suggesting displeasure by members of Life is Strange's original development team Don't Nod, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-director-hits-out-at-hateful-comments-about-life-is-strange-double-exposure">the series' original director finally waded in to call for calm</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over on reddit, the situation was compounded by posts from several anonymous commenters who claimed to have worked on Double Exposure (and who provided some decent proof they had done so), who made a number of claims regarding how the game's story had changed through development, and been shaped by feedback from Square Enix itself.
</p>
<p>
The suggestion that Square Enix was acting to scrub mentions of this, and in particular developers allegedly speaking out of turn, sparked the open letter to be created.
</p>
<p>
"With this recent [removed post], which contained only publicly made comments by D9 and ex-D9 developers, there is no ambiguity left - Square Enix is either willfully removing non-infringing content for reasons other than infringement (which is explicitly NOT the authority or purpose of the DMCA), or doesn't believe that the great power granted to them by the DMCA should come with great responsibility," the open letter alleged. 
</p>
<p>
"One of these options is merely callous, the other is outright abuse of a system which, frustratingly, has no repercussions for abuse. We are concerned that Square Enix is attempting to editorialise this subreddit."
</p>
<p>
In response, in a statement first shared by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/18/square-enix-accused-abusing-copyright-law-silence-fan-criticism-22018233/">Metro</a>, Square Enix said it had removed "infringing content" that included "leaks or confidential information due to breach of non-disclosure agreements and datamined content". 
</p>
<p>
The publisher's full statement lies below:
</p>
<p>
"In relation to DMCA notices, all steps taken were in accordance with appropriate legal requirements and reddit's own procedures for reporting intellectual property violations," a Square Enix spokesperson said. 
</p>
<p>
"These processes apply to infringing content shared prior to a game's release, including leaks or confidential information due to breach of non-disclosure agreements and datamined content. No DMCA notices were sent regarding any posts outside of these circumstances."
</p>
<p>
The r/Pricefield reddit community has taken Square Enix's confirmation it removed information in breach of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) as confirmation the publisher was trying to remove confidential details that would further inflame fans. 
</p>
<p>
But while certain posts, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pricefield/comments/1gpjui3/help_the_copyright_notices_are_being_taken_too_far/">this summary of developer comments</a>, have been removed, Eurogamer is still able to find various original comments by users claiming to be Deck Nine staff still remaining, alongside photos of physical items related to the game's development they posted as proof of their identity. 
</p><p>
In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>, I described Chloe's storyline in the game as "wholly believable" and that, ultimately, there was little room for the character this time around - even if her absence could have been handled better.
</p>
<p>
"There are good reasons other than nostalgia and fan familiarity for why a solo return to Max is interesting," I wrote. "Still, could this inevitable reaction have been handled better by the game, had the desire seemingly been there? Sure."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa.1039380/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that Sony is in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company and media giant Kadokawa, with a deal potentially just weeks away.</p>

<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, which, in turn, cites the age-old "sources familiar with the matter". As ever, take that with as big a pinch of salt as you like.</p>

<p>According to Reuters' report, talks between Sony and Kadokawa are ongoing, and if the talks are successful, then "a deal could be signed in the coming weeks", so it may not be very long before Kadokawa - and, by extension, FromSoftware - officially belongs to Sony.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-souls-3-sony-kadokawa-talks.jpg?itok=fJI5fqBp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-souls-3-sony-kadokawa-talks.jpg?itok=FDtKn41p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kadokawa subsidiary FromSoftware is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, as well as offshoots like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In light of the apparent talks, Kadokawa's shares rocketed up 23%, and Sony's closed 0.6% higher than before the report emerged. Naturally, both Sony and Kadokawa declined to comment when asked to do so by Reuters.</p>

<p>Sony already owns a stake in Kadokawa, having purchased shares <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">back in August 2022</a> (alongside Chinese gaming giant Tencent). It's possible Sony wants to make a move before Tencent does, but of course, that's pure speculation.</p>

<p>In gaming terms, Kadokawa is perhaps best known as the parent company of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware, although that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kadokawa-acquire-purchase" rel="nofollow">not the only studio it owns</a>, and as a media conglomerate, the company has its fingers in plenty of other pies as well.</p>

<p>If the report turns out to be true, then Sony's desire to acquire Kadokawa makes perfect sense; FromSoftware's most recent release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">clocked 25 million sales</a> at last count, while DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>racked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">five million sales in under a week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-sony-kadokawa.jpg?itok=KsGJZSFX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-sony-kadokawa.jpg?itok=l3QH3BS8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is just one of FromSoftware's many successes.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony could probably do with the kind of boost that purchasing Kadokawa would likely provide right now.</p>

<p>Recently, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">shut down two of its studios</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>developer Firewalk, and earlier this year, the Sony Interactive department <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off almost a thousand employees</a> around the world.</p>

<p>Subsidiaries like Bungie also arguably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">aren't in a good place</a> right now, so if Sony could snap up the parent company of not only FromSoftware but also the likes of Spike Chunsoft and&nbsp;<em>Octopath&nbsp;</em>developer Acquire, then things may well improve. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>

<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that Alan Wake 2 has sold 1.8 million units to date.</p>



<p>The news came via the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s capital markets day</a>, during which the company deep-dived into its financials and past and future projects. During the presentations, it was announced that Alan Wake 2 sold 1.8 million units since its October 2023 release date (just over one year).</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Remedy Entertainment announced that the game was close to fully recouping its development and marketing costs with its ongoing sales. Still, it’s unclear if the game has become profitable at the time of writing. However, the recent sales numbers show that 1.8 million times 70 dollars (the high-end average) would put the total amount generated at approximately $126 million.</p>



<p>Released on October 27, 2023, Alan Wake 2 received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregated Metacritic and sold one million units by February 2024. The game won multiple awards at The Game Awards 2023, including Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction.</p>

Players have experienced issues, especially with game audio, as well as with performance on PC.</p><p>Players might have been looking forward to playing the popular Rebirth Island map when it was re-added to Warzone with this week's playlist refresh, but the map was pulled from rotation just over three hours after it was added.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1858619592190685225" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Warzone</a> <br>We've removed Rebirth Island from the playlist while we investigate map-specific issues.

                <p>The shojo-anime-tinged farming game Fields of Mistria is getting its first major content patch. It includes a new seasonal festival, mounts--including unicorns, llamas, cows, and sheep--and expanded romance routes.</p><p>The updates includes the "Shooting Star Festival," which takes place in-game on Summer 28. Romancable NPCs can be invited to stargaze if you have four or more hearts with them. As for other town-related additions, the renown level cap has been raised to 70, and you'll receive new rewards and new "Crown Requests" after level 50. You can buy more items at Merri's, Vera's, and Louis's market stalls. You can claim new sets and rewards at the museum for the Insect, Archaeology, and Fish wings.</p><p>After repairing Hayden's barn, you can ride mounts (and you'll unlock a set of relevant skills to boot). Skill caps across the board have been raised from 30 to 45. You can also encounter two new monsters in the mines--the Essence Bat and the Mimic--and pick up new rare cosmetic items from them.</p><p>In romance and relationships, you can now raise your affection with romancable NPCs to six hearts. When you do so, you'll unlock new events with them. Additional NPC dialogue has also been added.</p><p>According to the game's roadmap, future updates will include even more festivals, skill and level cap raises, and marriage. You can check out the full patch notes for this update below and on the <a href="https://www.fieldsofmistria.com/post/first-major-update-patch-notes-v0-12-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fields of Mistria website</a>.</p><h2>Full Fields of Mistria v0.12.0 Patch Notes</h2><p>Patch notes will feature a 🌼 emoji whenever the change is based on community feedback and bug reporting!</p><h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li>Romanceable’s Six Heart Events have been added.</li><li>Rideable mounts and mount-specific Skill Perks have been added. <em>Note: The “Upgrade Hayden’s Barn” quest must be finished in order to unlock the Mount Questline</em>.</li><li>The Shooting Star Festival on Summer 28 has been added.<em>Note: To experience the date aspect of the festival, the “Beautification Project” quest must be completed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-dlc-out-now-adds-online-multiplayer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Binding of Isaac has received a new free DLC today, called Repentance+, that adds online multiplayer to the game. The new update allows up to four players to play together and run through the game. However, to run the new Repentance+ DLC, all players will require all of the previously released DLC for The Binding of Isaac for it to work, and mods are not compatible with the online side of the game. While Nicalis is calling this a beta, it has been confirmed this DLC is feature complete.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Binding of Isaac Repentance+ Beta Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7yPmbNCP4I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In The Binding of Isaac Repentance+ players can play on Normal, Hard, Greed, Greedier and do Challenges. There are also Daily Runs that will provide different challenges for players to tackle too. Achievements can be unlocked online, but only if you are present from the start of a run. Joining partway through a run will not count towards unlocking any achievements. Online play has some differences from solo play, including defeated bosses dropping loot for each player. Those who join a run partway through will be given items so they are not at a disadvantage compared to players who were present from the beginning. If a player dies, the rest of the team can choose to revive a player at a revive machine on each floor, though the cost of revival goes up every time a machine is used. Alternatively, the remaining players can try and defeat bosses without their fallen teammates as being successful also revives teammates. The full changelog can be seen below.</p>

<p>Item Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tammy’s Head – Reduced the duration of the animation when using Tammy’s Head, allowing Isaac to fire more quickly after use.</li>
<li>Lemon Mishap – Slightly increased the size of the puddle. Also, the puddle will now persist until Isaac exits the room.</li>
<li>Mega Bean – Creates a catastrophic fart that sweeps the entire room.</li>
<li>Milk! – The familiar now follows closely behind Isaac and blocks shots. After 10 hits, the glass will break and give Isaac a Tears upgrade for the remainder of the floor.</li>
<li>Delirious – Summoned bosses will now persist through rooms. Only one boss can be active at a time. The charge is now variable, based on the quality of the previously summoned boss.</li>
<li>Jar of Wisps – Reduced to a 6-room charge, allowing the wisps to stack up to the maximum number more quickly.</li>
<li>Abyss – Item quality now impacts the damage of the summoned locust. Locusts now inherit many different effects based on the item destroyed by Abyss.</li>
<li>Flip – Charge has been reduced to 4 rooms for Tainted Lazarus only.</li>
<li>Portable Slot – Removed from the Shop pool. Added as a possible reward from slot machines.</li>
<li>Void – Charge has been reduced from 6 rooms to 4.</li>
<li>Epiphora – The Tears upgrade from firing in a single direction is now a smooth increase, instead of being staggered every few seconds.</li>
<li>God’s Flesh – Doubled the chance of shrink tears firing. Shrunken enemies now briefly flash white before growing back to full size. Enemies that explode, fire shots or summon minions on death can no longer hurt Isaac if they’re killed while shrunken.</li>
<li>Hushy – While held in place, Hushy now fires radial bursts of shots.</li>
<li>It Hurts – After taking damage, Isaac’s tears will now leave behind small pools of blood creep for the room.</li>
<li>Mars – In addition to being invulnerable when charging, Isaac will gain a 1-second bubble of invulnerability after the charge. Hitting obstacles also causes a knockback effect to clear any threats from the surrounding area.</li>
<li>Evil Charm – Isaac now gains immunity to spider-web slowdown, flame attacks, fireplaces and poison mushrooms. Isaac can also stand in enemy creep for 1 second before taking damage.</li>
<li>Vasculitis – Friendly radial shots fired after killing an enemy will now appear as blood clots to more easily distinguish them.</li>
<li>Lil’ Portal – Has been completely reworked. Double-tapping a fire button is now required to launch Lil’ Portal. After it has consumed enough items and the room is clear, a single portal will spawn and the familiar will now disappear for the remainder of the floor. Entering this portal now takes Isaac to a room where he can pick up or drop off items. This room persists throughout the rest of the current run.</li>
<li>Linger Bean – The fart cloud is now deployed after 4 seconds of continuous fire (instead of 7 seconds). The cloud starts small and potent, and will grow and deal reduced damage over the course of 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Jupiter – Now heals 2 red hearts instead of just ½.</li>
<li>Butter Bean – Recharge time has been reduced from 3 seconds to 2.</li>
<li>The Bean – Can now be re-used after a 4-second cooldown (instead of a room charge).</li>
<li>Kidney Bean – Can now be re-used after a 4-second cooldown (instead of a room charge).</li>
<li>Dead Bird – Will remain active between rooms as long as the player is at ½ heart. (Note: Eve requires 1 full heart.)</li>
<li>Data Miner – Using Data Miner in a room with an item pedestal will now reroll it into a glitched item.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bomb rocks can now create bridges across chasms.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Technology 2 and Mom’s Eye could cause backward-firing shots to do excessive damage.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the D4 unintentionally being able to force all items in a particular pool to reroll.</li>
<li>Parasitoid egg sacs can now be created from Technology shots and Brimstone beams.</li>
<li>When picking up cards/pills/runes with tainted characters who carry eternal items, the consumable is now placed behind the item and can be manually selected, avoiding unintentional uses.</li>
<li>The Tick trinket can now be removed by picking up the Lighter trinket.</li>
<li>The 404 Error trinket now shows which trinket it is emulating.</li>

<li>Fixed Hush attacking more aggressively than intended when below 50% HP.</li>
<li>Fixed Pay to Play challenge incorrectly requiring Mr. Mega to be unlocked.</li>
<li>Removed E. Coli from Scat Man challenge, as it made the player virtually invincible.</li>
<li>Fixed enemy tear projectiles not having the same collision size as blood projectiles.</li>
<li>Fixed being able to reroll some enemies that shouldn’t be rerollable (i.e. Eternal Flies, evolved Blood Puppies and Rag Mega’s purple light beam attack)</li>
<li>Reverted Flesh Death Head’s base HP from 30 back to its original value of 50.</li>
<li>Increased the shadow size of Ultra Greed’s coins to make them easier to see when falling.</li>
<li>Ultra Greed’s coins can now be devolved into coin pickups using the D10.</li>
<li>Stone Eyes now do a full turn before they start firing their laser. (This prevents some unfair damage scenarios when entering a room from the bottom door.)</li>
<li>Fixed Shell Games showing an outdated sprite when the prize is Skatole.</li>
<li>Added Skeleton Key, Best Bud, Angry Fly and Sharp Key to the Key Beggar’s prize pool.</li>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Overdrive Mode, which introduced path tracing to the game, continues to be the most impressive showcase of the technology to date despite being among the very first games to implement it, as highlighted by a new comparison video shared online.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 2, and Desordre running without ray tracing, with ray tracing and with path tracing, highlighting the differences between the different rendering techniques. While the differences path tracing brings to Alan Wake 2 and Black Myth: Wukong, for example, are minimal in most scenarios, they are really transformative in Cyberpunk 2077, elevating the game's visuals to heights that no open-world game has managed to match to date.</p>

<p>While developer CD Projekt Red stopped supporting Cyberpunk 2077, the development team having moved on to working on the second entry in the series, the game is still getting image quality improvements thanks to mods and new NVIDIA DLSS versions. The upscaler's latest version, version 3.8.10, brings significant <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nvidia-dlss-3-8-10-performance-improvements/">anti-aliasing, VRAM, and performance improvements.</a></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the 2.0 update and the Phantom Liberty expansion released last year on PC and current generation consoles in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-aim-assist-settings-for-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Aim is everything in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a>, as you’ll need to stay accurate to get the fastest TTK possible. While using the meta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-krig-c-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-dragons-breath-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attachments</a> helps a lot, having the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-black-ops-6-controller-settings-aiming-combat-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best and most comfortable aim settings</a> can be extremely beneficial, especially on controller.</p>



<p>This is mainly due to Aim Assist, and while it’s been nerfed in BO6, it remains a fundamental advantage that controller players will want to make the most of. That said, here are the best Aim Assist settings in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-aim-assist-settings-in-bo6">Best Aim Assist Settings in BO6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sensitivity Multiplier: </strong>Preference</li>



<li><strong>Look Inversion (On Foot): </strong>Standard</li>



<li>Aiming Advanced Settings
<ul>
<li><strong>Look Inversion (all):</strong> Standard</li>



<li><strong>ADS Sensitivity Transition Timing:</strong> Gradual</li>



<li><strong>3rd Person ADS Correction Type: </strong>Assist</li>



<li><strong>Aim Response Curve Type:</strong> Standard</li>



<li><strong>Custom Sensitivity Per Zoom:</strong> Off</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Target Aim Assist: </strong>On</li>



<li><strong>Motion Sensor Behavior:</strong> Off</li>
</ul>



<p>The most important setting here is Target Aim Assist as if you turn this off, you won’t receive any help when your crosshairs are near an enemy. It’s important to note that Aim Assist has been nerfed in BO6, as the devs reduced its strength when in close-quarters combat. Also, there are no longer multiple Aim Assist options, with the devs deciding to simplify the aiming system for controller.</p>



<p>Other controller settings like Sensitivity and Deadzone Inputs will further help your accuracy and therefore increase the effectiveness of Aim Assist, so it’s important to have these settings dialed in too. We recommend playing around with different Sensitivity settings and choosing one that feels comfortable, and as for Deadzone, reduce the right stick value to as low as 3, but if your stick is drifting, increase this value until the drift stops.</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-find-aim-assist-setting-in-bo6">Where to find Aim Assist setting in BO6</h2>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Call of Duty.</li>



<li>Go to Black Ops 6.</li>



<li>Head to Settings.</li>



<li>Scroll to the Controller tab and then Aiming.</li>



<li>You’ll find Aim Assist under the second section.</li>
</ol>



<p>Aim Assist is a controversial topic for competitive online FPS games, as the war between mouse and keyboard vs controller continues. </p>

<p>As per the latest reports, Pokemon TCG Pocket has raked in over $120.8 million between October 30 and November 17, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a> (shared via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-surges-past-100-million-in-17-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PocketGamer</a>), Pokemon TCG Pocket reached over $100 million in earnings on November 15 and exceeded $120 million by November 17.

<p>In its first week, Pokemon TCG Pocket earned $35.8 million. In the second week, earnings increased to $48.5 million, and in the third week, they reached $37.2 million with a few days still remaining.</p>

<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket has made an impressive debut, surpassing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads in just the first 9 days</a> and generating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-earned-over-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over $12 million in revenue within the first 4 days</a>.
