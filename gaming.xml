                <p>Monster Hunter Wilds next free content update is adding two new monsters, Lagiacrus and Seregios, along with underwater combat and layered weapons.</p><p>Announced during the Capcom Spotlight showcase, Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 arrives on June 30, and it is adding a ton of new content to the game. The biggest new additions here are the two monsters, both of which are returning favorites from previous games. Lagiacrus is a sea wyvern, preferring a water habitat. While Capcom's trailer depicted it fighting on land, it also included underwater combat sections, as well. Meanwhile, Seregios is a medium-sized wyvern with bright gold scales. Both of those monsters will be available on June 30.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522242" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522242"></a><figcaption>The new monsters will be available on June 30, with other features rolling out later.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Capcom also ran down the schedule of new content coming to Monster Hunter Wilds throughout the summer. On June 30, the next wave of cosmetic DLC will arrive, adding new layered armor and emotes. Late July will see the release of the next tempered monster, Arch Temper Uth Duna. Festival of Accord: Flamefete, a summer-themed event with new cosmetics and event quests, runs from July 23 to August 6. On August 27, Capcom is releasing a new emote in collaboration with Fender guitars. Capcom concluded by revealing that Title Update 3, which will add another monster, will arrive in late September.</p><p>The update also adds a number of small quality-of-life features, like layered weapons and improved photo mode options, like new lighting options.

            <p>
Daft but brilliant curation sim Two Point Museum is grabbing its D20s and venturing into the world of medieval fantasy for its first paid DLC release, which promises magical exhibits (and ensuing curses for unsuspecting guests), RPG-inspired expeditions, and more this July.
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Finds, as developer Two Point Studios is calling its DLC, introduces a total of 40 mysterious and magically inclined exhibits. You've got your Flying Carpet, your Teanie Kettle, your Novel Wardrobe, and more, all granting beneficial blessings to guests. Unless, that is, you fail to keep them well-maintained - in which case you'll be dealing with cursed patrons instead.
</p>
<p>
As in the base game, all these curios are acquired out on expeditions, which is where Fantasy Finds' RPG-style twist comes in. In order to track down or maintain the DLC's new exhibits, you'll need to hire new Fantasy Experts. These come in a range of familiar classes - barbarian, wizard, rogue, and bard - each with their own stats. "Does your team have enough combined Strength and Dexterity to counter a dragon attack?", Two Points Studios teases. "Perhaps you need the right combination of Intelligence and Luck to overcome a Picked Lock shortcut."

Fantasy Finds also includes three new guest archetypes, 26 decorations and utility items, a new medieval-themed paint job for your expedition chopper, Mythical Gear buffs for staff, plus new interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, floors, and more. All this arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 17th July, and while there's no word of a price yet, a week-long 10 percent launch discount is confirmed. And if you haven't played Two Point Museum yet (which you should if you're a management sim fan, because it's great and easily the best entry in the series so far) you can currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/">pick it up with 20 percent off as part of the Steam Summer Sale</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Featured as part of the Capcom Spotlight stream, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has some big updates coming soon. Free Title Update 2 launches next week on 30th June, bringing back Lagiacrus and Seregios, and plenty more besides!</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Free Title Update 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJQFAfT0T3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The long-awaited return of Lagiacrus brought an interesting challenge for Capcom, the Monster Hunter Tri star having introduced water battles back in the day. For this reappearance in Monster Hunter Wilds, underwater battles will return, but will be an additive to the surface combat and have some special moves, like the grapple, to help getting in close to deal damage.</p>
<p>Seregios then appeared in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, the version of the game that had an international release. As an agile monster that came with a then surprising diagonal kick and speed, these properties have been retained for the Wilds update.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Monster Hutner Wilds Title Update 2 brings new weapon layering – you just need to have crafted the final weapon in the tree, hit the final level for Artian weapons, or high ranked for Palico weapons, and this will give more customisation options.</p>

<p>Photo mode is being enhanced with the ability to hide characters, youll be able to swap Erik in for Alma as you handler, and there’s a new support unit with Mina, a sword and shield user from Vespae Unit.</p>

<p>The summer roadmap for MH Wilds is also stacked. From 23rd July there will be the Festival of Accord: Flamefete, bringing a new look to Grand Hub, and with a bunch of new rewards.</p>
<p>Arch-Tempered Uth Dura will then appear on 30th July, this limited time creature offering new armour sets for those who can overcome its HR 50+ event quest and challenge.</p>
<p>Oh, and then at the end of August? Yeah, then you can grab a Fender and start shredding. This barmy real-world collab is feeding back into the game with a limited event that rewards players with a guitar. You’ll get a rendition of the guitar which has been scanned in with photogrammetry, touched up with scuffs and scratches, and which has then been brought into the game alongside custom motion captured animations, music recorded on this actual guitar, and just a huge attention to detail. Heck, even palicos will start to jump around an air guitar when you use this emote gesture!</p>
<p>Released earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds was the long-awaited successor to Monster Hunter Worlds, arriving from the off for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. We said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/monster-hunter-wilds-review/">our review</a>, “Monster Hunter Wilds is the best Monster Hunter game we’ve ever had. The best storyline, the best visuals, and changes to the combat that revolutionise the way the game plays. That said, striving for the widest audience yet has dulled some of the series difficulty, and you may have to wait for the toughest parts of Wilds to fully reveal themselves.”</p>

			<p>Capcom hosted its Spotlight Showcase 2025 event this evening and showcased new gameplay for several of its key upcoming games, including <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/news.html">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, due out next year on February 27, 2026.</p>
<p>Requiem was first revealed at the beginning of this month as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Summer Game Fest 2025's</a> big showcase, with a cutscene that gave us a short look into the game's story, but not a look at gameplay.</p>
<p>While we didn't get a full gameplay deep-dive during the spotlight event, we did get a solid look at gameplay, which was featured between clips of members of the development team talking about different aspects of the game, such as their foundational concept of wanted to create a feeling of "<em>addictive horror</em>" and how challenging the team felt it was to bring players back to Raccoon City, because of how significant the city is in the series history.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hiC3qpghP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Capcom also dug a bit more into Grace Ashcroft, who they described as being more introverted and frightened than series regular Leon Kennedy would be in the same situations, wanting to create a character that would be closer to how the player feels while playing the game, unsure of what will happen around the next corner.</p>
<p>That said, Capcom clarified that she's still an FBI agent and is more than capable with a weapon. First-person gameplay was described as being more for players who want a horror-focused experience, while action-focused players ought to pick third-person.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most significant comments made by the team came from director Koshi Nakanishi, who explained a bit about why it's important for Capcom to be going back to Raccoon City in this game, and the significance of the game's title.</p>
<p>"<em>This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before. Resident Evil is a series that was born from Umbrella and the Raccoon City zombie outbreak. And we chose the title "Requiem" to mark a milestone in the series."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has revealed our first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> gameplay in brief snippets shown during a livestream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Capcom Spotlight event, Capcom showed a small portion of first-person gameplay, heavy on the horror and featuring new protagonist FBI Agent Grace Ashcroft. We see the character slowly move around creepy corridors with just a lighter for company. At one point, we see Ashcroft turn around to see a hulking humanoid creature close in on her from the shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In another clip of first-person gameplay we see Ashcroft explore a grand hallway, this time holding a handgun (as an FBI agent Ashcroft is handy with guns). She's also able to "act with calm, deductive reasoning," and we see her inspect a toolbox in the classic Resident Evil up close style to demonstrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, we get a very brief look at third-person Resident Evil Requiem gameplay where Ashcroft is, once again, exploring creepy corridors and poorly lit rooms. We see that horrible creature again, casually stomping in the shadows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the video, Capcom developers explain how the first-person perspective makes for "tense, realistic gameplay," whereas playing in third-person via the over-the-shoulder camera lets you see "more of the action." The third-person persepctive is "great for people who enjoy action-heavy gameplay," Capcom added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem lets players switch between first- and third-person through the Options menu at any point during the campaign. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">Resident Evil Requiem hands-on preview</a> for more information.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem First Gameplay Screenshots — Capcom Spotlight 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Capcom confirmed Resident Evil Requiem takes place 30 years after the missile strike on Raccoon City that occurs at the end of Resident Evil 3, which explains the enormous crater we saw in the announcement trailer. Indeed, the name "Requiem" was chosen because, as Capcom explains it: "This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no big Leon Kennedy reveal, as some fans had hoped for — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return">and even expected</a>. If the Resident Evil veteran is playable in the game, perhaps that reveal will come later. It's worth noting Capcom developers issued some interesting comments around Leon and Resident Evil Requiem in the video, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">which we go over here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches February 27, 2026, across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-love-the-alters-and-all-its-weird-annoying-clones.1229598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Alters</em> is not what I was expecting! Given <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I now learn about new and upcoming games in a very normal way</a>, I went into it almost blind, knowing absolutely nothing about it, my only prior commentary being, well...</p><p>To find it was a very nice-looking sci-fi game with a unique blend of resource and personnel management, with loads of adventure and dialogue layered over the top, was something of a pleasant surprise!</p><p>You play as the sole survivor of a deep space accident, waking up on an incredibly hostile alien planet to find the rest of your crew is dead. Your base and transportation are still functional, however, leaving you a finite number of days (<em>Majora's Mask</em> style) to stay alive and reach an extraction point. It's a goal you'll never achieve on your own--the mission was originally designed for a whole crew, after all--so before long you need to build your <em>own </em>crew. By cloning yourself. </p><figure><figcaption>While you CAN drive much of the game from menus, it's a lot more fun to get out there and do everything in-person, especially since the WHOOSHING elevators in your base are so much fun to use</figcaption></figure><p>Seems like a straightforward solution, only there's a catch, and this is where the name and cover come in: you're not really cloning yourself, you're creating "Alters". The technology in this future has been able to map brain and body alike, the latter charted via core memories (think <em>Inside Out</em>!) revolving around important decisions you've made in your life, from childhood to school and beyond. <em>The Alters</em> lets you revisit those moments and change the outcome, after which a quantum computer simulates the results and spits out a different you.</p><p>Physically, it's you, but emotionally each clone can be a wildly different person. You've all got some degree of shared histories--the same parents, some of you broadly similar upbringings--but have also lived essentially different lives. This is a cool trick when talking to your new co-workers, everyone the same yet also not, but it also has a practical consequence, because conveniently all the Alters you grow have been trained in the different jobs you'll need to crew your base, from scientists to technicians to refinery experts.</p><p>A big part of <em>The Alters</em> is simply dealing with all of, well, you. The more Alters you create the more they bounce off each other, work themselves into exhaustion, have needs and start fights, and your job as the original is to support everyone, mediate disputes and just generally try and hold the whole operation together.</p><figure><figcaption>Both have a point! How you settle this, or whether you settle it at all, is up to you</figcaption></figure><p>The other part of the game involves running the base, which means constantly tinkering with a resource and production management system. <em>The Alters</em> has a real-time clock and everyone gets tired, but your base and crew always need fuel and food, and you always need to be building and repairing stuff, so it's essential to try and find a balance between all these competing needs.</p><p>This part of the game takes a little while to get your head around; it lives partly as a spreadsheet, with all your numbers and routines and assignments always a click away in a menu screen, but it also lives in a 3D space you can directly interact with as a player character, sometimes because it's just more fun to do it that way, also because you often need to leave your base to explore the planet around you, or do some mining.</p><p>There are very clear lines between these parts of the game, visible seams between the two halves of the elevator pitch. The team leader stuff is cool, and there are some interesting implementations of it--your ex-wife is on the phone at one point, for example, and you need to find an Alter who can actually talk to her--but a lot of the dialogue is also kinda boring and repetitive, over-written and overly-wordy in a way that had me turning the subtitles on ASAP so I could skip through sections instead of having to sit through entire conversations. The idea of all these Alters is interesting, but not many of the actual <em>guys </em>are.</p><p>The resource management stuff is also neat, in the way it can be run mostly from menus but also in person, and juggling everything alongside time and energy levels makes it a constant challenge. But it's also kinda artificial; the game's story often intrudes on your plans, so it never <em>quite </em>feels like a proper resource management game.</p><figure><figcaption>This is a very good-looking video game!</figcaption></figure><p>Where I really liked <em>The Alters</em> was the way that, thanks to its context and the way both halves of the game related to each other, none of that mattered, because the lines between them ultimately aren't important. Yeah, many of the Alters are boring and talk too much, but these are your workmates, that's incredibly relatable. And given everything else about this game, particularly its emphasis on story, I didn't <em>want </em>it to be a proper resource sim; I appreciate that it's giving me something to do in between conversations that is trying something different to the usual strategy, FPS or RPG approach to a narrative you'd expect from these visuals and this setting. I've honestly never played a game like this, and that's a very cool and fun thing to get to experience.</p><p>You're playing as a man stranded, stressed and alone, and there's just enough panic and frustration on the resource side of things that I truly felt those things. And the cloning takes the game's setting and runs with it; as a premise in the universe of <em>The Alters</em> its dicey and experimental, so its imperfect implementation is just a reflection of that.</p><p>So yeah, I really liked this game! I appreciate fresh swings at familiar genres, I am <em>very </em>into its art design (and menus, which are lovely) and I would love to see more games at this point in the market try interesting new stuff like this.</p><p>I still hate the cover though. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba"><h3>This Game Sure Looks A Lot Like Venba</h3></a><p>Prolific copycat studio makes a copycat game of Venba, stripping it of any life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga"><h3>You win, Rent-A-Girlfriend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just a couple weeks after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/07/resident-evil-9-requiem-revealed-and-is-out-next-february/">Resident Evil Requiem closed out Summer Game Fest</a>, Capcom has shared another good inside look at the hotly anticipated sequel, speaking to the creators about the inspirations and direction that this new game is taking. The game is set to launch on February 27th 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZ4YPcRZL8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi gave insides on how the game is built around the concept of addictive fear –&nbsp;as in, the cathartic effect of overcoming fears. He also discussed how that ties in with the new protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, who is shy and introverted, needing to overcome her fears and leaning on her training to be able to use a gun and fast deduction skills.</p>
<p>Leon had been in consideration to be the lead character for this new game, and would certainly have been popular, so why not return to the franchise staple?</p>
<p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist,” Nakanishi-san said. “But making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere, there’s insights on how RE Engine has evolved to cope with some of the ordeals that Grace is being put through. For example, when hung upside down, the rush of blood to her head will now add redness to her face, while a wig was used to model the hair hanging upside down and the motion that it causes.</p>
<p>For the setting and returning to Raccoon City, Art Director Tomonori Takano said, “we’ve seen a lot of characters face hardship due to Raccoon City, who have faced those hardships and grown. Figuring out how to tell a story which came off of all that came before was actually quite a daunting undertaking that I was nervous about.”</p>
<p>Nakanishi-san then said, “There were a lot of characters involved in the original outbreak who lost their lives or were changed drastically as a result of it. […] This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before.”</p>
<p>Longer developer interviews are available by signing up with a Capcom ID at <a href="http://game.capcom.com/residentevil/">game.capcom.com/residentevil/&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to be another big shift in style and tone for the long-running horror franchise. Starring Grace Ashcroft, the story drags her back to Raccoon City, 30 years on from its destruction in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, as she follows the trail of strange deaths at the Renwood Hotel as an FBI technical analyst. That just so happens to be where her mother was herself murdered eight years previously.</p>
<p>The game will call back to some of the most iconic entries of the series to date by having Grace be pursued by a monster, similar to Mr. X and Lady Dimitrescu, and (as was eventually added to RE Village), you’ll be able to switch between first person and third person perspectives, which will help to shift the tone of the game and experience. to your liking.</p>

You'd think that with Summer Game Fest technically being all wrapped up by now we'd all be done with showcases, and yet here <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> are with a Spotlight of their own. One little game that got a look-in was, of course, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. Specifically, the second title update was shown off, which as always is adding a whole bunch of things in, so let's jump in.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's two big monsters joining the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game with this update, which arrives next Monday, June 30th. First up is Lagiacrus, a big, blue, electricity crocodile/ dragon lookin' fella, who was also the flagship monster from Monster Hunter 3. Sure to be a hit, I imagine. There's also Seregios from Monster Hunter 4, a quick-moving, partially flying monster that honestly kind of just looks like a Chocobo.

<p>
July 23rd will see the arrival of the Festival of Accord: Flamefete, a limited time event where the main hub will be decorated all fancy, and you'll be able to get equipment, gestures, and the like.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, a Monster Hunter themed Fender guitar was released to celebrate the series' anniversary, and now in an event that's taking place from August 27th to September 24th, you'll be able to get a gesture that lets you shred some sick licks on an in-game version of the same guitar. Video games!
</p>
<p>
On top of that, there's a bunch more outfits that you'll be able to pick up, free DLC like dance gestures, paid DLC like a new cosmetic pack, layered weapons are being added in, you'll be able to swap your handles so you can travel with Erik instead of Alma, and Mina, a sword and shield support hunter, is being added into the game. Oh, and you'll be able to choose which support hunters you bring with you on missions too. Title update 3 should be coming late September, but no exact release date on that one just yet.
</p>
<p>
It's probably also worth noting that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is discounted right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam</a> thanks to its summer sale. The action game is 20% off, making it £48 down from £60, which still isn't cheap, but hey, take what you can get, especially with a game that only came out this year. Just keep in mind that it seems like your mileage when it comes to performance might vary.

		<p>Having broken its silence over Pragmata earlier this month, Capcom has shared another update on the long-in-development sci-fi romp. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/capcoms-pragmata-is-coming-out-in-2026/">The game is set for release in 2026</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capcom Spotlight (EN-UK) | 26.6.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkCA8EnPTgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After repeating the State of Play trailer, the showcase dipped into a bit more about some of what makes Pragmata unique. Public hands on will be available at Gamescom, Capcom has confirmed.</p>
<p>Hugh Williams has been sent to a lunar facility to investigate what’s gone wrong there, but after getting split from his team, he’s saved by the android that they eventually settle on should be called Diana – short for DI02367. She immediately jumps in to help Hugh when hostile androids attack, hacking onrushing enemies to break open their armour and let Hugh deal damage with his guns.</p>
<p>We just went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a>, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy. Thankfully, it’s not the most mentally taxing of tasks (at least initially), as the grid appears and you simply need to fill blocks to paint a path to the exit point. Along the way, you’ll want to also pass through marked nodes that will power up the attack, while avoiding those marked as a hazard. It’s very simple stuff, but what makes it feel different is that you need your thumb on the left analogue stick in order to move Hugh and Diana away from any dangers, so directional inputs are instead mapped to the shape or letter face buttons.”</p>

<p>Even with this trailer and our hands on, there’s still a lot of mystery surrounding Pragmata, though now there’s a little bit less that when it was announced half a decade ago. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/pragmata-ps5-capcom-release-date/">First revealed for PS5 in 2020</a>, the game was meant to release in 2022, was delayed to 2023, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">then was delayed again with no further date</a>. Finally, at the latest State of Play stream, it was confirmed for a 2026 launch date.</p>

		<p>Since its reveal in the middle of 2020, Pragmata (pronounced more like ‘prag-matter’) has remained one of the most enigmatic and fleeting games out there. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/pragmata-ps5-capcom-release-date/">years between trailers</a>, and a handful of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/12/capcoms-pragmata-project-athia-delayed-release-date-2022-2023/">deeply</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/18/pragmata-officially-delayed-by-capcom-to-2023/">apologetic</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">release date delays</a>, we’ve been none-the-wiser about what this game actually is. Until now, that is, as we’ve finally had the chance to go hands on and play this fascinating new sci-fi adventure.</p>
<p><iframe title="PRAGMATA - First Contact Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6q3XjHKGPc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It would be easy to assume that this is a glitzier, cleaner riff on Dead Space horror. The third-person camera angle, the bulky space suit with a hard-headed helmet cover, the abandoned space station all give that feeling. Heck, in the scene in which the little girl Diana saves stranded astronaut Hugh’s life, she grabs something that looks a heck of a lot like a Plasma Cutter and holds it to his leg. “This is getting very, very dark, very quickly,” I thought to myself, only for this to be revealed as a Lunafilament tool that repairs the broken patches of Hugh’s suit and allows it to start applying emergency aid.</p>


<p>Pragmata is actually forging its own path in a lot of other ways. As IDUS, the Cradle lunar station’s AI, becomes aware of your unsanctioned presence and starts to command nearby robots to expel you. Rather forcefully.</p>
<p>As they stomp towards Hugh, his pistol’s bullets pinging off the armoured skin of the humanoid robot, Diana is determined to help. She has all the appearance of a 6-year-old girl in an oversized puffer jacket, but as she fights to get past the instinctively protective Hugh to help out, she’s immediately revealed to be a highly advanced little android girl instead – her actual designation is DI02367, but let’s stick with Diana – able to shoot hacking laser beams and project a HUD from her hand.</p>


<p>Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy. Thankfully, it’s not the most mentally taxing of tasks (at least initially), as the grid appears and you simply need to fill blocks to paint a path to the exit point. Along the way, you’ll want to also pass through marked nodes that will power up the attack, while avoiding those marked as a hazard. It’s very simple stuff, but what makes it feel different is that you need your thumb on the left analogue stick in order to move Hugh and Diana away from any dangers, so directional inputs are instead mapped to the shape or letter face buttons.</p>
<p>Jumping deeper into the game, tougher enemies like a big stompy boy that leaves behind puddles or arcing electricity to stun you, provide a larger grid to quickly skim your way through. You also have access to special nodes like Decode, which is able to lower enemy defence further if you are able to integrate it into the path you hurriedly chart through the puzzle. The thing is, nodes are consumables that you collect, rather than a permanent upgrade, so you might want to avoid those spots when battling more standard enemies.</p>

<p>Naturally, there’s different weapon types, so in addition to the unlimited ammo available to Hugh’s standard pistol, there’s a shotgun-like Shockwave Gun, where damage will fall off the further away you are, while the Stasis Net drops a bubble that will stun enemies caught within its radius.</p>
<p>It adds up to a style and tone of combat that’s really rather active and engaging without really feeling overwhelming. Dashing is assigned to a shoulder button, so you’re not having to perform exotic claw grips to play the game to the fullest.</p>
<p>Exploring the Cradle is also interesting, though here we’re left with a lot of questions for the game’s overarching form. Diana unlocks save points by hacking floor hatches with ladders, which could be taken to hint at a Soulslike style where enemies respawn if you use them… or they might just be basic save checkpoints.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a ton of secrets to uncover, though, with hidden fake walls shimmering and certain interactive points that can shift parts of the level around. We also wandered through a room that looked like it had been half generated from a 3D printer, finding a datapad with emails that all about Read Earth Memory technology that can be used to replicate furniture, decorations, and even food for the disappeared residents of this base.</p>

<p>Our hands-on time came to an end, rather abruptly, as the full scale of the moon base is revealed, the dome covering a control room peeling away to show the sprawl across the dusty grey surface. IDUS takes great offence to this, calling once more on nearby robots to come and put an end to your intrusion. In this case, it’s ED-209… or a bipedal bot that looks an awful lot like the RoboCop icon, anyway. Sadly we didn’t get to face off against this boss, but I’m definitely keen to do so whenever the chance does come up.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses.1229550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024 Unearthed Arcana. This new playtest material reintroduces some character options originally available in Fifth Edition as well as the return of much older character options from the fantasy TTRPG's storied past.</p>



<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, several members of the design team, Makenzie De Armas, Amanda Hamon, and Ben Petrisor, discuss the contents of the latest <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Unearthed Arcana. Notably, the video in the post is the first not to feature Todd Kenrick, who has served as the host of the design videos. This is because he was let go from the company about a week ago.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-arcane-archer.jpg?itok=wTVCIfT9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-arcane-archer.jpg?itok=Eoj7HPfq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Generally, the character options in this Unearthed Arcana appear to be 2024 updates of pre-existing Fifth Edition subclasses. These include the Arcane Archer Fighter, the Hexblade Warlock, the Arcana Domain Cleric, and four different Wizard schools: Conjurer, Necromancer, Transmuter, and Enchanter. All of which were absent in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, if you are familiar with the 2014 version of these subclasses, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Unearthed Arcana includes cliff notes on how they have been changed for the new 2024 edition. For example, Arcane Archer's Arcane Shot ability has been reworked with any weapon that uses ammo, including firearms, and the Hexblade's Armor of Hexes is now unlimited and scales with your Warlock Level.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-tattooed-monk-artwork.jpg?itok=qwHdr10i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-tattooed-monk-artwork.jpg?itok=A6LYEVO2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for the new stuff, there are two new subclasses that haven't been seen since 3.5 Edition. The Tattooed Warrior Monk, originally a Prestige Class, has returned for 2024. In this subclass, your Monk slowly gains a collection of magical tattoos, ones imbued with arcane power. Using these tattoos, and some Focus Points, this will allow you to cast certain spells like Misty Step, Longstrider, or Lesser Restoration.</p>

<p>The second new subclass is the Ancestral Sorceror. These Sorcerors trace their bloodline back to a powerful ancestor who wielded great magic. Maybe your Sorceror is a descendant (or reincarnation) of wizards of legend like Mordenkainen or Bigby? This is reflected in the class features, which include adding Charisma to your spellcasting, having Counterspell always prepared, and having perfect concentration.</p>

<p>Obviously, the material in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Unearthed Arcana is playtest material and will be subject to change. If you want to let Wizards know what you like and dislike, the Unearthed Arcana is available to download for free. The feedback survey will open on July 3.&nbsp;</p>

Remember back in April when I told you about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor's</a> next update, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/abiotic-factors-next-update-brings-in-an-upgrade-system-a-chilly-new-zone-and-best-of-all-functioning-bins">Cold Fusion</a>? No? What do you mean you can't remember every single news post I've ever written? Fine, whatever, point is, it turns out that said update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543358846952800257?l=english">turned into the full on 1.0 release of the game</a>. And now, as shown off in a swanky new trailer for developer Deep Field, the release date for the release of 1.0 has been revealed!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Drum roll please… it's July 22nd! Which is less than a month away, so you've not got long to wait. That also happens to be when the co-op game is launching on console, but who gives a hoot about that round these parts? In any case, how about a little reminder about what's new in the full release. First up, there's a new area, the Residence Sector, which is where the final chapter of the base game is set. There's a new R.A.I.N shower (no idea what that acronym stands for) that gives you a nice clean.

Plus you can get "something that almost imitates Mexican cuisine" at The Taco Mine, which generally sounds quite inadvisable. And you can even build your own office cubicle, because who doesn't love replicating their workplace in a video game?
</p>
<p>
Deep Field have previously said that a 1.1 update will be coming at some point in 2025 as well, alongside more updates beyond that, but as of yet they haven't set an exact date, or even what that might entail. I expect they're a bit busy prepping that 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and if you want to pick it up at a bit of a discount ahead of its proper launch, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/">currently 20% off on Steam</a>. Go wild!

This isn’t the experience we intended, and we’re sincerely sorry.

If done correctly, assuming your Switch 2 was late, the $50 card will be discounted to $0. </p><p>There is a catch, because of course there is. There’s always a catch. In this case, Target seems to only be offering the $50 eShop card to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1938317840601518267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1938317840601518267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people who pre-ordered a Switch 2 and received it on or after June 7</a></span>. However, some people have contacted support and claim to have still been able to get a $15 Target gift card if the console was only a day late. </p><p>Either way, if Target screwed you over while trying to buy a Switch 2, you owe it to yourself and your wallet to log into your account and see if you can get a free gift card for your trouble. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/target-switch-2-late-delivery-gift-card-eshop-nintendo-1851785182]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba.1229502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Food is core to what makes <em>Venba</em>, a cooking game from Visai Games, itself. Its thoughtful cooking mechanics are an extension of its story about a Canadian Indian family. Recipes, pulled from an oil-stained cookbook, are a way to explore both the beauty of Tamil culture and the struggle of immigrant families. It’s a triumph of game development, and you don’t just have to take my word for it; <em>Venba</em> won best debut and a social impact award at the 2024 Game Developers Choice Awards, the Seamus McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival, <em>and</em> best debut game at the 20th British Academy Games Awards.</p><p>It’s no wonder that game developers would take inspiration from <em>Venba</em>. That’s not inherently a bad thing, unless you’re doing what mobile game developer Global Advertising Network LTD — lol — is doing: Whitewashing out any of the things that make <em>Venba</em> incredible, blatantly cribbing its art style, and turning it into a sloppy mobile cash grab.&nbsp;</p><p>Global Advertising Network’s game <em>Sofra</em> is marketed as a cooking simulator and released some time in 2024. It’s seemingly gone somewhat under the radar since then, though the Google Play Store lists it as having more than 10,000 downloads. There’s no story; it simply takes the gameplay mechanics and art style of <em>Venba</em>, following recipes to create inspired, creative dishes like, uh, peanut butter and jelly. As you might expect, there’s a microtransaction for everything — to earn more coins, remove ads, and to unlock levels like the vague “Asian Food Pack.”</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/visaigames.bsky.social/post/3lsegwqa3o22a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visai Games called out <em>Sofra</em> on BlueSky</a>: “If you ever wanted a version of Venba where you get to make sandwiches instead of Tamil food and don't have to contend with themes of like dealing with racism, then I have good news for you! This mobile game rip-off with stolen assets is for you!!”</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Visai Games, Global Advertising Network, Apple, and Google for comment.</p><p>This is, unfortunately, not a unique phenomena for mobile gaming, <a href="https://aftermath.site/unpacking-nintendo-eshop-switch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and it’s something that’s spreading elsewhere, like onto the Nintendo Switch Store</a>. Global Advertising Network, unsurprisingly, is a prolific copycat developer: Its most popular game, <em>Find Sort Match: Puzzle game</em> is a blatant ripoff of Secret Mode’s 2022 release <em>A Little to the Left</em>. According to the Google Play Store, <em>Find Sort Match: Puzzle game</em> has been downloaded more than 5 million times on that platform alone. As with <em>Venba</em>, it takes both the concept and art style of the game and makes a cheap copy of it. It’s also got games that resemble <em>Bad North</em>, <em>Frostpunk, </em>and <em>Stacklands</em>.</p><p>These sorts of low effort clone games are a major issue on mobile app stores. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#copycats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s guidelines include a section specifically about copycat games</a>: “Come up with your own ideas. We know you have them, so make yours come to life. Don’t simply copy the latest popular app on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s name or UI and pass it off as your own. In addition to risking an intellectual property infringement claim, it makes the App Store harder to navigate and just isn’t fair to your fellow developers.”</p><p>Games can be removed, according to the guidelines, due to copyright claims or if they are “impersonating” another game or app. It’s unclear whether <em>Sofra</em> would fall into that category of impersonation; its art style is clearly a copy, but unlike in the copycat situation with <em>Unpacking</em> recently, it’s not directly using the game’s name. Some developers have moved to the court system to force app stores to take action: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/510282/poppy-playtime-lawsuit-scam-games-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Poppy Playtime </em>developer Mob Entertainment filed a lawsuit</a> in January over “scam” versions of its games. Mob Entertainment issued DMCA takedown requests to get the games removed from the Google Play Store, but they were later readded. That lawsuit is still ongoing. In May, Google filed a motion to dismiss, saying that Google isn’t responsible, and that Mob Entertainment should go after the infringing game developer instead.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga"><h3>You win, Rent-A-Girlfriend.

Just days after barreling through the 1m sales barrier, Peak - the daft co-op climbing game from developer Landcrab - has reached another impressive milestone. It's now sold over 2m copies, and Landcrab is celebrating the occasion by talking a little about its plans for future updates.
</p>
<p>
Peak, if you've not yet had the pleasure, sees up to four friends attempting to scale an ever-changing mountain. You've got ropes, climbing spikes, and other useful tools to aid in your upward adventure, but key to your slapstick survival is communication and coordination. Poorly orchestrated ascents have a tendency to end in hilarious chaos - the kind of Tok Tok and YouTube friendly calamity that's helped catapult Peak up the charts.
</p>
<p>
It took <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charming-co-op-climbing-game-peak-takes-steam-by-storm-selling-one-million-copies-in-six-days-and-mounting-the-top-sellers-page">just six days for Peak to cross the 1m sales threshold</a> following its launch, and it's now shifted another 1m copies three days after that. "We seriously cannot thank you enough for all the love and support we've had on this game," Landcrab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498325386812195119?l=english">wrote on Steam</a>. "There's an abundance of ways we would like to say thank you, but I think the best way we could do that is by sharing with you all what's next: Yes, we are now looking into possible updates."

<p>
Landcrab says its update plans are in the "very early stages", but it's collating player feedback and is considering everything from "quality of life features to new content and all the funny additions that we wished to make real from the start." There are some caveats, however; firstly, it will continue to prioritise bug fixes and stability before anything else, so "don't expect a huge content update right away."
</p>
<p>
Secondly, Landcrab's somewhat unusual set-up - it's actually two studios, Landfall Games and Aggro Crab, working in collaboration - means there's a degree of uncertainty about what it'll actually be able achieve: "We don't know how many major updates we're planning... Since we're two studios who have other projects to work on, and neither of us being live service studios... The last thing we want to do is promise any features that we can't make a reality."
</p>
<p>
As for those bug fixes, Landcrab says it's continuing to investigate some of Peak's most widely reported issues, including those relating to disconnection and reconnection, performance and optimisation, crashes, and mic/audio problems. "We are still a small team," it adds, "so we really appreciate all the patience with us tackling bug reports. We're reminding ourselves to take breaks, fix bugs and also appreciate the success of the project."
</p>
<p>
Peak (which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for Landfall, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/content-warning-dev-investigating-server-issues-as-steam-smash-hits-62m-downloads">Content Warning</a> and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds) is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">available now on Steam for a mere £6.39</a>. Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">earlier this week</a>, writing, "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."

Films like the <em>Mortal Kombat </em>series, <em>Dead or Alive</em>, and the 1994 <em>Street Fighter </em>all possess a kind of so-bad-they’re-good ridiculousness that has made them cult classic guilty pleasures. Part of that is because, in narrative terms, the source material they’re drawing from is barely strung together to begin with, since in most fighting games the plot is there just to bring a series of memorable weirdos together to beat each other up. Those characters are the most interesting part, so casting actors who can bring all their bizarre sensibilities to life is key. That’s probably why the cast for the upcoming <em>Street Fighter </em>reboot reads like a randomly generated ensemble made up of some truly surprising picks.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,197586,196406" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-curtis-50-cent-jackson-1236299350/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-curtis-50-cent-jackson-1236299350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span>, rapper, actor, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/get-this-50-cent-blood-on-the-sand-started-out-as-a-t-1847655379&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/get-this-50-cent-blood-on-the-sand-started-out-as-a-t-1847655379">occasional video game star</a></span> 50 Cent is joining the cast as Balrog, the boxer who made his debut in <em>Street Fighter II</em> back in 1991. 50 Cent isn’t the only musician-turned-actor set to star in the film next year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apex-legends-the-board-game-review.1229484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bottling the kinetic energy of a first person shooter video game and successfully transferring it to the tabletop is a herculean task. Publisher Glass Cannon Unplugged is up to the challenge, presenting Apex Legends: The Board Game in the form of an overstuffed box that spills cardboard and plastic onto the table like a body lit up by a VK-47 Flatline. This analog translation defies the odds, legitimately capturing some of the visceral action of its namesake with unique and clever design work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> the video game is a hero shooter battle royale. It has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/Characters_(Legends)">full lineup of protagonists</a> with their own suite of abilities and playstyles. This identity is likewise the heart of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board game adaptation</a>, forming the basis for its team-based skirmish action. Characters such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/mirage">Mirage</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/bloodhound">Bloodhound</a> all make an appearance, with each of their roles expertly captured and adapted to the turn-based setting. Everything is powerful and awe inspiring, and it feels extraordinarily faithful to the property.</p><div catalogid="59f120e6-93ee-456b-ada0-ea76f3f22000" id="223645"><div id="223645" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apex Legends: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard format is either two-versus-two, or three-versus-three, with each player fielding a single character. While there are a bevy of miniatures skirmish games on the market, including popular titles such as Kill Team, Infinity, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-shatterpoint-board-game-review"><u>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</u></a>, none offer this particular style of team-based small-unit approach. Distinctly, this is not a game of armies or squads – it’s one of personalities and legends. The result is an altogether different tone, one charged with dynamic abilities that form the centerpiece of a violent gunfight on a fully rendered board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The board is quite the looker. Verticality is a core tenet of gameplay, as players are able to scale and fight from 3D cardstock buildings. Other elements pop off the map, including cardboard trees and boulders, loot containers, and even fully operational ziplines. The environment is active and responsive. It feels every bit a playground, albeit one with shrapnel and taunts whizzing by your dome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This dedication to elevation fuels the aggressive FPS-style play, but it also is the root of Apex Legends: The Board Game’s primary challenge. I’ve mentioned the game’s bloated componentry, which contributes to a lengthy setup time, but all of these options and details add up to a relatively complex system. The central turn-to-turn action sequence is surprisingly simple and direct. One team activates all of their characters with each committing to two actions. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This board game defies the odds, capturing the visceral action of its namesake with unique and clever design work.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But that streamlined activity fragments into many intricate pieces. Line of sight is a strong example. Measuring from center square to center square and assessing any blockages is standard for this style of game. But when you consider elevation, all of a sudden there are three pages of lengthy examples displaying potential situations. Thankfully, the rulebook's diagrams do a good job of illustrating what you need to consider, but the downside is that line of sight can be difficult to assess on the fly and it can slow down the pace of play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also tough to remember the difference between some of the keywords, such as "adjacent" versus "neighboring." Terrain items and cards use a similar library of tags that must be referenced. There are specific timing windows for reactions and a sub-system for handling abilities and cooldowns. None of these are overly burdensome on their own, but taken together they can become tricky to navigate. It’s important to understand that this is not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game for beginners</a>. Instead of going for wide appeal with a similar approach to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review"><u>Mass Effect: The Board Game</u></a>, Apex Legends aims to satisfy hobbyist gamers familiar with sophisticated systems. If a 40-page rulebook scares you, then you’re not going to hack it on this battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting element of Apex Legends: The Board Game is also the most convoluted. Instead of a sophisticated physics engine handling the shooting mechanism, this game opts to zoom in on the firefight and simulate multiple factors, including recoil, stability, and rate of fire. Most games opt for a handful of dice and some quick arithmetic, but Apex Legends uses a sideboard and a dedicated set of cards to resolve gunshots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s actually a pretty stellar system. Different guns have various rates of fire. They list a number of cards that are drawn from the shooting deck and placed alongside a track. Each card is placed in a slot representing an individual shot. Cards drawn later in the sequence have more recoil affecting their ballistics, which results in an escalation of penalties. The penalty is applied to the strength of the randomly drawn card, and then compared to the necessary hit value on the weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the quick and dirty explanation. In reality, it’s more nuanced as each drawn card also has a possible icon which can inflict headshots, bonus hits, or cause an automatic miss if the target is behind cover. Weapons that hit exceedingly hard with slower rates of fire – such as a shotgun or sniper rifle – may draw multiple cards to a single shot slot, thus avoiding the recoil penalties the system tries to emulate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This can be a wonky process to resolve – it’s certainly slow going with new players. Until you get used to it, this is another part of the game that stunts the tempo of action. Obviously this is a cost of modeling the video game with a high level of detail, but it can be an outright turnoff as it highlights the shortcomings of board games and their inability to obfuscate and resolve math.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this level of detail isn't all bad. What you sacrifice in momentum, you gain in realism. This system acutely captures the unique qualities of various firearms. Sub-machine guns spray several weak shots. Battle rifles fire tighter groupings and hit with power. Light machine guns spray all over the place but can level a building. Weapon attachments are mixed in with the loot, allowing you to alter a firearm’s properties mid-game. This includes optics, barrels, magazines, and stocks. It’s exceedingly cool and really juices up the impact of scavenging for supplies in the battle royale mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result is a weapon system that actually boasts gunplay. No other board or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tabletop-game-alternatives-to-warhammer-40000">miniatures game</a> I've played has so meticulously modeled this key feature of first person shooters. It’s a fantastic accomplishment and absolutely the standout feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this wonderful feat, Apex Legends: The Board Game offers several other killer features. Characters are expertly modeled. They have asymmetric tactical abilities and ultimates that affect the battlefield in various ways. You can pop smoke, call in airstrikes, and deploy drones. Each character is also paired with a unique deck of cards that can be played to tweak actions and react to opponents’ maneuvers. This creates a nifty fog of war, although again, at the cost of possibly slowing down the pace of play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another crowd pleaser is the variety of modes on offer. The battle royale option is the key offering, including a distillation of the final moments of the video game’s finale. This includes a barrier that closes on the battlefield, forcing combatants into tighter and tighter area. But there are also deathmatch, VIP, and capture the flag options. Each of these is fully realized and not at all an afterthought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those sickos who can’t get enough, this game also will be arriving with expansion products for additional characters as well as a new board and environment. Most notably, there is a sophisticated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solitaire</a> / <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op</a> addition that adds AI behavior trees to each of the core game’s protagonists. This mode works fairly well, producing mostly logical enemy actions that sometimes surprise and dazzle. Again, much like the rich base game ruleset, it can be a sluggish pace to familiarize yourself with this additional layer of rules, but it certainly settles down once you’ve become comfortable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a first-person shooter airdropping to your tabletop, Apex Legends: The Board Game is a solid effort and certainly a success. There are challenges involved and the tempo can really drag as players learn the systems and assess the wide swath of options on their turn. Once familiarity sets in and the game starts collapsing towards that 60-90 minute estimated playtime, the bliss of gunplay coupled with dynamic action and a multi-faceted loot system truly shine. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXVy?object_uuid=1a4cdcfc-6638-451d-b767-27674f9d015b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 26, 2025 7:34 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Apex Legends: The Board game is a huge, intricately designed game that can be both overwhelming and thrilling. All of the moving parts make for occasionally clunky and slow gameplay, but it’s reliably a fierce one full of individuality. There’s nothing quite like this on the market, and that makes up for any shortcomings.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-win-rent-a-girlfriend-i-give-up.1229475/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In all my 28 years on this spinning rock, I’ve read my fair share of manga—some absolute classics, some guilty pleasures, and plenty that were straight up trash. But no series has tested my patience quite like <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>. Somehow, against all odds, it’s become the most bizarrely pivotal manga out right now—perched at the edge of being either a brilliant subversion of the genre or a drawn-out cliche that’ll embolden red-pilled manosphere incels for generations. And honestly? I’m too drained to care anymore.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>, by Reiji Miyajima, is a rom-com series I can best describe as <em>Scott Pilgrim,</em> but worse. It follows Kazuya Kinoshita, a perpetually down-bad college student who, off the heels of a brutal breakup, impulsively hires a rental girlfriend named Chizuru Mizuhara to fill the hole in his sadboy heart. I genuinely can’t stress this enough: Kazuya is a weirdo to the nth degree at the start of the series. He blows through tissues and can’t be bothered to clean them up. Early Kazuya lashes out at Chizuru for “faking it” on their rental date, despite her doing her job. He embodies every red flag rolled into one desperate, entitled fuckboy. And this is before the trashy harem manga/anime hijinks ensue.</p><p>Kazuya and Chizuru’s grandmothers, conveniently bosom buddies at the same nursing home, spot them together, roping them into continuing a charade of “fake dating” after getting spotted together and keeping up appearances in front of Kazuya’s friends, which inevitably spirals out of control. Things get even messier when the series leans hard into full-blown harem chaos. Enter: a girl whose heart condition means her kokoro only goes doki doki for Kazuya; another painfully shy rental girlfriend but still Team Kazuya because he shows normal human decency to her; a loli sidekick who exists purely to cheer on the will-they-won’t-they with her finger firmly tipping the scale toward the former; and an ex who, ironically is the only one calling out the madness—yet gets vilified by readers who just see her as a bitch.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Best Waifu of 2020" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwnK8DRINbY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>By now, you’re probably wondering why I even bothered diving into this series. Trust me, I ask myself that same thing every week when I clock in to read a new chapter and massage my brow. My morbid curiosity had me first watching the entirety of its first season in a day and then catching up to its available manga chapters to the point where it was, for a time, like rubbernecking a beautiful car crash.&nbsp;</p><p>Secretly, though, I hoped for a pivot—for Chizuru to wise up and leave Kazuya in an emotional landfill where he belonged. Despite their improbable chemistry hinting at genuine affection, it was a later arc of hers that caught me off guard—a storyline where she pursues acting and reveals that her rental gig was a means to support that dream. That made me feel things.&nbsp;</p><p>Kazuya, by that point, had taken enough Ls to start resembling a functioning adult instead of a 2D wish-fulfilment entity for anime and manga’s most tragic fanbase. But of course, there’s a catch: the series<em> </em>drags. It <em>drags</em>. And Kazuya somehow becomes even more of a spectacle. Case in point is an infamous waterpark meltdown, complete with tears, jealousy, and a boner where the man is crashing out at the thought (which readers see in excruciating detail) of Chizuru bumping uglies with a male friend of hers. Peak narrative despair so cringe I’m surprised I didn’t Thanos snap into oblivion having read it.</p><p>What followed, surprisingly, was a glimmer of actual progress—their lie exposed by Kazuya’s ex, and a dramatic, full-spread kiss spurned by Chizuru to prove they were dating that duped Kazuya’s friends, family, and readers into believing we were headed into final arc territory. Closure is possible.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t. The series kept going. And the worst part? I kept reading.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The 🔥Roast🔥 of Rent-A-Girlfriend" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OckbgVgZj04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Fellow anime connoisseur Geoff Thew of Mother's Basement and I have exchanged war letters (via Twitter DMs) about the series. Geoff’s long since tapped out. I, on the other hand, remain entrenched in the manga, reporting back like a shell-shocked soldier. And while Geoff has summarized the pain more concisely than I can without seeing red, the core gripe remains: this manga has become an exercise in narrative purgatory.</p><p>Kazuya and Chizuru both know they have feelings for each other. Everyone knows. And yet, instead of resolution, the story stalls—like a cat toying with its food, savoring the indecision. Chizuru has had the ball in her court for what feels like geological time, and the series seems intent on suspending the inevitable “let’s date” or “let’s just be friends” moment for maximum agony. Along the way, every romcom cliche and emotionally manipulative contrivance has been hurled at them to stretch the string taut: cohabitation shenanigans, Kazuya becoming her acting manager, a chorus of women (all but his ex) lining up to cheer him on like a dating sim with no bad route story branch.&nbsp;</p><p>But then something happened. Around chapter 380, the pair is finally on their first real date. Let that sink in. In the time this saga has burned through endless trial runs of their date like it was an episode of <em>The Rehearsal</em>, entire romcoms—<em>Komi Can’t Communicate</em>, <em>My Dress-Up Darling</em>, <em>Don’t Bully Me Nagatoro</em>, and <em>Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out</em>—have wrapped up their burgeoning love stories with them getting together and ending the series. <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>, meanwhile, is shaping up to be the <em>One Piece</em> of emotionally constipated romcoms.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s especially wild, and why I lead with the manga suddenly being critical in the manga reading community, is that the series is at a strange narrative crossroads: it could deliver a long-overdue moral reckoning about transactional intimacy and the entitlement that festers around men regarding women…or it could go full tilt into rewarding Kakuya, breathlessly validating the worst kinds of reader fantasies. And the manga community is embroiled in a civil war over either outcome as the series progresses toward its conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the latest chapters finally gave us the date. I’ll spare you the minute-by-minute because, true to form, readers were subjected to every intrusive, obsessive, ogling thought Kazuya had overanalyzing Chizuru’s mannerisms from start to finish. At the end of their date, it finally happened: Chizuru accepted Kazuya’s feelings. She thanked him for loving her, and she even said she loved him too.</p><p>And then she rejected him.&nbsp;</p><p>She reasoned that her lifestyle as a rental girlfriend and, more honestly, the emotional stage she was at in her life, wouldn’t allow for a relationship. Kazuya, for once, didn’t spiral. He was hurt, sure, but he took it in stride. A vocal subset of the fandom did not.</p><p>Many <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend </em>readers interpreted Chizuru’s rejection as a surprise, maybe even a subversive move—a long-con feminist parable about how affection and support shouldn’t entitle men to a relationship. But on Musk’s town square of terminal takes, the reaction to Kazuya’s rejection was nothing short of a riot. People dogpiled what looked like a rare, poignant moment of growth for Kazuya and branded the manga “peak cuck content.” Chizuru, in particular, was called everything outside her name, with some fans highlighting that Kazuya spent 250,000 yen on their dates and funded her career as evidence that she used him for emotional and financial labor, only to turn him down. One particularly heated reader went full unhinged, posting a manga edit of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s Toji killing Chizuri.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">people going "erm... am i too woke or is this a teensy bit misogynistic... ☝️🤓" bro it's an edit of a woman being called a bitch and shot in the head for gently turning down a guy OBVIOUSLY it's misogynistic 😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/ajoUByBGWO">https://t.co/ajoUByBGWO</a></p>— danny website (@raincoatrevive) <a href="https://twitter.com/raincoatrevive/status/1934340105528856956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>While I was initially championing the story for somehow surprising me by dovetailing into an essential lesson at a time when men aren’t doing okay and their manosphere pariahs aren’t helping, the manga, to my horror, appears to be spinning the block on its emotional breakthrough. In chapter 382, the story is hinting at their romance not being over, with Kazuya carrying Chizuru piggyback to their apartment after noticing her heel was bloodied from breaking in fancy new shoes—a quiet gesture he’s taken as a signal that their night matters to her, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Odds are they’ll end up together anyway, wrapped in some breathless “it was all worth it” speech. But I won’t be sticking around to see it. I’ve watched this story loop around resolution like a broken record for years, clinging to the hope it might land somewhere bold. I’m not that teenager chasing trainwrecks anymore—I’ve got bills, better taste (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-self-aware-harem-anime-must-finish-its-story-2000560926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in trashy anime</a>), and better manga to read. Maybe it still turns the ship, but after that latest cliffhanger, I’m out. Not every trashy romance can pull off a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErTEqW1_25c&amp;pp=0gcJCf0Ao7VqN5tD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trashy-meets-classy bonkers landing</a> like <em>Domestic Girlfriend</em>. This is me breaking the cycle.

			<p>As anyone familiar with the Dune series knows, "<em>A beginning is the time for taking the most care that the balances are correct</em>," a mantra that's true for plenty of situations in life, and for starting a new character in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">Dune: Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>When you begin your adventure on Arrakis, you'll go through a character creation process that feels like it has huge importance to it - and it mostly does.</p>
<p>But at the same time, some of the choices available to you don't have as much of an impact on your journey as they might seem to, if you're someone who is very into Dune lore and the politicking that the series is known for.</p>
<p>This guide will take you through all the choices you'll face in the opening character creation process, and which ones really matter.</p>
<h2>Dune: Awakening - The Best Character Creation Choices and Which Ones Really Matter</h2>
<h3>Which Choices Really Matter</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Starting with what means the most, the choice that actually matters, and I say choice because out of the three core choices you're given in the character creation, the only one that really matters is your <strong>mentor/class</strong>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to train in every class throughout your journey on Arrakis, so whoever you pick first is just that - the class you'll start out with. But it is the choice out of all the character creation options that has the biggest impact on your early game playtime.</p>
<p>Your caste and selecting which world you're from don't play as huge of a gameplay role, and are more there for you to role-play in the world of Dune: Awakening more than anything. You'll see the fruits of your choices play out in certain dialogue options, but overall they won't have nearly as strong of an impact on your time in Dune: Awakening, especially the early hours of your journey, as your choice of mentor/class.</p>
<h3>The Best Character Creation Choices</h3>

<figure></figure>

<h4>Class/Mentor</h4>
<p>While you can be effective with any choice for your mentor/class, there is an obvious answer for which one is the best to start with, giving you the biggest advantage in the early game.</p>
<p>Dune-heads will be unsurprised to learn that the best choice for a mentor in the game is also the most logical choice according to the lore, which is <strong>Mentat.</strong> Choosing Mentat for your starting class means you'll start with the Sentinel turret, which will be invaluable for taking out enemies at camps and testing stations in the early game.</p>
<p>Bene Gesserit is arguably the second-best choice, because of the Bindu Sprint ability you'll be able to unlock early. Before you're able to craft a vehicle, having an ability that lets you cross great distances quickly while on foot is a huge boon when trying to avoid open sand as much as possible.</p>
<p>Swordmaster falls third, though not by much, as the Bindu Sprint is what really pulls picking Bene Gesserit up the ladder. Both starting classes won't be as big of a help with early game combat as starting with Mentat will.</p>
<p>Trooper has the unique distinction of technically being a pretty good starting choice, but also more realistically the worst pick, because the first trainer you'll meet is the one who will open the Trooper skill tree for you. The Shigawire Claw, which is a very useful grapple hook, is easily one of the best abilities in the game, though you can get it so early on from the basic-level Trooper trainer, it's nearly pointless to pick Trooper as your starting class.</p>
<p>Mentat, Bene Gesserit, and Swordmaster trainers are all discovered a bit later on, so you're much better off picking any of them to open up a skill tree you'd otherwise need to play hours to access, while still being able to get the best part of the Trooper skill tree from the beginning of the game.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Class/Mentor</strong></td>
<td><strong>Skill Tree Focus</strong></td>
<td><strong>Starting Ability</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bene Gesserit</td>
<td>Physical Mastery &amp; Manipulation</td>
<td>Voice: Compel - Use The Voice to force someone towards your position from afar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mentat</td>
<td>Recon &amp; Strategy</td>
<td>The Sentinel - Deploy a suspensor buoyed dart projector that uses motion detection to cover a field of fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Swordmaster</td>
<td>Close-quarter Aggression</td>
<td>Knee Charge - Propel yourself forward into battle with a terrific knee charge into the enemy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trooper</td>
<td>Offense &amp; Demolition</td>
<td>Shigawire Claw - Shoot a barb that attaches to a surface, than rapidly pulls you towards that position.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Homeworld</h4>
<p>As already stated, your choice of homeworld in Dune: Awakening isn't really all that significant, and more so depends on how you'd like to role-play within your journey on Arrakis.</p>
<p>If you needed to pick one, then you could make an argument for Giedi Prime, the Harkonnen homeworld. The dialogue trait you'll get with this is Deception, and being able to lie your way out of sticky situations when they arise is always useful on Arrakis.</p>
<p>Similarly, choosing Kaitain, the home base of the Imperium, is also not a bad choice, as you'll acquire the Political dialogue trait.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the opportunity to pick a dialogue option based on the trait you chose at the beginning of the game doesn't crop up enough, especially in the early game, for any of these choices to really stand out as 'best.' The only other element of picking a homeworld is that you get a unique emote. So, once again, basically no impact on gameplay.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Homeworld</strong></td>
<td><strong>Dialogue Trait</strong></td>
<td><strong>Unique Emote</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Caladan</td>
<td>Honorable</td>
<td>Atreides Salute</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chusuk</td>
<td>Cultured</td>
<td>Chusuk Music</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Geidi Prime</td>
<td>Deception</td>
<td>Harkonnen Curse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kaitain</td>
<td>Political</td>
<td>Kaitain Bow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ix</td>
<td>Technologist</td>
<td>Ixian Secret</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Caste</h4>
<p>Your choice of caste does give you a separate dialogue trait, but once again it has little to no impact on your gameplay, particularly in the early hours of your journey. Just like your choice in homeworld, this is more about how you want to role-play within Dune: Awakening.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Caste</strong></td>
<td><strong>Dialogue Trait</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bondsmen</td>
<td>Bondsmen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Na-Familia</td>
<td>Nobility</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pyon</td>
<td>Pyon</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Do you… do you hear that? Can you feel it? That disgusting, gnawing feeling, a shiver down your spine because you know it's coming for you… the Steam summer sale… Friends, Romans, country(insert pronoun here), it is unfortunately that time of year again, that time where you look at all of those games in your wishlist as you try to figure out which deal is the best, and which to leave for the next inevitable sale.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Personally, there are far too many games in my wishlist that I'd like to buy now but I am also supposedly an Adult with Responsibilities, so I will try to refrain from picking anything up. Besides, that backlog isn't getting any shorter and my lifespan isn't getting any longer. Still! The mortifying concept of ego and literal death aside, I'm still going to make mention of a few notable games that have some healthy discounts, if only to make you think "oh yeah I've been meaning to play that."

<p>
For starters, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">Death Stranding is 60% off</a> making it only £14, and considering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>'s inevitable PC release is nowhere in sight, you might as well relieve some of that FOMO. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/">Elden Ring is quite a healthy 40% off</a> at £30, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/">so is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, making it £39</a>. Possible future GOTY and frequent discourse starter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a smaller discount of 10% off</a>, but that still makes it £38. Last year's actual GOTY <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/">UFO 50 is also only £16.80</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you really want something cheap as chips, the groovy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/">Crypt of the Necrodancer is as low as £1.27</a>. Heavily lesbian visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/">Heaven Will Be Mine is only £2.27 as well</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/">Robocop: Rogue City is £4.49</a>.
</p>
<p>
Point is, there's too many damn games that are really cheap right now. I'm sure you'll figure out your budget somehow.

If you're unfamiliar, the Steam Summer Sale is one of the two biggest sales available on the platform annually, with the other occurring around the holiday season in December. You can expect to save big on PC games both new and old, which makes the sale a perfect time to buy games in bulk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Steam Summer sale is set to run through July 10. Some of the top-reviewed games of 2025 are included as part of this sale, in addition to newer PC ports from publishers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/square-enix">Square Enix</a> or PlayStation.

Don't miss your chance to save as much cash as possible on these PC games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Steam Summer Sale - The Best Deals Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best deals I recommend checking out is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> for $41.99. With the main story and side content combined, there is easily over 100 hours of content in this RPG. This game just made its way to PC in late January, and it's one of the best RPGs to release in the last five years. If you haven't yet played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, you can grab both games together in the Twin Pack for $59.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, you can save $10 off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. While this just released in April by surprise, you can already save 20% off and dive hundreds of hours deep into this iconic Bethesda RPG. Bethesda also has a solid deal on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and now is the best time to jump in and prepare for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-dlc-the-order-of-the-giants-finally-has-a-release-date">The Order of Giants DLC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also save on three major 2025 indie games: R.E.P.O., Schedule I, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review">Blue Prince</a>. The latter sits as one of the highest rated games of the year, offering a unique house of puzzles to solve. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/schedule-1-review-early-access">Schedule 1</a> puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer, and the game is still one of the most played Steam games of 2025. Finally, R.E.P.O. is a wonderful time with friends that is sure to cause both laughs and headaches. All of these smaller games are generally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-steam-games-on-your-phone">great to stream to your phone</a> if you want a more mobile experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for deep discounts, I recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-review">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/17/star-wars-battlefront-2-review-2019">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>. Each of these games is 90% off, and you can pick all three for a grand total of $14. Star Wars Battlefront II is an especially good deal, as there has been a major resurgence in online players as of late.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the smaller discounts available is for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. While you'll only save $5 during the Steam Summer Sale, this is the lowest we've seen this game yet. If you've been on the fence about picking this one up, it's not likely to dip much further until late this year, especially since it is one of the highest-rated games of the year.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Amazon Prime Day Arrives at the End of the Steam Sale</h3><div catalogid="a568cc81-560f-48fe-bbf9-5308ce73a03f" id="223504"><div id="223504" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All Early Prime Day Deals</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Steam Summer Sale is ongoing right now, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-everything-we-know-so-far">Amazon Prime Day</a> is set to kick off on July 8. This year, Amazon has doubled the length on the sale, making it the longest Prime Day to date. Though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">PC games</a> are not usually a focus of Prime Day, you can expect to have the opportunity to score a few deals on PC hardware, monitors, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard">accessories</a>, and more. If you're looking to either enter the PC market for the first time or upgrade your existing setup, keep your eye on Prime Day. This is also when more of the console games will likely go on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-early-prime-day-2025-offers-free-games-prime-gaming">currently offering free PC games</a> as part of an early Prime Day promotion.
