            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and NIS America have announced the&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>release date, with the long-awaited JRPG set to arrive in the West in February.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>launches on Valentine's Day in the West. It'll have some stiff competition, with the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day">Date Everything!</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>&nbsp;</em>vying for your attention on that date as well.</p>
<p>As you'd expect,&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>picks up where the original&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>left off. It once again follows the adventures of Van Arkride, a spriggan (think bounty hunter crossed with detective) who must investigate a series of murders.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date-fishing.jpg?itok=DuCcs5GS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date-fishing.jpg?itok=LdxTfC-E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Van Arkride might have some murders to investigate, but that doesn't mean he can't stop for a spot of fishing.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, although&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2</em>&nbsp;takes the form of a murder investigation in terms of its plot and setup, it's still offering exactly the kind of classic action-RPG combat you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Daybreak&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>Two new systems, Cross Charge and EX Chains, have been introduced. Cross Charge lets you bring in a party member to deal damage if you manage to successfully pull off a perfect dodge, while EX Chains deal huge damage to stunned enemies once certain battle conditions have been met.</p>
<p>Each act of&nbsp;<em>Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>will contain multiple chapters, and some of those chapters may focus on Van's friends rather than him, as the party will frequently split up to deal with multiple issues in different locations.</p>
<p>Some chapters will even require the special skills of certain party members, like Swin's tailing skills or Mare's orbal hacking capabilities.</p>

<p>Given that the original&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>only <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date">launched in the West this past July</a>, it's nice that you won't have to wait too long to check out the sequel.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668430/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_through_Daybreak_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004596" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Nintendo Switch on February 14th.</p>

It comes a year after Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which has also seen the likes of Diablo 4 and Modern Warfare 3 arrive on Game Pass, and will, in November, see StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection hit the subscription service.</p><p>Black Ops 6’s launch straight into Game Pass is a big gamble for Microsoft. It hopes the power of Call of Duty will boost subscriber numbers and revenue (itself bolstered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">the recent Game Pass price rise and restructure</a>), but it comes with the risk of losing sales of the full-price game. While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed. "Well, there's a different person making the decisions," Spencer laughed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>In the shorter term, tomorrow, October 16, South Park: The Fractured but Whole (Cloud, Console, and PC) hits Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. A day later, on October 17, Donut County (Cloud, Console, and PC) returns to the Game Pass library via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard, and MechWarrior 5: Clans (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) hits Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass as a day-one release.</p><p>Then it’s the big one: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Cloud, Console, and PC) on October 25 via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass only. Also on October 25, last year’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (Cloud) via Game Pass Ultimate, and battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (Cloud) via Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>Moving on from October 25 and Call of Duty, Ashen (Cloud, Console, and PC) returns to Game Pass via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard on October 29.</p><p>And finally for October, Dead Island 2 (PC) enters Game Pass for PC gamers via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass on October 31 (it’s already available on Game Pass via Cloud and Console).</p><p>Microsoft also mentioned StarCraft: Remastered (PC) – November 5 (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection (PC) – November 5 (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass), which are set to kick off Wave 1 of November 2024's Game Pass lineup.</p><h2>Xbox Game Pass October 2024 Wave 2 Lineup:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole"><strong>South Park: The Fractured but Whole</strong></a><strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 16</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/donut-county"><strong>Donut County</strong></a><strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 17</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mechwarrior-5-clans"><strong>MechWarrior 5: Clans</strong></a><strong> (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 17</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6"><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</strong></a><strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 25</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023"><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</strong></a><strong> (Cloud) – October 25</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20"><strong>Call of Duty: Warzone</strong></a><strong> (Cloud) – October 25</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ashen-2018"><strong>Ashen</strong></a><strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 29</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-island-2"><strong>Dead Island 2</strong></a><strong> (PC) – October 31</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-remastered"><strong>StarCraft: Remastered</strong></a><strong> (PC) – November 5</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty"><strong>StarCraft II: Campaign Collection</strong></a><strong> (PC) – November 5</strong><br>Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li></ul><p>As usual, a number of games leave Game Pass as new titles arrive.</p><h2>Here’s what’s leaving Xbox Game Pass on<strong> October 31:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li><li>Headbangers (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li><li>Inkulinati (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li><li>Lonely Mountain’s Downhill (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li><li>Mineko’s Night Market (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li></ul><p>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

There are a few miscellaneous and collectible trophies thrown in too, as well as the party member-specific trophies — although, curiously, not for completing a romance storyline.</p><p>BioWare games traditionally do include achievements for romancing characters, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> appears to be taking a different, perhaps more Platinum-friendly approach.</p><p>The names of the achievements tied to those story beats suggest various plot developments, locations, and even the final boss, so it’s worth a PSA for the perhaps inevitable ramping up of Dragon Age: The Veilguard spoilers on the internet as we near the release date.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-settles-gamers-antitrust-lawsuit-over-69-billion-activision-blizzard-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft has settled the antitrust lawsuit filed on behalf of a group of gamers who objected to the company’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-lawsuit-gamers-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>, details of the settlement were undisclosed, but we do know the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, which means it cannot be filed again. Lawyers agreed that "each party shall bear their own costs and fees."</p><p>The lawsuit was filed back in 2022 in California by a group of gamers from across multiple states who expressed concern about the potential negative impact of a Microsoft monopoly in the video game space sparked by absorbing the makers of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, among many other games. It came soon after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began its work to block the deal from closing, work that ultimately failed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>The lawsuit had claimed that if Microsoft were to acquire Activision Blizzard, it could lead to the company prioritizing Xbox versions of multiplatform games, prices going up, or the cancelation of certain games. There was specific concern about the potential impact on Game Pass subscribers should the buyout go through.</p><p>Since Microsoft successfully acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, Game Pass has changed significantly. It’s slowly added Activision Blizzard games to the subscription service (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-with-xbox-game-pass">with Black Ops 6 set to be the first mainline Call of Duty game to launch in Game Pass day-one later this month</a>), but it’s also restructured Game Pass itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-standard-tier-doesnt-include-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-starfield-diablo-4-and-more">Day-one releases are now not a part of Game Pass’ revised basic tier</a>, and big-ticket games such as Diablo 4, Starfield, and Call of Duty are reserved for the more expensive Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass subscriptions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">Microsoft has also raised the price of Game Pass</a>, most recently in July when Xbox Game Pass Ultimate increased from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">The price increase was described as inevitable</a> by analysts speaking with IGN, with some predicting that Game Pass will eventually see the introduction of ads. The changes are said to be part of a push by Xbox to recoup some of its $69 billion investment in Activision Blizzard.</p><p>In response, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ftc-blasts-xbox-game-pass-price-increase-and-new-tiers-as-product-degradation">the FTC called out Microsoft's Game Pass price rises</a> and labeled the new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier a "degraded product." The FTC claimed Microsoft was "exercising market power post-merger" of Activision Blizzard with its controversial changes to Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft responded to the FTC's filing about Xbox Game Pass price increases, calling the FTC’s complaint a "misleading, extra-record account of the facts." It insisted the FTC was wrong to call Game Pass Standard a “degraded” version because it includes multiplayer.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Microsoft has also cut an eye-watering 2,550 staff from its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard</a>, with multiple studios falling by the wayside. In February, the FTC claimed Microsoft contradicted its intentions during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">when it laid off 1,900 employees from its games division in January</a>.</p><p>FTC lawyer Imad Abyad argued that Microsoft said it wanted Activision to "operate as a limited-integration studio." But because Activision staff were among those affected by the layoffs, Abyad claimed this contradicted Microsoft’s prior claim. Microsoft responded to insist Activision Blizzard had already planned mass layoffs regardless of whether the acquisition was completed.</p><p>“As time passes, Microsoft continues to increase its market power, prices have increased, games continue to be canceled, development capacities continue to diminish, and Game Pass continues to trend towards a monopoly,” attorney Joseph Saveri said in a court filing.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising-announced-by-netease.1009869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase and Bungie have announced&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising</em>, a mobile spinoff of the hugely popular MMORPG-FPS hybrid&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>, and it's getting a closed alpha playtest next month.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20240930/41118_1181986.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement</a>, NetEase describes&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>as a "new epic free-to-play mobile sci-fi RPG shooter" with a variety of playable heroes, a "shared world", and several game modes. It'll offer both first-person and third-person shooter gameplay.</p>
<p>The game will take place "within the rich tapestry of the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>universe" and will be both developed and published by NetEase itself, although naturally, the game is officially licensed by Bungie.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-rising-mobile-spinoff-shooting.jpg?itok=iWUcjBA6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-rising-mobile-spinoff-shooting.jpg?itok=DGCVFYiA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>will take place within the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>universe, but perhaps not quite as you know it.</figcaption></figure><p>NetEase says that&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>will be set "in an alternate&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>timeline" and will explore a story "in the post-Dark Age era", likely to avoid any chance of tangling up the series' canon ahead of Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-new-release-cadence">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>efforts</a>.</p>
<p>The game will feature single-player, co-op, and competitive gameplay, just like&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>itself, and will also feature both "game modes familiar to&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>players" and "all-new modes that introduce new ways" to experience the core gameplay.</p>
<p>NetEase senior VP Ethan Wang says the aim with&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>is to "deliver a&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>-caliber experience to mobile devices", promising an "action-packed RPG shooter set within the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising</em>, which shows off the world of the game and just a little hint of gameplay towards the end, right here.</p>

<p>In addition to releasing this trailer, NetEase has also released a developer preview in which NetEase and Bungie staffers talk about exactly what&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>is and how they're building it. You can check that video out here.</p>

<p><em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can sign up to get a chance to be part of the game's first closed alpha test in November by <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">visiting its official website</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-bog-witch-update-ptr</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valheim-the-bog-witch-update-brings-new-trader-new-mechanic-and-more-to-ptr.1009866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-bog-witch-update-ptr<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iron Gate and Coffee Stain have released a new&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>update on the game's public test realm, and it brings a new trader, a major new game mechanic, and more. Be aware that we'll be spoiling some of what's included in this update, so read on at your peril!</p>
<p>The update is currently available to try out in&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>'s beta, and its first major addition is the titular Bog Witch, a new trader who has new goods for you to buy. She can be found in the Swamps, and she'll sell you ingredients and materials for brewing potions.</p>
<p>She's also got things that will be useful for the update's new Feast mechanic, which lets you cook large meals you can share amongst several players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valheim-the-bog-witch-update-food.jpg?itok=f3UazCDN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valheim-the-bog-witch-update-food.jpg?itok=N2-vrynr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>The Bog Witch update brings a new mechanic for you to check out and lots more.</figcaption></figure><p>Three new skills are being introduced in this update: Cooking, Farming, and Crafting.</p>
<p>Cooking reduces food crafting time and gives you the chance to gain another food while crafting. Farming reduces Cultivator stamina cost and increases farming item durability, while Crafting reduces item crafting time and boosts crafting item durability. It's all pretty simple stuff.</p>
<p>You'll also find lots of new crafting materials and potions to try out, as well as some new emotes to help you communicate with your friends and much more besides.</p>

<p>You can read this update's patch notes, which also contain a ton of bug fixes and minor gameplay improvements, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/7514910232818862414" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a> if you wish.</p>
<p>Unlike previous major&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>updates along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-ashlands-update-ptr-launch">Ashlands</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-mistlands-update-available-public-test-branch">Mistlands</a>, this update doesn't add any new biomes or creatures for you to fight, but it's still a pretty substantial addition to the world of&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>nonetheless.</p>
<p>If you want to join the beta branch and check out this game, you can do so by heading to the game's Properties menu in your Steam library. From there, select Betas and enter the code "yesimadebackups", which will grant you access to the PTR.</p>
<p>Xbox players, meanwhile, should use the Xbox Insider Hub app to find&nbsp;the "<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>Public Test" option within the Previews menu.</p>
<p><em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/valheim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

Here is a breakdown of every set and how we’ve been able to earn them.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Dragon Balls (Shenron)</strong> - The most iconic set from the franchise, one that resides on planet Earth and summons Shenron. Finishing some of Whis’s missions can earn you a full set. They otherwise seem to have a small chance of dropping during offline or online battles. Those who bought the Season Pass will also receive one free wish to use.</li><li><strong>Dragon Balls (Porunga)</strong> - The second set introduced, residing on Planet Namek, and summoning Porunga. These seem to have an even smaller chance of dropping during battles.</li><li><strong>Dragon Balls (Super Shenron)</strong> - The most powerful set that summons Super Shenron. One set can be earned from completing Goku’s Episode Battles, while another can be earned from Trunks’ Episode Battles. It seems likely that these could drop from offline and online battles as well, but if they do, they must have the lowest chances of all. Those who purchased the Ultimate Edition get one free wish to use.</li></ul><p>Given that we can confirm at least two of them will drop from Battles, you’ll want to complete as many as possible. <strong>The most effective method I’ve found for farming Dragon Balls is to play a Battle against a CPU on the World Tournament Stage, with Out-of-Bounds rules on.</strong> All you need to do to win is knock them off the stage and onto the ground. I acquired Dragon Balls more often when playing on higher difficulties, although you might enjoy the pacing of fighting against a weaker CPU.</p><p>Equipping some ability items to raise your Ki is a fantastic strategy if you can combo into a Beam or Blast Super. Starting a match with Gogeta Blue’s Stardust Blaster against Hercule or a larger opponent is practically guaranteed to send them out of bounds. Another option is to go in as Great Ape Vegeta and try to throw the opponent out of the ring, which can feel pretty cathartic after fighting the big monster. No matter who you use, your goal should be to finish a match within 30 seconds.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-great-ape-vegeta-guide-1851669880&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-great-ape-vegeta-guide-1851669880">Struggling With <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Great Ape Vegeta? We’ve Got You</a></span></p><p>I do want to share a word of caution though: <strong>you cannot collect more Dragon Balls once you have a full set</strong>. A message will pop up to say that you can’t accept another one of the same type because you have too many. I held onto mine in hopes that it would make it more likely for the other types to pop up, but I ended up with more messages if anything. You should aim to use the Dragon Ball sets as soon as possible.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-recommend-id="image://62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The iconic green dragon Shenron offers multiple options to wish for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The iconic green dragon Shenron offers multiple options to wish for." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-recommend-id="image://62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The iconic green dragon Shenron offers multiple options to wish for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Summoning Shenron gives you access to a single wish. I’d argue he’s middle of the pack in what he offers, but that depends entirely on what you want to unlock. Here are your choices with this dragon:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>I want more Zeni</strong> - Grants 300,000 Zeni</li><li><strong>I want you to raise my Player Level</strong> - One of the first things I did after the tutorial was summon Shenron and choose this wish. I was pretty happy with the result, as it increased my Player Level to 8 and expanded the Shop quite a bit.</li><li><strong>I want more Titles</strong> - These are titles for your Player Card.</li><li><strong>I want New Outfits </strong>- These are cosmetic options for specific characters. The options include Yamcha’s original Bandit outfit, Goku and Vegeta’s Outfits from <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, and Master Roshi’s Jackie Chun outfit.</li><li><strong>I want to complete an Episode Battle</strong> - Offers a Dragon Orb item to make secondary objectives easier.</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="816a0884a9a6b886e343bf56b9761e0a" data-recommend-id="image://816a0884a9a6b886e343bf56b9761e0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1918" data-height="1029" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The buff green dragon Porunga offers three wishes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The buff green dragon Porunga offers three wishes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="816a0884a9a6b886e343bf56b9761e0a" data-recommend-id="image://816a0884a9a6b886e343bf56b9761e0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1918" data-height="1029" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The buff green dragon Porunga offers three wishes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Things work a bit differently with Porunga. He can’t raise your Player Level or Outfits, and he provides less Zeni, but he has the advantage of granting you three wishes. You can also acquire Ability Items from him. Here’s the breakdown:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>I want more Zeni</strong> - Grants 120,000 Zeni</li><li><strong>I want more Titles</strong> - A different set of titles for your Player Card.</li><li><strong>I want Ability Items</strong> - Most of these will be available in the shop over time, but it’s a great way to unlock some early on.</li><li>I<strong> want to complete an Episode Battle</strong> - Offers a Dragon Orb item to make secondary objectives easier.</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="834e1abdc7b1fdc201b98a5ef02e9906" data-recommend-id="image://834e1abdc7b1fdc201b98a5ef02e9906" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The gigantic yellow Super Shenron, with galaxies in the background, offers multiple choices for a wish." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The gigantic yellow Super Shenron, with galaxies in the background, offers multiple choices for a wish." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="834e1abdc7b1fdc201b98a5ef02e9906" data-recommend-id="image://834e1abdc7b1fdc201b98a5ef02e9906" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The gigantic yellow Super Shenron, with galaxies in the background, offers multiple choices for a wish." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Super Shenron offers an exclusive category, letting you wish for a character.

They’re both thematically appropriate to this dragon and they certainly are fan favorites.<br></p><p>The remainder of his choices are also pretty enticing. He gives you everything the other dragons can, and he grants far more Zeni and player experience. Here’s everything you can get from Super Shenron:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>I want more Characters</strong> - Allows you to unlock Goku Black or Fused Zamasu.</li><li><strong>I want more Zeni</strong> - Grants 1,000,000 Zeni.</li><li><strong>I want you to raise my Player Level</strong> - Using a different profile that was at a player level 2, this option skyrocketed it to 18.</li><li><strong>I want new Outfits</strong> - Offers the same outfits that Shenron does.</li><li><strong>I want more Titles</strong> - Super Shenron has some unique titles, and provides the same ones offered by Shenron and Porunga.</li><li><strong>I want Ability Items</strong> - Offers the same items as Porunga.</li><li><strong>I want to complete an Episode Battle</strong> - Offers a Dragon Orb item to make secondary objectives easier.</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="728d0a8167edb4d1cbbed95641114c87" data-recommend-id="image://728d0a8167edb4d1cbbed95641114c87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The confirmation screen for using a Dragon Orb item." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The confirmation screen for using a Dragon Orb item." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="728d0a8167edb4d1cbbed95641114c87" data-recommend-id="image://728d0a8167edb4d1cbbed95641114c87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The confirmation screen for using a Dragon Orb item." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every dragon can grant help completing an Episode Battle. Choosing that wish will give you an exclusive item called a Dragon Orb. <strong>These can be used only when hovering over an Episode Battle with branching paths, as they make the secondary objectives easier to meet.</strong> Even though a lot of these objectives just require you to win within a certain time, using a Dragon Orb for a bit more leeway can be a big help. The only caveat is that you won’t earn victory rewards from it, but that’s not too bad of a trade-off to see some really fun what-if stories.<br></p><p>This option won’t pop up until you’ve come across an Episode Battle with potential branching paths. Although that occurs early on in Goku’s story, those who immediately spent a lot of time in multiplayer modes or received a free Shenron summon—depending upon which edition they purchased—would likely not have seen this. Make sure to keep an eye out for this option if you didn’t see it during your first summon(s)!</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> doesn’t spend much time explaining the nuances of summoning the dragons, and leaves it all for us to discover. As fun as that idea is, nobody likes to feel like they made the wrong choice, especially with how rare it can be to see Porunga and Super Shenron.<br></p><p>The best choice for you depends entirely on preference and how far along you are, but you should be better equipped to select a more favorable option. Go out and make your wishes in confidence!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But one day, a shocking series of murders involving a mysterious <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>son beast sets the wheels of fate in motion once again. Various factions spring into <a title="Genres > Action [2,243 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> – both those who abide by the law to uncover the truth and those looking to capitalize on any new developments wherever possible, no matter how sinister.</p><p>With chaos once again looming on the horizon, the spriggan Van Arkride receives an unexpected visitor, prompting his own investigation. Who is behind the murders, and what is their goal? The sands of time bring old and new faces together for this thrilling second installment in the <em><a title="Series > Trails [62 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/trails">Trails</a> through Daybreak</em> saga.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Year 1209 of the Septian Calendar.</p><p>The threat posed by Almata has passed. Peace has finally returned to Calvard. And, for a time, that peace goes uninterrupted—until a CID special forces unit is slaughtered by an unknown assailant.</p><p>With authorities working to contain the situation, criminal forces take the chance to make their own moves.</p><p>Meanwhile, a spriggan by the name of Van Arkride begins his own investigation—after prompting from an unexpected visitor.</p><p>Who could be responsible for this massacre? What was their objective? And how does it all relate to Agnes’ search for the eighth Genesis?</p><p>A crimson beast’s roar. A chance meeting with a boy and girl, both embroiled in a mysterious search. These are the circumstances that lure Arkride Solutions down the trail of an inescapable fate.</p><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Battle System</strong> – The game builds on the seamless transition between field battles and command battles introduced in the previous game with new mechanics that can be used in both: Cross Charge &amp; EX Chains! Mastering the use of these two combo mechanics can provide you with overwhelming firepower to use against your opponents.</li><li><strong>Cross Charge</strong> – If you manage to Perfect Dodge an enemy’s attack during a field battle, the Cross Charge icon will appear! Pushing the correct button while the icon is on-screen will swap in another party member, who will simultaneously execute a charge attack on your foe! As a bonus, the party member that you swap in will have enhanced attack power for a period of time.</li><li><strong>EX Chains</strong> – EX Chains can be activated by fulfilling specific conditions during command battles. Once these conditions have been met, using a craft or normal attack against a stunned enemy will automatically activate an EX Chain! This allows party members with SCLM activated to launch a simultaneous attack that will also impact nearby enemies, dealing massive damage.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Chapters</strong> – Van and his collaborators will not always travel together during the events of Trails through Daybreak II. At times, some of the group may split off in order to take care of tasks in different areas of Calvard concurrently. Because of this, each act contains multiple chapters you can play in any order. Progress the story in the order you choose! Each chapter features a different cast of characters as we see their side of the act’s story play out. Once you’ve completed your chosen chapter, the next one will start up automatically.</li><li><strong>Unique Missions</strong> – Certain chapters will feature missions that utilize the unique skillsets of the characters in that chapter’s party. For example, directly controlling the holo core AI, <a title="Games > Mare" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mare">Mare</a>, to hack the orbal network, or using Swin to silently tail a suspicious individual.</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Van Arkride</strong> – The man at the head of Arkride Solutions. A lover of sweets, saunas, and orbal cars. Due to his job as a spriggan, Van has a tendency to take on legally-questionable jobs. However, the fact that he occasionally walks on the edge of the law does not preclude him from doing good by others—as is evidenced by his numerous personal contacts. While tracking down the Oct-Geneses at Agnes’ request, Van developed the ability to transform into an armored form known as the Grendel with the help of Mare, the holo core installed within his combat orbment. It was with this new ability that he was able to fend off the mafia group known as Almata. Having once terrorized the entirety of the Republic, Almata was eventually brought to its knees by the Arkride Solutions team during the fight for the Oct-Geneses. Upon the quelling of this threat, however, they decided to temporarily go their separate ways. Now left to himself in a less-than- lively office, Van is free to return to his lone-wolf lifestyle once more.</li><li><strong>Agnes Claudel</strong> – A first-year at the prestigious Aramis Academy who currently serves on its Student Council. Despite her polite manner of speaking and at times meek demeanor, Agnes has shown great strength and determination while employed at Arkride Solutions—especially when facing off against the seedy underbelly of society. Agnes first met Van while searching for eight prototype orbments known as the Oct-Geneses, which she inherited from her great-grandfather. As thanks for taking on her request, she began working as one of Arkride Solution’s part-time assistants. At present, Agnes has recovered seven of the eight Geneses. Unfortunately, while continuing her search for the last remaining Genesis, she’s had no choice but to also divide her time between preparing for the Aramis Academy Festival and periodically helping out around Arkride Solutions. Regarding her relationship with Van, she both respects and admires him as her employer. However, she seems to be harboring some more amorous feelings for him as well…</li><li><strong>Elaine Auclair</strong> – An A-rank bracer affiliated with the Calvard branch of the Bracer Guild. She is occasionally referred to by the moniker “Beauty’s Blade.” Due to her dignified beauty and masterful skill with a sword, Elaine tends to catch the eye of the media more often than not. Unfortunately, this also leads to talent agencies offering her contracts for modeling and acting—she always declines. Outside of being the poster girl for the Bracer Guild, Elaine has no present interest in joining the world of entertainment. During her high school years, she enjoyed a brief and fleeting romance with Van before he suddenly vanished without so much as a word. It was only recently, after seven years, that the two were able to reunite. Although their lingering feelings for each other have left their current relationship a bit tense, their time fighting Almata together was able to strengthen their bond once more. Some time after the events involving Almata and the Oct-Geneses, Elaine received word that the Central Intelligence Department’s elite Gamma Squad had been brutally murdered by an unknown assailant, and that a ‘crimson’ monster was spotted at the scene of the crime…</li></ul><p><strong>World</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Republic of Calvard</strong> – A large country located in the central region of the Zemurian continent. Its current leader is President Roy Gramheart. Due to the unfortunate circumstances created by the desertification of eastern Zemuria, Calvard has a substantial history of receiving both immigrants and refugees. The resulting mixture of cultures and ethnicities has made the country into something of a melting pot. One hundred years ago, Calvard was under the heel of its monarchal rulers. It was only after Sheena Dirke and her compatriots brought about a democratic revolution that the nation was transformed into a democratic republic. Though in constant conflict with Erebonia over the control of bordering regions, Calvard has recently been on the receiving end of reparations from the empire following the Battle of Jormungandr. These reparations enabled Calvard to enter a period of rapid growth and development, leading to its eventual overtake of Erebonia as the most powerful nation on the continent. Regarding the region’s recreational interests, recent technological advancements in orbal vehicles and filmmaking have caused a boom in both the motorsports and orbal cinema industries.</li><li><strong>Messeldam</strong> – A moderate-sized city located in the north of Calvard. Due to its long-standing role as one of the Northern Sea’s major trading ports, Messeldam was often tasked during the days of monarchal rule with the delivery of imports to the capital of Oracion—along with fresh seafood, of course. Although the port remains active to this day, developments in airship technology have greatly diminished its significance. The city itself, however, remains an important gateway to Remiferia and its surrounding nations. Unlike Langport, Messeldam possesses very few tourist destinations. That being said, the townscape’s architecture tends to be quite popular with visitors, as its design has seen little change in the past century. The city’s Eastern and Central Eastern populations are fairly meager due to its geographical location. As such, it lacks a community that values cultural traditionalism. This has, fortunately, been a boon for Messeldam, as new art movements and customs are accepted with relative ease. It was this very attitude that led to the city serving as the venue for the Orbal Film Festival for a number of years, until its relocation to Tharbad in 1208.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Western Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Trails through Daybreak II -  Release Date Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPowp3vGuz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bandai Namco is reportedly cutting its Japanese workforce and cancelling a number of projects due to lacklustre demand.</p>
<p>The news comes as the company reports huge sales of its latest anime game release Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! Zero.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> has reported, staff are not being directly laid off. Instead, since April around 200 of the roughly 1300 staff at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bandai-namco-studios">Bandai Namco Studios</a> in Japan have been sent to rooms with nothing to do, putting pressure on them to leave voluntarily. Almost 100 people have resigned in this manner, according to Bloomberg sources.</p>

<p>These rooms are known as oidashi beya and are utilised due to strict labour laws in Japan. Many employees use these rooms to job hunt before leaving voluntarily.</p>
<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, Bandai Namco denied the use of these rooms.</p>
<p>"Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation. Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge," said a representative from Bandai Namco. "There is no organisation like an 'oidashi beya' at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily."</p>
<p>Bandai Namco has overhauled its game lineup, resulting in 21 billion yen in writedowns (£107m) in the three quarters leading to December.</p>
<p>The likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Japan-only MMORPG Blue Protocol was cancelled in August</a>, ahead of its Amazon Games published worldwide release. Mobile game Tales of the Rays was also shut down in July in Japan.</p>
<p>Reportedly, several other projects have been cancelled or paused, including based on popular anime Naruto and One Piece, and a project commissioned by Nintendo.</p>
<p>The news follows the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> last week, also based on a popular anime, which sold more than 3m units in its first 24 hours on sale. On <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/">Steam</a> it's already reached a peak concurrent player count of over 122k players, with plenty more players across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It’s party time in party plaza with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and what promises to be the biggest Mario Party game ever. Following the ups and downs of their last few attempts, before the fan-pleasing throwback of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/28/mario-party-superstars-review/">Mario Party Superstars</a>, Nintendo Cube is sticking to the tried and true. That doesn’t mean there isn’t space for new ideas, and modes that answer some niche requests from the community, though.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Party Jamboree – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKR6sdcO4ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The basics of Mario Party are here.&nbsp;Dice roll up to 10, Stars cost 20 coins, and some of the boards –&nbsp;there’s five new and two remakes –&nbsp;can initially boggle the mind with complex routes and events that completely upend all your plans.</p>


<p>Wiggler’s Tree Party is a nice and simple beginners board, leading pleasantly into the twinned routes and karting theme of Roll ’em Raceway. It gets much trickier for Goomba Lagoon, with high and low tides that can trap you in a corner of the map going in the loop –&nbsp;this is a really frustrating point on this map, to be honest –&nbsp;and the shopping mall themed Rainbow Galleria is a maze of multiple levels with a half-price shopping event, stamps to collect and more. That’s my favourite.</p>
<p>Western Land and Mario’s Rainbow Castle have been remade as unlockables, and then there’s a seventh map to make this the biggest Mario Party since the first one!</p>


<p>All of the fundamental Mario Party gameplay tropes are here, with a familiar core set of items. But there’s also a bunch of new and returning items, such as the Bowser Phone and Cellular Shopper from Mario Party 3, a cheaper regular pipe with random movement, payday dice that give you coins to match your move, and trap items that can steal from your opponents. I feel there’s a good balance here that gives more options to quickly get somewhere else, though without always having control over where you go.</p>
<p>New for this game are the Jamboree Buddies, adapting the Ally system from Super Mario Party. These characters will randomly appear on the map and will give a major boost to any character that gets them for three turns, always double whatever your landing space offers (good or bad) as well as a character-specific perk. Mario as a buddy adds extra movement, Peach makes stars costs less, Waluigi can steal coins from opponents you run past, and so on.</p>

<p>You have to get to them within a few turns though, and that triggers a bespoke Showdown minigame with the player to initiate the challenge having a starting bonus to earn them, so it’s more about skill than dice rolls. One strange decision is that another player can steal a buddy if they pass you on the board, which can rip that advantage away from you if everyone’s in a similar spot. It can too easily nullify having earnt a buddy –&nbsp;especially Waluigi and Yoshi where you have to pass an opponent to trigger their ability – and maybe a quick rock-paper-scissors game might make this feel more fair.</p>
<p>One of the defining characteristics of a Mario Party session is the randomised nonsense that bonus stars, invisible blocks and more spin out. If that’s something that grates with you, then the new Pro Rules will help to lift a good chunk of the most egregious randomisation, paring back some (but not all) of the possibilities to make for a more predictable and consistent competitive game. You know what the bonus star is for ahead of time, special spaces now have defined outcomes, shops have limited and specific items, and potential star spaces are marked out so you can plan ahead with a Chomp Call in your back pocket. It’s good to have, but I gravitated back towards the shenanigans of the regular Mario Party.</p>

		
		

<p>Of course, so much of Mario Party is about the minigames, and Jamboree has a very broad set of games to play – it promises the largest selection of minigames ever, though a bunch of those are specific to certain modes, and it won’t take long before you’re seeing them repeat. As in the last few games, you can practice before you play, to help even the playing field for newcomers, and there’s a good mix of games that generally play with familiar ideas and themes. There’s a bit of social deduction and fake outs, a bit of luck, a bit of skill, a smattering of motion games amongst the predominantly button games (so you can play without motion and not feel short changed).</p>
<p>If you just want minigames and not a 90+ minute board game, Minigame Bay has a bunch of ways to dip in for a few quick games. Whether playing solo, taking on daily challenges, or with a full set of players, it’s a good quick alternative to dip into. Outside of the main Mario Party and minigame modes, Super Mario Party Jamboree throws a bunch of other ideas up at the wall to see what sticks.</p>
<p>Paratrooper Flight School has you extending your arms out and flapping and tilting the Joy-Con to fly around a few sky islands. There’s a two player battle mode, a co-op mode and a free flight mode, all of which will make your puny arms feel like they’re about to fall off. Toad’s Item Factory is then a quirky little puzzle game where you move world items to get a ball through a stage, and Rhythm Kitchen is a co-op rhythm mode with vegetable digging, chopping and more. They’re all kind of just fine, playable with real people or AI. Little diversions from the endless tirade of board games and minigames elsewhere.</p>

		</div>

<p>A bit more successful is the Party Planner Trek. This mode sends you off to the various game boards to help set things up, freely meandering around the map and chatting to Toads, Goombas and a bunch of player characters, who might then ask you to find an item they’ve lost or take on a minigame challenge. You’re collecting Mini Stars through this, which builds up to a big event once you have enough, before you can visit the next stage. It’s a nice, fairly chilled out way to get the lay of the land, and learn some of the minigames. By its nature, that makes it much better suited to younger players, while old hands probably want to get their minigame time in with the main modes.</p>
<p>In addition to full online Mario Party and minigame modes, there’s also a pair of standalone online modes that are all about larger multiplayer groups. Koopathlon is a big minigame race where up to 20 players rush to collect coins as quickly as possible in individual games, each coin moving you around a track one space, with every fourth game being a 20-player Bowser survival minigame, where you can end up losing places.</p>

<p>Then there’s the eight player Bowser Kaboom Squad, with a Kaiju-sized Bowser stomping around a map as you all race to collect bombs, bring them to a cannon and fire them at Bowser. Every once in a while you get a co-op minigame, rewarding you with items to help build up to the final damage phase to win.</p>
<p>We only got to try these online modes at an in-person preview event, but they’re a good bit of fun if you want a larger mode to dip into. Bowser Kaboom Squad has some clunky controls with a single Joy-Con in hand, trying to navigate 3D space without real camera controls.</p>

<p>Oh, and since I complained that it had disappeared with Mario Party Superstars, I’m happy to confirm that the little jingle that your Joy-Con plays with HD Rumble has returned for Jamboree.</p>

			<p>Three PC games launching soon have been confirmed to feature NVIDIA DLSS 3 support. The first and arguably most anticipated is MechWarrior 5: Clans from Piranha Games. Due to launch on Thursday, October 17, MechWarrior 5: Clans is powered by Unreal Engine 5. In our interview from GDC 2024, Piranha Games CEO Russ Bullock <a href="https://wccftech.com/mechwarrior-5-clans-takes-full-advantage-of-unreal-engine-5-finally-ships-with-great-controller-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>In every way we possibly can. Thankfully, we really leveraged almost all the new toys in there. There's a full MetaHuman base with heavy customization of the models to our needs, a full motion capture of cinematics, and then you've got the world itself.</em></p>
<p><em>We've gone with full Nanite and Lumen, all the destructible are based on Chaos. We use World Partition. We've pretty much activated and used all the fancy new stuff at this point. It definitely makes the game look a lot better. Even in the last month, as we brought more and more of these things online, it's just gotten better and better. We're really happy we made the upgrade from UE4 to 5.</em></p>
<p>On the same day, PC gamers will be able to check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-launches-17-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Quiet Place: Road Ahead</a> with NVIDIA DLSS 3 and DLAA support. Developed by Stormind Games, the Italian studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remothered-broken-porcelain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/batora-lost-haven-bathing-in-shadows-to-reach-dim-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batora: Lost Haven</a>, A Quiet Place: Road Ahead is a single player horror adventure game set in the world created by Jon Krasinski for the acclaimed movies. In this spin-off, players will go through the journey of a young woman as she navigates the alien apocalypse amidst interpersonal family conflict, all while coming to terms with her own inner fears.</p>
<p>Lastly, the cel-shaded single player action first-person shooter game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272250/Forgive_Me_Father_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forgive Me Father 2</a> will exit early access on Thursday, October 24, and get NVIDIA DLSS 3, DLAA, and AMD FSR 3 support. In a world inspired by Lovecraft, the player must fight through hordes of nightmares to restore their sanity.</p>

			<p>Japanese publisher Bandai Namco recently started reducing its workforce following the cancellation of several titles due to low demand, and it is doing so using a very Japanese method.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a>, the company is attempting to reduce staff by sending workers to rooms where they are given nothing to do so as to put pressure on them and make them leave voluntarily. Since April, 200 employees have been moved to such rooms, and 100 have already resigned, with more expecting to leave the publisher in the coming months, according to people familiar with the matter who wished not to be named.</p>
<p>A Bandai Namco representative commented on the report, saying that their <em>" decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation. Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge. There is no organization like an 'oidashi beya' at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily"</em></p>
<p>In other news, Bandai Namco is enjoying great success with the release of Dragon Ball SPARKING! Zero, which sold<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-has-sold-3-million-units-in-one-day/"> 3 million units in just a single day</a>. This is hardly surprising, considering how popular Dragon Ball continues to be and the game's high quality. The game is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-games-advantage-hardware-cross-gen-long-time/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It will likely take a while to see the release of PlayStation 6 games that fully take advantage of the new hardware, as the cross-generation period is likely to last a very long time for a few important reasons.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on the next-generation console by Sony, highlighting how, no matter what the system may offer, it will take some time to see games that take advantage of its hardware to the fullest, as the cross-generation period that will see games also releasing on PlayStation 5 will last a very long time. The length of the next cross-gen period will be caused by the cost of making software and the returns publishers expect from such investments. It wouldn't make any sense to release a triple-A game that cost over $100 million to make 1, 2 million to early adopters in the first year, and, as such, we should expect games to also be released on PlayStation 5 for a very long time.</p>
<p>During this week's episode of the podcast, Digital Foundry also commented on the PlayStation 6 hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-need-playstation-5-pro-to-deliver/">reiterating</a> that while it is too early to be sure of anything, it's likely that the console will go all-in AI-powered features. The PlayStation 5 Pro, with its AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, is likely being released to let developers get accustomed to AI features, which are likely going to be predominant in the next-generation system, considering how the days of simply increasing GPU size to offer better visuals and performance at a reasonable cost seem to be over, considering the limited GPU improvements the PS5 Pro has over the base model, compared to the PS4 Pro over the base PS4.</p>

<p>As of now, nothing is known about the PlayStation 6 other than&nbsp;<span>that it will be powered by AMD once again. Intel also bid to design the console but&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost to AMD in 2022</a> because the company could not</span>&nbsp;settle on a price.</p>

We had a chance to sit down and hear from <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5de03d1-d8cd-419d-8918-561c018bd3c0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins">Chris Perkins</a>, Creative Director, and James Wyatt, Principal Game Designer, about all of the changes that will be coming to the DMG and how the team of designers at Wizards of the Coast took on the feedback about 2014's Dungeon Master Guide and sought to improve it in every way.</p>
<p>Before diving into the contents of the new book Perkins and Wyatt took a moment to explain the influences that led to the changes we were to hear about. It began with the explanation that there was a lot of feedback that they heard from players, and that they had collected internally, about the 2014 Dungeon Master's Guide and how there were very easy-to-understand issues with it. From my own personal experience, a book about DMing beginning with the greater cosmology of the world instead of how to run a game was a bit confusing and represented a top-down approach, with more granularity being added as you proceed, the 2024 DMG will flip this on its head.</p>

Perkins also stressed that the tips here for DMs are "Designed by DMs for DMs", this advice is the tried and true kind that should help show that D&amp;D doesn't need to be a labour but can be efficiently set up and executed.</p>
<h2>Dungeon Master's Guide 2024 Chapter List</h2>
<p>As we were about to get walked through each chapter of the book we were provided a list of all chapters and appendices.</p>
<p>1. The Basics<br>
2. Running The Game<br>
3. DM's Toolbox<br>
4. Adventures<br>
5. Campaigns<br>
6. Cosmology<br>
7. Treasure<br>
8. Bastions<br>
A) Lore Glossary<br>
B) Maps</p>
<p>Alongside all of the above chapters and their contents there is also a collection of tracking sheets for campaigns, to help the DM structure how they might want to record major events and relationships that occur. While Appendix B is about a number of varied maps to be used for combat there is also a double-sided map of Greyhawk, one side showing the World of Greyhawk while the other details the City. This map will lend aid to the additional information about Greyhawk that will be available in the Adventures and Campaigns sections of the DMG.</p>
<h2>Let's Start With The Basics</h2>
<p>The DMG is meant to be a guide for all. It's for the new DMs as well as for the old. This chapter goes over what it's like to be a DM, just like in the PHB there will be scripts illustrating the kind of back-and-forth that might happen between the DM and the Player. Wyatt explained that this will also be expanded to include what a DM might be thinking as something is going on.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-dungeon-master-guide-how-to-dm.jpg?itok=902zOQq1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-dungeon-master-guide-how-to-dm.jpg?itok=HQi6huf2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There is even a section about learning via watching, highlighting the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dc0a217-e28f-4919-887d-2ef0511e836a" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/taliesin-jaffe-talks-asha-of-critical-role-downfall-monk-builds-and-what-ashton">prevalence of streamed and live D&amp;D events</a> that are readily available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You don't have to be Chris Perkins to be a good DM for you group, you need to facilitate your table" - Wyatt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Focus was also put on how to make sure that all players are having fun, and that it's a safe game.</p>
<h2>Running the Game</h2>
<p>This section goes over how to engage with players and understand their tastes, sorting out a manageable group size, working with multiple DMs and a variety of other tips for making sure that the game you're running is what's best for the players involved.</p>
<p>This is also where mechanics such as social interactions, exploration, combat, and character advancement are underlined. If it has to do with something the player will have agency over then this is the chapter that will cover it.</p>
<p>Perkins hopped in to highlight that each of the elements that they've added here is advice that's tried and true from DMs and is meant to help uplift new DMs.</p>
<p>Tracking sheets allow for DMs to keep track of a journal of the events, the growth of a settlement, and even one that highlights campaign conflicts. This isn't just meant to be a way for a DM to take record, but also a way to prompt the DM to think about more going on in their world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If everyone is having fun, you're playing D&amp;D right" - Perkins</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A DM's Toolbox Is Meant To Be By Their Side</h2>
<p>This portion of the book is going to be the place that a DM will flip to in the moment in game, or even when preparing their sections. We were shown a massive list of topics that each have a page or more including but not limited to Chases, Death, Environmental Effects, Firearms &amp; Explosives, Hazards, Mobs, Poison, Settlements, and Traps.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-dungeon-master-guide-dm-toolbox.jpg?itok=MMtpSyqZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-dungeon-master-guide-dm-toolbox.jpg?itok=a40JD_E1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For when you're wanting to add spice to your next session, or are working to find an element to center your next one-shot around this section is intended to be open and at your side.</p>
<h2>Adventures and Campaigns</h2>
<p>An interesting aspect of the new DMG is that it will break out creating not only a full campaign, but also adventures for a smaller scale.</p>
<p>This means it's about teaching the player how to make efficient notes that a DM can have in front of them to run a session, as opposed to a curated 30+ page adventure that WOTC would publish themselves.</p>
<p>There are also 5 sample adventures that are 0.5-1 pages in length and model how you can craft a full adventure in a compact format. This will be an adventure you can drop right into with players in the situation where one or two players can't make it for their full campaign.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm hoping that a lot of new DMs will look at these adventures and see it's not hard" - Perkins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving into talking Campaigns, Perkins really wanted to get across that crafting a campaign is like creating an adventure but instead of an Adventure being made of a few encounters, a Campaign is just created from a few Adventures.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cleric-bastion_noor-rahman.jpg?itok=JYce_8vE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cleric-bastion_noor-rahman.jpg?itok=2TE5Mbtw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Adventure and Campaign sections will be very similar it's just the scale with which they're carried out.</p>
<p>An aspect of the creation of the Campaign in the new DMG will also be at the hands of the players. Whether they're making different decisions, or see something more interesting off the beaten path, there's also a lot here about how the DM can make the player's help them steer the campaign in a way that's interesting to them.</p>
<p>The sample campaign, Greyhawk, will be able to be used with the example adventures. These adventures – at level 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 – will be standalone but are also able to weave together to created a grander Greyhawk narrative. In working to teach DMs how easy it is to move things around there will also be suggestions for how these adventures could occur in places other than Greyhawk.</p>
<p>Maps are included that can be versatile in use (15 in total) and some will be used in the adventures, but others will not be so a DM can use them as they wish. They wanted the maps to be interesting, but also simple enough to promote a DM to have the idea that they can create a map like it themselves.</p>
<p>Colorized versions will be available in the D&amp;D Maps tool, but the more simplistic/black and white versions can be found in the book.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-dungeon-master-guide-bastions.jpg?itok=MQWcapke 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-dungeon-master-guide-bastions.jpg?itok=GlzILUt4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Bastions</h2>
<p>Bastions are a concept already used in D&amp;D in the past but they wanted to bring it back. Is intended as a way to make downtime a more enjoyable activity. "The player can play an invaluable role in creating content for a campaign that the DM doesn't have to be the only one inventing things" and that's where the idea of the Bastion's as a way to let the Player take custody of a part of the world and make it the guiding force.</p>
<p>In wanting to realize this in the game Perkins explained that what they settled on was simple. If the Players and DM decide that Bastions work well in the campaign then they can include them at Level 5. The Bastion is essentially a home base, and while the artworks shown were impressive Perkins highlighted that it could be something as simple as an attic or a house.</p>
<p>There are different facilities that you'll unlock as you level up allowing you to shape it to your whim. These are sanctuaries.</p>
<h2>Combat Encounters and Tables</h2>
<p>While only briefly brought up Perkins did want to reinforce that the Combat Encounter instruction, something many have long scrutinized, has also been "turned on it's head." The previously multiple pages have been condensed into a single page for efficiency and greater understanding. Perkins reassured that just because there's less in terms of wordcount it will be better at assisting DMs in creating encounters for any challenge.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-dungeon-master-guide-adventure-situations.jpg?itok=NaTsUjI8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-dungeon-master-guide-adventure-situations.jpg?itok=RBBaipB9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Creating a variety of challenges will also be possible with a number of tables that will be included meant to assist DMs by allowing them to roll, or by just prompting their creativity. While we didn't see too much of tables what we did see was grouped "Adventure Situations" for levels 1-4 and 5-10. It was also confirmed that there will be similar tables for higher level play addressing the longstanding criticism of nothing for endgame players published officially.</p>
<h2>Rules for Crafting</h2>
<p>The crafting of magical items and potions was something covered in the 2024 PHB but will be further expanded upon with the release of the DMG. Here are rules that expand the magic item creation rules even further. They'll be in the Treasure portion of the DMG before the list of Magic Items. The only items that you can't create are artifacts because the way to create those has been lost to time.</p>
<p>If your players have the time and money as well as the interest in creating items of power for themselves then this is where you'll be able to find a balanced approach for players to follow.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DM Screen</h2>
<p>Lastly, information was shared about the DM screen that will be available alongside the 2024 Dungeon Master Guide.&nbsp;The info on it has been revised for the 2024 rules, not only that but there are also visual improvements. The team worked with UI consultants who helped create a better layout and improve it. Text size is much larger so it can be read at a distance (especially good for those of us with poor eyesight).</p>
<p>A major change has also come with the advent of so many DMs running games with Laptops open that block crucial information in the center spaces of the DM screen. The center panels of the DM screen will now include information that the designers expect most DMs will already know but may need to reference less often leaving the most frequently used information to be on the side panels and more readily accessible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, the latest game in the <i>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</i>series of fighting games, has crossed a major sales milestone within just 24 hours on sale, according to publisher Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>In a press release, the publisher confirms that&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has hit three million sales just a day after launching around the world, which is a pretty impressive milestone indeed.</p>
<p>As pointed out by analyst MauroNL <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1846143690831466603" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the game has already surpassed&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>, which took around a week to ship two million units. It's also beaten the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>&nbsp;</em>(a million in five days) and&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>(three million in three months).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-interstitial.jpg?itok=a5Mpu403 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-interstitial.jpg?itok=7rCMPPfi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>sales have been pretty strong.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's behind this surge in sales for the latest&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>game? Well, there are likely a number of factors at play. For one thing, this is the first game in the&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>series for over fifteen years, so there's a degree of excitement around a long-dormant sub-franchise being revived.</p>
<p>Our local&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>expert Andrew Stretch also pointed out to me that&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is targeted at a less hardcore demographic when it comes to fighting games.</p>
<p>The power imbalances at play between characters suggest that while&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>probably won't have much of an esports presence, it's likely to be more popular among casual fans.</p>
<p>This is also the first one-on-one&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighter for six years, and its colossal roster and wealth of gameplay modes arguably make it the definitive&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighting game, albeit perhaps not the most technically complex.</p>
<p>Given that it achieved the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut">best Steam debut ever at launch</a>, the strong performance of&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>perhaps shouldn't come as a surprise, but it'll be a boon for Bandai Namco, at any rate.</p>

            <p>
Last October, Paradox Interactive announced that they and development studio Harebrained Schemes were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">breaking up</a>, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pulpy-xcom-a-like-lamplighters-league-written-off-as-a-big-disappointment-and-22m-loss-by-publisher-just-a-week-after-release">underwhelming sales</a> of Harebrained's 1930s-set XCOMlike, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lamplighters-league">The Lamplighters League</a>. The publishers had already made layoffs at Harebrained in the run-up to release, implying that preorder numbers were low; ultimately, Paradox wrote it off as a $22 million flop. At the time of the "parting of ways", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans". 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
We ourselves were mixed on The Lamplighters League. "A strong turn-based foundation and colourful setting held back by grind, blind chance, and a need for efficiency over tactical variety," was Sin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lamplighters-league-review">verdict</a>. But other outlets were more enthused, and the Steam user review consensus <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167750/The_Lamplighters_League/">remains positive</a>, even now that Paradox have yanked support. When I spoke to deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">Paradox's Media Day </a>earlier this month, I had to ask about the game's fortunes, and Paradox's decision to steer away from XCOMlikes in future.
</p>
<p>
"I can start with how we see the reality of that game, or the reality of that genre," Lilja told me. "When we started [that project], we read it as a fairly lively genre, where there were many games, tactical games that could coexist. We often think in terms of, who's the number one in the genre, what does it mean to be number two or number three, and if you're number three, is that still a viable option for the long term? If it is, maybe you want to go there - you're not going to be number one, but maybe number three or four or five, whatever.
</p>
<p>
"When we released The Lamplighters League, it quickly became very obvious to us that this was not the game that people wanted, and we were not going to be able to save it," he went on. "It was reviewed OK - I liked it too. But it was not an audience of any size that would mean this would be sustainable for a long time." 
</p><p>
(For context, Paradox are in the habit of publishing games you can play for years, even decades, with lashings of DLC and free updates. This business model, which pre-dates Steam's early access format, has led to some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">consternation</a> among players regarding how many resources the developers set aside for paid DLC, versus the main game.)
</p>
<p>
"We're starting to see that there might be maybe a second place, but there's no third - there might not even be a second place in the tactical gaming space," Lilja continued. "So maybe there is only one game. There are certain genres that are like that. They have one game and everybody else is sort of not catching up or finding a viable existence, as the second choice in this genre." 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/the_lamplighters_league_4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Paradox had strong suspicions that The Lamplighters League would flop, Lilja confirmed, based on preorder numbers. As such, the apparently mutual decision to split with Harebrained came about pretty quickly after release.
</p>
<p>
"The game was basically commercially dead on arrival," Lilja commented. "And the studio, this is what they do. And it is very specific, what people are good at in [games development] - certain talents, you can move, but the core team of a game is really hard to pivot to something else. They're not going to be very good at it.
</p><p>
"And it's the same with the grand strategy people - they're probably not going to be very good at other genres, either.  So it is quite specific, the understanding of [these games] - they're such complex products, and you know them specifically. So we were in a position, where we said we can't use this team effectively, and they were like, we want to do what we're good at. So good, let's go our separate ways. 
</p>
<p>
"And the decision happened really quickly at launch. We can cheat a bit by looking at pre-orders.  It's very rare that game has low pre-orders and then takes off at launch. We have not seen it, somebody else might have. The opposite might be more true - good pre-orders, but then weaker sales post-launch, that could happen if you have a very niche product.
</p>
<p>
"So we we quickly came to an agreement with the devs that we needed to go set our separate ways. We're not going to invest more in this type of game, and they wanted to make more of these."
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, I'd have liked Lilja to spell out is what precisely he means by "the tactical gaming space", which obviously encompasses a bundle of subgenres and approaches, not least Japanese tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> such as Final Fantasy Tactics. I did clarify with him that by "number one" in the genre he meant XCOM. It's also worth noting that if Harebrained have a reputation for tactical games, they aren't just in the business of XCOMlikes - their previous project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battletech">Battletech</a>, is a different kettle of mechafish entirely.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
One thing I did raise is that The Lamplighters League isn't Paradox's first stab at publishing an XCOM-style tactics game with that particular combination of grid- and turn-based combat. The company's past dalliances with the format include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-sin">Empire Of Sin</a> from Romero Games, which released in 2020. Our reviewer Tom Senior <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/empire-of-sin-review">called it</a> "a wonderfully ambitious mashup of systems wrapped around a lovely, if extremely cliched, caricature of the golden age of gangster fiction", with some significant flaws born of said mashing-up, and far too many bugs.
</p>
<p>
Paradox <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/year-end-report-2020">deemed themselves "not satisfied" with Empire Of Sin at launch</a>, though the disappointment was masked by 2020 being "the best year in Paradox's history". So why did they keep trying with the XCOMlike in its wake? 
</p>
<p>
"There we messed up the execution, quite a lot," Lilja told me. "The Lamplighters League was a competently made game, decently reviewed, and it did work. The fact that Empire Of Sin didn't work was kind of obvious, unfortunately, and that was also on us. So it didn't say anything about the market, really. It just said that if you don't make a good game, you're not going to fly in any genre. We might have may read that wrong but yeah, we didn't release a good game, and that is always punished."
</p><p>
Speaking as a fan of yer XCOMs, to say nothing of yer Gears Tacticses and yer Mutant: Year Zeroes, I find the idea that there is precious little appetite for games comparable to XCOM distressing. Is this really more than a gut response from Paradox, and if so, how do they explain the situation? Is the audience for such games just too small, or are people overly wedded to XCOM, a series which hasn't received a fresh instalment since 2016?
</p>
<p>
"Execution is everything," Lilja reiterated. "That's the logic that I'm trying to refer to. So maybe there's XCOM and nothing else. Or somebody else makes a [successful XCOM-style game] and I look like an idiot, but right now, that's our thinking."

Paradox's chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus offered similar arguments later that day, when I asked for his thoughts on Lilja's assessment of "the tactical gaming space".
</p>
<p>
"I don't have data on this, but it's my distinct feeling that for this target demographic, it's winner takes all," he said. "We need to - well, we don't need to, but we should look at why that is. Because it seems to me that the survival crafting genre, for example, is infinitely big. But turn-based tactical? It seems to be more 'number one or nothing'.
</p><p>
"Then again, I like other turn-based tactical games, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phoenix-point">Phoenix Point</a>," he added. "But there seems to be something to that. It would be interesting to delve into that. For what it is, I think Lamplighters League is a good game."
</p>
<p>
The ray of hope here is that Harebrained Schemes are still alive and kicking. Their first post-Paradox project, Graft, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadowrun-and-battletech-creators-unveil-cyberpunk-horror-rpg-set-on-a-dying-space-station-where-upgrades-change-your-personality">looks splendiferous</a>. It takes place in  a "dying space station" and has you willingly or inadvertently modifying your own personality by plugging in cybernetic implants laced with the memories of their previous owners. It's also, as some readers noticed, a real-time game. Fingers crossed that this isn't an early indication of a great dearth of XCOMlikes to come.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Black Ops Story So Far Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The developer's goal for Black Ops 6 audio is to create a more "purposeful and directional soundscape" that focuses on the information players need, while reducing the clutter of extraneous noise. More specifically, the team has been focused on distant firing sounds, giving players information on directionality, distance, and threat level so they can more easily identify where their enemy is firing from.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch achieved part of this by working with Microsoft Project Acoustics to make more realistic and immersive sound for Black Ops 6. As shown in <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1845887545135026297" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>'s clip below, the characters' voice-lines now echo and carry through the environment for a more realistic sound.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1845887545135026297" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">NEW: Audio updates in Black Ops 6<br>Treyarch worked with Microsoft Project Acoustics, voice lines now echo and carry through hallways, alleys, and more to sound more realistic. Listen with headphones to the video. <a href="https://t.co/qoeWol9Ojj" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/qoeWol9Ojj</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1845887545135026297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"We want to make sure that the soundscape in this game will adapt to each player as they play, creating a living and breathing play space,” says Treyarch's lead audio designer Collin Ayers.</p><p dir="ltr">Expert audio engineer William Cornell elaborates by saying, "Players will hear gunshots and grenades that realistically fill the space around them. Footsteps will echo down long hallways."</p><p dir="ltr">Greater immersion is also added to Black Ops 6 with the use of Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) technology to better simulate how sound is transferred from the game world to a player's ears. Cornell explains by saying, "HRTF emulates the way that sounds are affected by the shape of your head and your ears before you actually hear them. It's the gold standard for maximizing directional perception when you're listening on headphones."</p><p dir="ltr">An advanced headphone mode for the game makes use of HRTF and Immerse Spatial Audio technology to increase the directional accuracy of sounds played in the world. The developer says Immerse Spatial Audio is compatible with any headphone or earbud model and greatly improves the player's spatial audio experience. This new mode will be available in Black Ops 6 at launch. Optionally, players can also choose to enhance this HRTF experience even further by creating a personalized profile that takes into account their physical attributes, such as the shape of their ear or head.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also works to provide more audio accessibility options with Black Ops 6, including the Reduce Tinnitus Sound setting. This new audio setting will replace the sound from concussion and flash grenade shellshock with a dimmer audio cue to help people who suffer from tinnitus, a condition that causes ringing or other sound to be present in one or both ears without any external audio source present.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure to check out the blog post to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-dynamic-soundscape-audio-intel" rel="nofollow ">hear more of the audio samples</a> given for Black Ops 6's footsteps and character voice-lines.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/" data-ref-id="1100-6524072">Black Ops 6</a> releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24270606/2004-week-tech-internet-gadgets-phones-pop-culture<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In early 2004, the world was shaking it like a Polaroid picture, flocking to theaters to see what was going to happen with all those hobbits, and wondering if that Tom Brady guy was something special. Meanwhile, a few folks around the world were inventing the web as we know it now: a world-shaking social network was brewing in a Harvard dorm room. A Google employee was dreaming up the future of email in their spare time. The coolest cellphone of all time was just about to drop. The internet was still a niche activity, but that was about to change — and fast.</p><p>In so many ways, the digital world in which we now all live was created 20 years ago. Google went public and began to ascend to rule the web. Facebook, Gmail, Firefox, Flickr, and Digg all launched — the year Web 2.0 became the web. “Blog” and “the long tail” were on no one’s radar before 2004, and since then, they’ve been everywhere. The United States went through a contentious election, a bunch of sequels dominated the box office, and Apple launched a new product that looked very cool but was ultimately eclipsed by a better product a year later. Okay, some things never change.</p><p>Every year is a big year in tech, of course, but 2004 was an especially big one. And <em>The Verge </em>didn’t exist yet! So, this week, we’ll have stories on the best and most important gadgets and platforms that launched that year and pieces about the cultural events that still affect the way we live now. Basically, we’re going to blog like it’s 2004.</p><div><p>Our first few stories are up today, covering everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24234678/robot-car-darpa-grand-challenge-2004-autonomous-race">the first robo-car race</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24201021/motorola-razr-v3-design-paris-hilton-2004">the Motorola Razr</a> to the mystery of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24220118/lost-photos-facebook-flickr-digital-cameras">all our missing 2004 photos</a>. There’s also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24238422/podcast-etymology-term-history-tech-vergecast">a special episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a><em> </em>all about the history and future of podcasts, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24209615/digg-internet-web-2-homepage-2004-kevin-rose-interview">an interview with Kevin Rose</a> about Digg’s legacy, and a shockingly hard quiz asking one simple question: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24236611/2004-2024-quiz-trivia-tech-gadgets-pop-culture">did it happen in 2004 or 2024</a>?</p></div><p>We’ll be publishing more 2004 stories and videos all week, and we want to hear all your 2004 memories, too! Share your favorite pictures from that year, your favorite 20-year-old gadgets that you wish still worked (or shockingly still do), and anything else you remember from that seminal year in our recent past. We’ll be doing the same. It’s going to be more fun than <em>Shrek 2</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
