<p>DK...Donkey Kong!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're now just weeks out from the smashing arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the Switch 2 and Nintendo has now released a overview trailer.</p>
<p>It uploaded plenty of these in the leadup to key releases during the Switch generation and this trend continues with eight minutes of footage for the new Switch 2 exclusive. It highlights DK and Pauline's abilities, transformations, boss battles, and much more.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind this overview is only available on Nintendo's Japanese YouTube channel at the moment but if we get an English version, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we also shared our final preview of Donkey Kong Bananza here on Nintendo Life, and despite some minor technical concerns, his latest adventure is showing all the signs of becoming his greatest outing to date. The game's developer has been confirmed as well.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco ended its latest showcase with another look at <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/digimon_story_time_stranger">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a></strong>. If you were wondering about the possibility of a Nintendo release, there's reportedly been a new development.</p>
<p>As highlighted by multiple sources, a new listing has popped up on the EAN database in Europe which includes a code for an apparent "Switch 2 version". These codes are used by retailers to identify products at sale.</p>

<p>Nothing has been officially announced, so it's probably best to treat this one as a rumour for now. In saying this, Bandai Namco has already got games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> coming to the Switch 2, so it wouldn't be the biggest surprise.</p>
<p>The Switch generation also saw multiple Digimon games released physically and digitally. Digimon Story: Time Stranger is currently confirmed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam, and will launch on these platforms in October.</p>

Inzone Buds offer markedly superior active noise cancellation and use the same audio drivers found in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's flagship 1000XM5 earbuds</a>. That said, Inzone Buds aren't as versatile as GameBuds. You can use the included 2.4GHz USB-C dongle to connect wirelessly on PS5, PC, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, Steam Deck, and mobile devices.</p><hr><p>But when it comes to Bluetooth, Sony went with Bluetooth Low Energy instead of the conventional Bluetooth 5 series (5.3 is common now). The problem with Bluetooth LE is that only a select number of Android phones support it. Apple doesn't use Bluetooth LE, and there aren't any major game consoles that support it either. As a result, Inzone Buds can't double as Bluetooth earbuds for general audio on your iPhone.</p><p>I personally still use Inzone Buds with my iPhone, but just know that you'll need to be cool with having a wireless receiver attached to your USB-C port. This also means you'll want a wireless charger since the receiver occupies your USB-C port. You can get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Wireless-Certified-MagSafe-Compatible/dp/B0DRCSZ618?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">two-pack of Anker wireless chargers</a> for $28 (was $40) at Amazon.

The ROG Cetra does not have ANC, but these stylish Bluetooth earbuds can sync with PS5, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. Asus also has a higher-end model called the Speednova that adds 2.4GHz audio as well as adaptive ANC. But even with a $50 discount, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXRS7BBN?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ROG Cetra Speednova</a> costs more than the Inzone Buds and GameBuds, both of which we'd recommend over the $170 pair from Asus.</p><p>If you'd prefer a traditional over-ear gaming headset, Amazon has deals on a bunch of SteelSeries wireless headsets. Most notably, you can get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0B8QP5BGD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7X universal headset for $146 (was $200)</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/">Mecha Break</a> is an ambitious free-to-play anime mech shooter from Amazing Seasun Games. While Mecha Break's launch this week kicks off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mecha-break-season-0-rain-of-fire-challenges-and-rewards-detailed/1100-6532919/" data-ref-id="1100-6532919">a number of events and the game's first season</a>, it also adds a ton of new modes and features which were unavailable during its feature-limited open beta. The largest addition is a swath of multiplayer modes, ranging from co-op, PvP, and "extraction." A variety of new cosmetics and customization features are also newly available.</p><p>Here's how each of Mecha Break's new multiplayer modes work. In Operation VERGE, you'll battle in 6v6 matches. The first team to complete a map-specific objective--like capturing specific locations or escorting a vehicle--wins. Ace Arena is a 3v3 deathmatch mode, in which teams compete to be the first to kill eight opponents. In this mode, players can switch their mech mid-battle. Operation Storm is Mecha Break's extraction mode, taking place across a massive map called Mashmak. You'll combat both player- and computer-controlled enemies, stealing their loot, and attempting to make it back to a designated extraction point. You can enter Mashmak with a squad of teammates or all on your own. In co-op, you can explore restricted zones: locked areas where you have to fight a boss or complete objectives within a time limit.</p>

Employ repair stations for support during engagements. The first squad to eliminate 8 enemy Strikers wins that round. Achieving victory in 2 of the 3 rounds before the operation ends secures overall victory.</p><p><b>Poseidon Armory</b></p><p>· The Poseidon Armory, an automated Striker factory engineered by Salem Electric Company, utilizes Isles-Vessel technology to navigate secretly in the deep ocean while producing giant Strikers for the Thalassic Federation. Upon discovering the unmanned facility, the Apostles planned to take control by hacking into its nodes to manufacture colossal Strikers for their forces. To counter this, S.H.A.D.O.W. dispatched a squad to safeguard the factory’s three control nodes and prevent the Apostles' scheme.</p><p>· Competing squads must capture and hold three Data Nodes to assume control of the armory. The squad that first completes data transmission or holds the lead when the operation concludes will be declared the winner.</p><p>· Special Environment: Underwater</p><p><b>Stella Observatory Island</b></p><p>· This island, deserted during The Catastrophe due to volcanic activity and Corite contamination, is now targeted by Theia's Vanguard who aim to deploy Corite Extractors. These devices are intended to initiate Corite Pulse Storms, compelling S.H.A.D.O.W. to intervene. To counteract Theia's Vanguard, S.H.A.D.O.W. has dispatched a squad to disable the Corite Extractors.</p><p>· Squads are tasked with dismantling as many Corite Extractors as possible within the designated area. If not dismantled in time, the extractors will activate automatically. The first squad to achieve the dismantling target before the operation concludes will be declared the winner.</p><p><b>Longmen Launch Site</b></p><p>· The Vulturia Alliance has constructed a significant mass accelerator at this location, crucial for its space launch operations. Windrose seeks to exploit this by altering the mass accelerator's automatic launch program to covertly transport bombs, posing as a regular Alliance mission, and coordinating external attacks to destroy the accelerator track. In response, S.H.A.D.O.W. has dispatched a squad to intercept these plans and ensure the correct delivery of the Alliance's space payload.</p><p>· Squads must escort the Transport Vehicle along a designated path to the Launch Site. Capturing and activating three Signal Consoles en route will expedite the vehicle's progress. The first squad to successfully reach the Launch Site before the operation concludes will be declared the winner.</p><p><b>Vigil Imbrium</b></p><p>· Vigil Imbrium, an asteroid defense base operated by the Commonwealth of Lunar-mare, is equipped with missiles and artillery for destroying medium-sized asteroids. Theia's Vanguard detected weak defenses at the base and launched an assault to capture its main turret. In response, the under-resourced Mare-Imbrium Autonomous Region sought assistance from S.H.A.D.O.W. Recognizing a strategic opportunity, S.H.A.D.O.W. decided to neutralize the main turret to eliminate a potential threat to Earth-Moon relations. Their mission is to oust the invaders, secure the base, and decommission the main turret before it can be used.</p><p>· Squads must retrieve Digital Keys from three Data Terminals and upload them to the Main Turret for control. The first squad to successfully complete the upload or maintain the lead as the operation ends will be declared the winner.</p><p>· Special Environment: Lunar Surface, Solar Storms</p><p><b>Babylon Sky Fortress</b></p><p>· To safeguard the orbital elevator, the Thalassic Federation established Babylon Sky Fortress at its midsection, later fortified with airdrop weapons by Windrose under a security contract, escalating regional tensions. S.H.A.D.O.W. is tasked with disarming this threat by swiftly defeating the fortress's garrison forces at each level, neutralizing this heavily fortified position.</p><p>· Squads are required to focus on neutralizing enemy Strikers across 3 rounds. Repair stations are available during combat. The first squad to destroy 8 enemy Strikers secures victory in each round. Achieving two round victories before the operation concludes will result in overall victory.</p><h3><b>#Ace Arena#</b></h3><p><b>Gameplay Overview</b></p><p>· Combat initiates with each side deploying 3 Strikers. Victory is awarded to the first side to secure 8 kills or hold the lead when time expires. In the event of a tie at the end of regulation, the match proceeds to overtime, where the first team to achieve 2 kills wins.</p><p>· Within the Ace Arena, Pilots can strategically switch Strikers after being neutralized, allowing for precise adjustments and rapid counter-strategies in response to the opposing lineup.</p><p>· Designed to challenge Pilots' overall combat skills and adaptability, the maps in Ace Arena evolve as the fight progresses. Modular Weapons and Auxiliary Devices will randomly spawn during combat, enhancing tactical diversity.</p><p><b>Maps</b></p><p>Space Carrier: Trailblazer, Xiling Bunker City, Octantis Industrial Zone, Combat Matrix</p><p><b>Space Carrier: Trailblazer</b></p><p>· The Trailblazer, a vast passenger-cargo transport spacecraft, has been operational since the first Earth-Moon migration. Constructed by early Moon Pioneers using lunar resources, it showcases advanced autonomous construction and material printing technologies. The spacecraft has played a crucial role in transporting immigrants, supporting over a million residents on the Moon, and remains vital for importing essential carbon resources and other supplies.</p><p><b>Xiling Bunker City</b></p><p>· Post-Catastrophe, the Vulturia Alliance constructed the Xiling Bunker City near the ruins of Xiling City to shelter survivors and manage Corite contamination from the Wanshan Mountains. This elevating city can lower its core districts underground and seal itself from pulse storms, effectively shielding residents from their harmful effects.</p><p><b>Octantis Industrial Zone</b></p><p>· Situated on the outskirts of Hermes, a central bay port city on the Moon, the Octantis Industrial Zone was developed by NG Lunar Company. Initially a construction base for the lunar orbital elevator, it has evolved into a key logistics and storage hub for the cislunar route, now operating fully autonomously with no human intervention required.</p><p><b>Combat Matrix</b></p><p>· Originally a practice simulation for the early Ace Arena system, the Combat Matrix allowed users to customize terrain, room settings, and combat conditions. Despite its simplicity, it became popular for organizing training exercises and competitions. Scheduled for deletion, it was preserved due to its popularity among test users.</p><h3><b>#Operation STORM#</b></h3><p><b>Mashmak</b></p><p>· Mashmak is known as the world's largest and most perilous Marcens Zone, producing high-quality Corite with unique properties. This draws numerous factions to the restricted area, fostering a uniquely chaotic environment. After seizing control of Mashmak, Theia's Vanguard deployed Corite Extractors, triggering several massive Corite Pulse Storms that devastated the island strongholds of various factions. Recent intelligence indicates that Theia's Vanguard plans to leverage these storms to provoke a global crisis, coercing major Earth powers into capitulating to their demands. In response, multiple forces, including S.H.A.D.O.W., have deployed squads to counteract this threat. As a S.H.A.D.O.W. operative, remain vigilant of Corite pulse storms and hostile squads while neutralizing Theia's Vanguard and facilitating evacuations.</p><p><b>Gameplay Overview</b></p><p>· Engage and neutralize enemy forces in Mashmak, collect their dropped weapons and supplies, and secure extraction via the designated Extraction Point.</p><p>· Introducing the new combat mission mode in-game. S.H.A.D.O.W. evaluates your squad's performance, difficulty level, team capabilities, airdrop setup, and past missions to assign random combat tasks. Complete these missions to earn rewards such as Matrix Credit, Supply Crate · Scorching Fire, or activate an Extraction Point for evacuation.</p><p><b>Restricted Zones</b></p><p>Explore the new Restricted Zone feature in co-op mode. Squads must complete specific mission objectives or defeat area bosses within the given time frame. The difficulty of the Restricted Zone and target completion rates determine the variety of loot available.</p><p>To enter a Restricted Zone instance, squad members must airdrop a Locator Beacon (equipped with the corresponding Restricted Zone Key) to pinpoint the exact coordinates before heading to the instance entrance. Squads dropping Beacons of the same level may find themselves in the same Restricted Zone, where all competing squads have equal rights to claim loot from the supply crates available in the area.</p><p><b>Modes</b></p><p>· Free-For-All: Pilots face off individually. The Summoning Beacon enables reentry to the battlefield after a Striker is neutralized, with available uses depending on difficulty (3 in Normal, 2 in Hard, none in Extreme).</p><p>· Co-op Mode: Teams of three Pilots collaborate to overcome challenges. The Summoning Beacon allows for unlimited respawns of neutralized teammates. As the difficulty increases, the scale and number of accessible Restricted Zones also expand.</p><p><b>Difficulty Levels</b></p><p>· Normal: Requires Combat Readiness below 2,000. Enemies are easy and few, with 5 Extraction Points. Mercenary mod drop rate: 30%.</p><p>· Hard: Requires Combat Readiness below 6,000. Enemies are tougher and more frequent, with 3 Extraction Points. Mercenary mod drop rate: 60%.</p><p>· Extreme: No Combat Readiness cap. Enemies are highly challenging and numerous, with 2 Extraction Points available. Includes extra Extraction Beacons and Supply Crates. Mercenary mod drop rate: 100%.</p><p>· Combat Readiness depends on the Pilot's Airdrop setup and the mods on their Striker.</p><p>· In all modes and difficulty levels, eliminating a mercenary halts their mission in Mashmak, blocking their respawn via the Summoning Beacon.</p><p><b>Airdrop Settings</b></p><p>· Pilots have access to 7 customizable airdrop slots. Apart from the standard Summoning Beacon, all deployed Beacons and Auxiliary Devices are single-use and cannot be reused.</p><p>· Weapon Airdrop Beacon, Ammo Airdrop Beacon, and Locator Beacon become available for airdrop configurations only when Pilots equip the corresponding Modular Weapons, ammunition, and Restricted Zone Keys.</p><p>· If a teammate picks up and successfully exits with a Glider from your airdrop, it is automatically returned to you via mail.</p><p>· You can customize your Modular Weapons, Gliders, and various Beacons with paints and Insignias.</p><p><b>Supplies</b></p><p>· During exploration, Pilots can determine the value of weapons, supplies, and materials by checking either the sellable price in Matrix Credit or Corite.</p><p>· Collecting different quality materials for Gliders and Auxiliary Devices allows you to research and assemble these items for future airdrop configurations upon successful evacuation.</p><p>· Weapons and Gliders acquired or carried during exploration can be kept for future use if successfully evacuated.</p><p>· If a Pilot's Striker is neutralized, all equipped Modular Weapons and ammo are destroyed, but supplies in the Cargo Space may be retrieved by other Strikers.</p><p>· Materials, Gliders, Auxiliary Devices of Superb quality and above, and Modular Weapons of Rare quality and above can be sold or auctioned in the Matrix Marketplace.</p><p><b>Mods</b></p><p>· During Operation STORM, you can collect Mod Boxes of varying qualities. Successfully evacuating with these allows you to open them for random mods of the corresponding quality.</p><p>· Mods possess both beneficial and detrimental effects, applicable only in Operation STORM. Pilots should equip mods based on their specific needs and Striker configurations.</p><p>· Mod Boxes and mods of Rare quality or above can be sold or auctioned in the Matrix Marketplace.</p><p><b>Matrix Supplies</b></p><p>· Weapon Airdrop Beacons, Ammo Airdrop Beacons, Locator Beacons, and all types of ammunition for Modular Weapons can be purchased using Matrix Credits at Matrix Supplies.</p><p>· Matrix Supplies also automatically updates its inventory every 2 hours with 2 random Auxiliary Devices of Fine quality or below and 6 random Modular Weapons of Rare quality or below. Pilots may use Matrix Credit to refresh the inventory as needed.</p>

Microsoft made significant job cuts across the board, including the cancelation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">a new MMO from The Elder Scrolls Online team</a>. But Xbox boss Phil Spencer still has his job, and despite rumors to the contrary, he isn't retiring.</p><p>Xbox's head of communications Kari Perez told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696922/phil-spencer-xbox-microsoft-gaming-retiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> that, "Phil is not retiring anytime soon." That was in response to <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a rumor spread by Call of Duty leaker GhostofHope</a> that claimed Spencer will step down from his role as Microsoft Gaming CEO after the next-generation Xbox console launch, which would pave the way for Xbox president Sarah Bond to succeed him. As that rumor gained traction, Microsoft communications chief <a href="https://x.com/fxshaw/status/1940481184649433246" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frank Shaw posted on X</a> that it was made up.</p><p>In response to the outcry over the layoffs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">Spencer claimed that the cuts were necessary</a> and touted the future of Microsoft's gaming division.</p><p>"We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities," said Spencer. "We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p><p>Among other canceled projects, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">the Perfect Dark reboot was shut down</a> today when the studio behind it, The Initiative, was closed. Approximately 9,000 employees lost their jobs across the entire company, including non-Xbox divisions, as part of the latest round of cuts. However, a separate report suggests that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-games-shown-at-the-xbox-showcase-in-june-are-safe-report/1100-6532924/" data-ref-id="1100-6532924">all of the games from last month's Microsoft Showcase are "safe"</a> and they will still be released as planned.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Warcraft Rumble is shifting into life-support mode following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/">latest round of layoffs at Microsoft</a>, which appears to be targeting about 4% of the company's workforce, or around 9000 employees.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215864/announcing-changes-to-warcraft-rumble-support" rel="nofollow ">post on Blizzard's blog</a>, the studio announced that the team behind Warcraft Rumble would "continue supporting Rumble with updates focused on regular, systemic in-game events and bug fixes, but no new content. " An email sent to staff by Blizzard president Johanna Faires about the layoffs, which was received and reported on by <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble" rel="nofollow ">Aftermath</a>, reads, "As part of these changes, we made the difficult decision to shift to a scaled down, live ops-only phase of development for Warcraft Rumble, similar to our current approach with games like StarCraft II and Heroes of the Storm.”</p><p dir="ltr">Warcraft Rumble, a mobile tower defense game based on Blizzard's popular Warcraft series, was released back in 2023 after nine years in development.According to this latest announcement though, Rumble "struggled to find its footing," and despite feedback from the community and changes implemented by the team, the efforts weren't enough to set the game on "a path to sustainability."</p><p dir="ltr">As part of the cuts at Blizzard, Aftermath reports that the number of impacted employees could be "as high as 100." While many are being let go, others are being moved onto other projects at Blizzard, though some of these teams are also facing losses among the restructuring.</p><p dir="ltr">These changes to Warcraft Rumble are reflective of the ongoing layoffs at multiple Microsoft divisions, especially under Xbox.</p><p dir="ltr">It has been reported that an MMO from Zenimax Online Studios, the developers behind Elder Scrolls Online, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/">also been cancelled</a>. The Initiative, a studio founded by Xbox to lead development on a now-cancelled Perfect Dark reboot, is being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">shut down</a> and Everwild, an ambitious game from Sea of Thieves' developer Rare, has also been canceled amidst these cuts.</p><p dir="ltr">Both projects had lengthy and troubled developments, with Perfect Dark eventually being partially outsourced to Crystal Dynamics for support. News around Everwild, which was announced back in 2019, quickly went cold, and after years of silence around the project, reports of the game's development, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-boss-resigns-from-rare-marking-another-high-profile-xbox-departure/1100-6483926/">key studio departures</a>, came out suggesting the title was being rebooted before ultimately getting axed.</p><p dir="ltr">The full impact of these layoffs is still being gauged as news slowly trickles out from the affected teams under Xbox's banner.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>News today that Xbox has <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled multiple projects</a> and<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laid off hundreds of workers</a>, on top of<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> thousands more let go in earlier layoffs over the last 18 months</a>, has shaken an industry already pretty damn shaken after<a href="https://aftermath.site/layoffs-are-the-vibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> everything that's happened over the last 3-4 years</a>. This leaves me asking the same question<a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I've found myself asking a lot lately</a>: why are the people most responsible for the company's failures not the ones facing the consequences for them?</p><p>Microsoft has stepped on rake after rake in the decade since the launch of the Xbox One. I could make a list here of every mistake the company has made--from first-party development mishaps to confusing naming practices to Game Pass' undercutting of an entire industry to more recent stuff like devaluing the brand's identity itself--but you know all this already. You can take your pick as to what you think has been the biggest contributor to a once-dominant console now appearing to be in terminal decline.</p><p>Whichever you choose, in whatever order and priority, they've all got one thing in common: they're all strategic mistakes. Everything Microsoft has fucked up since 2013 has come from the very top.</p><p>Those fuck ups have consistently pointed the company on a downwards trajectory, to the point where we are now looking at a <em>fourth </em>round of layoffs since 2024. Workers who have poured their lives into making games, or marketing games, or making sure studios are run properly, have been cast aside.</p><p>None of those people were responsible for calling it the Xbox Series X But Also Series S. The person answering phones at Arkane didn't bet the farm on Game Pass becoming the next Netflix then...not becoming the next Netflix. An artist paid to draw spaceships for a <em>Halo </em>game didn't decide that Xbox should mean an actual Xbox but also kinda mean an Oculus Quest 3 and some handhelds and cloud services but also not really.</p><p>Xbox executives made those decisions! They've all been bad decisions, one after another, for over a decade now, and as you cast your eyes over the lists of people being affected by these layoffs--their careers and entire lives upended in an instant--that list does not include CEO Phil Spencer.</p><p>He remains in his role, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696922/phil-spencer-xbox-microsoft-gaming-retiring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants to be there for a while yet</a>, and will remain receiving total compensation in the <em>millions</em>, pay that should in theory be a result of the scale of responsibility he is entrusted with. Getting paid millions while you're doing well makes sense! Continuing to be paid millions while your business sucks so badly you think you need to lay off workers because of your terrible decisions, or decisions you're responsible for, makes <em>no </em>sense.</p><p>If Microsoft really wants to reverse a decade of mistakes, and feels the best way to achieve that is to let someone go, maybe they need to be looking at laying off the people--or person--ultimately responsible for those mistakes.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble"><h3>Microsoft Layoffs Hit Blizzard, Warcraft Rumble Put On Life Support</h3></a><p>No new content for Warcraft Rumble as Blizzard departments like marketing and customer service are also impacted</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go"><h3>G/O Media Finally Sells Kotaku</h3></a><p>Kotaku has been purchased by the owners of sister site Gizmodo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of Microsoft’s latest round of <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>, which have already claimed multiple in-development projects including <em>Perfect Dark</em>, <em>Everwild</em>, and an unannounced MMO from the makers of <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em>, Activision Blizzard is effectively ending development on <em>Warcraft Rumble</em>, a mobile tower defense game that launched in 2023 after a lengthy development period.</p><p><em>Rumble</em>, Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215864/announcing-changes-to-warcraft-rumble-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just announced publicly</a> and earlier today in an email to staff, will no longer receive any new content.&nbsp;</p><p>“The emails from Phil [Spencer] and Matt [Booty] today have laid out workforce changes underway across Microsoft Gaming, including Blizzard,” Blizzard president Johanna Faries wrote in an email to staff viewed by Aftermath. “As part of these changes, we made the difficult decision to shift to a scaled down, live ops-only phase of development for <em>Warcraft Rumble</em>, similar to our current approach with games like <em>StarCraft II</em> and <em>Heroes of the Storm</em>.”</p><p>The game, Faries said, began life nine years ago, but ultimately, after its launch in 2023, “team leaders recognized that early development and design ambitions were not meeting expectations in terms of audience engagement and retention.”</p><p>“Since launch, <em>Rumble </em>has struggled to achieve the scale necessary to sustain its current form for the long-term, despite very good and hard work by everyone on the team and supporting the game,” Faries wrote.</p><p>She went on to say that “several” <em>Rumble </em>team members have moved to new roles within Blizzard, but others will be let go. While Faries did not disclose an exact number, Activision Blizzard employees who were granted anonymity on the basis that they were not authorized to speak publicly said the number could be as high as 100. Many employees affected by today’s layoffs, they said, found out initially via Slack deactivations. Other Blizzard departments impacted, according to Faries' email, include customer service and marketing. Other teams, like those working on various <em>Overwatch </em>features – dealt <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a devastating blow</a> during Microsoft's early-2024 mass layoffs – <a href="https://x.com/chronofloss/status/1940498049513804057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appear to be safe</a> this time around.</p><p><em>Rumble </em>was part of a burgeoning Blizzard initiative to conquer the mobile market following the success of <em>Hearthstone</em>, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-03/activision-blizzard-preps-warcraft-mobile-game-cancels-another" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported in 2022</a> played a role in Microsoft's decision to purchase Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion. Another Blizzard mobile game would have seen the company do its best <em>Pokémon Go</em> impression, but that project was canceled before it ever saw the light of day.</p><p>"Organizational changes like this can be difficult to navigate and our ability to adapt, stay focused, and weather storms is a testament to the strength and resilience of our teams,” wrote Faries. “I want to recognize the significant and meaningful progress we are making on many fronts. Today's news does not diminish the hard work and dedication of talented individuals, nor does it take away from the collective brilliance of so many. Together, we will continue to build towards a bright and creatively ambitious future for players the world over."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer"><h3>Has Xbox Considered Laying One Person Off Instead Of Thousands</h3></a><p>None of the people being laid off were responsible for the decisions that have led to these layoffs</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go"><h3>G/O Media Finally Sells Kotaku</h3></a><p>Kotaku has been purchased by the owners of sister site Gizmodo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-confirms-mass-layoffs-across-xbox-gaming-and-all-its-divisions/">today’s confirmed mass layoffs across Microsoft</a>, details of the teams and games at Xbox that have been affected have started to emerge. One studio closure has taken place, but a number of long in development projects have been cancelled and their associated teams have been cut.</p>
<p>The job cuts affect <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> developer The Initiative, which is being shutdown, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/everwild">Everwild</a> team at Rare, Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10, and an MMORPG which had been an unannounced development at ZeniMax Online Studios since 2018, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">codenamed Blackbird</a>.</p>


<p>In a public acknowledgment, Microsoft Studios’ <a title="People > Matt Booty [110 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/people/matt-booty/">Matt Booty said:</a></p>
<p>“We have made the decision to stop development of <a title="Games > Perfect Dark [85 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/perfect-dark/">Perfect Dark</a> and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio.</p>
<p>“As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, <a title="Companies > The Initiative [69 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/microsoft/the-initiative/">The Initiative</a>. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.”</p>

<p>Job cuts are being made across the board at Microsoft, with a bit under 4% of the global workforce affected, and with roles being cut at any level and at any tenure and seniority. There are reports of layoffs from Halo Studios, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiple-call-of-duty-studios-hit-by-xbox-layoffs/">across the network of Call of Duty studios</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l">roughly half of Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10’s team is being let go</a>.</p>
<p>However, we are seeing some more targeted job losses as the company ends production on some games that have spent a long time in development and have leaked reports about development trouble. Perfect Dark was in development at The Initiative, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/24/crystal-dynamics-is-co-developing-the-new-perfect-dark-for-xbox/">the studio needed to bring in Crystal Dynamics to help co-develop the game</a>, and there were then swirling reports about the game’s troubled development before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/perfect-dark-re-emerges-with-a-fresh-gameplay-reveal-trailer/">the gameplay reveal last June</a>. That looked encouraging, but alas, no more.</p>
<p>Everwild was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/14/everwild-rare-new-ip-sea-of-thieves-xo19-project-scarlett/">announced by Rare in 2019</a>, but after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/check-out-the-beautiful-new-everwild-trailer-from-the-xbox-series-x-games-showcase/">a trailer followed in 2020</a>, precious little has been heard of the game since then, but there have been reports of development difficulties as the project lacked focus and clear gameplay direction.</p>
<p>These are the most high profile cancellations, as they are of publicly announced games, but other projects have also been cancelled that were not public.</p>
<p>While there’s obviously reports emerging of what has been lost, there’s also reports of what is safe. <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/">Any game featured during the most recent Xbox Showcase is unaffected,</a> and games like Fable, <a href="https://xcancel.com/JezCorden/status/1940443109202219181">State of Decay 3</a> and others are also largely unaffected – even if the studios may be undergoing some layoffs still.</p>
<p>While some of the game cancellations are understandable, that it’s all being wrapped up in a rushed bundle of layoffs all at once – there’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">reports of ZeniMax employees just being kicked off Slack</a> – with a percentage target just makes it feel callous. Microsoft will obviously supply everyone affected with severance packages, and they have also promised that outgoing employees can gain priority viewing on jobs elsewhere within Microsoft, but little consolation. Our thoughts go out to anyone affected by these layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft says that Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming CEO and the head of Xbox, isn’t retiring “anytime soon.” The company has responded to rumors of Spencer’s retirement, which have spread online today following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">Microsoft’s major layoffs</a>.</p><p>“Phil is not retiring anytime soon,” says Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. The denial comes after <em>Call of Duty</em> leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190">GhostOfHope claimed</a> “Phil Spencer will be retiring from his role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming after the launch of the next generation Xbox” and that Xbox president Sarah Bond would be taking over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p><p>While Microsoft’s comment doesn’t address the rumor fully, it makes it clear Spencer isn’t retiring imminently. Separately, Microsoft communications chief, Frank Shaw, <a href="https://x.com/fxshaw/status/1940481184649433246">took to X</a> to claim that at least part of the rumor was made up.</p><p>Spencer originally assumed leadership of the Xbox division <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/31/5566186/phil-spencer-head-microsoft-xbox-division">in 2014</a>, a promotion from his role as the boss of Microsoft Studios. As the boss of Xbox, he’s overseen many big initiatives, including the launch of the Xbox Series X / S, a huge push into Xbox Game Pass, acquisitions of major companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">Activision Blizzard</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">ZeniMax Media</a>, bringing more Xbox games to platforms like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><p>While Spencer isn’t retiring anytime soon, Microsoft is continuing its big cuts today that have affected Xbox studios and employees. <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs">have been cancelled</a>, while <em>Forza Motorsport</em> developer Turn 10 Studios will be letting go of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts">more than 70 staffers</a>. Zenimax Online Studios also reportedly canceled a new MMORPG codenamed Blackbird that had been in the works since 2018.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/696922/phil-spencer-xbox-microsoft-gaming-retiring]]></content:encoded>

Unlocking Daisy requires you to complete the Flower Cup, period. Whether you race in 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc doesn’t matter. This Grand Prix series takes you from Desert Hills to Shy Guy Bazaar and all the way through Wario Stadium and Airship Fortress, in that order.</p><p>This is a fitting way to unlock her as the Flower Cup signifies Daisy’s character emblem. Much like the crown and the star are emblems for Peach and Rosalina, respectively. You can see those symbols printed on most of their outfits. Plus, the scorching desert region of Shy Guy Bazaar just so happens to be in her homeland and kingdom of Sarasaland. She’s one of only three characters to have the Oasis outfit to represent the land in which she was born, raised, and rules.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-unlock-daisy-flower-cup-multiplayer-1851785551]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Following rumors that a new My Hero Academia fighting game was in the works, Bandai Namco confirmed the news by announcing My Hero Academia: All's Justice during its summer showcase. The 3D fighting game is being developed alongside the anime series' final season, and as such, will feature the series' final fights, allowing players to experience the conclusion of the popular manga firsthand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkheljpoug" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nCkheljpoug" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After showing off the game's next-level visuals in a short trailer, Bandai Namco offered a first look at combat and a brief overview of its mechanics. According the game's director, Aoba Miyazaki, one of the highlights of My Hero Academia: All's Justice is a "huge roster" that, for the first time ever, includes all students from class 1-A. From this roster, players will assemble a team of three characters who can be switched out seamlessly during fights, allowing them to chain together attacks and quirk abilities. A new Rising system will also players to "significantly boost" the power of their characters by unleashing "their full potential," though the studio did not specify exactly what that might entail.</p><p>However, Bandai Namco did confirm it will be sharing more about My Hero Academia: All's Justice in the near future. For the time being, players can wishlist the upcoming title on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.</p><p>The announcement of My Hero Academia: All's Justice comes more than five years after the last My Hero Fighting Game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/my-hero-ones-justice-2/" data-ref-id="5000-502681">One's Justice 2</a>, was released back in March 2020. One's Justice 2 was considered a significant step up from its predecessor, One's Justice, but failed to garner the sort of praise reserved for Bandai Namco's Naruto fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naruto-ultimate-ninja-storm/" data-ref-id="5000-33192">Ultimate Ninja Storm</a>, or its Dragon Ball fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz/" data-ref-id="5000-465487">FighterZ</a>.</p>

            <p>
Soon, the fairies will be upon us thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-off-with-the-fairies-in-new-enchanted-by-nature-expansion">imminent Enchanted by Nature expansion</a>. But before all that, EA has laid the foundations for its impending pixie dust explosion with a free content update - introducing the likes of glass walls and rooftop plants - that's available to download and muck around with right now.
</p>
<p>
Glass walls - which should delight the exhibitionist Sims in your life - can be located under Misc &gt; Wall Patterns in Build Mode, and do pretty much exactly what you'd assume, offering your Sims all the outdoors they could possibly hope for without them ever needing to go outside. Alternatively, they could be turned into (lethally?) inconspicuous partitions, or paired with glass roofs for that authentic greenhouse look. And those aforementioned rooftop plants? Well, you can now stick a select assortment of plants on top of your house. The end.
</p>
<p>
Away from these new decor bits, EA's latest update also brings Sim inventory improvements and a notebook refresh. Players now have new ways to sort their inventory, for instance, with the default "new" view placing freshly acquired stuff at the top, but your stash can also be filtered by price, name, crafting quality, and rarity. Spoiled foods, meanwhile, get an unmissable red background indicator and are grouped into a new Spoiled stack.

As for the notebook - which includes a new interface designed to make it easier to keep tabs on your household Collections - it now sports a refreshed layout, category page enhancements, new discovery badges, and more. "Whether you're jotting down notes for your Sim or exploring unique categories," EA writes, "the notebook is now more intuitive and engaging."

All that arrives alongside an extensive list of fixes and improvements across The Sims 4 base game and its expansions. With the update applied, for instance, Sims should no longer need to grapple with the inconvenience of having rain and snow do their thing indoors, and children should stop going stretchy when attempting to play the violin. There's plenty more where those came from, though, as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025">detailed in EA's announcement post</a>.

The Sims 4's latest update is available now on all platforms and arrives ahead of the game's next major paid expansion, Enchanted by Nature. This launches next Thursday, 10th July, and introduces emotion-hungry fairies (in both kindly and chaotic forms) as a new supernatural Sim option. That's alongside the new coastal world of Innisgreen, where brave Sims can reside if they don't mind luck heavily impacting the course of their lives. Chuck in new adventures, skills, traits, and a new mechanic based around emotional balance, and it's quite a busy one.
