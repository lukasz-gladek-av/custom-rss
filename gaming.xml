		<p>The theme parks of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/10/planet-coaster-console-edition-review-ps5-ps4-xbox-one-series-x/">Planet Coaster</a> are ones of pure joy. Here, during our very first hands on with the sequel, the vibes were immaculate, and it’s heartening to find that at least in this crucial way, nothing much has changed. That’s it though, as Frontier are ascribing to the bigger, better, wackier and wetter school of sequel-building, pushing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> straight to the top of our park-building wish list.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet Coaster 2 | Gamescom Water Flume Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L_y0yRk00YI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Planet Coaster 2, much like its predecessor, aims to capture the wonderful world of the theme park. Rich Newbold, Game Director sets out, “We wanted to build on the amazing foundations of the first game, allowing players a place to build those amazing dream theme parks and water parks and combine them with the amazing coasters.”</p>
<p>It’s water parks that are the watchword here, and through our hands-on time we focused on the key addition of lots of water-based fun and frivolity. That means lots of pools, lots of waterslides and, somewhat unsurprisingly, lots of changing rooms too. The team had to step in early on to point me in the right direction when all of my theme park visitors were standing aimlessly at the ladder to a particularly tall flume – “They need somewhere to change!” they explained. Once I’d found and placed the relevant building things swiftly became right with the world as my digital visitors could now slip into something a little less concealing, and immediately leap into the nearest pool. Here, a half-naked customer is a happy customer.</p>


<p>Richard says, “We wanted to add that great experience of going to a water park into the game. All of those amazing fun days that the team have had, or people in the community, of going to a water park, and experiencing all those things that water parks have: those big swimming pools with wave machines and jets (which you can build in Planet Coaster 2), the lazy rivers and all the amazing different types of flumes, and all the special pieces that you have on the flumes, have been inspired by the amazing days we’ve had.”</p>
<p>You can customise your rides and features more than ever before here, right down to the individual components of different buildings. If you want to remove a balustrade from a building, or just take the whole roof off, you can, and that’s before you alter the colour of every component or swap out the statue on the top.</p>
<p>Just as with the original, the controls and building tools are straightforward and welcoming for both newcomers and younger players, but if you want to be particular, there’s untold levels of depth to help you craft a park that looks truly incredible. There’s been key improvements to the path tools, with more options to dig deeper into both your control over and the laying of those crucial pathways, ensuring that your visitors can get where they need to, but also that it looks exactly how you envisioned it as well.</p>

<p>Planet Coaster 2 looks simply lovely, and the addition of water-based rides and scenery just pushes things even further. The water sloshing around in each of the pools and pouring out of the flumes looks so inviting that at times you might wish you were actually able to visit the park you’ve created. It’s unequivocally bright, colourful, and characterful, with each of the visitors and the other characters you encounter, captured in the chunky, distinctive style that Frontier have honed over the years.</p>
<p>Structurally, there’s a lot here that’s shared with the original game, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/22/planet-zoo-review/">Planet Zoo</a> as well, with the central campaign taking you through a series of different park scenarios and having you solve a specific set of problems. Our playthrough saw our somewhat hapless colleague caught up in some kind of park-based hazing, with a rival park owner hiring our services in an attempt to show us up. Obviously, we didn’t let that stand, but it was nice to see the light humour still running through the campaign, and providing something a little bit different amongst all of the park building.</p>
<p>And there’s <em>so much</em> park building to do. Outside of the central campaign, there’s the sandbox mode, which is likely where the most dedicated fans will spend most of their time, utilising the never-ending funds they have on tap to make something spectacular and without constraints. We only had a short couple of hours to get our park started, but I was undeniably happy with what I’d been able to make in that space of time.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of new themes and landscape options, and the Resort and Mythology options let you turn your park into a mini-Olympus (with water slides), or simply your dream vision of a spectacular waterpark. Whichever you choose, Planet Coaster 2 gives you the tools to make it one of a kind.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to get into the nitty-gritty, Planet Coaster 2’s Blueprints mean that you’ve immediately got access to a fantastic set of pre-made rides – many of which have come from the community – so you can still create a sprawling park oasis, but in record time. Richard told us, “There’s those people who really want to get down to the detail, and there’s tools there for that, but the Blueprints are there for people to very quickly get their theme park up and running. But, if you want to, you might want to customise those Blueprints, so they might also be a great first step for people to make a good theme park.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that Planet Coaster 2 comes from a place of love, and Senior Producer Adam Woods picks up on that. “We’re massive theme park fans, and we knew what we wanted to add to the second game, as well as listening to the community. A big shout out to the team, because I think you can see the passion, the enthusiasm, the expertise that comes out in the game, because we’re theme park fans.”</p>

<p>Everything here supports that idea. You just can’t come away from Planet Coaster without a massive grin on your face, humming the cheerful tunes that accompany your park building, while dreaming of your next step on the way to park-building nirvana. You might as well prepare now, as Planet Coaster 2 is going to provide the park-building ride of your life. No judgement if it turns out to be the lazy river.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-13-releases-on-pc-adding-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-3-support.979131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-13-releases-on-pc-adding-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-3-support/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Patch 2.13 for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty is officially being rolled out on PC, adding support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 with Frame Generation. The official Cyberpunk website has the<a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50818/patch-2-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full list of changes being made</a>, and it will most likely affect those who use mods for their game. This happens in any game, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-optimized-path-tracing-mod-40-performance-improvement/">mods</a> typically end up broken from an update. However, since this update is focused on adding support for AMD FidelityFX as well as Intel Xe Super Sampling, it feels like it'd be unlikely to disturb any mods.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more about how AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 impacts your game, they have made an article that explains it all. In short, it combines image upscaling with frame generation technology so that you can have the smoothest possible gaming experience by generating high-resolution frames at fast frame rates. This option can be enabled or disabled depending on whether you feel your game could benefit from the technology. There is additionally a separate setting to enable FSR Frame Generation.</p>
<p>To be able to use FSR Frame Generation in game, you have to have AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 upscaling enabled. CD Projekt Red has decided to keep support for both FSR 2.1 and FSR 3 so that players have as much flexibility as possible when it comes to choosing the visual quality and performance for their gaming session. The website states, "this allows them to experiment and find what fits their gaming style best."</p>
<p>While AMD FSR 3 is compatible with&nbsp;<span>many different GPUs, other system requirements must be met for it to be able to be utilized. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/super-resolution.html#tabs-c1d1ec273c-item-683977caaa-tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD website</a> has a list of all GPUs that are compatible with it, so you can check whether your rig will be able to utilize the technology</span>.</p>
<p>To get the most out of AMD's FSR 3 capabilities in Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty, it's recommended that the game run at a baseline of 60 FPS. Lower frame rates make visual artifacts more prominent and can cause frame pacing issues if you enable them.</p>
<p>To have the most visually stunning experience, CD Projekt Red also recommends playing on a higher refresh rate monitor (120 Hz and above), as using a lower refresh rate monitor can lead to frame time issues.</p>
<p>If using this technology is something that you want to pursue, making sure your GPU drivers are up to date is imperative. Below are the versions you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD: 32.0.11037.4004</li>
<li>NVIDIA: 556.12</li>
<li>Intel: 32.0.101.5972</li>
</ul>

Now, “The Flappy Bird Foundation Group” will relaunch the game on Android and iOS in 2025.</p><p>But it’s unclear whether the original creator of <em>Flappy Bird</em>, Dong Nguyen, is a part of the game’s relaunch. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Nguyen with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. His account on X and the website for his game development company don’t show any recent updates. The Flappy Bird Foundation said they acquired the rights to the game from Gametech, LLC, which isn’t associated with Nguyen.</p><p>Following <em>Flappy Bird</em>’s sudden shutdown in 2014, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones">clones started flooding app stores</a> while companies attempted to snap up its trademark. Even though <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/flappy-bird-creator-bringing-game-back-this-summer-76325/">Ngyuen expressed interest</a> in relaunching the game at the time, Apple’s App Store rules may have prevented him from doing so. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/remove-an-app/#:~:text=Removed%20apps%20can%20only%20be,ID%20can't%20be%20reused.">Under the rules</a>, developers lose ownership of an app’s name when they remove it, and they can’t relaunch it under the same name if another developer is using it.</p><p>Still, as someone who was a big <em>Flappy Bird</em> player back in 2013, I’d love to see the game brought back to life.</p><p>While the new game will feature the original <em>Flappy Bird </em>character, future updates will introduce new game modes, characters, and “massive multiplayer challenges.” The <a href="https://flappybird.org/">new <em>Flappy Bird</em> website</a> shows what we might expect, with a new “rivals” mode where you can challenge 99 other players and another that has you shooting birds through basketball hoops. There are some new characters as well, like “Peng” the penguin, and the rainbow mohawk-sporting “Quirky.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Flappy Bird is making a victorious return to devices worldwide more than a decade after it was pulled offline. In 2014, the app’s creator scrapped the game despite raking in the cash after stating that it was ruining his life. He remarked that it was a serious success, but it wasn’t worth the upkeep.</p>



<p>Following the shutdown, people were spending thousands of dollars on mobile devices that still had the game installed and working, but the craze died off relatively quickly.</p>



<p>Now, the hyper-addictive title is making a grand comeback.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-flappy-bird-is-back">Flappy Bird is Back</h2>



<p>By the end of October, Flappy Bird will be back, landing first on web browsers and then as an iOS and Android application in 2025. It has been pieced together by The Flappy Bird Foundation, which is made up of a squad of fans dedicated to reviving the legendary mobile game. </p>



<p>It took a while, but The Flappy Bird Foundation secured the trademark for the game from Gametech Holdings LLC, per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/10-years-after-it-was-pulled-offline-viral-mobile-game-flappy-bird-is-coming-back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a report from IGN</a>.</p>



<p>The team is assembling a next-generation version of the game, which’ll include new modes, character customisation, and progression – plus <strong>multiplayer</strong>. Imagine the frustration of competing against your friends in Flappy Bird and having the ability to knock them down out of the sky – it’s sure to shatter friendships.</p>



<p>In a statement, a representative of the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a series of images, the new features were explored, revealing new locations, special modes featuring sports-themed crossovers, and a faithful replication of the original game. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the return of Flappy Bird?</p>

Fan modder MerigoldMariobor has found a few lost moments of dialogue from one of The Witcher 3's endings, and has released a new mod that restores a little more closure for Geralt and Ceri.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-mod-restores-cut-endings" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, the ending in the game features a favorable outcome for Geralt and Ciri as he presents her with a sword signifying her status as a fellow Witcher. However, there were two lost moments of dialogue that added more to the scene. First, Ciri finally gets a chance to react to having a Witcher's sword of her own, before she and Geralt make plans to reunite with either Yen or Triss, depending upon whom Geralt is romancing in the game. The video below adds both of those moments back into the narrative.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHcqUeftAoM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="3">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHcqUeftAoM?start=3" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The final expansion for The Witcher 3, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine-review/1900-6416443/" data-ref-id="1900-6416443">Blood and Wine</a>, seemingly wrapped up Geralt's storyline. CD Projekt has already announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-now-has-tons-more-people-working-on-it/1100-6519533/" data-ref-id="1100-6519533">The Witcher 4</a> is in development, and if Geralt's story is over, then it would only make sense if Ciri becomes the new main character of the game. That's still only speculation for now, but CD Projekt recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">Geralt will have a much smaller role</a> in the next game.</p><p>CD Projekt hasn't set a date for The Witcher 4, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-now-has-tons-more-people-working-on-it/1100-6519533/" data-ref-id="1100-6519533">the development team expanded</a> in late 2023 as production ramped up. It's too soon to guess when The Witcher 4 will arrive, but presumably it will be released for the current generation of consoles. In the meantime, The Witcher Season 4--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look-as-geralt-revealed-by-netflix/1100-6523641/" data-ref-id="1100-6523641">Liam Hemsworth as Geralt</a>--will arrive in 2025.</p>

But unless that user also adds them back, they're only considered a "follower" and can only see content made public by the user they added.

A number of high-profile creators lambasted Unity and threatened to ditch the engine over what they felt was a huge betrayal of trust.

<p>Other features coming to the PC version of Until Dawn include full DualSense controller support, Ultrawide Aspect Ratio and Ray-tracing support (if you have the hardware).</p>
<p>The DualSense's haptic feedback will allow players to feel the characters' heartbeats pulsating through the controller during Until Dawn's Don't Move sequences, adding to the intensity. Additionally, Ballistic Moon said the controller's adaptive triggers will allow players to "feel the weight of [their] choices".</p>
<p>As with Sony's other PC releases such as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">forthcoming God of War Ragnarök</a>, a PlayStation Network account is required.</p>
<p>Along with PC, Until Dawn is also set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-gets-suitably-spooky-pc-ps5-release-date">release on PlayStation 5 on 4th October</a>. If you didn't play Until Dawn on its original PS4 release, I would recommend giving it a bash. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-review">Until Dawn review</a> from 2015 called the game "weird, gory and surprisingly moving".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Star Wars Jedi Survivor patch is now live on PC, bringing some welcome performance and quality-of-life improvements</p>
<p>Patch 9 mainly focuses on performance and quality-of-life improvements, introducing framerate improvements for various hardware configurations and fixes for several sources of framerate hitching. The patch also optimizes ray tracing for CPU usage and should now scale better for high-end GPUs.</p>
<p>The new Star Wars Jedi Survivor patch also introduces some quality-of-life improvements, such as an improvement for the "Optimizing Game Files" screen and improvements for mouse and keyboard functionality. Lastly, the patch introduces some bug fixes and removes Denuvo DRM. The full patch notes can be found on the game's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/patch-notes?isLocalized=true">official website.</a></p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi Survivor is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. The game will launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One next week, on September 17th. Learn more about the second entry in the series by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a surprise journey when it was first released, the time spent apart hasn’t made Cal Kestis’ adventures any less enjoyable. A similar framework in unfamiliar territories helps to establish Jedi: Survivor as a quality sequel to the original release. Jedi: Survivor still plays it safe in comparison to the prior game. It may be difficult to give Jedi: Survivor full marks for its individuality, but compared to the predecessor focused on Cal’s time as a Jedi Padawan, each title can stand up on its own merits, and Jedi: Survivor polishes up much of the experience as it propels the narrative ever forward on Cal Kestis’ journey to Tanalorr.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infamous-mobile-smash-hit-flappy-bird-returning-this-year.979080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-returning-this-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>? It's back, in expanded form. The game so addictive it caused its creator to destroy it for fear of what he'd unleashed on the world is making a return, and it's hitting browsers this year, with a mobile version to follow in 2025.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://flappybird.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new official website</a> for the little yellow bird and its infuriating pipe-based gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>will be available for iOS and Android, as well as browsers. Rather confusingly, the game's <a href="https://linktr.ee/flappy_bird" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linktree page</a> says it'll be playable "exclusively on Telegram".</p>
<p>A description on the site claims that&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>is "refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to soar again", and that this will indeed be "the official&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>game", so this isn't one of those cheap imitators that sprang up in the wake of the original's disappearance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flappy-bird-returns-gameplay.jpg?itok=miwzCPux 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flappy-bird-returns-gameplay.jpg?itok=TrrVLO2z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>is back, with all the modern trappings you'd expect from a 2024 revival.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this being a 2024 revival of&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, you can expect all the usual modern mobile game trappings. The relaunched version of the game will come complete with "new game modes, characters, progression, and massive multiplayer challenges", according to a press release.</p>
<p>Those modes include a basketball-based mode in which you guide the lil' bird through hoops, as well as an honest-to-goodness&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>battle royale (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-battle-royale-is-thing-apparently">no, not that one</a>).</p>
<p>Said press release also confirms that the browser-based versions of&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, which include a version for mobile web browsers, will launch this fall, and that the iOS and Android versions will follow next year.</p>
<p>It looks like original&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>creator&nbsp;Dong Nguyen won't be involved with this revival. Instead, the group spearheading the game's relaunch calls itself Flappy Bird Foundation, and the group says it will "revamp the game's ecosystem" while retaining the "familiarity of the game design" enjoyed around the world.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>was released in 2013, but its meteoric rise to fame came in 2014, at which point it gained millions of players and attained the number one spot in the iOS download charts.</p>
<p>However, just a couple of weeks after its sudden surge in popularity, creator Dong Nguyen <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took the game down</a>, claiming he couldn't "take this anymore" (referring to the game's overexposure).</p>
<p>Whatever Nguyen may think of&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, it seems Flappy Bird Foundation disagrees, and that's why you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>once again in your browser this year and on your phone next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>An upcoming "survival experience" from the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> got its first trailer today, teasing spaceships against stellar backdrops. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-frontier">Eve Frontier</a> was previously known as Project Awakening and is set in a faraway sector of the Eve universe. The developer calls it "a sandbox which focuses on self-reliance, skill-based tactical gameplay and third-party development". Huh? Third party development? Oh, I see. It has a bunch of blockchain cryptocurrency horseshit attached to it. Great. </p>

<p>We've known the game was in development since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-onlines-developers-are-making-a-blockchain-game-in-the-eve-universe">its announcement last year</a>, and it saw a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-online-dev-ccps-blockchain-survival-experience-project-awakening-is-getting-a-closed-playtest-in-may">closed beta test</a> a few months ago. But this marks the moment it has been christened with a real name. "In creating EVE Frontier, we wanted to make a new type of survival game," say developers CCP in a press release, "testing not just the individual survival of players, but the survival of civilization itself within a sandbox simulation."</p>
<p>That sounds fine. I love to survive amid the hellish collapse of interstellar civilisation. What sounds less inviting is the horrendous soup of cryptochatter that follows. There is mention of "L2 Blockchain", "ERC-20 tokens", and a programmable in-game building mechanic called "Smart Assemblies" which seems to let players make little shops that sell in-game materials, presumably to fellow blockchumps for various crypto doubloons.</p>
<p>"Players will be able to turn their assets (ships, items, resources), their services (e.g. providing bodyguard services to a fellow player, maintaining third-party development environments), and their reputation (“as a renowned player, my members pay me to lead their clan”) into real-world value through the in-game economy and in-game currencies."</p>
<p>In other words, it's the grubby "play-to-earn" idea baked into the EVE universe. I'll pass, cheers.</p>

<p>If the blockchain bullshittery is not featured in the trailer (or even mentioned in the video's description), it is likely because even those who indulge in unwise cryptocurrency speculation have to concede it is often interminably boring and invites immediate derision and skepticism from all quarters, save the cryptobro hardcore. Unlike vague images of spaceships flying coolly through space to warbling music, it does not make for exciting marketing material. Try to read this sentence, also included in the press release:</p>
<p>"Using Solidity, players can code functionality through smart contracts (on-chain code) and connect infrastructure to decentralized applications (DApps), programs through which you can modify how that infrastructure functions and behaves."</p>
<p>Is this a video game? <em>What is this?</em> Eve Online as an MMO can be a difficult game to approach as a new player, but at least it exists as an interesting landscape of cyber-skulduggery and a complex simulation of cutthroat economics. I have fond memories of rushing into battle as a dirt poor frontline fighter in a larger fleet, trying to orbit and electronically disable a much bigger, deadlier ship, like a buzzing fly trying to lasso an rhinoceros. I even have fond memories of manipulating the space stock markets with play money. </p>
<p>But that is the key thing: the ISK of Eve Online is play money that everyone agrees is play money. By contrast, Eve Frontier looks like an ill-fated attempt to pump $40 million dollars of real world money into a black hole. </p>
<p>But who knows. Maybe it will do better than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-ccp-havent-stopped-trying-to-make-an-eve-online-shooter-for-15-years">the first-person shooter they have made four times</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Helldivers 2’s upcoming Premium Warbond has unveiled new weapons, cosmetics, stratagems and more that will have players embracing their inner bug exterminator. Chemical Agents Warbond arrives for Helldivers 2 on September 19. Learn more details about it below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-chemical-agents-stratagems-and-utilities-nbsp">Helldivers 2 Chemical Agents Stratagems and Utilities&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Starting with the offensive stratagems, players have a new weapon, the TX-41 Sterilizer, which can spray high-pressure chemical gas on the Terminids. Additionally, players can unlock the&nbsp; AX/TX-13 “Guard Dog” Dog Breath, a support drone that hoses enemies down with corrosive gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chemical Agents adds 2 new Utilities for Helldivers 2, the P-11 Stim Pistol and the G-4 Gas Grenade. The P-11 Stim Pistol is the perfect choice for friendly fire, as this time, you won’t be killing your friends but healing them. The G-4 Gas Grenade is a throwable that instantly brings a cloud of corrosive chemical gas around your enemies. Additionally, players will receive 300 credits.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> has today received its ninth patch, which brings "substantial performance improvements" on PC and removes Denuvo DRM.</p>
<p>EA promises framerate improvements for various hardware configurations, fixes for specific framerate hitching elements for smoother gameplay, and optimised CPU usage for ray-tracing.</p>
<p>Importantly, Denuvo DRM has been removed, which is often criticised for hampering performance.</p>

<p>In addition, the patch brings other improvements like better mouse and keyboard control in menus, quality of life fixes, and bug fixes for crashes and collision issues. Read the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/patch-notes?isLocalized=true">full patch notes</a> for more information.</p>
<p>A further patch is set to arrive soon for the PlayStation 5 version of the game, which will allow for save file transfer with the forthcoming PS4 version - due on 17th September.</p>
<p>This ninth patch arrives 17 months after Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was first released in April 2023.</p>
<p>At the time, the PC version of the game was heavily criticised for its poor performance.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry described it as "the worst triple-A port" of 2023 and then, after seven patches, stated the "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-star-wars-jedi-survivor-on-pc-is-still-the-worst-triple-a-pc-port-of-2023">PC port is still not fit for purpose</a>".</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if this ninth patch will make the necessary changes to ensure the game is finally up to standard, but it's clear EA has been committed to improving its performance.</p>
<p>The game will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-september-release-on-ps4-and-xbox-one">launch on PS4 and Xbox One</a> on 17th September, costing £44.99. Let's hope it runs well on the older consoles.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and is a third-person action adventure with Soulslike elements. "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's lovable unpretentiousness is what makes it such a blast - but a lack of true focus holds it back," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-hit-and-miss-action-with-the-warmest-of-hearts">our review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I got the chance to try <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-and-glowmade-reveal-king-of-meat-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King of Meat</a>, the debut game of British indie studio Glowmade. The developer was founded a few years ago by former industry veterans who worked on high-profile games like Battlefield, Fable, and Horizon Zero Dawn, and they <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-glowmade-horizon-zero-dawn-fable-battlefield-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a publishing deal with Amazon Games three years ago.</p>
<p>King of Meat is a colorful cooperative action game styled after survival game shows. It is set in the world of Loregok, which seamlessly blends traditional fantasy elements like dragons, trolls, and skeletons with corporate commercialism. Contenders join the so-called Komstruct Koliseum in a risky bid for glory, gold, and fame.</p>
<p>During the game, you race through the dungeons, hacking and slashing against all sorts of monsters while at the same time trying to impress the bloodthirsty crowd with your combat skills. Indeed, every action, such as dealing a certain amount of damage or looting treasure, provides a certain amount of points that go into the tally.</p>
<p>As for the combat itself, it's pretty standard fare for an action title, with light and heavy attacks, dodging, and whatnot.&nbsp;There appears to be a strong focus on various types of environmental traps to avoid, including classics like lava-filled rooms, spinning blades, flaming balls of fire, rotating spikes, and more.</p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn't too impressed with what I played. At first glance, everything seemed to be a little too vanilla to stand out in today's increasingly crowded lineup of cooperative action titles, but King of Meat does have a feature that could make it much more attractive: user-generated content. It will come with a dungeon editor on all platforms, allowing the whole community to easily create levels and share them with the public. Needless to say, this feature could vastly expand the longevity.</p>
<p>After the brief hands-on, I had the opportunity to speak to Glowmade Studio Head and Co-Founder Jonny Hopper to discuss the studio's inspiration for King of Meat, its feature set, and the post-launch roadmap (in broad strokes). By the way, the game is currently in Pre-Alpha and there's no word on a release window. It will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and even Nintendo Switch, though. Glowmade is taking tester signups <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/tester-sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>, in case you're interested.</p>

<p><strong>How long have you been working on King of Meat?</strong></p>
<p>About four years. We signed with Amazon at the end of 2020, although we had been working on it as a very small project for about a year before that.</p>
<p><strong>What was your inspiration for this rather peculiar setting?</strong></p>
<p>We were in the pub, and a few of us were sitting around just talking about the things that we love, the films and stuff that we really enjoyed. Adam, our art director, said he's a big fan of Labyrinth, the David Bowie film with Jim Henson. He loves that, and Mike and Jim were talking about WrestleMania and that kind of over-the-top, spectacular sort of stuff, and then we just felt like, well, what happens if we try and take those feelings and put them into a game?</p>
<p><strong>One of the main features is user-generated content (UGC). Will the ability to create dungeons be available on consoles, too?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. It's fully cross-play on all the platforms, so you can play the levels on any platform and create levels on any platform. The idea is that anything you make on any platform will work on any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Which engine are you using?</strong></p>
<p>It is our own technology. We built the whole engine ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>You said there will be your own levels and dungeons, and the community can create custom ones.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. We're sort of doing that already behind the scenes. The game itself, when it comes out, is going to have about a hundred levels that we made as part of the offering, and we've also got the community behind the scenes building levels for us already.</p>
<p>We've already got people kind of seeding those creations. The idea is that on launch, there's going to be a lot of content. Quite a lot of official Glowmade stuff, but also some community-made stuff ready to go on day one.</p>
<p><strong>Did the community already help you improve the level-making tools in King of Meat?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, they did. We got such great feedback from them. Also, we get surprised a lot, which is really, really cool because obviously we know exactly how everything works and how all the pieces work, but then somebody will make a level and you don't know how they've done the thing that they've done with the tools, and there's always really amazing moments when you go, how did he do that? There's one level which is a magic library, with all these books flying everywhere, and I know theoretically how it's done, but the complexity that the person pulled off is really amazing. Those are the things that really make us happy, actually.</p>
<p><strong>I guess it's a bit like LittleBigPlanet, where some people made astounding levels.</strong></p>
<p>I worked on the editor for that some 18 years ago, so yeah, they're very much alike. We want people to just actually feel good when they're making levels and feel proud of the things they've made.</p>
<p><strong>How will you feature creators in the game? Will players be able to rate the best levels?</strong></p>
<p>That's such a good question. There's quite a few ways to do this. When you make a level, one of the things you can do is you can use a preset, which consists of different objects and enemies and styles to make certain levels.</p>
<p>When you've published your level, it can then make its way into the sort of main league that the whole public can display as part of their game progress. Also, for every single player, we have this kind of tipping system. Every day as a player, you get like a hundred tips, and the only thing you can do with those tips is give them to creators to reward them. Using that makes you as a creator feel really good because you can see people enjoying what you made, but it also means we can do exactly as you said, feature the creator of the week with the most levels or the most tips. We can do those kind of cool leaderboards and tags and badges or something.</p>
<p>Also, when you were playing in the plaza, did you see the big banners? We can use those banners to be like, the creator of the week is Rebecca because she's got, you know, a 1000 tips or whatever. It lets us show off the people behind the creations and make them feel good and part of the game as well.</p>
<p><strong>With Amazon publishing, I bet it occurred to you that King of Meat could get big on Twitch.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that would be great. It is sort of an obvious good fit for streaming. We've also had a bunch of streamers and content creators play the game already, and they really enjoyed it. They were screaming and laughing and just having a good time. We're really hopeful that it can take off.</p>
<p><strong>In the past, a few games have implemented Twitch functionality that allowed spectators to interact with the game. Did you think about doing the same?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we've been thinking about that, but we're not going to want to talk about what that is at the moment.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It is sort of an obvious good fit for streaming. We've also had a bunch of streamers and content creators play the game already, and they really enjoyed it. They were screaming and laughing and just having a good time. We're really hopeful that it can take off.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Fair enough. As far as what I played in the demo, King of Meat seemed to be a lot about avoiding environmental traps and fighting basic enemies, but will there be any boss encounters?</strong></p>
<p>A boss fight is kind of what you make it. What we've done is we've given the tools to the creators to build bosses. There's a really good example in as a level that you may or may not have played; I think it's called Bombs Galore, and it's got this really amazing boss fight that really feels like a climactic moment. But all we're doing is providing those pieces to let a level creator make that kind of thing in the way they want.</p>
<p><strong>What can you tell me about character progression?</strong></p>
<p>In the game, you have something called the road to stardom. You're ranking up through the levels, and as you rank up, you unlock new features, new moves, new weapons, and special moves, and then within that, you can rank up your weapon archetypes, and you unlock various different things there. The core game, even if you don't engage with the UGC side of it at all, making or playing, what we're delivering is a good 30 to 40 hours of campaign and progression.</p>
<p><strong>So there's also a campaign.</strong></p>
<p>There are some single-player campaign levels that you can play, and that's where we can do narrative development and story, as well as the League, which is your progress through growing fame.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned talents, right? Is there a player role system where you can be a support character, for example?</strong></p>
<p>That comes with your loadout. There are different weapons that are better or worse at different roles. You have a system called trinkets, which are like buffs for weapons, and you can also choose your kind of special move loadout as well. The idea here is that you can choose what you like, but then you start a level, and there's also like a little weapon locker, and it's like a vending machine; you can then go and change it once you're in the level if, as a team of four, you think you want to be more of a support type of character. So, it's not a character class thing. But it's more of an organic way to reconfigure your loadout.</p>
<p><strong>I know King of Meat is a co-op game, but what if one player could be the Dungeon Master? Did you think of that type of asymmetrical PvP experience?</strong></p>
<p>It's not the game we're launching with. I think there's loads of game modes and ideas that we plan to do post-release, and we'll talk about that more another time.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about the game's post-launch live service, what kind of additions can players anticipate?</strong></p>
<p>We've got a roadmap of one, two, and three years out where we've got a content plan for new weapon skins, weapon archetypes, more campaign levels, more example levels and cosmetics and so forth. We know what we want to do and how we want to do it, but we also want to listen to the community and see what they really want us to focus on.&nbsp;Do they want a new feature? Do they want a new creative mode? Are they really passionate about a particular skin or something that we can support?</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about whether these updates will be free or not?</strong></p>
<p>We are not going to delve too much in there at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Is there going to be an in-game store with microtransactions?</strong></p>
<p>It's only for the cosmetics. We've all been very clear that we're not doing a battle pass, and there is no pay to progress or pay to win.</p>
<p><strong>So you're not adopting a season system?</strong></p>
<p>Not in the battle pass way.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We've got an event system in the game where we could have a competition on making the best Halloween level, and then at the end of the competition, we feature those levels on a rotation and then you go into the Halloween event, and you can play all the best levels.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will you release themed updates, like Halloween, for King of Meat?</strong></p>
<p>That's the plan. We've got an event system in the game where we could have a competition on making the best Halloween level, and then at the end of the competition, we feature those levels on a rotation and then you go into the Halloween event, and you can play all the best levels. We've got a lot of plans for that sort of seasonal content.</p>
<p><strong>With this event system, will you also add themed props, etc., for level creators?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly, that's perfect. Going back to the Halloween thing and maybe there's pumpkins and Jack-o'-lanterns and skeleton outfits.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaiserpunk-delayed-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Overseer Games has announced a delay for&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, its upcoming alternate-history grand strategy city-builder, and it's a fairly significant delay as well.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2012190/view/4595449146464414178" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, which was originally intended to launch in the third quarter of this year, will now be arriving on February 27th, 2025 instead. Overseer says this decision came "after a lot of careful consideration and many days with our thinking caps on".</p>
<p>The studio says that it considered an Early Access release for&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, but that "for a game like&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, we believe it's crucial for players to experience the entire journey in the best possible light".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kaiserpunk-delayed-map.jpg?itok=p9e_sY0J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kaiserpunk-delayed-map.jpg?itok=7veau_He 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to cook.</figcaption></figure><p>Lead designer&nbsp;Danijel Mihokovic goes on to say that even if publishers "don't recognize the potential" of&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>or are "too hesitant to try something genuinely new", he and his studio don't want to compromise their vision.</p>
<p>To that end, lots of new features have been added to&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>'s core design based on player feedback. These features include new biomes, a heritage system, and an "intricate trading system", as well as "significant optimization work".</p>
<p>If you're looking for more information about&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, Overseer says it will release a series of dev diary-style feature articles that will explore various aspects of the game's mechanics, worldbuilding, and development process.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be an opportunity to playtest&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>at some point in the near future, although Overseer doesn't disclose exactly when that will be. Watch this space.</p>

<p>Developer and publisher Overseer Games is promising the opportunity to build complex production and logistics chains that span "the length of the game", as well as 100 different resources to gather and transform into everything from zeppelins through to bombers.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of games like Paradox's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hearts-of-iron-iv"><em>Hearts of Iron</em></a>, then you'll likely find plenty to love here.&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2012190/Kaiserpunk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on February 27th.

Other times you might allude toward fast food. In this instance, my trite and overused analogy is a great big buffet offering of all your favorite foods, where you just grab handfuls of everything and stuff it in until you’re sick. That, in the best way possible, is <em>Wild Bastards</em>.<br></p><p>Ostensibly a follow-up to developer Blue Manchu’s 2019 game <em>Void Bastards</em>, but defiantly not a sequel, <em>Wild Bastards</em> is a large part old-school FPS action, with a hefty helping of <em>Slay The Spire</em>, and then embellished with tactical strategy. It mimics the behavior of a thousand rogue-lites, but certainly isn’t one, throwing you into super-difficult first-person action sequences that last only a minute or two each and encouraging you to carefully craft elaborate teams of specifically equipped characters, before undoing all your work between every chapter. And it all absolutely works.</p><figure id="" data-id="41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-recommend-id="image://41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider Rosa shoots at an enemy, causing a large spark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spider Rosa shoots at an enemy, causing a large spark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-recommend-id="image://41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider Rosa shoots at an enemy, causing a large spark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s tempting to spend too long comparing <em>Wild Bastards</em> to its predecessor, putting ticks and crosses next to the aspects it shares and doesn’t, but I think this undermines both. And despite the visual similarity, and that both have a branching map of locations leading to FPS-based missions, they are starkly different. So let’s focus on what <em>Wild Bastards </em>is, rather than what it isn’t.</p><p>You begin the game with two characters, the four-armed, somewhat demonic Spider Rosa, and gambling robot Casino. The pair are attempting to escape the Chaste family of twisted evil cowboy types by fleeing through the galaxy in their spaceship. When beaming down to a (tutorial) planet where the two must make their way across a map to reach a spot that lets them beam back to their craft, one of the Chastes, McNeil, destroys the ship and attempts to capture them. At this point, a legendary ship called Drifter swoops in and rescues them, and forces them on a journey to recover the life forces of former colleagues killed by monstrous patriarch Jebediah Chaste. Which is to say, each chapter of the game is about reaching the end of a small, branching sector of space to collect the DNA of the fallen, then revive them and add them to your crew.</p><p>Each point on the sector map you opt to fly to has a planet you must beam down to, and each of these planets has its own map with branching, intersecting locations, points variously filled with pick-ups, stores, and most importantly, battles to win. Each of these battles is a mini-FPS location, where you take on collections of enemies with your crew. Except—and bear with me, there’s a <em>lot</em> of explaining to do here—your gang travels a planet in “bunches,” grouped in ones or twos, with no more than four selected for any drop. You can bunch them as you wish, but when you’re battling, only one is fighting at any time—however, you can switch between either in the group on the fly. You then need to make use of your ears (and the game’s visual representation of sound on the compass) to locate the enemies, who’ll hide but endlessly give themselves away by shouting insults or having conversations with each other…Oh god, this game is so much easier to play than to describe.</p><figure id="" data-id="0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-recommend-id="image://0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Warping screen, showing your victories." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Warping screen, showing your victories." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-recommend-id="image://0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Warping screen, showing your victories." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If a character dies in battle, they’re dead until you either get back on Drifter and revive them with a rare potion, or if you lose everyone and travel back to the beginning of the sector, or succeed without them and move on to the next sector, whereupon everyone is revived. Except, in both instances, you also lose all the many pieces of equipment you’ve won, bought or picked up, and previously assigned among your crew, along with any money, potions, bonus items, or…beans.</p><p>Except, or, or, except, but, or, except, and my goodness. I’ve not even gotten into the Ace cards you pick up that permanently improve a character, or the Juice you find in battles that allows each to perform their special ability, or how you want to make sure you pair up a long-range one-shot shooter like furious robot Judge with a more rapid-fire but less precise crewmember like mysterious alien Roswell, and if it’s a drop where only three can go, use Casino and his Juice ability to instantly kill the enemy he’s facing, or ghostly pastor Preach who wields the ludicrously ammo-heavy Sermon .58 and who has no shields but can use Juice to heal when she kills. Oh, but also, if your&nbsp;battle is going to be against a bunch of Critters rather than humanoids, you’d be crazy to use snake-like Hopalong and his laser lasso, but he’d be perfect if it’s just against a couple of heavy Ironclads.</p><figure id="" data-id="17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-recommend-id="image://17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A science-fictiony base, with smoke and guns and shooting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A science-fictiony base, with smoke and guns and shooting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-recommend-id="image://17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A science-fictiony base, with smoke and guns and shooting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I hope, if somewhat laboriously, I’ve made my point. <em>Wild Bastards</em> is extraordinarily involved, layers upon layers upon layers, with tactics to develop for all its elements. The range of characters is elaborate, eventually offering you 12 to pick from, and even <em>this</em> has added layers of complications, as the wonderfully written and voiced crew will have fallings-out with one another at unscripted points, meaning they’ll refuse to bunch with each other until they make up over…a plate of beans. Or they may bond during one of the squillions of conversations that can occur (I’ve never heard the same one twice), and work better together, supporting the other by dropping items into the arena.</p><p>I’ve also failed to celebrate the ever-larger menagerie of enemies to battle, an extraordinary 25 humanoids (Chasteners), 11 animals (Critters), and five types of automated security bots, each with unique behaviors, weapons, and defenses. Let alone that each Bastard on your crew moves subtly differently, some faster, some able to jump higher, one slithering rapidly on his belly. Like I say, this game has taken something from every section of the buffet, and somehow fit it all on one delicious plate.</p><figure id="" data-id="93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-recommend-id="image://93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sector map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sector map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-recommend-id="image://93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sector map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are, of course, concerns. While the combat is a lot of fun, and even more so for the incredible variety on offer, I do think it lacks punchy impact on hitting enemies. It feels too often like they’re able to run through your fire unharmed, and there’s a lack of satisfying oof when you clip them. It makes things feel a little too ethereal.</p><p>Poison is ludicrously overpowered, and the levels with poison-spitting Rattlers can be miserable to get through until you’ve rescued some of the later crew members, the ongoing damage they deal being far too punishing. The other, rather more significant gripe, is that there’s a missing difficulty sweet spot between Normal and Easy. Normal can be a surprisingly tough choice, especially early on, as the game makes obsessed use of poison as you’re just getting going with two or three characters, and it can feel dispiriting. But Easy is genuinely easy, and lacks enough challenge. (Clearly there are those who’ll excel on Hard and Very Hard, and god bless them.) I wish that Normal were ever-so slightly less punishing at the beginning. I recommend switching back up to it when you’re just breezing through levels, however, because that’s to miss the point.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-recommend-id="image://26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shooting at Critters at the general store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shooting at Critters at the general store." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-recommend-id="image://26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shooting at Critters at the general store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The other odd decision is to force you to play through the tutorial every run. Even switched to “Off” in the menu, the opening level remains required, and it’s pretty tedious when you’re on your third or fourth run (something made far worse for me by my having hammered through the demo of this multiple times earlier this year).</p><p>Oh, but if you’re an impatient bugger like me, know that hitting Escape will skip you past the grindingly slow beam up and down sequences and post-battle reports. Just don’t ever use it on the conversations, because they’re all brilliant.</p><p>There, I barely compared it to the brilliant <em>Void Bastards</em> at all, although I urge you to play both. It’s tempting to call <em>Wild Bastards</em> an evolution, but that’s unfair to <em>Void</em>, which has its excellent crafting elements and the permadeath of characters (albeit with persistent progress). What’s crucially similar about both, beyond the excellent art and fantastic sense of humor, is that unlike so many roguelite games, they both <em>want you to win</em>. They’re about progressing forward, being able to reach an ending, and then starting all over to try it completely differently. It’s just that in <em>Wild Bastards</em>, there’s so much more that can be different each time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Could the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series be making a comeback in some fashion? In a new episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIEpU0EF0XI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mythical Kitchen</a> released on Thursday, the legendary skateboarder was asked about the future of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater franchise as it celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. </p>



<p>Hawk said that there is definitely “something” planned to celebrate the anniversary. However, he wouldn’t say much more beyond that.</p>



<p>“I wish I could tell you more,” Hawk said. “But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p>After a bit more back-and-forth on it, Hawk wrapped up with saying that he believes it’ll be something that “the fans will truly appreciate”.</p>



<p>Whether that is a brand new game entirely or the planned then canceled Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3/4 remake remains to be seen. Back in 2022, Hawk confirmed that the plan was to release another remake before developer Vicarious Visions was absorbed into Activision.</p>



<p>What do you think is next for the Pro Skater franchise? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>Flappy Bird, the infuriating mobile game, is set to make a return later this year.</p>
<p>The game grew to tremendous popularity with over 100 million people playing it, but in 2014 original developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-bird-dev-is-removing-popular-app-for-some-reason">Dong Nguyen removed the game from sale</a> despite it generating a reported $50,000 a day in advertising revenue.</p>
<p>A decade later and Flappy Bird will return this autumn, followed by dedicated mobile apps coming to iOS and Android next year, as well as other platforms.</p>

<p>The game's return is thanks to the Flappy Bird Foundation, a team of fans "committed to sharing the game with the world". Together with affiliates, the team has acquired the official rights from Gametech Holdings as well as the rights to Piou Piou vs Cactus - a mobile game long credited as the inspiration behind Flappy Bird.</p>
<p>The new version will include new game modes, characters, and even multiplayer challenges.</p>
<p>"It's been a decade-long, convoluted journey to get here, but we're so excited to finally begin sharing Flappy Bird once again with the world," said a spokesperson for the Flappy Bird Foundation.</p>
<p>Michael Roberts, the chief creative behind Flappy Bird’s return, added: "We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!"</p>

<p>The developer of Piou Piou, Kek, added: "Today is a milestone not just in gaming but for me personally. It's so cool to see how influential Piou Piou has been for developers and hundreds of millions of gamers over the years. It's incredible to work alongside such a dedicated team of fans and creators who are truly passionate about changing the industry narrative and together bringing the original Flappy Bird back to life."</p>
<p>So <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-creator-of-flappy-bird-pulled-the-game-from-sale">why did Nguyen pull the game from sale</a>? "Flappy Bird was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed," he said at the time. "But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down Flappy Bird. It's gone forever."</p>
<p>Flappy Bird was a viral sensation on release, but its return is certainly a surprise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
