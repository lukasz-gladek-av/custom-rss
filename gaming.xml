            <p>Switch strategy RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/triangle-strategy">Triangle Strategy</a> has been removed from the Nintendo eShop for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Although the 2022 game is still available on Steam, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed via X/Twitter that for now, it is "temporarily unavailable" for Nintendo Switch. Players who have already purchased it, however, can still download it at their leisure .</p>

<p>Square Enix did not expand on why the game had been withdrawn from sale on the Nintendo eShop, nor give any indication of when it will return. </p>
<p>"Triangle Strategy is temporarily unavailable to purchase on Nintendo Switch eShop," wrote Square Enix. "Those who have already bought the game will be able to download it.</p> <div>

<p>"We are working on this and will update when the game is able to be purchased again."</p>
<p>A similar issue happened with Square Enix's RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> back in March. That too was temporarily delisted after it switched publisher between Nintendo and Square Enix.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Nintendo and will update as and when we find out more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/triangle-strategy-sells-800k-globally-in-two-weeks">Triangle Strategy sold 800k copies globally in its first two weeks</a>, 200k of which were sold in Japan and Asia alone.</p>
<p>In Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/triangle-strategy-review-an-enjoyably-complex-tale-of-a-battle-over-salt">Triangle Strategy review</a>, we said that "despite moving slowly in both its story and in combat, Triangle Strategy ultimately rewards your patience".

If you’ve been holding out for incredible discounts, now’s the time to act—these prices aren’t likely to drop any further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of standout deals, especially for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-games-under-30-black-friday-2024">Switch games under $30</a>, making it a fantastic opportunity to expand your collection.

That means if you’re planning to download both games, you’ll be pretty close to filling up the original Switch’s storage. That’s where a high-capacity memory card comes in, and trust us, it’s no longer just a luxury—it’s a must-have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news? Some of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-sd-cards-for-nintendo-switch">top recommended SD cards</a> for the Switch are part of the Cyber Monday deals, making it the ideal time to grab one at a great price.

The company is now projecting 12.5 million units sold, down from the previous estimate of 13.5 million. This comes as Nintendo reported a 17% drop in revenue and a 69% profit decline compared to the same quarter last year. For the six months ending September 30, Nintendo sold 4.72 million Switch units, down from 6.84 million in the previous year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the software side, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has sold 2.58 million copies, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe saw a 2.31 million increase, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door reached 1.94 million, and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD sold 1.57 million copies during the April to September 2024 period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other news, Nintendo confirmed that the upcoming Switch 2 will be backward-compatible with original Switch games and will support Nintendo Switch Online. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa revealed this at the company’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, though further details about the successor's full features are expected after its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analysts-say-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-now-unlikely-before-end-of-2024">official announcement</a>, which is slated for before March 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was the in-store shopping frenzy, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday focused on online deals</a>. While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-cyber-monday-best-deals-2024">Xbox</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-playstation-cyber-monday-deals-2024">PS5 deals</a> are also now live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the same deals from Black Friday normally return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including some that sold out or expired. Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event. This means Cyber Monday will bring back popular deals alongside brand-new, never-before-seen offers. But, most importantly, Cyber Monday is the final day of the Black Friday, November, sale season, with all the deals going with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

December brings a shiny new Mewtwo card to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>, if you're a subscriber to to the game's Premium Pass. 
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon TCG Pocket Premium pass costs £7.99 ($9.99) and allows you to open an extra card pack per day, as well as gain access to exclusive premium missions and rewards. 
</p>
<p>
The latest of these rewards are now live, as of 1st December - perhaps suggesting a monthly addition going forwards. Subscribers can simply log in to claim their Mewtwo promo, plus some cute Pikachu card accessories, anytime from now until 31st December.
</p>
<p>
For those who aren't subscribers, you're not missing a card that's going to change the game's meta. This is the same Mewtwo with the same stats and attack as in the game already, albeit with different card artwork. It looks snazzy, though.
</p>

<p>
Fancy a promo card but aren't a subscriber? Well, the game's ongoing Venusaur drop event is live now until 13th December. You'll need to participate in solo AI battles for a chance at promo cards including a special version of Venusaur that does look rather lovely indeed.
</p>

<p>
Of the two dozen promo cards currently in the game's files, only two remain unreleased. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-cards-joining-pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-ahead-of-december-events">Promo versions of Bulbasaur and Magnemite are expected by fans to become available from a Wonder Pick event</a> beginning next week. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-booster-packs-available-before-end-of-year">Pokémon TCG Pocket will add the ability to trade cards</a> with other players at the start of 2025, its developer has confirmed. Before then, the game will also be refreshed with the launch of new booster packs due "by the end of the year".

<p>Version 0.75, which can be downloaded for free from Nexus Mods, introduces some visual improvements via more gparam edits for each area, parallax occlusion mapping for certain surfaces in Central Yharnam, Cathedral Ward and a few other areas, and some upgraded textures.</p>
<p>Shortly following the release of the new version of the Bloodborne Remaster Project, the developer behind the project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, shared a new video on YouTube providing a look at the current state of development. Needless to say, the future is definitely looking good for the project, as the visual upgrades it will continue to bring wouldn't have looked amiss in an official remaster.</p>

<p>If it weren't for the quick development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-the-last-guardian/">ShadPS4 emulator</a>, Bloodborne would have continued to be playable only on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Unfortunately, despite the huge demand, Sony doesn't seem interested in officially bringing the game to PC anytime soon, so playing the game via the emulator seems like it will be the only way to go for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Bloodborne is now available on PlayStation 4 worldwide. The game can also be played on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, with some minor visual improvements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-much-more-excited-for-avowed-after-hearing-the-team-say-that-what-makes-rpgs-special-is-missable-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>‘Confident’ game design is one of those slightly fluffy critic words I sometimes find myself reaching for tenuously, knowing that - sigh - I’m going to have to do all sort of detestable nonsense like ‘back up my vague assertion with concrete examples that are useful to the reader’ if I do. Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.</p>
<p>It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I <em>am</em> smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/obsidians-new-first-person-rpg-avowed-channels-baldurs-gate-3-in-one-key-way-the-core-of-rpgs-that-makes-them-special-is-missable-content/">GamesRadar</a>.</p>

<p>The "core of RPGs that makes them special is missable content, to be honest, and it makes the experience feel so much more personal to how you play the game," Ritger says. You might find something special, but a mate finds something else instead. "It creates a very interesting dialog about the game," Ritger says, "and it makes your experience feel more personal to you."</p><p>For Avowed specifically, they’re aiming to allow for this with vertical environments. "We want to draw your attention to things we want you to engage with," says Ritger. "Like the lighthouse is very tall, and so everybody's going to see a big, tall thing and want to go climb. And so we want to support that as well. And you can do that, and you can jump off into the ocean, if you like. And so we try to draw your attention that way."</p>
<p>The irony of me just now saying that I like games that trust my intelligence, then Ritger saying “gamer brain make want climb big tall thing” is not lost on me. But he’s right, dammit.</p>
<p>This approach to design does, of course, raise a bit of a Schrodinger’s Cat: how am I supposed to enjoy content I don’t know is there? But the example I always find myself going back to is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> renegade/paragon conundrum. It’s well documented that something like 90% of players chose to play as paragon Shepard, which sounds like an enormous waste of resources on the surface, but it was having the option to deck a reporter that made your restraint feel all the more heroic.</p>
<p>On the development side, it’s also a matter of resources - which, as Larian’s Sven Vincke <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-tease-future-non-dd-games-say-morale-is-super-high-were-doing-our-own-thing-again">has pointed out before</a> to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/">PC Gamer</a> - can be a hard sell to publishers:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you see it, it'll scare you, as a shareholder, as a publisher, the very first thing you will try to do is get it under control—you will try to scope it, you will try to box it, you will try to control it, which is exactly the opposite of what we want to do. Because it's like, why are we spending a million dollars on a dragon, which nobody's ever going to see, except like five people who made that obscure choice? Because if they see it, they have to be happy too. So that's why I put the bloody dragon there, because that's the logical consequence of the things that they've done.</p></blockquote>
<p>How well Avowed will actually make good on this promise, and how much of this talk is easy piggybacking on excitement for another game that does wot Baldur’s Gate 3 done, we’ll have to wait and see. It looks like the game might have bigger issues, too. “There's also a broken-up sluggishness to it all,” is how Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-rickety-combat-feels-like-the-undoing-of-its-lush-fungal-world">felt about combat</a>. “Animations don't flow together very charismatically, which lends a curious, stuttery cadence to the ducking and diving.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/loco-motive-review.1049403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/02/loco-motive-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Loco Motive is a brand new point and click adventure that turns to the classics for its inspiration, providing an intriguing murder mystery for players to solve aboard a lavish locomotive – hey, that’s the name of the game! This is a detective story where none of the three main player characters are proper detectives. Instead, the case of a murder on a train is left to be solved by Arther Ackerman, an estates attorney, Herman Merman, a novelist who fancies himself as a detecitive, and Diana, an inexperienced agent.</p>
<p><iframe title="Loco Motive - Launch Trailer | OUT NOW on PC &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tptsZ7UD5GQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Loco Motive takes place on a luxury train called the Reuss Express, owned by the Unterwald family. This family made its fortune in trains, and is headed by the matriarch Lady Unterwald. At her ripe old age, she has decided to pass on her legacy but, before the big reveal of who her heir will be, she is murdered! Cue panic and subterfuge as the guests on the train try to figure out what is going on, while the murderer tries to keep away from the spotlight. It is not an original idea for a murder mystery – Murder on the Orient Express might even be considered the most famous of them all – but the premise is a classic for a reason.</p>


<p>You first step into the shoes of&nbsp;Arthur Ackerman, who had been tasked by Lady Unterwald to update and maintain her will. Arthur is a bit of innocent soul who loves nothing more than bureaucracy and sorting paperwork. He can also be a bit bumbling but is definitely the most lovable and endearing of the three characters. That may be because you play as him for the largest portion of Loco Motive, meaning you get to know him better.</p>
<p>Then there’s Herman Merman, a novelist who thinks he is a detective and has an over inflated ego. He is also a memorable character, mostly because he shouts his name a lot, though he can be grating and was unlikeable at times too. You spend the least amount of time with Diana, a first time field agent. She’s a likeable character too, especially as she learns how to work in the field. Of the three, Arthur will be the favourite of the majority.</p>


<p>What is great across all three characters, and the supporting cast, is the voice acting. Each character has a distinct personality because of the voices they have been given and it elevates the experience of Loco Motive. This in turn makes the comedy of Loco Motive stand out too, with absurd situations made funnier because of the excellent delivery by the actors.</p>
<p>A point and click adventure has to have puzzles in it that are headscratchers – something a little bit obtuse, but that can ultimately be worked out by a player. For the majority of Loco Motive, the puzzles toe that particular line, encouraging out of the box thinking to figure out solutions. There were a couple of puzzles though that did really stretch the thinking, eventually leading to needing help from the hint service, making you wonder how you would have solved the problem without clicking items randomly to get the right result.</p>
<p>As a clever twist, the hint service is incorporated into the world of Loco Motive. It is a service run by an actual detective who you call up and he gives advice. The first time you call for a hint for a specific puzzle he will give a small clue, laying the breadcrumbs to nudge you in the right direction. Keep asking and the clues pretty much point out the answer. Having Herman call this detective is fun, as Herman does not like him.</p>

<p>Loco Motive has a very good art style, one that will be familiar to those who have any experience with 2D point and click adventures of yesteryear. You do not have to worry about trying to click on everything in a scene to see if you can interact with it, as you can highlight all of these items in a room, meaning there’s less wasted time.</p>
<p>There are a couple of moments when Loco Motive can fall down slightly, such as the hint system not being available to help with a couple of scenarios, and an instruction box on how to switch between characters not disappearing from the screen. Within the narrative, some characters will discuss things with you about situations that are yet to come to pass, which can lead to some confusion about what to do next.</p>

            <p>Last week, Brendy left a note in our weekly Maw liveblog about <a href="https://kernelmethod.org/notes/qud_worldmap/">a player-made map</a> of Caves Of Qud, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">reportedly excellent</a> sci-fi roguelike RPG that lets you "chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations", represented as 2D <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>-esque layouts. Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.</p>
<p>"Is Caves Of Qud <em>really</em> 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.</p><!--more-->
<p>In fact, Caves Of Qud is bottomless. The game's world is partly procedurally generated, adding more levels as you descend, and the only real constraint is hardware. "You can go, in practical terms, till your computer's storage fills up with zones you've visited," Bucklew told me over email. The game is designed with a certain depth in mind, he added, but if you insist on burrowing further, the systems for generating encounters, treasure and so forth will strive to support this. "The designed max is about 50 levels deep but beyond that it is effectively limitless, and some of the parameters like rarity of encounters continue to grade with depth up to the maximum integer sizes."</p>
<p>Unearthing strange items is, of course, one of the principle incentives to keep digging. "I'm not sure the deepest place players have been," Bucklew went on. "But advanced players abusing the endgame absolutely go at least hundreds of levels deep using tools like spiral borers, typically to farm for extremely rare occurrences in the deep caves, like finding cryogenic clones of yourself, duplicating your inventory, and doing that several times."</p><p>The challenge is that Caves Of Qud's code grows more erratic with depth, as though the critical workings were being crushed and suffocated by the sheer weight of rock. While poking around for stories about Qud spelunking, I've stumbled on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cavesofqud/comments/17u459b/how_deep_down_can_you_go/">Reddit threads</a> about zones where every room contains a merchant, together with more routine complaints about laggy performance.</p>
<p>Bucklew acknowledges that obsessive delvers will face a variety of technical hiccups. "This is factually true and I've received several bug reports and performance reports from players doing this," he said. "One of the key performance cases for the new UI was a save game from a player who had transformed into a crystalline monstrosity and descended at least 500 levels deep and duplicated their inventory 8 or 9 times, and was running into performance issues stepping on a stack of yet another clone with thousands of items."</p>
<p>I'm not sure I personally have the patience, or leftover lifespan, to play 2,147,483,646 levels of Caves Of Qud. But I do love the idea of a world without a bottom: there's something both harrowing and comforting about the knowledge that you can always keep digging. I also love terrain generators that misbehave when you roam too far, as with <a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/discussion/2891447-how-to-get-to-the-far-lands-easy-fast-and-without">the horizon-wide walls of Junji Ito-ass geology</a> encountered in certain editions of Minecraft. It's as though you were slowly transiting between the realms of two gods - the god of art, craft and intentionality, and the god of luck, white noise and decay.</p>
<p>Anyway, Caves Of Qud <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/">leaves early access on 5th December</a>, and seems likely to entertain even if you confine yourself resolutely to the surface. Prodigious catacombs aside, it's got mushroom infestations, goat-charming, spider possession, and "a novel’s worth of handwritten lore". The existing version is already one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The grind for experience points (XP) and ‘prestige’ (resetting progress and leveling up all over again after hitting 55) is part of the Call of Duty experience, and for many is the driving motivation to play for months, sometimes years on end. But a player already hitting the maximum possible level, with Black Ops 6 little over a month old, was thought impossible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's because of the astronomical amount of XP required to hit level 1,000 (approx 50 million XP). Once you Prestige 10 times you can graduate to become a Prestige Master, which unlocks an extra 1,000 levels to grind. Hitting level 1,000 Prestige Master is the end point of the entire Black Ops 6 grind, and brings with it a set of exclusive rewards that were unknown to the community, until now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">1000 Unlocked <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cod?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#cod</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nukesquad?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#nukesquad</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mogged?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#mogged</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CallofDuty?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CallofDuty</a> <a href="https://t.co/JPIAXDbU3O" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JPIAXDbU3O</a></p>— Beamishh (@Beamishhhhhhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/Beamishhhhhhh/status/1863315265523499422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The player in question created an X / Twitter account to discuss what they had achieved, and even published a <a href="https://streamable.com/dxwbjk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> showing off the rewards. The X / Twitter user, called ‘Beamishh,’ subsequently admitted to using “Zombies glitches,” to hit level 1,000 already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Black Ops 6’s release players have used the PvE Zombies mode to farm XP because it's much quicker than playing Multiplayer or Warzone (XP progress is shared across all three experiences). And within Zombies mode, various away from keyboard (AFK) glitches and exploits have been discovered that let players leave their console or PC running as their character obtains XP from infinite waves of zombie enemies. And that’s exactly what Aldredd / Beamishh did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is this a problem? Some Black Ops 6 players were racing to become the first to hit Prestige Master level 1,000 and thus reveal the rewards themselves. Indeed, entire groups of players were working together to reveal the rewards first through legitimate play. One such group, called Nuke Squad, is made up of Call of Duty streamers who are sharing their accounts in order to hit the coveted milestone, but are now complaining about Beamishh getting there first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One member of Nuke Squad, called Santana, <a href="https://x.com/TheBoiSantana/status/1863332192019157224" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say they were “robbed.” “So saddening to see zombie exploiters ruin the level 1,000 rewards,” they said. “Nuke Squad has streamed every single game since the game released and for it to be robbed and posted all over social media is so disheartening. It’s also sad that the company didn’t really do anything about these exploiters even though we all knew what was going on in the background. GGs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Santana’s tweet has itself fueled the row, with some in the community pointing out that while Beamishh used Zombies glitches to hit level 1,000, Nuke Squad were trying to hit the same milestone by account sharing, which violates Call of Duty’s terms of service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Santana <a href="https://x.com/TheBoiSantana/status/1863356600284742088" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> to this suggestion by claiming that Call of Duty publisher Activision had told Nuke Squad that its members were allowed to account share for the race, but were restricted to no more than six people, and no more than eight hours for each person playing. This itself has caused some to wonder why an exception was made for Call of Duty streamers and content creators, leaving regular players with a disadvantage or facing a potential ban for employing the same tactic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The row shows no sign of stopping either, with both Beamishh and Santana continuing to have their say online. Beamishh <a href="https://x.com/Beamishhhhhhh/status/1863377291515936833" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denied</a> cheating (“I’m just doing zombies glitches mate idk why you’re so tilted”) but <a href="https://x.com/Beamishhhhhhh/status/1863344500426330397" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> “there’s nothing impressive about my 1,000.” Santana has <a href="https://x.com/TheBoiSantana/status/1862530908609552688" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> Zombies AFK exploiters could get banned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Prestige Master Level 1,000 spoilers follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rewards, some are saying they tease the next Call of Duty game, which is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-reportedly-a-black-ops-2-sequel-set-around-2030">reportedly a Black Ops 2 sequel set around 2030</a>. They include a skin for Operator Eric Samuels, a Secret Service agent from Black Ops 2. The skin is called 'New Orders' and looks like it includes future tech. The weapon blueprint is called Enigma Tech, and includes the following description: "Get a glimpse of the day after tomorrow with the Enigma Tech Weapon Blueprint."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1863358638577889766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The speculation now is that Activision and Black Ops developer Treyarch had hoped it would take at least half a year for players to hit Prestige Master Level 1,000, around about the time it planned to pull back the curtain on next year’s Call of Duty. Samuels, it seems, will play a role in that game. All this will make sense in time, but for Activision, perhaps, this particular breadcrumb was discovered sooner than expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode?

            <p>Visions of Mana director Ryosuke Yoshida has departed NetEase to assume a new position with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement on X/Twitter, Yoshida thanked NetEase and his development team for their support, but confirmed he quit the Chinese megacorp at the end of October and will join Square Enix in December.</p>
<p>Whilst Yoshida had been employed at NetEase subsidiary Ouka Studios, Visions of Mana was published by Square Enix - the company he has now joined.</p>

<p>Yoshida stopped short of revealing what position he will take on at Square Enix, or what game or franchise he may be working on.</p>
<p>The news comes after Ouka Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-developer-ouka-studios-reportedly-set-to-close-days-after-games-release">had "all but a handful of jobs" cut</a> by parent company NetEase.</p>

            <p>One of the many high concept ludonarrative experiments I’d one day like to bring to fruition is an immersive sim in which the player has access to many guns, but their default arsenal selection is an open packet of crisps which they hold out in front of them, in first person, and offer to NPCs. Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyperdrive-inn">Hyperdrive Inn</a>. It’s an avant garde point and click <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.</p>

<p>Hyperdrive Inn released this Sunday passed, a nonchalant testament to Finnish cosiness if ever there was one, and there’s a demo still available on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561260/Hyperdrive_Inn/">Steam page</a>. What else might we find on this page? Oh! It’s a description. Wonderful.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your father has triggered a set of cataclysmic events and escaped into the depths of his creation, the infinite hotel of Hyperdrive Inn. It's up to you to find him and save the world in the process. The ever-growing accommodation behemoth known as Hyperdrive Inn is your father’s creation, and he is also responsible for triggering a set of cataclysmic events that threaten to destroy everything in existence.</p></blockquote>
<p>The game also promises “brain-twisting puzzles”, some randomised content for replays, and a Finnish folk music score. I’ve queued up the demo myself, but do let me know if any crisps are involved. Google tells me a famous Finnish snack is the ‘Karelian’, which is basically mashed potato in a pie. Carbs on carbs, you say? Somehow, this speaks to my British soul.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Arrowhead's Helldivers 2 made a big splash at launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling</a> over 12 million units between PC and PlayStation 5 in its first three months on the market. Player numbers dwindled afterward due to a few underwhelming patches, but they have since risen back slightly.</p>
<p>In a year without standard-setting game releases, it is not that surprising to see that Helldivers 2 managed to win the Game of the Year award (as well as the Best Visual Design and Best Technical Innovation categories) at the yearly TIGA Awards, hosted last week at Shoreditch Town Hall in London by the UK's games industry trade association.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Richard Wilson OBE, CEO of TIGA, stated: The TIGA Games Industry Awards 2024 showcase the incredible talent, innovation, and passion that define the UK games industry. Our Awards recognise excellence in studios of all sizes, super service providers and outstanding educational institutions. Congratulations to all the winners, nominees, and the entire community for making this such a vibrant and pioneering industry. Your achievements set the stage for an exciting 2025 in the UK games sector. I would also like to say a very special ‘thank you’ to our generous sponsors, who make the Awards possible.</em></p>
<p>Beyond Helldivers 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellblade II</a> also managed to snatch a couple of awards. You can find the full list of winners below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-new-steam-review-rating/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>No Man’s Sky has passed into the realm of ‘Very Positive’ on Steam after eight years on the market. The space-faring epic is one of the biggest rags-to-riches stories in gaming, and after eight years of solid updates and continuous content drops, it has managed to bump itself up a notch on the popular PC platform.</p>



<p>At launch, No Man’s Sky was crushed by negative reviews and paltry feedback that left players dismayed. The game had been a long time coming, and when it was released, it was in a shambolic state that put people off almost instantly.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-skyrocketing">Skyrocketing</h2>



<p>When Hello Games released No Man’s Sky, something of a panic took place. The developer became reclusive and impossible to reach, and the negative reviews continued piling up. The earliest updates failed to patch most of the game’s major problems, and the ambitious title became a laughing stock.</p>



<p>Over time, things stabilised, and the content was flowing regularly enough to keep a solid base of users entertained. By today, Hello Games has released a string of major updates that have left fans gobsmacked. With each new update, memes surface about Hello Games being <strong>too </strong>generous, with fans stressing that they’d happily pay for these sizeable expansions.</p>



<p>On Steam, No Man’s Sky just passed into ‘Very Positive’ where its all-time review count is concerned. It took this long to turn the numbers around, but today, the game is looking at a slew of reviews that are 82.1% positive, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>When the game came out, only 30 – 40% of the reviews were positive.</p>



<p>That’s a turnaround tale for the history books.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Tablet devices have come a long way over the last decade, but if you're looking for a quality screen, you're going to have to fork out some big cash for it. Fortunately, this Cyber Monday deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMPSWMJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo M11 tablet</a> is a tempting one, as you can pick up a budget tablet for just $140, a 30% discount when compared to its regular $200 asking price.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lenovo M11 Tablet</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>$140 (<del>$200</del>)</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4407478-lenovo-m11-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4407478" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4407478-lenovo-m11-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4407478"></a><figcaption>Lenovo M11</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4407478-lenovo-m11-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Lenovo M11 is an 11-inch tablet with a 1920 x 1200 90Hz screen. Specs-wise, it has 4GB of RAM, and an internal SSD storage capacity of 64GB that can be expanded with an SD card. While there are certainly more powerful tablets on the market, this is a great choice for standard, every-day use, especially if you're looking for something to handle simple functions like web browsing, video streaming. It's also a nice option for kids who might be too old for one of Amazon's Kindle tablets, as it comes with a pen that can be used to take notes and create art, similar to the iPad and the Apple Pencil.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">If you need something more durable, Amazon is also selling a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMGKBK9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">version of this tablet for $160 that comes with a folio case</a>, so for the extra cash, you're getting a nice layer of protection with your purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">Another affordable tablet you can check out during Cyber Monday is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF3VPMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ for $149</a> (was $220). It has a sharp 11-inch screen 64GB of internal storage capacity that can also be expanded through its MicroSD card slot, and it has a long-lasting battery. Don't expect resource-intensive apps to run smoothly on this, but again, if you're looking to browse the web, stream some TV shows, and do some social media scrolling, this is a budget-friendly tablet that can handle those tasks easily.In case the 64GB model doesn't offer enough room for all the files you want to use on it, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF2DNMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can grab a 128GB model for $199</a> (was $270). If you own a Samsung smartphone, you can link these devices up to quickly transfer files and photos using the company's app. </p><p dir="ltr">For a little bit more powerful, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-processor-throughout/dp/B0C1MYYFBW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon's Fire Max is another good tablet to consider</a>. This is easily one of the biggest discounts we've seen to date for it, as you can grab 64GB model tablet with a keyboard case and a stylus for just $225 (was $355), or for the tablet on its own, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get it at a 39% discount for $140</a>. The 11-inch screen has a resolution of 2000 x 1200, the battery offers up to 14 hours of use from a full charge, and the included keyboard makes it a good back-up device for when you need to do some work away from home. </p><p dir="ltr">We've listed a few more tablet deals available in Amazon's Cyber Monday sale below. We're also rounding up all the best discounts on video games, electronics, and more at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Cyber Monday deals hub</a>, so be sure to check that out if you're looking for more savings.</p><h2 dir="ltr">More Cyber Monday Tablet Deals</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMPSWMJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo M11 (64GB)</a> -- $140 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMGKBK9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo M11 with folio case</a> -- $160 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF3VPMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ (64GB)</a> -- $149 (<del>$220</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF2DNMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ (128GB)</a> -- $200 (<del>$270</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-processor-throughout/dp/B0C1MYYFBW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire Max Tablet bundle (64GB)</a> -- $225 (<del>$355</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire Max Tablet (64GB)</a> -- $140 (<del>$230</del>)</li></ul><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-collectors-edition-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6524003/">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle Collector's Edition Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-dark-souls-board-game-for-only-51-and-roleplaying-sourcebook-for-30/1100-6527696/">Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/">PS5 Pro Disc Drive Is Sold Out At Most Retailers, But Walmart Has It (For Now)</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Is Available Now And Eligible For One-Day Delivery At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-on-sale-for-a-great-price/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Is Already On Sale For 25% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-the-hedgehog-lego-set-gets-huge-cyber-monday-discount/1100-6525229/">Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Gets Huge Cyber Monday Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>
