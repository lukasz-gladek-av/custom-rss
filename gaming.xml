            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will reportedly be revealed this week with a trailer that will focus on the hardware, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, well-known insider Nate the Hate revealed that the next-generation Nintendo system will be revealed this Thursday, January 16th, with a trailer that will focus on the hardware. To see the games, however, we will have to wait a few more weeks, as a software presentation is reportedly scheduled for February or March. Unfortunately, there's the chance that we may not learn when the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch or how much it will cost in a few days, as the leaker is not sure this information will be included in the reveal trailer.</p>
<p>As for the launch lineup, Nate the Hate doesn't possess any concrete info, and the discussion is mostly based on speculation. One thing that could get confirmed, on the other hand, is the massive support from third-party developers the Nintendo Switch 2 will see. Square Enix, for example, will supposedly port Final Fantasy VII Remake this year and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in 2026. Ubisoft also seems to be betting a lot on the console, as ports of Assassin's Creed Mirage and Assassin's Creed Shadows are in the works, and the publisher is also looking into porting more titles. According to French News TV Channel <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/switch-2-assassin-s-creed-mirage-et-shadows-sortiront-sur-la-prochaine-console-de-nintendo_AV-202501140567.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BFM TV</a>, these ports are real, are not being developed by the original studios, are ambitious, and will take advantage of the console's power. The Shadows port, however, will not be released until the end of the year to polish the experience as much as possible.</p>
<p>Square Enix and Ubisoft aren't the only <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">third-party developers and publishers</a> that will support the Nintendo Switch 2. According to Nate the Hate, Konami is working on a Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater port, which could release day and date on the Nintendo console. The insider also heard rumblings of an Elden Ring port, but couldn't say for sure if it is indeed happening or not. Still, it seems like third-party developers are eager to port their games to the console, which wasn't exactly the case with the original Switch, which started seeing some high-profile ports only some time after the system launched.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but thankfully, the wait could be almost over. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forest-reigns-ex-stalker-devs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-stalker-devs-announce-single-player-survival-fps-forest-reigns.1081986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forest-reigns-ex-stalker-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VG Entertainment, formerly known as Vostok Games, has announced&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, a narrative-driven survival FPS set in the ruins of an alt-future post-pandemic Paris.</p>

<p>In the game's world, Paris has been "transformed by nature's fury" into a lush, verdant, and hostile paradise. You'll be able to see "iconic landmarks" (and I'm sure you can guess which ones) transformed by nature retaking the city as you explore and scavenge resources to survive.</p>

<p>Vostok Games says that in&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, as the title suggests, the forest itself will play a major role. It's effectively being treated as "an intelligence" rather than a backdrop; attacking it will cause it to respond with hostility, but approaching it with "caution" could see it aid you as your ally.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forest-reigns-announced-paris.jpg?itok=L8ielTaQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forest-reigns-announced-paris.jpg?itok=Lj-I5Hvp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>will let you loose in the ruins of post-apocalyptic Paris.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>will apparently also feature "realistic weapon handling" and plenty of "customizable gear" so that you can build your own distinctive arsenal as you traverse the overgrown streets of Paris.</p>

<p>As befits a game developed by ex-<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>luminaries, you can also look forward to a "non-linear story" with plenty of missions to complete, many of which will put you in touch with one of the city's four factions. Each one has a "unique vision" for how humanity should proceed after the apocalypse.</p>

<p>Studio head Ruslan Didenko says&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>represents "the most daring concept" the studio has ever explored, and that his team is returning to its "roots" by creating a single-player FPS with a narrative focus.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, which should give you a good idea of what kind of art style the game is going for, right here.</p>




<p>You might know VG Entertainment better as Vostok Games, the studio behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-stalker-devs-fear-wolves-to-enter-early-access-next-week" rel="nofollow">battle royale title&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-stalker-devs-fear-wolves-to-enter-early-access-next-week" rel="nofollow">Fear the Wolves</a>&nbsp;</em>and free-to-play FPS&nbsp;<em>Survivarium</em>, both of which have now shut down.</p>

<p>Given that it's a single-player title, the same fate is unlikely to befall&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, so let's hope it gets finished in a timely fashion. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it right now on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

<p>What’s Marvel Rivals Esports going to look like is a question that every player has been asking, and the game director of the hero shooter has just revealed their approach towards the competitive aspect of the title. &nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, Marvel Rivals game director Guangyun Chen was asked about Netease’s esports aspirations for the game. Chen responded that Marvel Rivals esports is something they have been thinking about “on a broader scale, looking at the picture as a whole.” Their approach aims to cater to both competitive and casual players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chen added that the team hopes their competitive modes or tournaments can “coexist” with their quick-play mode. The developers have observed several games managing healthy competitive and quick-play environments simultaneously. They will use references from these titles to help “both player pools thrive.” The director didn’t reveal any upcoming esports tournaments for Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Apart from their competitive plans for Marvel Rivals, the director also spoke about new additions to the roster during this interview. Players can expect new heroes to be added every three months; <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here are more details</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have figured out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-bots-are-being-sniffed-out-by-invisible-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to locate bots</a> with the help of Invisible Woman’s ability. Also, five more heroes are reportedly arriving for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-professor-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including X-Men’s Professor X</a>. What are your thoughts on the game director’s approach towards Marvel Rivals esports?

<p>Marvel Rivals fans won’t have to wait too long to see the game’s roster of heroes expand moving forward. In a new interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, game director Guangyun Chen gave an update on developer NetEase’s plans for new characters in the game.</p>



<p>Chen says that everything will revolve around the game’s seasons. A season in Marvel Rivals will last three months, but will be broken into two halves. During that time, players will get a new hero every half season. That means one hero every month-and-a-half for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>“We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community,” Chen said while adding that, in addition to new heroes, each season will include seasonal stories and new maps.</p>



<p>As far as which heroes will be added and when, Chen says that it’ll be “guided by the overall gameplay experience or theme that we want to create for each season.”</p>







<p>“So it’ll revolve around the season and right now, at post-launch, we have eight Vanguards and seven Strategists at launch,” he said. “The team believes that it gives the players a solid variety for tactical match-ups or team composition. Having more Duelists at the moment will definitely enhance the Duelist experience, letting players dive a little bit deeper into that aspect.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Chen thanked the community for feedback on heroes and say that the feedback will be used in making decisions on when to release certain heroes as well.</p>



<p>“[We] want to make sure that everyone feels heard and excited,” he said.</p>

            <p>Frontier has detailed its update roadmap for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>, with new features on the way from February until May.</p>
<p>The theme park sim sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2s-first-paid-dlc-releases-today-alongside-major-update">received its first major free update back in December</a>, alongside its first paid DLC.</p>
<p>The next update will arrive in February, bringing new features like custom video billboards, custom speakers, synchronised coasters, and interchangeable coaster cars.</p>

<p>As for new rides, there will be new stock coasters as well as the return of flat ride Pathos III. Other adjustments will include enhanced guest navigation; ongoing guest, economy and management enhancements; and ongoing stability and performance enhancements.</p>
<p>The third update will arrive a month later, which will allow guests to jettison off flumes (ouch) and add round-bottomed flumes and inflatable deformation. Water rides are a major part of the sequel, which Frontier is continuing to tweak post-release.</p>
<p>Other additions include making career maps available in sandbox mode as starting layouts, more stock coasters, and another returning ride.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Two more updates will then take place in April and May, although these remain under construction.</p>
<p>While an image of the roadmap has been shared, Frontier noted it is non-exhaustive and the developer is continuing to investigate crash and bug reports. Each update will bring a full list of changes.</p>
<p>Lastly, the developer is also looking to bring back some of the themes from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> game, with more to share in future.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Early Access. Survival. Crafting. It’s a combo that you’re likely familiar with if you’ve spent a reasonable amount of time browsing the Steam store. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="27306349-cc50-4431-8f1d-c08818c5fe74" href="https://techraptor.net/games/aloft" rel="nofollow"><em>Aloft</em></a> is the next in a long (and seemingly never-ending) line of these games, aiming to carve its own slice of the survival crafting pie.</p>

<p><em>Aloft </em>doesn’t make the strongest first impression, unceremoniously dumping you into a cave after limited character and world creation. Your only real hint at what’s going on is a single sentence during the loading screen, which talks about an “eternal storm” leading you to a broken world.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take long before you go through the motions of any survival game, picking up stray wood and stone to craft a hammer that will serve you for hours to come. From there, you learn how to build platforms, more items, and tools, then escape your rocky confinement into the outside world.</p>



<p>This outside world is where <em>Aloft</em>’s main selling point comes into play. Rather than one large open map to explore, this is a world made up of many smaller islands. After crafting a glider and flying out to neighboring islands, you soon learn how to create various sailing parts like a helm and sails.</p>

<p>Rather than crafting some sort of airship, you instead use these parts to commandeer one of the aforementioned islands. Once claimed, an island acts not only as a base of operations but also as the main way to traverse across the vast sky.</p>

<p>Traversing is something you’ll be doing a lot of. While worlds are randomly generated, they each follow a set pattern: each world is split into three rings, with each ring split into sections on the map. Sections are populated with clusters of islands, with some holding key points of interest.</p>

<p>Exploring islands is <em>Aloft</em>’s main gameplay loop, as you scour them for resources and crafting recipes. Cutting down trees, opening treasure chests, it’s all that you’d expect from a survival crafting game.</p>

<p>Where things differ is the island ecosystem mechanic. Some islands you come across will be in a state of decay, missing certain vital parts to keep the ecosystem alive. This can range from not enough animals to a lack of fungi or flora.</p>



<p>Most resources on the island stay locked until you satisfy all conditions, which are easy enough to check via a craftable field guide. At first, I thought this could be an interesting way to have the player think about their impact on the environment, carefully picking and choosing resources instead of ransacking everything.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s a shallow system that rarely impacts your playstyle. Most of the time you can just leave islands that require extra work, opting to find one that has a complete ecosystem instead. Even if you do choose to fix things, it’s generally little more than planting a row of flora or trees.</p>

<p>Aloft is full of these shallow mechanics and systems, most of which barely increase in complexity by the time you reach the end of Early Access content.</p>

<p>Combat is simple — all tools double up as weapons — and is clearly not a big focus. In fact, there are only three enemy types, alongside some larger growths that impede progress on some islands. The only real times I found myself in danger was thanks to lag spikes, something relatively common on any of the bigger islands.</p>



<p>This has the knock-on effect of making cooking mostly inconsequential right now. You can forage or grow a number of crops, with <em>Aloft </em>currently allowing you to cook a wide variety of dishes. But most serve very little purpose right now, especially since dying has no consequences.</p>

<p>I found myself crafting little more than basic clean water, since that allowed me to swing faster — a useful buff for both combat and gathering. This also serves the double purpose of staving off the desert heat in<em> Aloft</em>’s current final biome, though even that has very little going on right now.</p>

<p>As of the Early Access launch, <em>Aloft </em>only contains three biomes — two are almost identical, with the last being desert-themed. On top of this, there's a noticeably limited pool of islands that be spawned into a world. You’ll run into the same islands many times, with most having no defining features or reasons to visit.</p>

<p>To stop you from just making a beeline for the next map marker, the world throws a couple of roadblocks at you. Between the outer and middle rings on each side, you’ll have to make it through a field of floating rocks. The south and north sides of the map require progressively better sails, with the crafting recipes being found on random islands.</p>



<p>Because of this, you end up reaching a new cluster of islands, giving them a quick look for said recipes, then moving on to the next. With how plentiful most resources are, there’s not much point in lingering unless you really need to.</p>

<p>In between islands, you’ll use your trusty island-turned-ship, fitting it with new sails to go faster or one of many crafting stations. Crafting is all there really is to do when traveling to a new island, as there are no random events or items to look out for. You'll likely find yourself tabbing out often since you'll otherwise be waiting for minutes with nothing to do.</p>

<p>And honestly, that’s mainly my problem with <em>Aloft</em> right now. After a few hours, the gameplay loop ends up as a bland mix of quickly checking repetitive islands, and then spending my time away from the game while your ship makes its way forward.</p>

<p>Releasing too soon is a pitfall I’ve seen Early Access games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c8e4ab6f-2b6f-4d5c-93ad-467e250af935" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nightingale-preview" rel="nofollow">Nightingale</a> fall into, and I wonder if<em> Aloft </em>has done the same thing. Realistically there are only a few hours of actual meaningful content here, stretched out across 15-20 hours or so of repetitive exploration before you exhaust everything.</p>

<p>More can absolutely be added during Early Access, with the Steam store page promising more biomes and “challenges to overcome”. But as of right now, a unique gimmick doesn’t set <em>Aloft </em>apart from other, more engaging titles.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Aloft</strong> was previewed over 25 hours of gameplay on PC via Steam with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap for spring, and it's promising new rides, gameplay improvements, and more for the theme park management sim.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2688950/view/547849766230295443" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on Steam</a>, Frontier reveals the full roadmap, which covers the period between February and May. It begins with Update 2, which will arrive in February, bringing with it custom billboards and speakers, new rides, and several adjustments to the core gameplay.</p>

<p>Following that, you can expect Update 3 in March. That one will bring more guest and raft movement on special pieces, as well as more stock coasters, a returning ride from the original&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>, and more gameplay improvements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring-full.jpg?itok=Q3F94g0e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring-full.jpg?itok=679Sjxvb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>is getting lots of new stuff in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>More updates are on their way in April and May, but Frontier is remaining cagey about exactly what those updates will contain. Suffice it to say they'll probably be on the same level as the preceding two, so expect new rides, gameplay improvements, and other stuff.</p>

<p>Whether or not this roadmap will be enough to placate&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>'s more vocal critics remains to be seen, but I think it's unlikely. There's nothing particularly transformative here.</p>

<p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was sitting at a rather disappointing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mixed rating</a> on Steam, with over 6,600 reviewers weighing in on the theme park management sim.</p>

<p>Complaints include Frontier's approach to the release of DLC, as well as technical issues, unintuitive gameplay, and a lack of features when compared to the first&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>. I think it's probably going to take more than a few extra bits and bobs to convince some of these players the sequel was worth it.</p>




<p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was released for PC and current-gen consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in November</a>. It's the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>, and it boasts a new focus on waterpark features, as well as gameplay improvements and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009610" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/planet-coaster-2/9PK5WS0HXQKQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

While the original PlayStation 4 game focused on B-movie silliness and branching storylines based on player decisions, the movie version will employ an entirely different premise to try to recreate that effect.</p><p>Rather than choose who lives or dies in an interactive setting, the <em>Until Dawn</em> movie will see its victims killed again and again in different ways until they can figure out how to survive the entire night together. “The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again,” director David F. Sandberg says in the new teaser trailer. “Every time they come back to life, it’s like they are in a new horror genre.”</p><p><em>Until Dawn </em>won’t feature any of the original game’s characters, either. Almost all of its high-profile cast, led by Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere, are absent as well. The only person who has returned, as revealed in the first trailer on Tuesday, is Peter Stormare. But instead of playing the fourth wall-breaking psychiatrist Dr. Hill, it seems like he’ll be taking on a more sinister role to fill the apparent absence of the cannibalistic wendingos that served as the first game’s violent antagonists. </p><p>“Hey so, there’s definitely something here,” reads one of the top YouTube comments on the trailer. “However if this wasn’t labeled I would have had no idea that was <em>Until Dawn</em>.” Users on X were less generous. “We’re going to make a film with the same name as a popular videogame but we’re not actually going to base the story on the game in any way, shape or form,” one wrote sarcastically.

The official Pokémon online store, both in the UK and the U.S., was acting strangely: the new special set (so-called because it will be released in boxed and tinned products throughout 2025, but not be sold as individual booster packs) was marked as “UNAVAILABLE” the moment it was put in the store. After a while, “UNAVAILABLE” switched to “SOLD OUT,” and that was that. Somehow, despite never being possible to buy, it was gone.</p><p>The very same thing happened at the end of last week with the announcement of March’s next full set, Journey Together. At this point,  it has become very apparent something is going horribly wrong.</p><h2 id="h726263"><a id=""></a>It’s impossible to buy new Pokémon TCG cards</h2><p>For reasons too dull to get into, about a year-and-a-half ago, I got into the habit of refreshing the Pokémon Center websites for the UK and the U.S. a pretty troubling number of times a day. This reflex stuck and has proven useful in the long time since, helping me get the scoop on new products, and indeed ensuring I could buy myself the special Pokémon Center version of each set’s Elite Trainer Box (ETB), which invariably sold very quickly.</p><p>So it is that I tend to notice new product on the site long before press releases go out, and being in the UK, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914">often get the jump</a></span> on what will be added to the North American site later the same day. And so it was that I discovered Prismatic Evolutions was on sale far before any official announcements, and indeed that it was not possible to buy.</p><p>I contacted TPCi at the time—November 6—via their UK PR department (TPCi is notoriously difficult to get in touch with), with an incredibly innocuous question about how the products appeared to be sold out before ever actually being available. Was it a glitch? Was it unprecedented demand? Either way, you’d imagine the company would like to make it clear to customers. But instead, I received a response that read, “Pokémon does not have any additional information to share on the below.”</p><p>Perplexed, I left it, because—as I say—I’m aware how hard it is to get any information from TPCi, and even a “no comment” was a rare treat. Then, come January 9, the same thing happened again. Journey Together had yet to be officially acknowledged as a set by TPCi, but there it was on the Pokémon Center. Four products—the 36-pack booster box, the ETB, a six-pack booster bundle, and individual packs—all listed as available to buy on the “New Releases” page of the store, but all marked as “UNAVAILABLE” when you clicked through. Weirder, I noticed this time, was that it didn’t say it was unavailable <em>immediately</em>, but rather after the tiniest fraction of a second. For that split-second before, the usual, yellow “ADD TO BASKET” button would flicker.</p><p>I tried a bunch of times to see if I could click on it before it changed, eventually succeeded, but received only a strange error message. And then, after about an hour, the New Releases page updated the products to be “SOLD OUT,” and even more tellingly, a front page giant banner for the new product that was latterly added to the site was entirely removed.</p><p>So, obviously, I got in touch with Pokémon’s UK PR to ask what was happening, but despite repeated attempts over the last five days, haven’t heard anything back.</p><figure id="" data-id="6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-recommend-id="image://6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Prismatic Evolutions logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Prismatic Evolutions logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-recommend-id="image://6fd4dcb993dd613c08445eed425f2b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Prismatic Evolutions logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h726264"><a id=""></a>Collecting Scalps</h2><p>So what’s going on? Well, without a response from TPCi, it’s hard to be certain. But it makes sense to assume it’s directly the fault of bots and scalpers, looking to resell unopened products at vastly inflated prices. Right now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/593324/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-prismatic-evolutions-pokemon-center-elite-trainer-box-exclusive?page=1&amp;Language=all&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/593324/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-prismatic-evolutions-pokemon-center-elite-trainer-box-exclusive?page=1&amp;Language=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a $60 ETB of Prismatic Evolutions has a resale market price of $400</a></span>, while others are selling their <em>pre-orders</em> of Journey Together ETBs on eBay for $150+. To be clear, these are the sorts of items that would usually be stood in huge piles in your local card store, and easily available in Target and Walmart.</p><p>What’s brought this about is likely more complicated. Prismatic Evolutions is one of those sets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-151-scarlet-violet-tcg-pull-rates-etb-charizard-1850860867&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-151-scarlet-violet-tcg-pull-rates-etb-charizard-1850860867">like 2023's 151</a></span>, that will bring lots of people to the hobby. It’s an Eevee-based set, and it’s had a lot of buzz. That’s one factor. Then there’s <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, which has been a phenomenon, drawing in tens of millions of players, inevitably a gateway for vast numbers to want to collect the physical cards too. And, of course, there’s momentum. Once prices start going up, more people try to take advantage of those increases, buying up stock to increase scarcity, driving prices up further, and so on. We’re definitely in that vicious loop right now.</p><p>You might say we’ve been here before, first in 2016 when <em>Pokémon GO</em> caused a vast amount of new interest in the TCG, and then to the most outlandish degree in 2020 and 2021, when Logan Paul sparked a wild surge in prices after paying $150,000 for a Base Set Charizard, leading to a lockdown-driven crazy spike in interest in classic cards. However, what marks this situation as different is the cards it involves.</p><p>Both previous spikes were about classic cards, seeing the prices of old collections increasing exponentially, and in many cases, still maintaining that value today. But in both situations, while newer sets certainly proved a lot more popular, they were still widely available. The only exception to this would be Japan’s Clay Burst set that in 2023 astonishingly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-trading-card-game-tcg-stock-japan-iono-grusha-1850349547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-trading-card-game-tcg-stock-japan-iono-grusha-1850349547">caused Japan to sell out of <em>all</em> Pokémon cards</a></span>, but the Iono card responsible didn’t cause anything similar in the rest of the world when it was later released in English.</p><p>The reason it’s so different this time is that it’s affecting the brand-new sets, and that’s an issue for two important reasons. Firstly, it breaks the entire hobby for regular people. If you’re someone (like me) who tries to pick up an ETB and then buys a bunch of loose packs here and there, you’re now just shit out of luck. Casual collectors can’t try to get a few nice cards for their binders. Kids looking to spend their allowance on a $5 pack will go home disappointed. That really sucks, and it’s going to badly affect the reputation of the game.</p><p>And secondly, <em>the game</em>. These cards, while often bought in the gambling-lite hope of pulling a rare card, actually exist to be the playing cards for a massively popular game. And if you can’t buy the new sets at sensible prices, you can’t keep up with the meta, can’t redesign your decks, and just can’t join in anymore. There are millions of people, kids and adults, who meet up every week for clubs, who will be negatively affected by this sudden inability to buy <em>anything </em>new. (Browsing my usual online store right now, there’s not a single item from the last three full sets I can buy right now.)</p><figure id="" data-id="c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-recommend-id="image://c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-recommend-id="image://c94ead89eccb7b796247f132bf9b2dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h726265"><a id=""></a>Bring in the YouTubers</h2><p>As I was preparing this article, I noticed that the astonishingly popular Pokémon YouTuber, “PokeRev,” uploaded a video last night, commenting on very similar problems.</p><p>With almost 3 million followers, the streamer who most know as “Rev,” real name Nick, has a lot of reach. He sources his cards as a retailer, rather than a customer, invariably receiving crates of stock of each product, which is opened daily on his channel, and almost always given away to viewers. As such, he tends to get new sets before they’re available to buy, and presumably to the frustration of TPCi, opens hundreds of packs long before their shelf date. (Pokémon PR in the U.S. very generously sends me advance sample packs of each new set, so I can write about them on <em>Kotaku</em>, and Nick almost always gets his product before even these arrive.)</p><p>But in his most recent video, PokeRev is unusually candid, almost emotional, as he discusses the lack of availability of recent sets. Stating it began with November’s set, Surging Sparks, he explains how the resale prices of brand new cards have gone through the roof, as availability in stores has become minimal. And that things have become so extreme at this point, that as he tore into Prismatic Evolutions in the last few days, he’s been feeling a sense of guilt, that he knows his viewers aren’t going to be able to buy it for themselves. (Rev plans to give all his bulk to local card stores, on top of giving product away to viewers.)</p><p>I’m certain PokeRev’s speaking out is likely to cause more consternation within TPCi than my coverage, and I imagine others will jump on board too, so hopefully we might finally see the company pushed into addressing this issue. Because, for them, selling out is selling out, whether it’s bots or kids buying the cards. The only way to make them care is reputationally. (And please, please don’t pay the scalp prices—that motivates the situation and ensures it can’t improve.)</p><p>In the meantime, if you were hoping to enjoy a pack from the newer sets, or to update your deck for competitive play, then...damn. You might want to make a loud stink about it, in the hope that something will get done.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Balatro has a ton of content to unlock, challenges to beat, and fiery points totals to earn. Our Balatro Trophy Guide and the full list of achievements delve deeper into the game’s more challenging tasks—and your patience and free time are bound to be tested.</p>



<p>I’ve lost count of my Balatro runs at this point. I’m not sure I’d even want to know to be honest, as my losses would outweigh my wins. Yet, I love it, and it’s easy to see why it was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game of 2024</a>. If I want to be the ultimate Balatro master, I need to get every Trophy and Achievement, and the evidence suggests this might not <em>ever </em>happen.</p>



<p>All the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-plasma-deck-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plasma Decks</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-brainstorm-joker-in-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainstorm Jokers</a> in the world can’t make this endeavor easier—and I wish the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-balatro-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Balatro Seeds</a> counted toward progress!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-balatro-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">How Many Balatro Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beautiful sight. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Balatro has 32 PlayStation Trophies and 31 Xbox Achievements to unlock to complete the list.</strong></p>



<p>The shiny Platinum Trophy is the big difference between Xbox and PlayStation. Getting all Achievements is necessary for all Gamerscore, whereas getting every Trophy rewards you with a Platinum on PS4 and PS5. Achieving full completion earns bragging rights on either platform over friends who are trying to best Balatro too—something I’m desperately working toward.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-balatro-trophy-amp-achievement">Every Balatro Trophy &amp; Achievement</h2>



<p>Balatro’s Achievements and Trophies range from achieving scores with a ridiculous number of digits to completing Balatro—and I do mean <em>completing </em>Balatro.</p>

<h2 id="h-balatro-trophies-amp-achievements-difficulty-rating">Balatro Trophies &amp; Achievements Difficulty Rating</h2>



<p><strong>Balatro’s Trophies and Achievements are an easy 9 out of 10 on the difficulty scale.</strong></p>



<p>It achieves this rating based on the toughness of its Completionist++ objective, as well as how many hours it takes. Earning a Gold Sticker on every Joker is a stupidly difficult ask, and all it takes is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-beat-plant-boss-blind-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Plant Boss Blind</a> to mess everything up, or another unforeseen factor to have a good run end up in smoke in seconds.</p>

<p>A new teaser for the upcoming Until Dawn movie has been released by Sony Pictures. The teaser sets the stage for the movie ahead the reveal of the first trailer.</p>



<p>“As a huge fan of the Until Dawn game and how cinematic it was, I thought a lot about how we can continue the story without just giving the audience the same experience that they got when they were playing,” Writer and Producer Gary Dauberman said.</p>



<p>Director David F. Sandberg says that the movie “has sort of the same tone and same vibe” as the original game. However, he says, it “expands upon the universe”. Sandberg then touched on what he viewed as one of the more creative aspects of the game which is players making different choices and dying in different ways. </p>



<p>“The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again,” he said. “Every time they come back to life, it’s like their in a new horror genre. To survive, they have to make it until dawn.”</p>



<p>You can check out the first look teaser for the film below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="UNTIL DAWN – Film First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7mf5T1YYOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The movie’s description reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they find themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one…only to wake up and find themselves back at the beginning of the same evening. Trapped in the valley, they’re forced to relive the nightmare again and again – only each time the killer threat is different, each more terrifying than the last. Hope dwindling, the group soon realizes they have a limited number of deaths left, and the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Until Dawn is scheduled to release in theaters on April 25. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review.1081896/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I owe Donkey Kong Country Returns HD an apology. I laughed in disbelief at its initial announcement because it’s not only the third time Nintendo has sold us a version of this 2010 Wii platformer, it’s also the third Switch re-release Donkey Kong has seen despite not getting a completely new adventure in the last decade. This remaster’s reveal felt like the wrong game at the wrong time, but it only took a few minutes of running across a decently spruced up Donkey Kong Island to realize Returns is still one of the best 2D platformers Nintendo has made this century. It has all the things I want from this genre: satisfying movement that demands skill and precision, a large lineup of replayable challenges stuffed with secrets to find, and a practically unparalleled attention to detail in its superb level design that’s pretty much only rivaled by its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/01/donkey-kong-tropical-freeze-for-switch-review">Tropical Freeze</a>. Even though the remaster itself feels barebones and a few elements could have used a slightly more modern touch, this is definitely the best way to play Returns and one of the top bananas in the Switch’s impressive platformer lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I barreled through 80 levels set in jungles, caves, and more, it struck me just how few games like this are made anymore. In an era where modern platformers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot</a> mostly focus on wowing you with spectacle and joyously ushering you through their handcrafted digital theme parks, Returns stands out as it doubles down on the platforming itself. It’s full of tough levels and nail-biting moments that require you to master its central jumping, rolling, and swinging mechanics to overcome its biggest challenges. No shade to the two games I just mentioned – I adore them both – but revisiting Nintendo’s version of this classic platformer style is refreshing, and I love how it isn’t afraid to test you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Difficulty-wise, this is several steps above Mario and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">Kirby</a>, and that’s another great differentiating factor from the other platformers in Nintendo’s stable. The level design is incredibly impressive: Every stage introduces a new idea and explores it to the fullest as it ramps up the challenge without ever making it unclear what is expected of you. To reclaim Donkey Kong’s home, you’ll have to outrun hordes of ape-eating spiders, avoid enormous lethal waves, and make perfect jumps across crumbling platforms, and it’s always exciting to see what obstacle will be thrown at you next.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>DK’s perfect controls and satisfying abilities keep the challenge fun.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to Donkey Kong’s perfect controls and immensely satisfying abilities. There’s a distinct weight to the movement in Retro Studios’ pair of Donkey Kong games, as if you can really get a sense for the heft of this big ape as you move, resulting in a platformer more focused on momentum where you’ll often have to plan your moves ahead of time and gear up for that next huge leap. The advanced rolling-jump mechanic in particular – where Donkey Kong gets a free jump in midair after rolling off a ledge – leads to some of the most rewarding platforming out there when you pull off a crazy move to save yourself or snag a hard-to-reach collectible. Your options open up even more when you break Diddy Kong out of a barrel. He both doubles your max health and adds an extremely helpful hover ability that’s a game changer in tougher sections. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If testing your mettle isn’t for you, the optional Modern Mode – which is slightly altered from the 3DS port’s New Mode – adds extra hearts to DK and Diddy’s health, expands the inventory at Cranky Kong’s shop with more useful aids (like a Green Balloon that saves you after falling into a pit), and lets you take more consumable recovery items into each level. Plus, if there’s a stage you just can’t clear, Super Kong will eventually show up and offer to automatically beat it for you. I love challenging platformers, so I stuck to Classic Mode and never looked back, but these are at least great options for people who don’t like to get stuck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one place Returns occasionally gets a little bit <em>too </em>mean is its on-rails minecart and rocket barrel levels. These areas can suffer from a lot of trial-and-error, where I frequently died to sudden enemies or obstacles I had no way of reasonably avoiding on my first attempt. This is worsened if you’re going for the hidden collectibles in each stage, where you’re almost guaranteed to miss at least some of them the first time through until you know the level’s patterns. It’s especially frustrating because everything in these sections is a one-hit kill; a problem Tropical Freeze later solved by introducing vehicle-specific health bars. To be fair, it’s not a huge issue – Modern Mode adds an item in Cranky’s shop that can make these sections less of a pain, and I still really enjoy them for how they break up the pace of the standard stages – but I can’t help but feel they could have used a bit of freshening up. Similarly, the boss fights are largely fantastic, but they still suffer from a complete lack of checkpoints, and being forced back to the beginning after dying in the final phase feels more like a waste of time than a meaningful challenge.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This really is just a new coat of paint and nothing more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The absence of any updates to these stumbling points highlights just how barebones Returns HD is as a remaster. This really is just a combination of the Wii and 3DS versions of Returns with a new coat of paint, and nothing more. It’s a competent update, but it’s nowhere near the level of something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> – the <em>other </em>Retro Studios game that got a shiny updated release on Switch. It certainly doesn’t look bad, and it almost always runs at a smooth 60 frames per second, but even Tropical Freeze’s 2018 Switch port looks noticeably nicer. That’s most apparent when comparing Donkey Kong’s character model across the two games: DK’s fur looks amazing in Tropical Freeze, but just a little bit off in Returns. This is very clearly still a Wii game in HD everywhere from the levels to the cutscenes, which is completely <em>fine</em>, but I would’ve liked to see the graphics get a bit more love when the movement otherwise aged so well. Still, this is undoubtedly the best way to play Returns, as the Wii version had mandatory waggling motion controls that have been mercifully made entirely optional, and the extra 3DS levels have been rescued from that version’s downgraded graphics and co-op that required two systems and copies. That makes Returns HD the first time you can play this adventure on your TV with traditional button controls and all of its content intact, and that’s great to see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of multiplayer, Returns HD is fully playable in two-player co-op where a second player takes control of Diddy Kong, but it’s not necessarily how I would want to play through the entire campaign. It's different from its contemporary New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which was made with multiplayer in mind from the beginning, in that it feels more like a neat bonus feature tacked onto a single-player game. The camera is so zoomed in that it’s easy for someone to fall behind, and these levels are clearly designed around just one player given their abundance of falling platforms and fast-moving obstacles. There’s still fun to be found in multiplayer, and it’s by no means a <em>bad </em>experience – but unless you have a great co-op partner willing to deal with some slight annoyances (or a young child/sibling that’s just content to be along for the ride), your best bet is either flying solo or passing the controller back and forth, as was also the case back on Wii.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan's Platformer Hall of Fame</h3><p>Running and jumping with the best of them. Level-based platformers only -- Metroidvanias not included.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it’s a testament to the original that almost nothing was changed for this remaster and the final product is still so great. The attention to detail in its level design is remarkable. Unlike Mario, there are no unexplained floating platforms or blocks – every single platform DK runs across is seamlessly built into the landscape, often through its masterful interplay between the foreground and background, and it all culminates in one of the most impressive, cohesive worlds in any platformer. The biggest highlight of this is the factory world, which wonderfully implements conveyor belts, gears, and other machinery as the main methods of getting around. The soundtrack and settings play it a little safe (especially when compared to its sequel), but it’s important to remember that the original Donkey Kong Country Returns was tasked with bringing the franchise back after years away, so Retro Studios naturally chose to revisit some of the staples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each level is stuffed with secrets to find, too, with the classic KONG letters and plenty of puzzle pieces tucked away in seemingly every corner. Sometimes exploration slows down the otherwise furious pace more than I’d like – blowing air onto all the dandelions, flowers, and candles you pass feels clunky and is an outdated mechanic that Tropical Freeze rightfully removed – but I still had a blast spending roughly 15 hours tracking down every letter and bringing my save file to 100% completion while also tackling tons of worthwhile content that appears after the credits roll. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Somehow, Donkey Kong Country Returns returned (again), but Nintendo’s third full release of this 2010 Wii platformer is almost as fresh and fun today as it was 15 years ago. DK’s satisfying, weighty movement paves the way for a challenging, momentum-based platformer that demands more skill and precision than the average Nintendo game. But it stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to incredibly impressive level design that explores every clever idea to the fullest and a ton of hidden collectibles worth tracking down. As a remaster specifically, it’s no more than a passable update, with graphics that can only really be described as “good enough” and some outdated elements that could have used more modern touches, like a lack of checkpoints during boss fights and a few obnoxious sections full of one-hit kill obstacles. But Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is still a competent update and easily the best way to play one of the greatest 2D platformers Nintendo has released this century.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-finally-looks-set-to-make-the-jump-to-playstation-this-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft is seemingly ready to launch its flagship Xbox video game series Halo on rival platforms for the first time, including PlayStation and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaker NateTheHate, who this week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-release-date-reportedly-leaked-online-alongside-release-window">reported that Nintendo is set to reveal Switch 2 on January 16</a>, also reported in <a href="https://youtu.be/AIhoTirZxlk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a separate podcast</a> that Microsoft will finally bring Halo to PlayStation in the form of a PlayStation 5 port of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, as well as a release on Switch 2. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Central’s Jez Corden subsequently corroborated the report</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Microsoft’s multiplatform video game strategy is well-documented at this stage, Halo was seen as the final frontier. However, perhaps the famous first-person shooter’s flight from Xbox shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-wont-rule-out-any-xbox-exclusive-making-the-jump-to-playstation-including-halo">Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer said there were no “red lines” in its first-party lineup when it comes to going multiplatform</a> — and that included Halo. Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said every Xbox game is up for grabs when it comes to making the multiplatform jump. “I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has so-far used older games released over a year ago for its multiplatform push as opposed to brand new games, but that will soon change with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which comes out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-finally-gets-a-release-date-for-xbox-and-playstation-gamescom-2024"><u>on PS5</u></a> just a few months after it launched on Xbox and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones is the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to a rival console, and follows the multiplatform release of Obsidian’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pentiment"><u>Pentiment</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded"><u>Grounded</u></a>, Tango Gameworks’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hi-fi-rush"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>, and Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> earlier in 2024. In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>Microsoft announced Id Software's upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages will also launch on PS5</u></a> this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure now on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We run a business,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said in August</a>. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore">As former Xbox executive Peter Moore told IGN last year</a>, bringing Halo to PlayStation will have been a topic of discussion at Microsoft for some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look, if Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's had its ups and downs, but look, Xbox wouldn't be what Xbox is without Halo. But yeah, I'm sure those conversations are happening. Whether they come to fruition, who knows? But they're definitely happening, I'm sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft does face a potential backlash from hardcore Xbox fans who are already disgruntled after what they feel is a devaluing of the Xbox as a console, the lack of exclusives, and Microsoft’s marketing strategy for its gaming business. Losing Halo to PlayStation could spark yet another angry response, but Moore told IGN that won’t deter Microsoft from doing what’s right for its business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The question would be, ultimately, is that reaction enough not to make a fundamental business decision for the future of not only Microsoft’s business, but gaming in itself?” Moore said. “Those hardcore are getting smaller in size and older in age. You've got to cater to the generations that are coming through, because they're going to drive the business over the next 10, 20 years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo isn’t alone in coming to PS5 and Switch 2. NateTheHate reported that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is also coming to PS5 and Switch 2. Windows Central additionally reported that Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition, Hellblade 2, and Age of Mythology are coming to PS5 in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, does Halo: The Master chief Collection's release on PS5 and Switch 2 open the door to other Halo games also going multiplatform? Could the next big Halo game launch across all platforms? Last year, tech experts said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>Halo’s move to Unreal Engine 5</u></a> would make it easier for developer Halo Studios, née 343 Industries, to take the game to PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>One of the impressive things about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> on launch day was its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-characters-every-superhero-and-supervillain/2900-5216/" data-ref-id="2900-5216">massive roster of heroes and supervillains</a>. From Spider-Man to Hela, each character looked and felt great to play as, and developer NetEase has ambitious plans to expand its cast of characters regularly. The studio aims to add two new characters in every future season, alongside updates, new maps, and more story content.</p><p>"Every season we'll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes. We'll actually be breaking down each season into two halves," game director Guangyun Chen said to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metro</a>. "The length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero. We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community."</p><p>The first Dracula-themed season of Marvel Rivals has kicked off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/">and will see the Fantastic Four added to the game</a>.

		<p>The first teaser for the upcoming movie based on Sony’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn">Until Dawn game</a> has revealed how the film will handle the branching narrative that is so integral to the game. Are they going to go all Clue and have<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuUrxRdJv9U"> a random ending for every time you watch it</a>? Will it be like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a> where you whip out your phone to make decisions? Well…. no.</p>
<p>In the game, the characters can die in multiple ways, so you can play through it quite a few times and get completely different outcomes. A film is a linear experience, so the director David F. Sandberg has explained that within the story, time will rewind and loop back to the start, giving the characters opportunities to try something different when they restart the night, but having to confront what Sandberg describes as being different horror genres.</p>


<p>The teaser also shows that while the location is still mountainous they have not opted to film in winter and replicate the chilly atmosphere in the game, even in its original tale. We also get our first look at Peter Stromare who is playing a character called ‘Hill’ in the game. He voiced and motion captured the role of Dr. Alan J. Hill (known in-game as “The Analyst”), the psychiatrist who popped up between chapters of the game to give you tests and offer advice.</p>
<p>The film will also star Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell. It has been stated that the film is set in the same continuity as the game so we may get a cameo from some of the original cast, although I suspect Rami Malek’s fee may be slightly larger than when he appeared in the game.</p>

<p>Until Dawn is set to arrive in movie theatres on April 25th, 2025.</p>

<p>Sony recently remastered Until Dawn for PlayStation 5 which I <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">reviewed</a>, giving it a sold 8/10. “Until Dawn remains a fantastic horror game with great acting and plenty of jump scares to get you out of your seat. While not essential for anyone that enjoyed the original game, this remake brings it to a new audience and is a solid update to what was already a great game.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-until-dawn-movie-actually-looks-kind-of-interesting.1081857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-movie-first-look<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a first-look trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>movie, which is set to land in theaters in April, and it actually looks like the folks behind the movie have some interesting ideas for the project.</p>

<p>The trailer is more of a teaser than a deep dive, but it does feature talking heads like writer Gary Dauberman, director David F. Sandberg, and actor Peter Stormare. If you've played&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, you'll know Stormare appears in the game as the sinister Dr. Hill, a role he's set to reprise in the movie.</p>

<p>Encouragingly, Dauberman says he's a "huge fan" of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, and that his goal for the movie was to "continue the story" rather than simply "giving the audience the same experience" as they had playing the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-movie-first-look-header.jpg?itok=ICXLQOP2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-movie-first-look-header.jpg?itok=s5HtQJb9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>movie won't just retell the story of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Sandberg, the movie will sport "the same tone and the same vibe" as the game, but it "expands upon the universe", so it won't just be a straight retelling of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>'s story.</p>

<p>Sandberg goes on to praise&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>'s system in which players make choices and see different deaths as a result, revealing that he's incorporated a form of this mechanic into the movie.</p>

<p>When characters die in the movie, Sandberg says "things start over and they get to try again", and that every time characters die, they're essentially revived "in a new horror genre".</p>

<p>Honestly, this approach is a lot more creative than I was expecting; I was fully prepared for&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>to be a generic slasher that limped out into theaters and was swiftly forgotten, but mercifully, it seems that's not the approach the team is taking.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>movie is set to arrive in theaters on April 25th, with a full trailer coming "soon", according to Sony. In the meantime, if you want your&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>fix, you can play the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date" rel="nofollow">recently-released remake</a>, although you'd certainly be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord" rel="nofollow">one of very few who did</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony has released a video for its upcoming Until Dawn film, giving us our first tease at what horrors await those unsuspecting teens.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting snippets to come from the trailer is how the film team is going to adapt the game's branching narrative. As those who have played Until Dawn will know, characters can die or survive depending on the different decisions made by the player. There will be a variation on this mechanic in the film.</p>

<p>"One of the creative things the game did is that people make different choices and die in different ways," explained Until Dawn's film director David F. Sandberg, adding: "The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again" (cue plenty of intense breathing).</p>
<p>So, what does this actually mean for the film's characters? "Every time they come back to life, it's like they are in a new horror genre," said Sandberg. "To survive, they have to make it until dawn."</p>
<p>Along with this news, the trailer features actor Peter Stromare, who is credited simply as Hill. "I'm very proud to be part of this evolution onto the screen," he says, before the video jumps to posters of missing teens, as an ominous ticking noise plays.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-dynasty-warriors-origins-metacritic-score/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins is out, which means its Metacritic score is available. The hack-and-slash franchise has nearly 30 years of developing and publishing mileage on the clock, so let’s see if Origins has managed to land its biggest killing blow yet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dynasty-warriors-cancelled-before-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynasty Warriors 10 was canceled</a> before it was ever shown to the public. Instead, we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynasty Warriors Origins</a>, one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-biggest-video-game-releases-of-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2025’s hottest games</a>. Origins features an unbelievable amount of soldiers on screen and more of the classic action that’s helped the series to ship over 20 million copies and counting.</p>



<p>As with any game’s release, reviews are everything. In today’s social-media-heavy society, review embargos are paramount. Everyone is desperate to know how a new title is received by critics, helping to sway people in their decision to buy it. Dynasty Warriors Origins’ reviews are out, so let’s dive into its final scores.</p>







<figure><figcaption>A beautiful blood-letting battle. Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins has a score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic.</strong></p>



<p>Individually, Origin rates <strong>85 out of 100 for PC</strong> based on 18 reviews, <strong>80 on PS5</strong> using 48 reviews, and <strong>78 on Xbox</strong>—taking into account 10 reviews.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dynasty-warriors-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origins’ Metacritic page</a> is the source for all the information we’ve collated. I find the best way to aggregate a game is the review score with the most quantitative verdicts, and in this case, it’s the <strong>PlayStation 5’s 80/100 score</strong>.</p>



<p>The Xbox’s number is only based on 10 reviews, so it’s hard to gauge this figure properly. A score of 80 out of 100 is a very good result for Dynasty Warriors—but more on this later.</p>



<h2 id="h-dynasty-warriors-origins-opencritic-score-explained">Dynasty Warriors Origins Opencritic Score Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins has a combined score of 82 out of 100—based on 62 reviews—on OpenCritic, with an “80% Critics Recommend” percentage.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17485/dynasty-warriors-origins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenCritic</a> considers more reviewers than Metacritic and is considered to be a more versatile source of reviews and opinions. It also doesn’t split up platforms and takes the best from each format for one averaged-out rating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-dynasty-warriors-origins-reviews-compare">How Do Dynasty Warriors Origins Reviews Compare?</h2>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins is the highest-rated game in the franchise’s history!</strong></p>



<p>Using Metacritic, and without historical data for 1997’s very first Dynasty Warriors, I can tell you Origins’ main Metacritic score of 80 out of 100 is a record high. Dynasty Warriors 3 and 4 are the closest competitors with a rating of 78 out of 100—so congratulations to Dynasty Warriors Origins for being the best yet.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at how every other DW title compares to Origins from a Metacritic standpoint.</p>
