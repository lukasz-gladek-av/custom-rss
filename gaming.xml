		<p>Microsoft has announced that three tentpole Call of Duty games will be available for Xbox Cloud Gaming via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> later this month. This includes the brand new launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on day one on 25th October.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023)</a> and the free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone will be available for streaming via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, rolling out to all players from 6PM BST on 25th October.</p>


<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is available across Xbox consoles, PC, Android and iOS, of course, but it’s also available on select Samsung TVs, Amazon Fire TV and Meta Quest.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that, in order to get this to happen, Microsoft will have had to cut a deal with Ubisoft. The company had to sell the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/22/microsoft-and-ubisoft-agree-streaming-rights-for-activision-blizzard-games/">streaming rights to the catalogue of Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft</a> last year, a move that was trying to placate antsy regulators to let them complete the purchase of the Call of Duty publisher. It worked, of course, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard/">Microsoft then able to close the deal almost exactly a year ago</a>.</p>
<p>Modern Warfare III is already <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-comes-to-game-pass-july-24th/">available via Game Pass since July</a>, though not for streaming. The bigger announcement earlier this year, was that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-game-pass-app-has-confirmed-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-day-one/">Black Ops 6 will be a day one launch into Xbox Game Pass</a>, with Microsoft gambling on the potential growth and engagement for the streaming platform vs. the truckloads of money they’ll initially miss out on for every subscriber… except that they then changed the bargain on what Game Pass will get you. You now need Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to get day one game launches.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 leans into all of the usual tropes and expectations of Black Ops series, with double crossing subterfuge and more through the campaign, set in the 1990s after the end of the Cold War. George HW Bush is President, and there’s lies and more swirling around that you’ll dip your toes into. The campaign is sure to be another rollicking ride of gunfire and explosions, and that will absolutely carry on over to the full multiplayer game, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/see-the-black-ops-6-zombies-gameplay-reveal-and-its-definitely-round-based/">the round-base zombies mode</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sands-steam-next-fest-demo-available-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SAND is the latest game to be published by tinyBuild and is shaping up to be a multiplayer mech FPS with PVPVE gameplay. This title did get a demo just before <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-sorcery-pvpve-extraction-arpg-gets-alpha-demo-for-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a> officially started, and players will now be able to dive into the world of Mech vs. Mech Warfare in the Steam Next Fest demo. This will allow people to team up with their friends and experience the diesel-punk world of SAND in the new public demo for the upcoming open-world FPS. People will be able to play the game in up to a team of six players and are able to customize their traveling fortresses and battle it out against each other in the demo.</p>
<p>This title is being published by tinyBuild, an iconic company that started off as an indie game developer and has managed to work their way up into a developer-publisher brand. They are behind games such as Hello Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, and Speedrunners. For this title, they have teamed up with TowerHaus, a game development and outsourcing studio based in Kyiv, Ukraine. Alongside them is Hologryph, a studio based in Lviv, Ukraine. After creating successful games such as Party Hard, Hello Neighbor, and Secret Neighbor, they work together to create SAND.</p>
<p>If you aren't sure whether you want to commit to the demo just yet, tinyBuild uploaded a seven-minute video onto YouTube that showcases the gameplay in its rawest form. In it, players are introduced to Tramplers, mechanical walkers that explore the ruins of a destroyed planet. This game features a massive, procedurally generated world where players have to work to survive encounters against rival smugglers, as well as take part in Trampler battles. If you manage to survive, you then have to find your way off of the planet with any valuables that you may have found during your exploration.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAND DEMO | 7 minutes of raw gameplay footage | Play Now On Steam" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/abHXuNB-bks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who are uncertain about being stuck inside a metal box, don't panic. There is the opportunity to disembark the Trampler and explore the dunes on foot, which will allow you to participate in close-quarter combat during fights for resources and city raids. Or, if you feel like being a nuisance to other people, you can steal the opposition's Trampler and ruin their day. As you progress, you'll be given the option to upgrade the Trampler's power, armor, weapons, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1431300/Sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAND is available to be wishlisted on Steam</a>, and the demo for this game is currently available for players to dive into.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-escape-from-tarkov/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-best-games-like-escape-from-tarkov%E2%94%82tarkov-alternatives-in-2024.1009449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-escape-from-tarkov/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov is widely considered the best extraction shooter game ever made. It has spearheaded the growth of the genre over the last ten years, and no game that has been released to compete against it has come close. It’s one of the most challenging games you’ll ever play, but some gamers appreciate that. In this list, we’re breaking down the best games like Escape from Tarkov, to give you an idea of who is trying to compete against this pioneering title.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hunting for a new Tarkov alternative or a game like Tarkov that’s not as tough, read on – we’ve got every title you need below. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-games-like-tarkov">What Are The Best Games Like Tarkov?</h2>



<p>If you want to invest time and effort in learning a new extraction shooter, you’ll be ecstatic to know that there are many games like Tarkov out there. This list represents the best alternatives you’ll find anywhere online in 2024.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-incursion-red-river">5. Incursion Red River</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Incursion Red River is a single-player and co-op extraction shooter with no PvP combat but plenty in the way of engaging gameplay and entertaining value for money. It was released in early access in April 2024, allowing players to take on a Vietnamese adventure, dodging bullets and seeking loot either with friends or alone.</p>



<p>It’s a great extraction shooter with some sumptuous visuals, but it’s nowhere near as polished as the competitors out there. That’s because it’s still an alpha product – but it’s getting there and if you invest now, you’ll be getting in early.</p>







<h3 id="h-4-hunt-showdown">4. Hunt: Showdown</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hunt: Showdown was first released in 2018, and it remains a popular enough game today. In Hunt, players are tasked with entering an open-world environment, fighting against other players and AI-based opponents, completing tasks, collecting bounties, and then extracting successfully from the map. </p>



<p>Does that sound similar? It’s a different aesthetic entirely, but it’s one of the best Tarkov alternatives.</p>







<figure></figure>







<p>Level Zero: Extraction is a shooter that’s played by some of Tarkov’s most prominent content creators. It’s more supernatural than Escape from Tarkov, but it’s a dramatically similar title as a whole. In Level Zero, players must survive against human enemies <strong>and </strong>monsters, which adds a unique twist to the typical extraction operating model.</p>



<p>It’s an early access game that was released in August 2024, which makes it one of the newest and best games like Escape from Tarkov on the market right now. It’s only available on PC, though. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-arena-breakout-infinite">2. Arena Breakout Infinite</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Arena Breakout Infinite is such a similar game to Tarkov that the developer was accused of ‘ripping off’ Battlestate Games in numerous ways. Those allegations were thrown out, though. Left in their place is a phenomenal extraction shooter that tops Escape from Tarkov in many ways. It looks phenomenal on screen and plays well, too.</p>



<p>In ‘ABI’, players are tasked with exploring various maps, securing the best loot, and winning fights against human and AI enemies, which is where the similarities to Tarkov start to creep in. If you’re looking for a brilliant Tarkov alternative in 2024, don’t sleep on Arena Breakout Infinite.</p>



<p>It’s also the only game on this list that’s free to play, so that’s a <strong>huge </strong>win.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-gray-zone-warfare">1. Gray Zone Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gray Zone Warfare is the perfect game like Tarkov for anyone wanting to scratch that tactical shooter itch. It’s not <strong>exactly </strong>an extraction shooter, but it’s remarkably similar to Escape from Tarkov in many ways. It features a gameplay loop that sees players deploy into a wide area, loot and kill to their heart’s content, complete tasks, and then successfully get back to their camp to bank their loot.</p>



<p>It differs in many ways, too. There isn’t a time limit, it’s an open-world game, and it’s more about the tactical shooter experience than the extraction shooter experience. It’s a solid game that was released in early access in 2023 by MADFINGER Games, and it skyrocketed in popularity.</p>



<p>It’s brutally realistic and deeply immersive, and it has enough meat on the bones to keep the average Tarkov fan engaged for hours on end. There’s no doubt that it’s one of the best games like Escape from Tarkov.</p>







<hr>



<p>What do you think? Are there any other games that should have made this list?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/welcome-to-strinova-a-next-gen-anime-shooter-with-a-unique-mechanic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s no secret that the hero shooter genre has become a crowded market. So when the creative team at iDreamSky started planning their next game, they knew they needed to differentiate themselves.</p><p>The result was Strinova, a third-person shooter with an anime art style and unique mechanic. It’s called “Stringification” and allows you to shift between 2D and 3D versions of your character. You become paper-thin and are much harder to see and shoot. You can hover above the ground to see more of the battlefield or stick to walls to travel across or up them. </p><p>“Usually, for a player to dodge bullets or evade attacks, you move faster, jump, or hide behind a wall. This is very traditional, and almost every game does that already,” said Alan Zhang, producer of Strinova and Vice President of Game Development at iDreamSky. “Stringify is an innovation. The new mechanics, we believe, allow players higher tolerance to move around the blocks, while providing a smoother and faster experience during a match with less risk of getting shot.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/stringify-floating-1728671899001.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you want to get to a higher vantage point, you can stick yourself to a wall and move directly up it, reaching the high point in a matter of seconds without attracting attention to yourself. If an enemy gets the drop on you, you can become super thin, making aiming harder and giving you a chance to escape. It also makes camping more difficult.</p><p>“If I camp on one spot, I can only see one dimension," said Jeff Lyndon, President of iDreamSky.  “I won’t be able to cover the wall. If someone is sticking themselves to the wall and walking straight at me, I won’t be able to see them. You need to change your angle to make sure you’re covering the area.”</p><p>Strinova introduces a brand-new universe, where characters belong to one of three factions — P.U.S., The Scissors, and Urbino — who are fighting over Energy Crystals (the battlefield targets), and they have different belief systems and objectives. P.U.S., who stick to the present, control most Energy Crystals of the current universe. The Scissors, who believe the past allows them a better life, want to unlock more Energy Crystals that allow them to return to Earth. While Urbino, the neutral mercenary faction, believe all should move on to a better future, so they work with either side to fight for Energy Crystals.</p><p>The core mode of Strinova is Demolition, a 5v5 mode where an attacking team tries to plant a bomb while a defending team tries to stop them to protect the Energy Crystals. Characters from the P.U.S. faction can only be on the defensive team, while characters from The Scissors can only be on the attacking team, but characters from Urbino can be on either side.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/1v1-gameplay-1728671930765.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“If you’re on the attack side, you probably would be missing defensive maneuvers. So you can ask your teammates to play as an Urbino character who has those capabilities,” Alan said. “Or if you’re playing as the defensive side and you’re lacking the ability to get more information about how the match is being played or where your opponent is, you’ll ask your teammate to play an Urbino character who can do that.”</p><p>Demolition is played in rounds, and after each round, your performance is assessed and you’re given points. You can use those points to upgrade your character in certain skill trees and unlock Awakening Skills that fundamentally change the way your character plays.</p><p>Each character has two distinct Awakening Skills. For example, the Urbino character Audrey starts with a heavy machine gun you can shoot on the run with lots of ammo but a wide spread. Or you can hunker down and place the machine gun like a turret, which raises accuracy but limits mobility.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/audrey-turret-mode-1728671964329.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Audrey’s first Awakening Skill allows the turret to slide side-to-side, providing mobility and the ability to change its firing angle. Her other Awakening Skill allows her to turn her turret into an autonomous sentry, allowing you to cover two points at once.</p><p>All of your skill tree selections and Awakening Skills reset after the match is over, so you can choose your upgrades based on what that specific match calls for. With unique abilities and Awakening Skills, even two characters who fill the same general role can end up playing very differently.</p><p>While characters and their roles were primarily built around the Demolition mode, that isn’t the only mode available. Escort also involves an attacking team and defending team, with one trying to push a payload forward while the other tries to stop it. The closed beta that launched October 10 added Team Deathmatch, a 7v7 match with the goal of reaching a particular kill count.</p><p>After two rounds of closed beta tests in select markets, the Strinova team has already made plenty of changes based on player feedback. But they want to hear even more, so they’re currently running another closed beta you can join. They stressed that they take community feedback very seriously and want to do all they can to give players the experience they want.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/group-gameplay-1728672009971.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We listen to the community. We create content based on what we think is cool, and we make and we test,” Jeff said. “If the community likes it, we’ll continue developing it. If the community doesn’t like it, we modify, we correct it.”</p><p>The Strinova team has added lots of content through their past beta tests, and they plan to release new maps and/or characters every two to three months. There are also collaborations with other IPs in the works, though it’s too early for the team to share details.</p><p>“Without disclosing who we’re working with, we are going to have IP collaborations on a scheduled basis,” Jeff said. “These collaborations will not just be adding a new skin. It could be coming in with a new game mode, it could be a new map, but it’s something that adds more complexity and content for players.”</p><p>Strinova is currently planned for a PC release in the very near future, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282270/Strinova/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wishlist it on Steam now</u></a>. The team plans to expand the release to consoles in 2025, with cross-progression for both platforms, so you’ll never have to start over from scratch. A mobile version of Strinova is also being developed and will be released in the near future.</p><p>The PC closed beta is live now and will run until October 21 at 5 pm (UTC+0). That’s 1 pm ET / noon CT / 10 am PT. You can check out the game’s <a href="https://x.com/Strinova_EN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/strinova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord</u></a>, or <a href="https://www.strinova.com/?media=PR&amp;media_code=NA01&amp;lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official website</u></a> to get all the info.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-multiversus-trailer-showcases-nubia-queen-of-the-amazons/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new MultiVersus trailer has dropped, showcasing the gameplay of DC's Nubia, Queen of the Amazons and protector of Themyscira. She is the latest playable character to join the extensive roster and will be available to play as of October 15, during Season 3: Sugar Spice &amp; Everything Nice. This will make her the 31st addition to the game, with there already being an extensive list of characters from The Iron Giant, Powerpuff Girls, Jason Voorhees, and Arya Stark, for example. There's something for everyone, depending on whether you prefer to be an assassin, bruiser, or mage.</p>
<p><iframe title="MultiVersus - Official Nubia &quot;Long Live the Queen&quot; Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYsJMRa5Tw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those wanting to know more about Nubia, she is a close-combat fighter but leans heavily into her role as an Assassin, as she utilizes her Staff of Understanding, a long-range spear with a sprinkle of Godly power, to make her a powerhouse on the battlefield. To celebrate the release of Nubia, a new trailer has been dropped to showcase Nubia's capabilities, and it shows off her ability to create Shockwaves using her staff, as well as her ability to kick, slash, and strike.</p>
<p>To celebrate her release, there will also be a character variant called Future State Nubia, which will be available to purchase on October 15 along with her release. Nubia isn't the only thing arriving to MultiVersus, as there will be a new battle-torn "Destroyed" version of the City of Townsville map from The Powerpuff Girls series, which will equally be available as of October 15.

<p>How many raids do you have under your belt? You likely have thousands if you’re like a few of us here at Insider Gaming.

<p>Escape From Tarkov features 13 unique bosses, with Santa Claus counting as the fourteenth, but only during the holiday event. They’ll spawn across maps, usually appearing with heavily armed guards ready to mess you up if you come too close. Some prefer to travel alone, like Killa and Tagilla.

<p>As mentioned, several seasonal and event bosses occasionally appear in Escape From Tarkov. While most people know <strong>Santa Claus</strong> from the holiday event, he’s only one. There’s also:</p>

<li><strong>Oni</strong></li>



<li><strong>Harbinger</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ghost</strong></li>

<p>They’re relatively new in-game bosses, like for a Halloween event, that you must locate and neutralize as part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-the-graven-image-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Graven Image</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A brand new event has started in GTA Online, where players will be able to fight off zombies in a new Left 4 Dead-style event. This leads players to the starting area of GTA 5, and players will now get to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3999181oaa34ko/fight-off-the-north-yankton-nightmare-in-the-new-ludendorff-cemetery-s#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%20in,new%20Ludendorff%20Cemetery%20Survival%20mode." target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience the Ludendorff Cemetary Survival Mode</a>, which was released on October 10. Since then, 400,000 people have eagerly logged into the game to play the new game mode, where players got to return to North Yankton. For many, this will be quite nostalgic, as this is where all the initial action of the story takes place, and players get to play as Trevor and Michael as they pull off a bank heist.</p>
<p><iframe title="New GTA Online Ludendorff Cemetery Survival" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDX66qVWCXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For many years, GTA Online players weren't able to explore North Yankton without using glitches to get into the area, as it's technically disconnected from the rest of Los Santos. As a result, this is the first time ever in GTA Online's history that players are able to freely go to North Yankton without having to try and break their game to get there.</p>
<p>As a result of North Yankton now being available for players to explore, over 400,000 GTA Online players have been coming back to the game to jump into the new game mode within the first 24 hours. In the past couple of days, the number has since shot up to over one million. With these numbers being so high, it's now remarked that player numbers for this event are 270% higher compared to GTA Online's last massive-scale event, Assault on ATT-16.</p>
<p>It's possible that the reason this event is doing better is because it's a wave-based zombie survival mode, which is often a popular genre, especially in games like Call of Duty and even Rockstar's very own Red Dead Redemption, which was recently announced to be making its arrival onto PC, including the iconic Undead NIghtmare add-on. However, this event will at least allow players to team up with each other, as the upcoming PC release of the game won't include any multiplayer elements.</p>
<p>Considering that GTA 5 is now over ten years old, the game continues to remain a mainstay across all platforms, and it's possible that it will gain more hype and attraction in the upcoming months before the release of GTA 6, which still remains a large mystery, as there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-map-two-times-bigger-gta-v/">barely any details</a> out about the upcoming game. While it's said that there may be a release period at the end of 2025, it's possible that it may be even later than that, depending on setbacks and the development budget.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/neva-review-poetic-platforming-perfection</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neva-review-%E2%80%93-poetic-platforming-perfection.1009416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/neva-review-poetic-platforming-perfection<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Neva</em> is an emotionally impactful piece of interactive poetry. Nomada Studios has refined their game design craft, delivering a brief, but deeply moving experience. A stellar blend of measured game design and phenomenal art direction makes it one of the best games of the year.</p>
<h2><em>Neva</em> Review – A Girl and Her Pup</h2>
<p>You play as Alba, a young woman in an enchanted forest. When the forest is overrun by a wave of corruption, its protective guardian, a giant wolf, dies protecting Alba and its pup. Alba adopts the pup, names her Neva, and embarks on a journey to make the world right again. All the while, Alba watches her new friend grow and mature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-spring-time-forest.jpg?itok=lulu-xZu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-spring-time-forest.jpg?itok=YuNyUSbs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every level looks like this. Hats off to the art direction.</figcaption></figure><p>The first early moments of the game do a fantastic job of setting up the tone and core themes. At its heart, it is an inversion of Nomada Studio's first title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gris-review-brilliantly-beautiful-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Gris</em></a>. Where that game was a melancholic meditation on loss, death, and depression, <em>Neva</em> is a celebration of life, parenthood, and the joys of nature.</p>
<p>It is a celebration that bursts off the screen through stunningly beautiful art direction. Fantastically stylized tableaus of warm colors and striking vistas. Coupled with some fluid and responsive animations, it comes together to create an experience somewhere between a game and a watercolor painting in motion.</p>
<p>Contrasting this vibrancy are the more subdued moody color palettes when you wade through corrupted areas. Mountains and forests break away into surreal, abstract vignettes. Nightmarish fields of desolation were torn apart by grasping clawing hands. Once peaceful animals twisted into pained monstrosities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-alba-in-combat.jpg?itok=M80u1NcX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-alba-in-combat.jpg?itok=skzNSDbC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bob, weave, keep moving.</figcaption></figure><p>Through visuals alone, <em>Neva</em> expresses a strong environmentalist narrative, one that can be interpreted both as a call to action against climate change and a meditation on the circle of life through the changing seasons. It is arguably the most overt theme in the game since its chapters are broken up by seasons. Starting in Spring and Summer with bright colors and friendly faces before turning into something akin to a horror experience in Fall and Winter.</p>
<p>What anchors this entire story is the central relationship between the two leads. Alba's furry companion starts as this small pup, wandering around, playing with and investigating everything around her. It is only with Alba's guidance that the pup follows and grows. Yes, there is a dedicated button to calling and petting the dog.</p>
<p>In a way, <em>Neva</em> shares similarities with Team Ico's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-guardian" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a>. Both games are about the growing relationship of a human and a supernatural dog creature. But Nomada Studios handily avoids frustrating situations by keeping the gameplay focused on Alba with her furry friend serving as a guide and aid. It's an elegant solution for interactive storytelling since it allows key moments in the story to land with precision and intention.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-broken-altar-with-monster.jpg?itok=WU07bUSv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-broken-altar-with-monster.jpg?itok=TQwp5hmf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh great, a smaller arena. Reflexes don't fail me now.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Neva</em> Review – Oh The Places You'll Go</h2>
<p><em>Neva</em> continues the proud tradition of the arthouse platformer. You will be spending most of your time moving from location to location, navigating through moderate platforming challenges.</p>
<p>Notably, Nomada Studios has greatly improved the game feel in this title. Alba doesn't just look effortlessly gracious as she twirls through the air, her jumps feel responsive and bouncy. Sword slashes are quick, and pack the right amount of punch. Getting into a chase sequence is packed with balletic tension.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing since <em>Neva</em> is expertly paced. Each level introduces a new twist on the gameplay, explores it, and then wraps it up in a nice bow before the idea overstays its welcome. It helps give each story chapter its own identity and each environment personality. The result is a platforming experience with an effortless sense of flow.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-falling-birds.jpg?itok=y2YIYBTV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-falling-birds.jpg?itok=m-Sd7Zul 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just when I think the gameplay is getting stale, these vignettes happen.</figcaption></figure><p>Complementing this platforming is some basic but serviceable hack-and-slash combat. Alba has a simple three-hit combo and a dodge roll. Eventually, she can command Neva to pounce and neutralize enemies, but that's about it.</p>
<p>Whenever enemy encounters happen, they never feel completely frivolous. This is thanks to inventive and creative arena design and a steady introduction of new enemy types. It nails the feeling of having each encounter being a puzzle of priority rather than an extensive chore.</p>
<p>It also helps the fights are designed to be quick and rewarding. Checkpoints are plentiful. Enemy attacks are telegraphed expertly with visually distinct wind-up animations. There's even a rallying mechanic where Alba can regain health by hitting enemies.</p>
<p>Yet, <em>Neva</em> doesn't completely alienate the less dextrous members of its audience. The game has two difficulty modes. Normal mode, the one I played, and story mode, which gives you unlimited health and lowers combat difficulty. It's a great compromise that will help this title age like wine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-nightmare-wolf.jpg?itok=4ho-gk90 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-nightmare-wolf.jpg?itok=0caJEZc5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's so expressive, yet Neva is still pops at the bottom, keeping the whole thing readable. Peak visual design.</figcaption></figure><p>What stuck in my mind after rolling credits on <em>Neva</em> is how it feels so precise in its gameplay and focused on its storytelling. There are plenty of games out there that focus on core gameplay, storytelling, or content by volume. But this game maintains a lean completion time of four hours packed with emotional richness and meticulous technical polish.</p>
<p>In the purest sense of the word, <em>Neva</em> is a game that must be experienced firsthand. It stands alongside the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/journey-five-years-on" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Journey</em></a> with its elegance, brevity, and emotional richness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-giant-monster-chase-sequence.jpg?itok=clAgsKFy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-giant-monster-chase-sequence.jpg?itok=QwHB0A3b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Run. Run. Keep Running!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Neva</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Nomada Studios has made something deeply moving with <em>Neva</em>. A short, but powerful experience about the persistence of nature, the joys and struggles of life, and a great visual tone poem of parenthood. It is one of the best games I've played this year and well worth your time.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Neva</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the developer over 4 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review. </em></p>

            <p>
Microsoft has announced the return of its Xbox Partner Preview digital showcase, which will feature "around 25 minutes" of games when it airs this Thursday, 17th October.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Microsoft's "no-fluff, all-games broadcast" kicks off at 6pm in the UK/10am PT and will feature "over a dozen" new trailers across its 25-minute-ish runtime.
</p>
<p>
There's talk of new game reveals, release date announcements, and new gameplay for upcoming games, with confirmed titles including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>'s The Lake House DLC, Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, and dark-fantasy action game Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.

<p>
Expect at least some chatter about Game Pass too, likely including a bit of fuss around the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-modern-warfare-3-and-warzone-coming-to-xbox-cloud-gaming">imminent arrival</a> of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and Call of Duty: Warzone for Game Pass Ultimate members - news that was shared earlier today as Microsoft celebrates a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">concluding its $69bn Activision Blizzard shopping spree</a>.
</p><p>
If that sounds like an enjoyable way to spend 25 minutes of your time this week, the Xbox Partner Preview can be viewed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a> (4K/60fps footage will be YouTube-only), with British Sign Language, American Sign Language, and audio descriptions all supported - as detailed in Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/14/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024/">announcement post</a>.

            <p>
Bungie has unveiled Destiny: Rising, a free-to-play mobile version of its sci-fi shooter series developed in collaboration with Chinese publisher NetEase, that's set to receive a "limited access closed alpha test" on iOS and Android this November.
</p>
<p>
NetEase initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-moves-to-reassure-destiny-fans-after-securing-usd100m-for-new-game">announced a partnership</a> with Bungie back in 2018, and reports began circulating in 2022 that the two were, in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-netease-reportedly-developing-destiny-mobile-game">working to bring Destiny to mobile</a>. And the fruits of that labour have now been revealed as Destiny: Rising, a "brand-new adventure set in an alternate Destiny timeline, exploring a narrative in the post-Dark Age era".
</p>
<p>
"With the help of legendary Iron Lords," Bungie teases, "humanity has broken free the shackles of tyranny and began to rally together against the alien forces intent on its extinction. Amidst the chaos of this early age for The City, a new generation of Lightbearers, resurrected by mysterious entities known as Ghosts, set out to restore humanity's prominence and secure its future."

<p>
All that'll take the form of a "shared world" experience stretching from the sanctuary of Haven to the "icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift." Single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes are included, with some set to be "familiar to Destiny players", while others are "all-new". NetEase has so far confirmed a mix of PvP and PvE, including campaigns and six-player cooperative strikes.
</p><p>
Destiny: Rising also promises a "diverse roster" of playable characters - including "familiar faces" from Destiny's past and a "host of new, intriguing characters" - all with unique abilities and stories. And if that appeals, the whole thing can be played in first-person or third-person using either a controller or touchscreen - this comes after Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-files-new-virtual-controller-patents-following-destiny-mobile-rumours">filed several patents linked to virtual controls</a> on touch-enabled devices back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Bungie hasn't yet shared a release date for Destiny: Rising, but a closed alpha test is scheduled to run on 1st November, with <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/">registrations now open</a> on the official website.
</p>
<p>
Today's announcement follows a steady dripfeed of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> news - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-teases-destiny-2s-metroidvania-expansion-with-new-concept-art-talksnext-generation-armour">recent confirmation</a> that next year's Codename: Apollo expansion will feature a "Metroidvania-inspired destination" - as Bungie continues its efforts to build enthusiasm for the game's future amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">significant layoffs</a> at the studio.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-rising-is-a-free-to-play-mobile-spin-off-from-the-developer-of-diablo-immortal-bungie-providing-oversight-and-approvals<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-destiny-mobile-game">long-rumored Destiny mobile game</a> is finally a reality, with an announcement that brings a debut trailer and word of a closed-alpha test on November 1.</p><p>Destiny: Rising is a free-to-play mobile sci-fi RPG shooter set within the Destiny universe Bungie has spent the last decade building. But this new mobile Destiny game isn’t developed or even published by Bungie itself. It’s developed and published by NetEase Games, the Chinese megacorp behind the likes of Diablo Immortal, Once Human, and the upcoming Marvel Rivals, under an official license granted by Bungie.</p><p>In 2018, NetEase invested over $100 million into Bungie to build a new game. The investment gave NetEase a minority stake in Bungie and a seat on its board of directors, but all that changed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">when Sony bought Bungie for $3.7 billion back in 2022</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Destiny Rising (@_DestinyRising) <a href="https://twitter.com/_DestinyRising/status/1845865721659617767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Now, two years after the Sony buyout and six years after NetEase's investment, Destiny: Rising is a reality. And while NetEase is the developer and publisher of Destiny: Rising, Bungie is “providing oversight and approvals of the game's development.”</p><p>In terms of gameplay, Destiny: Rising has both first-person and third-person options, with the player able to switch between them at will. Destiny: Rising supports touchscreen controls and supports PlayStation and Xbox controllers, as well as mobile-specific controllers.</p><p>While Destiny: Rising is set within the Destiny universe, its events take place in an alternate Destiny timeline. It explores a story in the post-Dark Age era (the era that took place after the Collapse of Destiny’s Golden Age). Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>As a genesis of new possibilities in the Destiny Universe, Destiny: Rising delves into an unseen era where burgeoning hope blooms once again after a terrifying collapse of civilization and the dangers of the resulting Dark Age. With the help of legendary Iron Lords, humanity has broken free the shackles of tyranny and began to rally together against the alien forces intent on its extinction. Amidst the chaos of this early age for The City, a new generation of Lightbearers, resurrected by mysterious entities known as Ghosts, set out to restore humanity’s prominence and secure its future.</blockquote><p>There’s single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer gameplay, NetEase Games said, including “beloved” game modes familiar to Destiny players, and all-new modes. There are campaign missions and six-player co-op strikes that are “iconic” to the Destiny franchise. Perhaps we’ll get something along the lines of the Cerberus Vae III strike from Destiny 1, whether we wanted it or not.</p><p>As for characters, expect “familiar” faces from Destiny as well as brand new characters. There is clan support, “fun and casual” party modes, and customizable shared spaces.</p><p>Environments include the sanctuary of Haven (a refuge for the Lightbearers and survivors), the icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift. As you’d expect, Destiny: Rising as exotic weapons, the franchises’ signature guns.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/14/netease-1728923705691.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“For over a decade, we have built this universe to contain many unique and wonderful stories, and we are excited to see mobile gamers be able to experience this new take on the Destiny universe from the creative team at NetEase,” commented Terry Redfield, creative lead at Bungie.</p><p>The announcement of Destiny: Rising comes at a troubling time for Bungie and the Destiny franchise after mass layoffs hit the legendary studio earlier this year. In September, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-set-for-major-changes-as-bungie-battles-to-win-back-players"><u>Bungie unveiled what it called “major changes” to Destiny 2</u></a> designed to win back players. Bungie has reportedly struggled to meet key financial targets, with Destiny 2 significantly underperforming last year. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2-the-final-shape"><u>The Final Shape</u></a> expansion, released in June, reportedly sold less at launch than 2023's critically panned Lightfall.'</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We are excited to see mobile gamers be able to experience this new take on the Destiny universe.</p></div><p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7240718454641606656/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LinkedIn post</u></a>, Don McGowan, the former general counsel at Bungie, reacted to the Destiny 2 changes to say he was pleased with parent company Sony’s apparent influence in the decision making, which, he said, meant the studio was finally “running the game like a business.”</p><p>Bungie reportedly has no plans for Destiny 3 and has canceled a Destiny spinoff project known as Payback. Development on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director"><u>its Marathon revival</u></a> is said to still be ongoing.</p><p>In December, IGN reported on an apparent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><u>scramble by Bungie studio leadership to avoid a total Sony takeover</u></a>. Then, in March, IGN reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director"><u>a leadership shakeup on Marathon</u></a> that included the removal of long-time Bungie designer Christopher Barrett from the game director role.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>Cast your mind back ten years. Done? Good, you survived the hideous form of time travel known as long-term memory. Now, do you see a horrendous first-person shooter anywhere back there, full of memes and intentionally terrible font choices? Congratulations, you may have remembered 420BlazeIt, a freakish eyesore of a game developed during a 7-day game jam by one of the people behind Crossy Road, of all things. It briefly did the YouTuber rounds, back when YouTube was not yet the anxiety-inducing ad factory it is today. </p>
<p>Now I'm going to ask you to come back to the present. But prepare for a bit of a shock - there's a sequel coming to that bong huffing shooter. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/420blazeit-2">420BlazeIt 2</a> has been announced for some months, but now there's a demo you can play too.</p>

<p>It is the "long awaited sequel to the FPS hit", according to the game's irony-soaked <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2624280/420BLAZEIT_2_GAME_OF_THE_YEAR_Dank_Dreams_and_Goated_Memes_wow11_Like_and_Subscribe_Poggerz_Edition/">Steam page</a>. If I was to follow the stylization of the name with complete accuracy, I would have to call it by its full title: 420BLAZEIT 2: GAME OF THE YEAR -=Dank Dreams and Goated Memes=- [#wow/11 Like and Subscribe] Poggerz Edition. </p>
<p>"The illuminati have stolen all the world’s memes!" we're told. "You’re an ex secret-service agent turned to a peaceful life of painting, but now you’re needed one more time to fight back."</p>
<p>The first thing you do is kick a piano to pieces. There is a sign nearby that says "Live, Laugh, Illuminati". As you boot down doors and blast dudes in suits with shotgun shells and AK rounds, you will endure some pounding dubstep in your ears, and the appearance of much comic sans. An arguably sorrowful moment comes when you defeat the bargain bucket swamp ogre "Sherk" while in the clutches of an ocularly punishing multicolour trance. Sherk lays bleeding, pained, dying. The sadness of this moment is undercut somewhat by the continuous vuvuzela horns bellowing over the ogre's dying words.</p><p>So yes, an atrocity upon the optic and aural nerves. The thing is... it actually handles really good? The guns are slickly animated and have a nice sense of recoil, the forceful kick upon a door is suitably hefty, and enemy bodies react to a spray of buckshot in the right sort of way, whether that's by stumbling backwards in pain and firing in the wrong direction, or by ragdolling across the floor with fierce spasms of mortality. Make no mistake, this game is a hideous crime against the ears, eyes, and brain. But it is unusually smooth to the touch. Hmmm.</p>
<p>Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise. Andrew Sum, game designer and head of studio Normal Wholesome Games, has previously said he's a big fan of shooters. He also seems very aware that this is a far cry from the other game he is known for, the popular Frogger-like phone game Crossy Road. "If players are surprised, confused, or feeling strong emotions," says his studio website, "then the team can call that a success." </p>
<p>420BlazeIt 2 will also feature a meme slider, letting you presumably adjust just how dank your playthrough can get. The original game did something similar, featuring a "dubstep controller" that worked in the background to detect how many enemies were dying and placed the "drop" accordingly. If you like the sound of that, you can still <a href="https://jigxorandy.itch.io/game-of-the-year">play the original 420BlazeIt</a> today. </p>
<p>Or better yet, grab that demo of the sequel, which we have harvested along with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/wishlisted-october-2024">all the other demos from Steam Next Fest</a>. It's a bumper crop, my friends. A bumper crop.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The announcement of any classic game remake is bound to stir up mixed feelings within a fanbase, and in the case of Silent Hill 2, some were unsure whether Bloober Team had the resume to back them to update such a beloved title. I’ve always enjoyed their games, but their handling of sensitive subjects hasn’t always gone down well, and given the importance of abuse and psychological issues within the world of Silent Hill, this was my main concern for this remake. Thankfully, my worries were fully assuaged;&nbsp;moreover, Bloober has achieved the impossible and produced an update that almost entirely supersedes the classic original.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7f5qac5f3mE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This remake retells the story of&nbsp;James Sunderland as he returns to the mysterious town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his late wife. What follows is a feverish nightmare that blurs the lines between dreams and reality whilst also serving as a haunting metaphor for the longlasting effects of trauma and abuse. Unlike the deliciously pulpy storylines of Resident Evil, Silent Hill is renowned for being darker and more mature and this tone is definitely maintained by Bloober Team.</p>


<p>There’s a moment in the first cutscene where you see a closeup of James’ hand and it’s clear that his wedding ring has gone. While a relatively subtle point it serves as a perfect example of how the extra detail and graphical fidelity can actually serve to improve on a game that relied so much on atmosphere given the technical limitations of its time. This also serves as a metaphor for the game itself – while it is clearly a loving homage and recreation of the original it is also inevitably divorced from it and struggling to become its own thing. I found myself returning to that patch of lighter skin on James’ wedding finger and reflecting on the extra layer of haunting achieved here.</p>


<p>Built within Unreal Engine 5, Silent Hill 2 looks superb. The extra details in the environment, the more sophisticated fog effects (here for effect rather than to hide technical limitations), and the character models all work together to produce a game that emulates my memories of the original rather than the blockier reality. There has been some controversy over character redesigns online, but I’d argue this is unwarranted (if not just pure bad faith) as the various people you meet feel entirely in place here. The different areas you visit are also more distinct than they felt in the original and the use of lighting and shadow is incredible.</p>
<p>Even more impressive is the sound design here. There are updated versions of most of Akira Yamaoka’s iconic score and the discordant tracks still work perfectly to create and cement the uneasy atmosphere. Ambient sounds are incredibly immersive and make for a particularly intense experience when playing with good headphones – as all good horror games should be. The voice acting is also great here, with standout performances from Luke Roberts as James and Salome R. Gunnarsdottir as Mary/Maria. Supporting characters also retain their personalities which means Laura remains just as annoying as she always was, but Eddie is given an extra layer of pathos which I appreciated.</p>

<p>Revisiting the original game before the remake – specifically the Enhanced Edition update on PC – I was surprised by just how well it held up to my nostalgic memories but also by how short it was and how little challenge the combat held thanks, in part, to having an abundance of resources in my inventory.</p>
<p>Bloober Team’s creation is a very different beast.&nbsp;I died a fair amount in my playthrough, whilst also spending far more time managing a more limited amount of consumables and ammunition. Part of the latter stems from an more dynamic system whereby you loot drawers and cupboards for resources rather than there just being set drops. Ammo is far more scarce too, as the default clips of ten bullets are replaced by handfuls.</p>
<p>This limited ammunition is key to the updated combat as the enemies are far more aggressive than in the original. Whilst enemy variety is not increased, the AI of each type has been completely overhauled and many prove to be much more threatening. Perhaps the clearest example of this is the iconic mannequins who were almost passive in the original, but here will respond to your flashlight with unsettlingly jerky and deceptively fast attacks. You can turn off your light to avoid this, but navigating many areas proves impossible without illumination. The mannequins border on being overused, but&nbsp;later levels mix their behaviour up in an unexpected fashion and ensure that they remain a danger.</p>

<p>Melee is a viable approach for most of the enemies, and the updated combat mechanics make fighting far more involved than previously. James is no ninja, though, and so there is a real sense of weight and heft to things as you swing the iconic plank and pipe. Almost all of the weapons from the original return with only one notable exception – the surprise NG+ weapon is especially effective for replays.</p>
<p>In terms of narrative, this is very much the story of Silent Hill 2, but there are many twists and surprises along the way. Puzzles and environments have been revised and updated and the overall effect is wonderfully uncanny as the world feels the same but also different enough to remain unsettling. The sense of homage is maintained through Easter eggs that show memorable landmarks from the original and feed into the sense that you as the player are experiencing an uncanny version of the events just as much as James is.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Silent Hill 2 is a fantastic remake of a true classic, Bloober Team putting their own spin on the iconic horror game. That being said, enough of rough edges remain that could put some players off – ironically the same rough edges that make it so successful for me. These echoes of some of the less positive aspects of the original game, as well as some performance issues on console, are the only negatives in a game that more than does service to the legacy of Silent Hill.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NetEase has announced Destiny: Rising, a mobile RPG shooter based on Bungie's popular sci-fi franchise. The game will be set in an alternate timeline, and its narrative unfolds in the post-Dark Age era. The premise is that, with the help of the Iron Lords, humanity has thrown off the shackles of tyranny and begun to unite against the alien forces bent on its destruction. Amid the chaos of this early age for The City, a new generation of Lightbearers, resurrected by mysterious beings known as Ghosts, set out to restore humanity's greatness and secure its future.</p>
<p>Unlike the regular Destiny games, Destiny: Rising will offer players a choice between first-person and third-person view, supporting both touchscreen and gamepad controls for those seeking greater precision. In another twist from the previous games, the game includes various playable hero characters instead of allowing users to create their own Guardian. The press release says each character will have their own story, personality, and, of course, skillset. Games modes range from campaign missions to the franchise's iconic six-player cooperative Strikes, but there will also be brand new PvE and PvP modes. There will be a strong focus on cooperative play, allowing users to create clans and customized shared spaces.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/3-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Destiny: Rising will include in-game locations like the sanctuary of Haven, a refuge for Lightbearers and survivors, the icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift. As you'd expect from a Destiny game, players will find plenty of loot, chiefly the powerful Exotic weapons with many different Trait combinations.</p>
<p>Ethan Wang, Senior Vice President at NetEase, stated:</p>
<p><em>With Destiny: Rising, NetEase Games is honored to partner with Bungie to deliver a Destiny-caliber experience to mobile devices. Destiny is an incredible franchise with a passionate and dedicated global fanbase. As huge fans ourselves, we are humbled and thrilled for the opportunity to bring gamers an action-packed RPG shooter set within the Destiny Universe.</em></p>
<p>Terry Redfield, Creative Lead at Bungie, added:</p>
<p><em>For over a decade, we have built this universe to contain many unique and wonderful stories, and we are excited to see mobile gamers be able to experience this new take on the Destiny universe from the creative team at NetEase.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising Developer Preview | &quot;What is Destiny: Rising?&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQPomw5UBCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the first outcome we've seen from NetEase's $100+ million investment in Bungie, which was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-gets-100-m-investment-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> around six years ago. Fans won't have to wait long to check it out, as a limited Closed Alpha test is scheduled for next month, and registrations are open now <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website.</a></p>

Hero characters include ones like Ikora Rey<strong> </strong>that exists in <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Destiny 2</em>, as well as a host of new characters.</p><p>Each character will have unique abilities and stories, and will be able to access single, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes. There will also be the usual Ghosts, Lightbearers, Iron Lords, and Warlords found in the <em>Destiny </em>universe before the Last City. In a trailer for the game we see a variety of characters and their new abilities, including a new void scythe that looks a lot like something a Warlock would use in the main <em>Destiny </em>games. There are also familiar enemies like the Hive, Fallen, and Vex.</p><p>“For over a decade, we&nbsp;have&nbsp;built this universe to contain&nbsp;many&nbsp;unique&nbsp;and wonderful&nbsp;stories,&nbsp;and&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;excited to&nbsp;see&nbsp;mobile gamers&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;experience this&nbsp;new&nbsp;take&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Destiny&nbsp;universe&nbsp;from the creative team at&nbsp;NetEase,” says Terry&nbsp;Redfield, creative&nbsp;lead at&nbsp;Bungie, in a press release.</p><p><em>Destiny: Rising</em> players will also be able to play in first-person or even third-person view, with touchscreen controls or controllers. There will be the usual campaign missions, six-player co-op strikes, and replayable PvE and PvP modes.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Mythic loot in Destiny: Rising.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: NetEase</cite></p></div><p>Even powerful exotic weapons will be available, alongside a new Mythic weapon rarity class that includes a new weapon type, too. All of these weapons help to fight against the darkness enemies in the <em>Destiny </em>universe in new locations like Jiangshi and the Red Sea&nbsp;Rift. Part of this new <em>Destiny </em>narrative includes searching for seeds of hope that are said to “shape the future of human civilization” after its collapse in the Dark Age of <em>Destiny </em>lore.</p><p>One big question around <em>Destiny: Rising</em> is what monetization system it will use. NetEase isn’t answering that just yet, but it <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20241011/41118_1186026.html">says in an FAQ</a> that a “good part of the main campaign will be available” in the alpha test next month alongside “at least one map for all game modes” so people can try out what the game has to offer.</p><p><em>Destiny: Rising </em>will be available first as a limited access closed alpha test on November 1st in the US and Canada. You can register for the test version at <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/">NetEase’s website</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you missed Kaan's (RPS in Gamesradar) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/before-we-leave-devs-next-chill-city-builder-is-set-on-top-of-a-giant-space-whale">announcement post from February 2023</a>, Beyond These Stars sees you raising a hex-based settlement on the back of an enormous interstellar animal. The creature is named Kewa, and its hide is rich in resources and buildable terrain.</p>
<p>Being a literally living, breathing world, however, it will be affected by your presence. In the course of the campaign, you must decide whether to form a symbiotic partnership with your host, or treat the beast as brusquely as I treat my own allotment grow bags, and plunge it into sickness and sorrow. Myself, I would probably avoid irritating <em>the planet-sized whale</em>, if only because any other star-faring species you encounter will take note of the state of your companion, and respond to you appropriately.</p><p>Beyond These Stars is, in general, very much an eco-fable that strives to avoid any suggestion of conquering territory and stripping it raw. This extends to the choice of resourcing and building options. You'll have to think about irrigation and topsoil quality while maintaining tree populations to cultivate a healthy atmosphere.</p>
<p>All this sits atop more generic building sim questions that perhaps encourage you to play more callously, such as structure adjacency bonuses and worker travel times. I always find it interesting to read about how games such as this try to resist the build-exploit-expand rhythms of their genre. As for the visual presentation in the trailer: the vital space whale component gets a bit lost behind the menus, but it all seems rather gorgeous, with water spilling through canals and clouds foaming up over forest canopies. </p>
<p>Anything you can't find on Kewa, you might be able to find by sending a rocket to establish an outpost on a nearby planet. This isn't space colonialism, the developers insist. The planets in question once "belonged" to the ancestors of your citizens, aka Peeps. As such "the Peeps are effectively reclaiming land that used to be theirs; we took care to ensure no implication that they would be displacing any other beings in the process."</p>
<p>The townsfolk are, moreover, "strictly vegetarian", so they won't be eating any of those adorable space chickens and space cows you see on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2295060/Beyond_These_Stars/">the Steam page</a>. Nor will they be mining the planets they land on, though this is more for the sake of keeping the focus on Kewa than avoiding any historical parallels. I think there's perhaps a touch of "having your 4X empire cake and eating it" here, but I respect the commitment to themes and playstyles beyond setting up oil rigs all over.</p><p>As for the release delay into 2025, "it's very important for us that we take the time to implement everything properly for our Early Access launch, and that we do so in a way that doesn't burn out our team," the developers write. "Because of this, our initially projected 2024 release date has had to shift."
