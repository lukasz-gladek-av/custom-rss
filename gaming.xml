		<p>Transformers: Galactic Trials has been announced by Outright Games, blending together racing and battling in this latest take on the Transformers franchise. Transformers: Galactic Trials is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC on 11th October 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRANSFORMERS: Galactic Trials | Announce Trailer | UK | PEGI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXT7fCiBh0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Transformers: Galactic Trials sees the Prime Relics stolen by Nemesis Prime, with both Autobots and Decepticons racing for the chance to grab their incredible power. Instead of just straight up kart racing, this is a transforming game, so you’ll be racing in Alt Mode and then flipping into Bot Mode to engage in speedy looking third person action. The two modes will feed into one another, as drifting and boosting will charge up Energon which lets you unleash special moves.</p>
<p>The game will feature both solo and local multiplayer, with ten tracks to master and levelling up the eleven Transformers that will star in the game – including fan favourites Bumblebee, Megatron and Optimus Prime.</p>

            <p>Several members at Tales of Kenzera: Zau developer Surgent Studios have been laid off.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-surgent-studios-is-cutting-jobs">Game Developer</a>, a number of former studio employees are now looking for work. Level designer Peter Brisbourne wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peteb_hello-the-chapter-entitled-pete-works-at-activity-7213868361368174594-wVBF/">LinkedIn</a>: "The chapter entitled 'Pete Works At Surgent Studios' is coming to a close at the end of the month", adding he is available for work.</p>

<p>Surgent technical artist Jordan Smee shared a similar post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213858949022785538/">LinkedIn</a>. "Well, it looks like I'm joining all the people affected by industry layoffs this year," Smee wrote. Additionally, a Surgent Studios producer going by the name of Raysura on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raysura.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> has also "officially been laid off" over the last couple of days. "Shit sucks," Raysura said. </p>
<p>"I'm another casualty of the wild west industry that is video game development," added game producer Phillip Smy on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213870230530334720/">LinkedIn</a>. Eurogamer has asked Surgent Studios for comment.</p>
<p>Word of these layoffs comes less than three months after the studio's debut game, Tales of Kenzera: Zau, released to much praise.</p>
<p>"What Tales of Kenzera lacks in creative game design it makes up for in vital, passionate storytelling," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Eurogamer's four star Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>.</p>

<p>Today's news is just the latest in a long line of studio shutdowns and redundancies in recent months. By the end of May 2024 - so not even halfway through the year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people had been laid off from their jobs this year across the industry</a>.</p>
<p>Others impacted this year include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-announces-layoffs-and-studio-closures-including-one-office-open-less-than-a-year">Just Cause developer Avalanche</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">Square Enix</a>, and that is barely scratching the surface.</p>

<p id="W7GN9s">There are a total of <strong>five map fragments </strong>to unlock in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>: one each in Gravesite Plains, Scadu Altus, Southern Shores, Rauh Ruins, and Abyssal Woods. While some map fragment locations are fairly straightforward to find, others will put your exploration skills to the test.</p>

<p id="I5BLCz">1. Start at the <strong>Castle Front Site of Grace</strong> and head southeast under the rock archway.</p>

<p id="3i9D77">Similar to the Southern Shores, you’ll need to go around a few areas to reach the <strong>Rauh Ruins map fragment</strong>.</p>
<p id="3m9AbV">1. Start from the <strong>Moorth Ruins Site of Grace</strong> and head northeast past the lake and statue of Marika into the cave.</p>
<p id="ainaG3">2. Proceed through the cave and head northwest to find another cave that leads to the <strong>Ancient Ruins Base Site of Grace</strong>.</p>

<p id="xPTEuO">In short, to reach the Darklight Catacombs, you’ll need to find the illusionary wall inside the Shadow Keep and ride the coffin taking you to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24185145/ruins-of-unte-location-how-to-get-enter">Ruins of Unte</a>.

Search along the northern wall to find the entrance to the Darklight Catacombs.</p>

<p id="RzvaBx">After completing the Darklight Catacombs, you’ll be spit out at the <strong>Forsaken Graveyard site of grace </strong>in the Abyssal Woods.</p>

<li id="4a0vHD">Follow the path south towards the Woodland Trail and don’t mind the warnings all over the place for now.</li>
<li id="yVRSEU">Continue down the path to the southeast where you’ll encounter <strong>Madding Hand</strong>, who you can either defeat or run past.</li>

<p>In Japan, a Change.org petition has surfaced to ban Assassin’s Creed Shadows. It has now been a fair few weeks since Ubisoft lifted the lid on this year’s Assassin’s Creed title, announcing a dual protagonist adventure set in Feudal Japan – a setting that fans have been desperate to experience for many years. </p>



<p>However, Japanese fans of the franchise were quick to voice their disappointment and concern about the game, with the most extreme claims suggesting that Ubisoft is floating racism and severe historical inaccuracy in Shadows, which is set to be released in November.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-down-shadows">Take Down Shadows</h2>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, users can assume control of Naoe, a shinobi, or Yasuke, a samurai and the series’ first protagonist to be based on a real historical figure. One of the main concerns is that Yasuke is being portrayed as a full-blown, respected samurai warrior in AC Shadows, and that is where the historical inaccuracies reportedly begin.</p>



<p>The recent <a href="https://www.change.org/p/%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B5%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%89%E3%82%A6%E3%82%BA%E3%81%AE%E7%99%BA%E5%A3%B2%E4%B8%AD%E6%AD%A2%E3%82%92%E6%B1%82%E3%82%81%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Change.org petition</a> that has surfaced in Japan has gathered almsot 30,000 signatures. Here’s the gist of the petition:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Recently, the lack of historical accuracy and cultural respect has been a serious issue regarding the upcoming game “Assassin’s Creed Shadows” by game developer Ubisoft. The game is based on Japanese samurai and ignores the fact that samurai were a higher class of warrior class and should have been “gokenin” or servants of nobles. In fact, the first European to receive the title of samurai, William Adams (Miura Anjin), served Tokugawa Ieyasu as a 250 koku hatamoto. In this history, Ubisoft continues to misunderstand the nature and role of samurai. This is a serious insult to Japanese culture and history, and may also be linked to Asian racism. We call on Ubisoft to immediately cancel the release of “Assassin’s Creed Shadows” and show sincere research and respect for Japanese history and culture. We need your signature. Sign this petition to let Ubisoft know the importance of cultural respect and historical accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows trailer (especially the one aired in Japanese) picked up a pretty awful likes-to-dislikes ratio. Players in other regions had some issues with the game’s flow and overall appearance, with many ruing the fact that it’s moving back to the massive open-world RPG model that was first introduced in 2017. That subsequently pushed many long-time fans out of the franchise, and it’s one of the reasons why AC Mirage did so well in 2023 – it was a small-form return to glory for the franchise.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-won%E2%80%99t-discord-stop-shoving-shit-in-my-face.917124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/discord-quests-chilling-no-thanks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aftermath has <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a wonderful Discord community that you should totally join</a>, but it is time for a confession: I hate Discord. I find it clunky and convoluted, it’s always making noises, I constantly forget to mute myself when I’m done with voice and then everyone can hear me talking to myself, and 90% of its servers <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-forum-messageboard-amazon-lost-ark-new-world-pc-1850393695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should just be forums</a>. Lately, Discord has added a new circle of Hell, in the form of all kinds of garbage it won’t stop shoving in my face.</p><p>This all began with these ridiculous little status badges that started showing up on my Discord video calls recently, announcing that I am “chilling.” Putting aside the fact that if I’m in a video call I’m <em>not</em> chilling, I’m streaming an episode of our <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a>, these things drive me bonkers. Before every stream, we have to remind each other to turn them off, which is annoying. Beyond that, I have been thinking the icon was an eggplant until <em>just now</em>, when I realized it’s a… cat sitting on a beanbag, I think? It’s hard to tell, because it’s a tiny icon and I have the eyes of a man too old to be using Discord.</p><figure><figcaption>Did you know it was a cat? I can't even see this thing.</figcaption></figure><p>Things took a new turn today, when I popped into Aftermath’s Discord to find that I had a “quest” available. What is a quest? Discord <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22225719947543-Discord-Quests-FAQ#h_01HVPBZR5F8Y7T0F1KJ0RAY9FZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> it’s “a way for players to discover games and earn rewards for streaming them on Discord.” Apparently if I connect a console to Discord and then play 10 minutes of a game on it, I will earn a “decoration” for two months. There’s also a quest related to the new Fortnite mode, which will also earn me a temporary decoration.</p><figure><figcaption>This is in my "gift inventory" tab, a thing I did not know I had and had to Google how to get to.</figcaption></figure><p>A <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/13410113109911-Avatar-Decorations#:~:text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions-,What%20are%20avatar%20decorations%3F,profile%20aesthetic%20whenever%20you%20want." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decoration</a>, another thing I’ve never heard of until today, lets you customize your Discord avatar. You can apparently buy them by going to your settings, navigating to “profiles,” and then going to the shop, a clunky journey that is very Discord. Here, you can buy virtual crap with <em>real money</em>; the decorations you spend money on are yours forever, but the quest-related ones vanish after two months.</p><p>Why did Discord need to inform me of this via my sidebar, blocking me from doing the things I came to Discord to do until I interacted with it? Why are various Discord bots popping up in my channels and DMs to tell me about features I don’t want? </p><figure><figcaption>Look at it! Get out of here!</figcaption></figure><p>Maybe it has something to do with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167147/discord-gaming-focus-redesign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord’s recent pivot (back) to gaming</a>, where in late May <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discords-next-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord CEO Jason Citron </a>spent many words talking about how Discord is a gaming app before saying, bizarrely, that “After taking stock of the world now that the pandemic is largely behind us [editor’s note: is it?]… we’ve recognized the need to narrow our focus from broadly being a community-centric chat app to being a place that helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests.” In other words, Discord should be Discord, the thing I didn’t realize it ever stopped being, and which can apparently be achieved with a bunch of garbage that actively gets in the way of me talking about games.</p><p>As far as I can tell, none of this stuff is terribly new, I just somehow managed to avoid it this long but now I cannot escape it. I hate it! Get out of my face! Stop filling my Discord, already overly busy, with more busy butt-in shit that makes my experience worse! If I wanted to be constantly annoyed with notifications I’d join more group chats on my phone, which at least have the benefit of coming from my actual friends.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes when I sit down to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/multiversus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/multiversus"><em>MultiVersus</em></a></span>, it kinda feels like I’m a child reaching into a cookie jar. Part of me knows, if I want to be a good boy, I shouldn’t be doing it. But cookies taste good as hell. That rush of mind-melting bliss when biting into a gooey, sugary treat easily overtakes the ethical considerations of disobeying my parents. Similarly, diving into <em>MultiVersus</em>’ colorful world of competitive chaos and cartoon charm is as novel and gratifying as ever. But all that joy is propped up by a dumpster fire full of free-to-play, service gaming tropes, some so poorly thought out or predatory that it’s shocking they made it out the gate at all. Having to qualify a good time with a bold asterisk of caveats is the <em>MultiVersus</em> experience.</p><p>First, the basics: <em>MultiVersus</em> is a “platform fighter,” which basically means it’s a derivative work of the <em>Smash Bros.</em> style and structure. It’s also a massive IP crossover, with a roster full of hits from cartoons, movies, and shows under the Warner Bros. umbrella. There’s no holding back in terms of worrying what source material children may be exposed to for the first time either, with <em>Friday the 13th</em>’s Jason Voorhees and <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ Arya Stark in the mix right alongside characters from <em>Scooby-Doo</em> and <em>Adventure Time</em>. It’s one of the best of its kind as well, with a rock-solid foundation combining the party game chaos this genre is known for with a surprisingly serious interest in the language and cadence of a capital-F Fighting game.</p><p>In the hands of developer Player First Games, that combo works quite well. Each character has a lengthy and creative move set full of distinct, IP-flavored properties alongside more common video game elements such as “cold things make you slow.” Looking at command lists is almost daunting in a MOBA kind of way, but in practice the basics are so rock-solid and uncomplicated that you can ignore the nuance and still have a great time. Between the stuff that’s obviously taken from <em>Smash</em> and the little dashes of extras and new ideas, <em>MultiVersus</em> makes an incredible first impression. From a gameplay perspective, anyway. When you boot the game up, the menus and UI begin to tell a different story entirely.</p><p>This could have been a heck of a comeback story. <em>MultiVersus</em> originally came out in 2022 as an “Open Beta,” inviting players to try the game out and maybe drop some dollars to become “Founders” in exchange for some goodies. Despite general aversion to “GaaS” models and feelings that there was something a bit cynical about Warner Bros. just tossing a bunch of the IPs it’s accumulated into a crossover fighter, it seemed like <em>MultiVersus</em> was a hit. Between a strong debut tournament at EVO, surprisingly compelling vibes and mechanics, and shocking player numbers, the momentum was stronger than anyone expected.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="e8bc7a4871c3fc6525dd9bf637b2d755" data-recommend-id="image://e8bc7a4871c3fc6525dd9bf637b2d755" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of characters fighting in MultiVersus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of characters fighting in MultiVersus." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8bc7a4871c3fc6525dd9bf637b2d755" data-recommend-id="image://e8bc7a4871c3fc6525dd9bf637b2d755" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of characters fighting in MultiVersus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately it wasn’t long before <em>MultiVersus</em> started buckling under its own weight. Player First is a small team saddled with an enormous task. The game was plagued with technical issues and balancing problems that only became more evident as more people dug in. Fixes made other problems pop up, and it felt like there was always something wrong, from overpowered characters to devastating fundamental flaws.<br></p><p>To PFG’s credit, these folks did an absurd amount of work in record time, even completely overhauling how hitboxes worked. At the same time, that work had to be funded somehow, and the microtransactions, seasonal content, and so on were also implemented during this “Open Beta” run. This stuff came with its own set of problems, as PFG grappled with reward allotments, Battle Pass XP scaling, event timing, yadda yadda. A lot of real-time learning was happening, to say the least.<br></p><p>Then <em>MultiVersus</em> was unexpectedly shut down. The “Open Beta” period had ended, the feedback was collected, and the devs needed to go head down for a while to come back with the best game they could make for 1.0. This came as a surprise for many; most players expected the Open Beta to simply roll into 1.0, as is often the case in similar service games, especially since a lot of money had already changed hands, as players bought Founder packs, skins, multiple Battle Passes, and more. That brings us to today. <em>MultiVersus</em> 1.0 arrived a few weeks ago, and I wanted to take my time with it, being sure that I was giving PFG a fair shake, as well as time to smooth out bugs, and maybe also Bugs if he came out too strong again. Given how strong its foundations are, I was really hoping for this game to get a win after so much turbulence. Unfortunately, though, it hasn’t quite worked out that way.<br></p><p>Throughout these first few weeks following 1.0’s release, <em>MultiVersus</em> has once again been a solid game plagued by problems. Bafflingly, some of those problems were repeats from before, such as a very deja vu-inducing lack of Battle Pass XP from playing matches, as well as XP being added but at an insultingly low rate. There were important features and options, including accessibility-oriented settings, that were just absent for no reason. Perhaps the loudest and strangest omission was one that immediately <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-unlock-characters-local-tournaments-1851505068&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-unlock-characters-local-tournaments-1851505068">made <em>MultiVersus</em>’ strong community prospects look dire</a></span>.<br></p><p>All of this stuff has been addressed or is confirmed to be addressed soon, following days of yelling or pleading from players in some cases. The messaging has been rough, with nobody actually knowing if some of these changes, omissions, or alleged bugs were on purpose or not until after the reactions were creating headlines and viral social media posts. It’s hard to undo that kind of damage.<br></p><p>Which is a shame, because <em>MultiVersus</em> remains a blast to play, especially after an initial round of patches and hotfixes. It’s a slower game than before, with a ton of effort put into making the action more reactive and visually digestible. The characters are a little larger, and the camera is more zoomed in. Additional animation work has been done to make hit detection more legible, and the end result of all this is a platform fighter that feels informed by “normal” fighting game logic in many ways. Spacing, reacting, reading, punishing, zoning, footsies…all these keywords are more pronounced in <em>MultiVersus</em> 1.0.<br></p><p>To me, this is a substantial improvement across the board. I understand some of the negative reaction to the slower pace, but speed isn’t an inherent plus for fighters. I may be exposing myself as someone who prefers <em>Street Fighter</em>, but having the breathing space to think more heavily about what I’m doing, and what my opponent is doing, feels better. And having that kind of mentality in a platform fighter feels distinct. Plus, it really helps the style coursing through every element of <em>MultiVersus</em> really shine.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="e8d4b171c727ec920ab6df532d3a541f" data-recommend-id="image://e8d4b171c727ec920ab6df532d3a541f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shaggy from Scooby-Doo is shown with an assortment of &quot;perk&quot; icons next to him.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One thing that hasn’t changed from the Open Beta to now is <em>MultiVersus</em>’ radiating passion for the characters and properties it pulls from. While you can’t argue that this game has anywhere near the same polish or production value as <em>Smash Bros.</em>, the amount of creativity, effort, and love put into molding these characters into a coherent fighting game universe is very close. My favorite example is Tom and Jerry, a pair of troublemakers who are living out an episode of their cartoon show instead of actively participating in combat. Jason Voorhees, a new example, has been presented in a new way visually, but has iconic movie moments built into his moveset. The <em>Looney Tunes</em> energy and reality-breaking toon lunacy is all over the place, even beyond the characters. This is the secret sauce <em>MultiVersus</em> is operating with, and a huge part of what makes the game feel special compared to its peers, despite its glaring problems and GaaS failings.<br></p><p>The new Rifts mode encapsulates that tug-of-war between the secret sauce and the corporatized, free-to-play gaming nonsense. <em>MultiVersus</em> needed a campaign-style mode for non-competitive players. This is that, and in a lot of ways it feels similar to a classic <em>Smash Bros.</em> mode. You make your way through stages that are themed, with specific opponents that have various buffs or other unusual gameplay gimmicks to break up the normal. There are goofy challenges like breaking targets, or a jump rope minigame that simpy exists to highlight the absurdity.<br></p><p>But of course, there’s a moment when the monkey’s paw curls a finger. Rifts have a “Gems” system woven in that asks players to equip these collectibles rewarding stat bonuses and extra buffs. Playing higher difficulties requires grinding the everloving bejeezus out of these Gems, and that’s just to get the doors to open. Succeeding requires further grinding, and even participating in some of the stage objectives (necessary to unlock more Gems) can require things like specific characters or even premium skins in some cases.<br></p><p>Currently, one of the new characters (Agent Smith of <em>The Matrix</em>) can be unlocked early, but it requires defeating 20 distinct bosses, something that can only be accomplished by going through multiple Rifts and multiple difficulty levels. The Rifts are still being rolled out, and it’s not actually possible to get Smith yet, but the prospect of staring down a sort of miniature Battle Pass that asks you to turn the silly campaign mode into a second job is exhausting. But hey, you can just wait a few weeks and pay up your real money if you don’t want to deal with all this!<br></p><p>Enjoying <em>MultiVersus</em> is a series of “yeah, but”s. It launched in poor shape with missing features and settings. Yeah, <em>but</em> it’s a fun, well-designed game that is full of tangible passion. There’s an absurd amount of grinding and pressure to spend money, even incorporated into the campaign mode. Yeah, <em>but</em> it’s a fun campaign with a lot of funny gimmicks and co-op! The roster is big and the new characters are great! Yeah, <em>but</em> you’re expected to grind daily or pony up chunks of cash to actually use them.<br></p><p>It’s the cookie jar. I want to play and praise <em>MultiVersus</em> for everything it does right. But everything it does poorly, or even wrong in a sense, has me wanting to slap my own wrist. <em>MultiVersus</em> has even managed to bungle those aspects of the games-as-a-service model that players have largely come to accept. There has been some course-correcting since launch, but the fact that was even necessary only shows how some forces behind these kinds of games are always ready to push the boundaries on monetization. It feels wrong, ethically, to participate in, and especially to recommend this game to others. But at the same time, it’s so good! Not even in the skinner box kind of way; <em>MultiVersus</em> is a legitimately well-made and lovingly constructed platform fighter that celebrates cartoons and movies I enjoy in effective, gameplay-centric ways. Rick and Morty are there too, I guess.<br></p><p><em>MultiVersus</em> is great. But I wouldn’t feel good about letting my own kid play it. That sucks.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Star Wars Jedi Survivor looks utterly stunning at 8K resolution with a few mods, including one that improves the visuals consistently.</p>
<p>A new video put together by Beyond Dreams shows the second entry in the series developed by Respawn running at 8K resolution with mods like Ultra +, which, similarly to the mod developed for Hogwarts Legacy, improves effects such as water effects, lighting, and textures. Further improving the game's visuals is the Complete RT shader by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NiceGuy</a>, an advanced screen space ray tracing shader that lets users add global illumination with effects like Diffuse Illumination and Specular Reflection, ambient occlusion, and glossy reflections to any game. You can check out the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K] Star Wars Jedi Survivor: Close to Realism!! RayTracing Mod - Complete RT - Ultra Plus 100+ Mods" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5Q119g8gfo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While mods have improved Star Wars Jedi Survivor visuals, none have managed to improve its performance, which still leaves a lot to be desired even after multiple patches. It is a shame the game does not run well on any platform, as it is a definite step forward over its predecessor in every possible way, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi Survivor is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It will eventually launch on <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-rated-for-playstation-4-xbox-one/">PlayStation 4 and Xbox One</a> as well.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24190672/resident-evil-9-capcom</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-resident-evil-in-the-works-with-the-man-responsible-for-reinventing-the-series-at-the-helm.917061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190672/resident-evil-9-capcom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ZRSMkQ">The next mainline Resident Evil game is in development, game director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed Monday in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQnubIc5cs&amp;t=383s">a video streamed by Capcom</a>.</p>
<p id="bZcuFy">Nakanishi was the director of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/23/14287196/resident-evil-7-review-re7-vii-biohazard-ps4-playstation-4-vr-psvr-pc-windows-xbox-one-capcom"><em>Resident Evil 7 biohazard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/5/24/4361030/resident-evil-revelations-review-secret-weapon"><em>Resident Evil: Revelations</em></a>, and also served as a designer on <em>Resident Evil 5</em>. In other words, Nakanishi’s games have both steered Resident Evil back toward its horror roots, while also trying to reinvent the franchise in important ways.</p>
<p id="ExIkjl">In confirming the new Resident Evil, Nakanishi said, “It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [<em>Resident Evil 7</em>]. But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial.” Nakanishi said he couldn’t say more about the next game, the follow-up to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22420808/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-pc-xbox-series-x-one-ps4"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>, but hoped that fans will look forward to its official reveal.</p>
<div id="1NEVAe"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FmQnubIc5cs?rel=0&amp;start=383" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Y3QPQ5">2017’s <em>Resident Evil 7 biohazard</em> was a major turn for the franchise, shifting the action from third-person to first-person and introducing a new playable protagonist, Ethan Winters. <em>Village</em>, released in 2021, is said by Capcom to be the end of the Winters family saga, meaning <em>Resident Evil 9</em> will likely feature the return of a classic Resident Evil hero or another brand-new character.</p>
<p id="zLedY0">The most recent entry in Capcom’s survival horror franchise was last year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23643823/resident-evil-4-remake-review-capcom-ps5">remake of <em>Resident Evil 4</em></a>, which starred Leon S. Kennedy. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23891490/resident-evil-4-remake-dlc-review-separate-ways"><em>Separate Ways</em> add-on</a> starring Ada Wong was released for <em>RE4</em> in September 2023. </p>
<p id="N38H8r">Capcom is reported to have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-reportedly-in-the-works-at-capcom">multiple Resident Evil projects in development</a>, including remakes of <em>Resident Evil Zero</em> and <em>Code Veronica</em>. There’s no official release window for <em>Resident Evil 9</em>, but given Capcom’s recent cadence of releasing a sequel or remake every other year, we could see the next Resident Evil as early as 2025.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYzTOfAlKTc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new trailer</a> released today, UNIVRS confirmed that Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable will launch into Early Access on July 23, 2024.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://aotvrub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> includes a small roadmap, which teases that the full release is still planned for “later 2024.” Since Early Access arrives in late July, the full launch will likely end up in Q4.</p>



<p>The Chapter 1 &amp; 2 Early Access version will be available for $4.99, “with update support alongside the 1.0 release.”</p>



<p>The roadmap adds that the 1.0 build release will include more chapters and a co-op mode at regular pricing. UNIVRS did not confirm the exact pricing for the full release, at this time.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>UNIVRS also invited fans to join the Discord launch in order to provide feedback during the Early Access period.</p>



<p>The devs describe Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable as a “3D Maneuvering Action-adventure game.” Players will “become a member of the Scout Regiment,” and even get to fly with Omni Directional Mobility Gear.</p>



<p>Today’s trailer showcased a variety of bloody combat and map traversal mechanics. It will clearly be as brutal as the source material. However, it’s unclear if the story will be original or follow existing beats from the beloved series.</p>



<p>Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable will be available on Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3. It will support both English and Japanese languages and voicing.</p>

<p>Nintendo is continuing to go after those it feels encourages and supports the piracy of its consoles and games. The company has filed more lawsuits against two parties in a Washington federal court. </p>



<p>As first discovered by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TorrentFreak</a>, Nintendo has filed two new suits. The first goes after Modded Hardware, specifically Ryan Daly who runs the group. The suit says that Nintendo asked Daly stop selling his modded hardware, but after he didn’t despite agreeing to do so, the company sued. According to the claims in the lawsuit, Nintendo says Modded Hardware sells various hardware that allows the Switch to play pirated copies of games.</p>



<p>The second lawsuit goes against James “Archbox” Williams. In this suit, Nintendo says Williams encourages piracy and is the “driving force” behind “several Pirate Shops”.</p>



<p>“Defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo’s intellectual property rights. Indeed, Defendant has bragged publicly that he is a ‘pirate’ who ‘[isn’t] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game’,” Nintendo says in the filing.</p>



<p>They say that Williams has helped people get easier access to pirate games for the Switch, and was magnified due to the aforementioned SwitchPirates subreddit. Williams is a moderator of the subreddit.</p>



<p>With both lawsuits, damages aren’t mentioned by Nintendo directly. That said, it could lead to millions of dollars if history is any indication. Recently, the company had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuzu-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular emulator YuZu shut down</a> after taking it to court. Yuzu developer Tropic Haze also agreed to a $2.4 million settlement.</p>

<p>Development is being handled by&nbsp;<em>Race with Ryan&nbsp;</em>studio 3DClouds, but don't let that discourage you; these are also the folks that made...erm...<em>Paw Patrol Grand Prix&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gigantosaurus Dino Kart</em>.</p>
<p>Still, maybe this one will make you happy if you're hankering for some&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>action.

<p>Progressing through the game's main Galactic Trials mode will give you the chance to unlock relics and improve your characters' skills, as well as unlocking new characters and skins.</p>
<p>If you feel like simply jumping into a quick bout, however,&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Galactic Trials&nbsp;</em>also supports a two-player Arcade mode, which pits you against a friend in split-screen multiplayer.</p>

<p>This is far from the Transformers' first excursion into the world of video games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-needs-to-cancel-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-according-to-a-group-of-japanese-gamers.917007/</guid>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows needs to be canceled by Ubisoft, according to a group of Japanese gamers.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal of Shadows</a> (previously dubbed&nbsp; Assassin's Creed: Red) back in May of this year, plenty of 'fans' took to social media to discuss Ubisoft's choice for the game's main protagonists. Not only has there been a vocal discussion about character representation, but a group of Japanese gamers also seemingly don't agree with the game's historical accuracy and the lack of cultural respect from Ubisoft. As a matter of fact, there's <a href="https://www.change.org/p/%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B5%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%89%E3%82%A6%E3%82%BA%E3%81%AE%E7%99%BA%E5%A3%B2%E4%B8%AD%E6%AD%A2%E3%82%92%E6%B1%82%E3%82%81%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now a Japanese petition</a> on Charge.org that demands Ubisoft to cancel the title.</p>
<p>"Recently, a serious issue of historical accuracy and lack of cultural respect has been raised about game developer Ubisoft's upcoming release, Assassin's Creed Shadows", the creators of the petition write (roughly translated). "The game is based on the subject of Japanese samurai and ignores the fact that samurai are a higher class of samurai and should be "gokemono" or servants of nobility. In fact, the first European to receive the title of samurai, William Adams (Miura Anobori), was a bannerman with 250 koku and served Tokugawa Ieyasu. Throughout this history, Ubisoft continues to misunderstand the nature and role of the Samurai.</p>
<p>According to the group, this misunderstanding about the nature and role of the historical Samurai is a serious insult to Japanese history and culture, which could lead to Asian racism. "We demand that Ubisoft immediately stop the release of "Assassin's Creed Shadows" and show serious investigation and respect for Japanese history and culture", the group writes.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing, more the petition has over 28.300 signatures with the next goal being 35.000 signatures. Out of those 28.300, more than 13.500 people signed the petition today.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that this petition will have effect on the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows later this year, but it will be interesting to see how Ubisoft will handle this heavily-signed petition. We'll update you as soon as more about the game comes in.&nbsp; What are your thoughts about this petition? Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is slated for a launch on November 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-smaller-origins-sized-map-not-all-of-japan-covered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will feature only a part of Japan, and will return to the map size as seen in Assassin's Creed: Origins</a>.</p>

While it can function fine as a standard crossbow, its Ash of War—which allows it to fire back-to-back bolts at a staggering speed—makes it stand out among other weapons in its class. Thanks to its fairly reasonable stat requirements, it can make a great ranged option for almost any endgame build.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s what you need to know about the Repeating Crossbow and where to find it.</p><h2 id="h3215"><a id="stats"></a>Repeating Crossbow stats and features</h2><p>The Repeating Crossbow has a weight of 6.0 and requires the following stats to wield:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>STR: 13</li><li>DEX: 15</li></ul><p>The weapon comes equipped with Ash of War: Repeating Fire.
