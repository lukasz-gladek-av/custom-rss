                <p>The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red has discussed what it's learned throughout decades of development, and one of the key takeaways is that the studio should focus on what it's best at instead of trying too many different things.</p><p>"We've learned that we have to be razor-sharp focused," chairman Marcin Iwinski said on the AnsweRed podcast, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-developer-cd-projekt-plans-to-stick-to-its-niche-and-thats-aaa-rpg-open-world-narrative-driven-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported by IGN</a>. "We cannot do so many things we would love to do--we are <em>tempted</em> to do. We tried and it didn't work out. We have to focus on what we are good at, and really put 100% into it."</p><p>Joint-CEO Adam Badowski added, "We're gonna develop AAA RPG, open-world narrative-driven games and this is our, let's say, niche. So the focus is there."</p><p>Iwinski said this sounds simple, but there were temptations to try new things outside of the company's core focus. "And you think, 'OK, no, let's take a deep breath and come back to what we're doing. Because if we spread ourselves too thin, we'll not deliver," Iwinski said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sYilj_DIGc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6sYilj_DIGc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not immediately clear what Iwinski meant when he said, "We tried and it didn't work out."

<p>"Just checked because I [saw] a post on X from Wario64 and it was about [making] sure payment is and all is good to go for when they are ready to ship.. I [checked] and my order got cancelled two days ago," reads one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1kylszy/target_canceled_my_order/">reddit post titled Target cancelled my order</a>. According to replies, the original poster is not the only one this has happened to.</p>
<p>Another post - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1kzkboe/did_anyone_elses_switch_2_preorder_get_cancelled/">Did anyone else's Switch 2 preorder get cancelled out of nowhere?</a> - shared on the Walmart subreddit said the same thing. "I just got an email saying it was canceled due to a payment error even though it was the same card I preordered it with," it reads.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://x.com/MechaPaddington/status/1928635220070150169">more examples of these Switch 2 cancellations</a> can be found on X. "Walmart you have failed me for cancelling my switch 2 preorder when my payment method is valid and has funds available, give it back," <a href="https://x.com/Bumbles1593/status/1928607013644165162">one poster wrote over the weekend</a>.</p>
<p>While Walmart and Target seem to be the main retailers in the US to have cancelled Switch 2 orders, <a href="https://x.com/noggin_chomper/status/1929273279459594600">GameStop has also been namechecked online</a>, although the problem doesn't appear to be as widespread.</p> <div>

<p>These reports follow last week's news here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-cancels-some-switch-2-online-pre-orders-a-week-before-launch">which saw retailer GAME admit it had cancelled a number of Switch 2 online pre-orders</a>, with just days to go before the highly anticipated console's release. At this time, GAME said it was aiming to "reinstate as many affected pre-orders as possible".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is set to release later this week, on 5th of June. Eurogamer's former EIC Tom Phillips has already been hands-on with Nintendo's upcoming console.

			<p>The upcoming PC release of Stellar Blade is going to be accompanied by all sorts of mods, and the game's developer seems to have already embraced them fully, offering praise for a mod now available for the recently released playable demo.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1929193800133742858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1929193800133742858%7Ctwgr%5Ebf7019ef9ac22b6b565cee10c60ca44810a6777a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespark.jp%2Farticle%2F2025%2F06%2F02%2F153330.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the game's official profile recently shared a short clip showcasing a modded VR mode now available for the demo via <a href="https://github.com/praydog/UEVR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UEVR</a>, praising it without reservations, leading some users to ask about the future addition of a PSVR 2 mode on PlayStation 5. Sadly, the developer has not clarified if this could be a possibility, so for the time being, the only way to play the game with a VR headset will be with the PC version launching next week. In case you do not own a VR headset, but still want to check out how Stellar Blade plays in VR mode, you can check out the video below by Paradise Decay.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Stellar Blade playable demo launched on Steam<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-demo/"> last week</a>. The demo allows players to try out the first hour of the game as well as fight against a boss found later in the story to let players try out some of Eve's advanced abilities. Save data from the demo can also be imported into the full release, which will launch on June 12th. You can learn more about what to expect from the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast-dungeons-and-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced that it will publish a&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game currently in the works at&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&nbsp;</em>director Stig Asmussen's studio Giant Skull.</p>

<p>Per a VentureBeat <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-publishing-agreement-with-giant-skull/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the game is a "single-player action-adventure game with an immersive story set in the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>universe". Asmussen and Giant Skull haven't revealed more details about the project yet.</p>

<p>In a statement to VentureBeat, Asmussen says the goal with the studio's&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>game is to "craft a rich new&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat, and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-jedi-survivor-giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast.jpg?itok=msBqu285 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-jedi-survivor-giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast.jpg?itok=uYnA61gM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Stig Asmussen's previous works include&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>For his part, Wizards of the Coast president John Hight says Giant Skull is full of "exceptionally talented creators", and that the collaboration between the two companies represents a new development in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players" rel="nofollow">"Playing to Win strategy"</a>.</p>

<p>The description of the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game in the works at Giant Skull isn't particularly specific, but it does rather sound like Asmussen's M.O.; he's previously served as the director on games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;God of War III</i>.</p>

<p>Asmussen first announced the founding of Giant Skull <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stig-asmussen-giant-skull-star-wars-jedi" rel="nofollow">in March last year</a>, following his departure from Respawn and its parent company EA in late 2023. At the time of Giant Skull's founding, Asmussen said his philosophy was simple: the world "need[s] video games, and [it needs] people to make them".</p>

<p>At the time, Giant Skull simply said that development on its first project was underway, but now, it looks like we know what that project is going to be (unless there's a second game in development at Giant Skull, which is perhaps unlikely).</p>

There's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gameloft-dungeons-dragons-game" rel="nofollow">life sim-survival hybrid</a> in the works at&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>studio Gameloft, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service multiplayer game</a> from&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze.</p>

<p>If you want solo thrills, though, it sounds like Giant Skull's game will be your jam. Stay tuned for more info on this one as and when we get it.</p>

In today’s announcement, Wojciechowski wrote that cancellations were due to an unspecified publisher’s failure to present necessary publishing agreements, and a “lack of communication” regarding whether or not the publisher wants to continue with development. </p><p>The statement also attributed the cancellations to issues with the publisher’s cash flow stating it, “showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production.” And the name of the publisher? It isn’t exactly a mystery. In the developer’s statement from December, People Can Fly named its collaborator on Project Gemini as Square Enix.People Can Fly — which was acquired by Epic Games in 2012 before going independent again in 2015 — will continue development on Xbox’s next <em>Gears of War</em> title, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></a>, as a partner studio working with The Coalition.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But I was nevertheless intrigued by a recent demo for the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250319823476/en/Consume-Me-Wins-the-Seumas-McNally-Grand-Prize-and-Nuovo-Award-at-the-27th-Annual-Independent-Games-Festival-Awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGF</a> award-winning <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Consume Me</em></a>, a schedule-based game that sees you managing a teenager’s packed days while dealing with pressures of food and body image.</p><p><strong>(Content note for themes of disordered eating.)</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="consume me trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdhqAffkVb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Consume Me</em> follows a high school girl named Jenny through her days. The game started in the summer, but Jenny still had plenty to do. Each day is broken into sections that you can fill with tasks from your to-do list, such as chores, studying, exercise, and even just vegging out. Chores like cleaning the bathroom or walking the dog gave me some of the money I needed to buy a swimsuit for a party at the end of the week to impress a boy; meanwhile, I felt pressured to become “interesting” so the boy would like me, via optional tasks like learning to do my makeup. Getting makeup to learn with, of course, required some of that money I was saving for the swimsuit, which required doing more chores, which meant missing out on all of the other tasks I needed or wanted to do.&nbsp;</p><p>These tasks are all done via <em>WarioWare</em>-style minigames. They’re hectic and imprecise in ways that feel like they really capture the chaos of being an over-burdened young person in an awkward teenage body. Studying, for example, is done by clicking your mouse to keep your gaze aligned on a rotating book while avoiding distractions. Folding laundry requires you to click when some lines meet to precisely fold your clothes. Exercising requires you to fling your character’s head and arms to match poses. As you play, you can earn items or level up stats that make these games easier, but I never felt like I’d mastered them.</p><p>A big part of these games involves dieting and food. Early on, Jenny’s mother criticizes her weight, inspiring her to start dieting. “Maybe I really should go on a diet,” Jenny says. “But I’ve never done that before. I don’t know how?!” That “how” is by taking in under a certain amount of calories every day (here called “bites”); at first you do this by balancing food items on a plate, but later you have to arrange <em>Tetris</em>-looking blocks on a grid, filling up as many hunger-representing blocks as you can while still staying under your bite goal. If you don’t fill enough blocks, you have to have a snack in the middle of the night, costing money if you have to buy one at the store and potentially putting you over your bite limit.</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>It was easy, as <em>Consume Me</em> surely intends, to fall into unhealthy habits: exercising off my excess bites, buying gum at the store to satisfy my hunger meter without actually consuming bites, feeding my highest-bite food to the dog instead of trying to fit it into my grid. Eating, like the rest of Jenny’s life, is a balancing act, and I was never able to make everything work in harmony: money had to be sacrificed to mood, mood had to be sacrificed to my diet goals, my diet goals had to be sacrificed to eating enough food to function. Jenny’s calendar features a weigh-in date, and these moments are stressful and intense. There’s a lengthy warning at the beginning of the demo for all of these topics, and though the game obscures calorie-counting through bites and the scale relies on emojis rather than numbers, it might be a hard game to play if those kinds of topics are particularly tough for you.</p><figure><figcaption>Hexecutable</figcaption></figure><p>I started this paragraph by writing “I’ve never really struggled with my weight,” but that’s not quite true. When I was a kid, my mom was very focused on her looks and had high standards for femininity, which my twin sister and I could never live up to; my sister was captain of (and the only girl on) our high school wrestling team, and I’m a trans guy, though I didn’t have the words for that at the time. Between how seldom my mom actually ate the dinners she cooked and my sister regularly doing extreme weight-loss things for wrestling, it wasn’t until I was an adult that I realized I had little idea what “normal” eating looks like, or a realistic understanding of what it means to be a healthy weight. While my mom was never as straightforwardly critical about weight as Jenny’s mom (unlike her frequent criticisms of my femininity; one of the only good things about going bald has been not having to go to the hairdresser anymore, the scene of screaming matches between my mom and I that made me panic well into adulthood), her ideas about weight and food definitely got in my head. My sister went on to join the Army, which comes with its own body image pressures, especially for women; when I visit her, we’ll often both notice the way she inadvertently talks to her own kids about weight and exercise and try to do things differently.&nbsp;</p><p>Revisiting stuff like this is why I don’t like playing games about being a teenager, but I appreciated the way <em>Consume Me </em>balances this core theme with other issues and topics, and the way the whimsical design of the minigames keeps things from getting too dark. <em>Consume Me</em>’s Steam description says the game features “over 13 possible endings: Most of them bad,” which sounds about right for growing up. It’s a game that maintains a skillful balance between being really fun and kind of super upsetting, and I’m curious to see if it can keep that balance when the full game comes out <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/tisch-research-news-events/news/jenny-jiao-hsia-consume-me-unlike-anything-youve-played-before.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later this year</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-nightreign-starter-guide"><h3>What You Should Know Before Starting Elden Ring Nightreign</h3></a><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is condensed and fast paced, so here's some tips from our friends at Big Friendly Guide.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parrying-clair-obscur-ea"><h3>It’s Never Too Late To Talk About A Video Game</h3></a><p>It's also never too late to have *obviously correct* opinions about video game mechanics</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/switch-2-xbox-playstation-exclusivity"><h3>Video Game Consoles Are Dead</h3></a><p>While Nintendo still focuses on console exclusivity, the rest of the video game industry is changing</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s Arm-based PC chip could make its debut in Alienware’s laptops later this year or in early 2026, according to a report from the <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/8778234">Taiwanese publication <em>United Daily News</em></a>. The chipmaking giant is reportedly working with MediaTek to develop an accelerated processing unit (APU) that combines an Arm-powered CPU with Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU architecture.</p><p>Nvidia is already popular in traditional gaming laptops using Intel or AMD chips, but an Arm CPU entry may well improve the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24215905/microsoft-windows-on-arm-gaming-laptops-notepad">Windows on Arm gaming situation</a>. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips have to run games emulated using Microsoft’s Prism software, and game compatibility and performance is severely limited on Qualcomm’s GPUs right now. </p><p>We first heard rumors about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23929240/nvidia-amd-cpu-arm-pc-chips-2025-release-rumors">Nvidia’s Arm-based chip in 2023</a>, which could serve as yet another competitor to Intel’s chips and the Arm processors built by Qualcomm. Last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/6tASUo7UqNw?si=d8LoV-9bkP2JQ0V0&amp;t=2330">a video from YouTuber Moore’s Law is Dead</a> showed off what appears to be a leaked image of Nvidia’s rumored APU, with sources suggesting it could run between 80W and 120W. </p><p>In January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an investor’s presentation that the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338939/nvidia-jensen-huang-hints-arm-desktop-cpu">has “plans” for the Arm-based CPU</a> installed inside Digits, its personal AI supercomputer, <em>Reuters</em> reported at the time. Dell CEO Michael Dell also hinted at the possibility of launching an AI PC with Nvidia, as he replied, “come back next year” when asked about Nvidia’s presence in the AI PC market <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/dell-and-nvidia-ceos-hint-nvidia-ai-pc-chip-may-arrive-next-year">during an interview in 2024</a>.</p><p>Nvidia isn’t the only company that could challenge Qualcomm’s dominance in the Arm-based CPU space. MediaTek is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mediatek-designs-arm-based-chip-microsofts-ai-laptops-say-sources-2024-06-11/">also rumored to be working on an Arm chip</a> of its own, while recent reports also <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-is-allegedly-working-on-arm-based-sound-wave-apus-for-microsofts-surface-laptops-next-year">suggest AMD is developing</a> an Arm-based chip for Microsoft Surface laptops.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p>Considering the Switch 2 is a long-term investment for players, they should take that advice to heart. There are also a lot of Switch 2 accessories, including screen protectors that can reduce the likelihood of damage from drops or scratches better than the protective film Nintendo already uses. But players will have to decide how much they're willing to spend to do so.</p><p>Preorders for Switch 2 sold out almost immediately, and it's unclear <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">how quickly Nintendo will have restocks</a> during its launch week. Nintendo has been gearing up by adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-mobile-app-updated-with-gamechat-and-other-switch-2-features/1100-6531907/" data-ref-id="1100-6531907">some of the new Switch 2 features to the Switch mobile app</a> ahead of the console's release.</p><p>Nintendo has lined up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/">20 Switch 2 games at launch</a>, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart World</a>, which will be available in a console bundle as well. There are also updated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">Nintendo Switch 2 editions</a> of both The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild and Tears Of The Kingdom, which will be available when Switch 2 launches on June 4.</p>

While the studio claimed it was working on an action adventure game, we didn't have any more details until today, when Wizards of the Coast announced its partnership with the developer on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game via a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">The statement includes a quote from John Hight, who is currently the president of Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming, but worked with Asmussen on the God of War series in the late '00s. "I’m so happy to be reuniting with him on this new project,” Hight says of Asmussen. “In our time working together on God of War I got to see firsthand Stig’s artistry and expertise, and he and the Giant Skull team are the perfect fit for our new game."</p>

<p>Giant Skull Founder Stig Asmussen</p>

</article>
<p dir="ltr">Details on the game itself are scant, but it's confirmed to be a single-player action-adventure title in development for PC and console. Given Asmussen's experience with the Star Wars: Jedi and God of War series, it seems firmly in his comfort zone. While it's just speculation, we would not be surprised to see a game starring D&amp;D legend Drizzt Do'Urden and his twin scimitars a la Cal Kestis or Kratos. Regardless, it seems likely that this will be Asmussen's second game series involving force damage.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are other D&amp;D games in production, Wizards of the Coast is likely seeking a new long-term partnership after it and Larian parted ways following the success of Baldur's Gate 3. While there's no telling how the development cycle will shake out, we were huge fans of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-turbulent-thrill-ride">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and even bigger fans of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor/capturing-the-fantasy">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/12/19/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2023#:~:text=6-,Star%20Wars%20Jedi%3A%20Survivor,-In%20many%20ways">one of our favorite games of 2023</a>, so this seems like a promising collaboration.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A decade on from its Tamriel Unlimited relaunch and with fistfuls of major expansions and new stories already told, The Elder Scrolls Online is doing something it’s never done before. The Seasons of the Worm Cult launches today for PC and in a couple weeks for consoles on 18th June, and for the first time ever, the timeline of this game is moving forwards. Not only that, but it’s a direct continuation of the story told in the original game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Elder Scrolls Online - Return of the Worm Cult" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OOfYaCdkGTE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That pesky Worm Cult from the game’s original main questline has returned, taking players off to the cult’s new base on the tropical island of Solstice. What they’ll find here is a new region with its own history, and a truly remarkable, inescapable monument to the Worm Cult’s power. Solstice isn’t some untouched paradise, but has instead been split in two by the Writhing Wall, a huge arcane barrier that blocks out half the sky, living up to its name as a shimmering pattern wriggles around, almost always in view wherever you are on the island.</p>


<p>But there’s plenty more that’s new and distinctive about this land. The island was originally inhabited by ancient Argonians, who will appear rather different to the ones found on the mainland of Tamriel, and who split into two tribes, the Tide-Born and the Stone-Nest. But their heritage has been buried under the city of Sunport, as the Corelanyan High Elves, who were banished from the mainland in ancient times, came to Solstice and thought “Hey, you know what? Let’s do some more evil stuff,” waging war on the Argonians, ransacking Sunport and stamping their own architecture on top of everything. A tentative peace did eventually emerge after all-out war… but that was shattered by the arrival of the Worm Cult.</p>


<p>And so that’s where you come in, arriving alongside the Stirk Fellowship and all manner of returning names and faces from the earlier years of this game, time rolling forward to tell a new story that’s specifically set after prior events. This is a pretty significant change to the philosophy of how Zenimax Online Studios has gone about building each expansion and story up until now. They’ve always held that every story should be standalone, that each questline can be played in any order, and that events take place concurrently while building up to the final encounters. But now, with the timeline stepping forward, this new tale can have characters directly reference prior actions, characters can return and already know you, and there’s a more linear structure to the new tale.</p>
<p>From this, Seasons of the Worm Cult Part I is based within Western Solstice, and will build up to a server-wide event that will breach that Writhing Wall, opening up the Eastern side of the island to adventure in later this year.</p>

<p>Importantly, this doesn’t affect how you need to play the game. New players, or old hands with new characters can still venture to Western Solstice, but they’ll also be able to go all the way back to the original story afterwards. The timeline will be jumbled, if you do that, but I think we can all get our heads around consuming stories out of order.</p>
<p>Those older hands will certainly appreciate some of the changes that are coming to this game, both in the expansion and with Update 46. There’s new and refreshed quest mechanics –&nbsp;for example, encountering a broken bridge will have you collect rubble with a magic wand to reconstruct it, or you could have to control magical armour remotely to navigate a trap-filled room –&nbsp;and there’s new enemies as well. Argonian-made golems have reawakened to guard certain parts of the island, though their true purpose is unknown, and there’s a new Vahath Behemoth, a wholly new enemy from character artist Bobby Foster, which came from an internal game jam and has now been fleshed out with abilities and attacks to make for a fun world boss.</p>
<p>The impactful change for all players, though, is the new Subclassing system. Free as a new base game feature, this is available for anyone that has levelled any character to level 50, enabling the feature account-wide.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Elder Scrolls Online – Introducing Subclassing" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_VUphPv0Y6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Subclassing breaks up the established structure where each class consisted of three set skill lines and fixed playstyles. Now, once a character has taken on the sub-classing quest, you’ll be able to mix and max skill lines, creating a huge number of new possibilities and combinations to try out, blending together the 21 skill lines from the 7 character classes currently in the game.</p>
<p>There are some limits, though. You will always need to have at least one skill line from your original character, and you can’t have two skill lines from another class, though you could have one skill line each from three different classes. You do still always have three skill lines active, but skills in non-native skill lines will also cost more, making them more taxing to level up and fill out.</p>
<p>Oh, and you will have had to buy any of the DLC character classes in order to use their skill lines.</p>

<p>Seasons of the Worm Cult promises a bold new era for The Elder Scrolls Online, advancing the MMO’s story in a way that could lead to many more significant changes in the years ahead. And with the new sub-classing feature, there’s a fresh shot in the arm for speccing out your characters and trying new things as you explore this new and unfamiliar land.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-surprisingly-adds-private-servers-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom announced that Dune Awakening will feature private servers at launch. Previously, the Norwegian developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-roundtable-qa-privately-hosted-servers-are-under-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the feature could be added in the future. However, they've made it work in advance of their own plans.</p>
<p>This was a highly requested feature, so fans will be pleased. However, it's worth noting that there will still be more limitations compared to the private servers available in Funcom's own survival game Conan Exiles. This is due to the MMO-like nature of Dune Awakening.</p>
<p>Here's how everything will work, in the developer's own words:</p>
<p><em>When you rent a private server, you essentially rent a server containing one Hagga Basin, just like the official servers. Here you have the full Hagga Basin map, and you can do everything you would do on an official server. Your private server will belong to a World consisting of other private servers, and you can choose a World for your private server when you rent yours from a provider.</em></p>
<p><em>That means that you will still be able to take full advantage of Dune: Awakening’s large-scale multiplayer content and mechanics, including visiting the social hubs and the Deep Desert, to meet and play with people from any private server in the same World. Players do not rent or control social hubs nor the Deep Desert. These are provided by the server hosting company, who ensures each private server’s World has them.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DA_PrivateServers-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>For now, these are the settings available to those who rent private servers in Dune Awakening:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Zones:</strong> Players can make all parts of Hagga Basin PvP enabled or choose to have pockets of PvP like on official servers</li>
<li><strong>Taxation:</strong> Players can disable taxation on their server</li>
<li><strong>Sandstorms:</strong> Players can disable the ever-shifting sandstorms</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, three server provides are available for interested players:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.g-portal.com%2Fdune-awakening">Gportal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fserver.nitrado.net%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fgameserver">Nitrado</a></li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fxrealm.com%2Fen%2Fgameserver%2Fdune-awakening-server-hosting">xREALM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, Dune Awakening launches on June 10 on PC, although early access begins on June 5 for those who purchase the Deluxe or Ultimate editions.</p>

			<p>The popular fantasy MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online gets a major update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a>, today on PC and Mac (consoles will have to wait until June 18), and we've got all its details from a press presentation and roundtable Q&amp;A with Zone Lead Jason Barnes and Systems Designer Carrie Day.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving away from the expansion-like Chapters</a>, the team is starting its new journey with Seasons of the Worm Cult, which will introduce a new playable zone, Solstice. Located off the southern coast of Tamriel, Solstice is a remote and largely undiscovered island, which ZeniMax Online thought was the perfect backdrop for the return of the Worm Cult, the fan-favorite group of necromancers whom players previously fought and defeated in the original main quest of the game. The design of Solstice features a Mediterranean tropical aesthetic that sets it apart from previous zones seen in The Elder Scrolls Online. A central feature of the island is the ominous Writhing Wall. This ever-present structure looms over the island and will play a crucial role in the overarching storyline, with players tasked to uncover its mysteries and ultimately band together to topple it later in the year in a big event.</p>
<p>Sunport is Solstice's capital and central hub. The city looks unique thanks to its architecture, which combines influences from various cultures, mainly Argonians and High Elves (Altmer). The narrative moves through the historical conflicts that emerged when the Altmer House Coralia, exiled from the mainland, invaded the island, leading to a significant war with the Argonians. After a fragile peace was established, the current threat comes from the Worm Cult, which has taken over the island's eastern half and constructed a barrier made of souls. A coalition of heroes called The Stirk Fellowship has arrived to face them, featuring familiar characters from previous questlines in The Elder Scrolls Online, like the Redguard Prince Azah. The players will join them.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Players can hop into Seasons of the Worm Cult at any level. We've made the story and everything there in a way that will make sense still. If that's the first thing you do, you can still play the main storyline and all that, you'll just have your own unique path for it.'</figcaption></figure>
<p>Western Solstice is the half of the island that players will explore right away, starting from today. The area is highlighted by features such as giant seashells and ancient fossils, but there are also haunted manors and Nordic enclaves. The developers have also added new gameplay mechanics like building bridges and controlling magical suits of armor. Additionally, a carnival offers quirky games that challenge players and reveal deeper secrets within the game.</p>
<p>Players will encounter ancient golems infused with Argonian magic and a new creature, the Argonian Behemoth, which character artist Bobby Foster originally created during an internal game jam. Crucially, Seasons of the Worm Cult is the first time the timeline moves forward narratively. This chronological advancement means that the story has evolved beyond the defeat of Molag Bal, but it will not restrict new players from enjoying the game's content in any order they choose.</p>
<p>Seasons of the Worm Cult will also expand the game with new World Bosses, Delves, a Public Dungeon, and a brand-new Trial, the Ossein Cage. There are 16 Antiquities (including three new Mythic items), four new Trial item sets (including Perfected versions), and a host of other rewards, including even more item sets, and new Collectibles like crafting motifs and pets.</p>
<p>However, arguably the most exciting update for existing The Elder Scrolls Online players is coming for free with Update 46. It's Subclassing, which will allow players to add skill lines from other classes, greatly enhancing the build variety available in the game. It's important to note that you'll always have to keep at least one skill line belonging to your original class. Additionally, you can only grab one skill line from each class; that means it's not allowed to, for instance, add two Dragon Knight skill lines to a Templar base class.</p>
<p>Once you hit level 50, you have to do the subclass quest, which can be found in the Crown Store under Quest Starters, and it's completely free. Of course, to access the classes that were not available at launch (Warden, Necromancer, and Arcanist), you will first need to purchase the related DLC. The other minor caveat is that unlocking skills from other classes will cost two skill points instead of one. Also, ZeniMax Online has added a new Champion star called Discipline Artisan that increases the experience gain with skill lines. Needless to say, this will be very handy with subclassing.</p>
<p>After the presentation, Jason and Carrie answered several questions from the assembled press and content creators.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'You do need to have a level 50 character once on your account for subclassing. That is an account-wide restriction, but once that occurs, you can then subclass at any level. You will need to go to a Wayshrine of those three zones to get to the NPC. It won't just spit you out there. But you could create a character and immediately beeline there and start subclassing to level your account in a whole new way.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What makes Solstice stand out in comparison to the other parts of Tamriel that are already in the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> <strong>Barnes:</strong> I think there's always unique things every time we come out with a new release of content. Aesthetically, it looks different. Monster-wise, I think there are many new things we're doing there, new types of creatures we've explored. Content-wise, we are exploring some new themes.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things about Solstice and its release that I didn't actually touch on is that the Seasons of the Worm Cult is going to play out a little bit differently. In the past, when we've done Year of style of gameplay - I'll use Elsweyr as an example, because I worked on Southern Elsweyr - it was two distinct stories that played out simultaneously. You could complete them in any order and then there was a capper quest that brought the two together, but there wasn't a distinct order to it.</p>
<p>With Solstice and how we're doing the storytelling this year in The Elder Scrolls Online, one of the unique things is that it all happens in order. You have to do the story in order. You can't just jump in and start doing the main quests in another area.</p>
<p>It all kind of chains together, which is really cool because it means the island itself is progressing as the year goes on, and things are opening up and changing. It's a kind of living environment in a lot of ways, and we've never done that before. As the year progresses and each stage kind of hits more, things are going to open up, more stuff is going to start to happen on the island, until eventually at the end of the year, it's craziness all over, and things are happening. So it's really kind of an evolving zone, and that's something that we've never done before.</p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH - How does <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-hands-on-with-scribing-plus-qa-with-rich-lambert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scribing</a> interact with Subclassing?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carrie Day:</strong> That's a really good question. Overall, Scribing will function the way it already has. So, if you have a class mastery ability, it will only function with the class that you created for character creation. That is part of that core functionality. So, class item sets included with that are also going to be tied to that class. So you cannot use class mastery for skill lines you've subclassed into.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a certain level that players need to be for Seasons of the Worm Cult content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jason Barnes:</strong> Nope. They can hop in at any level. We've made the story and everything there in a way that will make sense still.</p>
<p>If that's the first thing you do, you can still play the main storyline and all that, you'll just have your own unique path for it. One thing I will mention is there's not going to be a tutorial that spits you out to this island. You'll actually start in the base game's island through the new revamped tutorial. If you want to choose to come to Solstice, you can do that right away at level one. You just hop on a boat or grab the Wayshrine and hop over. But yeah, it scales just like all of our other zones in The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p><strong>Is that the same for subclassing in terms of levels?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carrie Day:</strong> You do need to have a level 50 character once on your account. That is an account-wide restriction, but once that occurs, you can then subclass at any level. You will need to go to a Wayshrine of those three zones to get to the NPC. It won't just spit you out there. But you could create a character and immediately beeline there and start subclassing to level your account in a whole new way.</p>
<p>Players who may not be as aware of the system do get a notification when hitting level 50 that subclassing is available, because it's a whole new world. You experience it from one to 50, and then once you hit 50, the Champion system opens and all these other features. We want to make you aware that you can continue to grow with subclassing, too.</p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH - Were there any further discussions on potentially adding a higher difficulty level for story and/or open world content for those who'd like more of a challenge?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jason Barnes:</strong> I will say that there are ongoing plans for that and it's in the works. We're not ready to talk about it yet, but we've acknowledged openly that it is something we're looking at, and there's people working on it. I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit more about the role of Writhing Wall?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> <strong>Barnes:</strong> It's the center of the Seasons of the Worm Cult. Everything really revolves around the Writhing Wall. Again, we can't get into too many details just because a lot of that's going to be revealed as we go into the Writhing Wall event that happens later on.</p>
<p>But, in broad terms for Seasons of the Worm Cult part one, it exists everywhere. You can't go past it. There's story references to it throughout, and you'll learn more. I've seen this question come up in other places - what happens if I come to the island after the event takes place? Will the story still make sense if the wall is in a different state? Yes, we've planned for that. It'll all make sense if you come in a year or two later to play through this content. We've made sure to think through those possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>With the event happening later in the year, can you tell us whether players who don't have the content pass will be able to participate, potentially, in other places outside of Solstice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jason Barnes:</strong> Yeah, and we'll reveal more details on that. But there will be activities going on in the general world in addition to what's going on in Solstice. That's about as much as we can say right now. But there's, there's definitely gonna be stuff for people to do.</p>
<p><strong>Do you need to re-level up the skill lines when you subclass into them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carrie</strong> <strong>Day:</strong> That is actually a really good question. You do actually have to re-level skill lines when you subclass into them. Because subclassing is an account-wide shared progress, your levels are shared, but not when you start day one of this content update. If you have previously hit rank 50 of a skill line, you have a collectible unlocked on your account that says, I already have mastered this and you can use that skill line completely freely to engage with subclass into for build management.</p>
<p>For players who have no existing experience already, they can only learn and engage in subclassing in up to three additional skill lines at a time to mix and match with. But everyone, regardless of whether or not you're brand new versus someone who is an experienced player, will start those subclass skill lines on rank one. They are leveling faster than your original one to 50 experience because you get increased experience as a max-level character in The Elder Scrolls Online. And we also have introduced a Champion star to assist in that process. So it will be an investment, but it will be an easier investment than you had previously.</p>
<p><strong>With the story progressing and the main quest in the past in reference to the Solstice events, which year are we now in the Second Era?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> <strong>Barnes:</strong> All we're saying is that it has advanced. We're not specifically saying that stuff yet, but nice try. I know a lot of people are trying to figure that out.</p>
<p><strong>For the base game, we had the Planemeld Anchors to break as a sort of zone-wide event to showcase the Worm Cult storyline. Is there a similar event in Western Solstice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> <strong>Barnes:</strong> Stay tuned. That's all I can say. You will see as the year progresses and things start happening. I will leave it at that. I don't want to give spoilers, but we're thinking about it. I'll keep that there.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Mannimarco is gone. It's Wormblood time. If anyone hasn't read the meet the character that we released for Wormblood, go and check it out. It has some ties to Mannimarco, but Wormblood is the new, mysterious entity that we will be facing off against. You'll learn more once you play through.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How much longer do we have to wait before we can punch Mannimarco for the 9000000th time?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> <strong>Barnes:</strong> Mannimarco is gone. It's Wormblood time. If anyone hasn't read the meet the character that we <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> for Wormblood, go and check it out. It has some ties to Mannimarco, but Wormblood is the new, mysterious entity that we will be facing off against. You'll learn more once you play through.</p>
<p><strong>What are your personal expectations for Seasons of the Worm Cult, and what do you hope that players enjoy most about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carrie</strong> <strong>Day:</strong> The story is something I'm really excited about. I was not someone who wrote the story when it released 10 years ago, but I was someone who experienced it on day one as a player, and to see that story come back is really, really special for me personally. But my personal expectation for this whole season is that we're in an incredible new stage of transition and evolution with the game. Subclassing is giving a new way to engage in the game that we've never done before. I expect people to be completely unique and do some really crazy things. I'm really excited to see it. I'm excited that people are going to come back to The Elder Scrolls Online excited about the return of the story as well as these new systems. And we've also done a ton of new things like a welcome back player feature that is coming next week. I expect it's gonna feel like a whole new thing, like One Tamriel all over again.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> <strong>Barnes:</strong> From my end, I'm super excited about the big event. It's unlike anything we've really done before. We'll talk more about that as it gets closer. That's going to be really cool. And then I'm just really excited about the overall story and where we're going with it. There's lots of twists and turns. It's a lot darker themed in a lot of ways, similar to the base game. It feels like a continuation of what we did back then. Also, just the amount of depth the team has gone through to pay off some of the stories and lingering questions and advancing storylines for various characters and being able to reference back to the things that the players have done. There's been an extreme amount of time really focused on that and making sure that pays off, especially as we continue into the latter half of the year. I'm super hyped about that. There's tons of stuff constantly being worked on, things that we haven't even talked about that are really exciting that are coming to the game.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> might have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">launched buggier</a> than a holiday at a nature reserve dedicated to cockroaches and coders, but since that point Team FOLON’s put a lot of effort into making sure people can enjoy the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-review">pretty damn good game</a> it’s created. While you’ll have to wait a bit longer for some Londony DLC, you can now play some of the mod in VR.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/747?tab=description">Fallout: London VR mod</a> is available to grab right now in beta form via Nexus Mods, having been developed by a team led by modder Asciimov. So, it hasn’t come from Team FOLON directly. That said, Fallout: London project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter has shouted it out via an announcement on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1377617569514782831">Team FOLON’s Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>“Please note that this is a community-made and unofficial mod by Asciimov's  ‘Fallout: London VR’ modding team,” Carter wrote, “Team FOLON does not provide any support for this.</p>
<p>“This mod and its conversation system are still in beta, as only around 10% of the quests (one main storyline) have currently been tested, but at the moment all known game breaking bugs have been fixed.” So, you can at least get started with your virtual reality trip to the city of baked beans, bowler hats, and blokes who sound like Michael Caine.</p>
<p>Carter also headed any questions folks might have about the Fallout: London DLC that Team FOLON’s <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">working on</a> off at the pass, adding: “If you are expecting us to announce the DLCs, they are still in the works and coming soon.” Cool.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the Fallout: London VR mod a go, the list of requirements is on its Nexus Mods page. You’ll need <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> with all DLC, Mod Organiser 2, Fallout 4 Script Extender VR version 0.6.21, and - unsurprisingly - Fallout: London. The Fallout: London VR team also has its own <a href="https://discord.gg/7xCQMU8CJ2">Discord server</a> you can head to for help troubleshooting issues that don’t have potential fixes outlined already.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But while many players have spent the opening weekend of the game’s release bleeding out on cosmic shores, some have been making the game look trivially easy. </p><p>YouTuber Youwy decided to take on Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow solo and—most importantly—without gaining a single level (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/someones-already-completed-a-solo-elden-ring-nightreign-run-at-level-1-and-as-is-tradition-the-power-of-status-effects-pulled-through/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/someones-already-completed-a-solo-elden-ring-nightreign-run-at-level-1-and-as-is-tradition-the-power-of-status-effects-pulled-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>). He played Executor, the dexterity-based Nightfarer who can parry attacks. The fights revolve around jumping, dodging, and managing stamina consumption like a farmer in a drought. Even more crucial was a starting build that included the Night of Miasma and Night of the Wise relics, giving a base weapon with tons of starting status ailments that can just be upgraded through the run. “I sometimes can’t beat the 1st night and bro is out here doing this solo and level 1...WP,” one fan wrote in the comments.</p><p>Then there was YouTuber Ongbal, who used the Executor class to take out the <em>Nightreign</em>’s final boss without any outside help (so spoilers, obviously, if you don’t want to know anything before playing it for yourself). Ongbal is well-known for <em>Elden Ring </em>hitless runs, but he hasn’t gotten there just yet with Heolstor, a boss you can really tell FromSoftware had fun designing. Once again making use of Executor’s parry, which lets players treat <em>Nightreign </em>more like <em>Sekiro</em>, he takes the final boss down in less than six minutes. And this was before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-102-solo-changes-runes-ps5-1851783188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-102-solo-changes-runes-ps5-1851783188">a new patch making solo play easier</a></span> went live on Monday (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l1ejiu/playing_solo_mode_on_the_new_patch_rn_and_wow/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l1ejiu/playing_solo_mode_on_the_new_patch_rn_and_wow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which is already making a big difference for some players</a></span>). </p><p>One thing that makes N<em>ightreig</em>n’s boss fights so tough is the work players have to do to get to them. Unlike past games, where you can beeline for the encounter and practice over and over until you’ve mastered it, <em>Nightreign</em> requires players to engage in a 40-minute open-world farming session beforehand. As a result, most players probably only spend about a ninth of their playtime actually learning how each Nightlord works. Some have already called for a practice mode to make training easier. That’s one request I don’t see FromSoftware’s granting anytime soon though. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The battle guitar is described as a melee weapon, so there's no indication yet that players will be able to jam some tasty--and electrifying--licks with it, if they need to take on enemies like Mules or BTs. Is a battle guitar a better option than grenades filled with various bodily fluids when taking on stranded souls? Possibly.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Official Release Date Reveal And Pre-Order Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Beyond that, it looks like players can also expect to play around with machine guns and sniper rifles in Death Stranding 2. Weapons were plentiful in the first Death Stranding, but players had to think carefully about what they wanted to bring along with them, as using conventional firearms on human enemies carried a major risk.</p><p>Allowing a corpse to necrotize could create a voidout in the game--a massive explosion that could result in the landscape becoming inaccessible. Fortunately, non-lethal weapon options were available--like the Maser Gun that was added in Death Stranding: Director's Cut--and there were also anti-BT weapons available.</p><p>Ahead of its release on June 26, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-game-premiere-set-for-june-8/1100-6531942/">a special premiere event for Death Stranding 2</a> will be held at the Orpheum Theatre on June 8. Hosted by Geoff Keighley and featuring Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima in attendance, there'll be an "exclusive" live demonstration of the game. This showcase will also be livestreamed and several other Death Stranding 2 events will be held worldwide in major cities.</p>

Additionally, the number of runes players can gain in solo play has been increased to make the experience smoother for people playing alone.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">glowing review of Nightreign</a> acknowledged that "it never feels like it was designed to accommodate a single player." The game supports three-player co-op or solo play, but not duos. Two-player co-op was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-doesnt-elden-ring-nightreign-have-two-player-co-op-the-reason-may-surprise-you/1100-6531760/" data-ref-id="1100-6531760">overlooked in development</a>, but could come to the game later.</p><p>The new Nightreign patch also makes general balance adjustments, including increasing the number of rare relics. In terms of bug fixes, the update fixes a bug where certain weapon types had higher damage than intended and an issue for camera behavior working improperly. The patch also fixes a bug that could cause the HUD to fail to display, along with a bug where background music would not play.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p>If you're just

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/02/new-elden-ring-nightreign-patch-makes-solo-play-easier-alongside-balance-changes-and-bug<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer From Software has released a new <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> patch that should make playing the game single-player easier, alongside some balance changes that will make the game better for everyone. Plus, the patch features a large list of bug fixes, too.</p><p>Nightreign launched last week, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/30/elden-ring-nightreign-hits-2-million-players-in-just-one-day">bringing in an impressive 2 million players in less than 24 hours</a>. It didn’t take long for players to realize embarking on solo expeditions is incredibly difficult, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency">something I noted in my Nightreign review</a>. Publisher Bandai Namco announced last week that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/30/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-coming-next-week-to-make-solo-expeditions-easier">an upcoming patch would address that</a>, and now that <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011">patch</a> is live.</p><p height="360" width="640"

allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For solo players, the patch adds the “Automatic Revival Upon Defeat” effect, which allows revival once per night boss battle, to the game and increases the amount of runes gained.</p><p>General balance adjustments that all players will feel are an increase in the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward when reaching Day 3 of any expedition, and an increase in the probability of obtaining high-rarity Relics from Scenic Flat stones purchased at the Small Jar Bazaar in the Roundtable Hold.</p><p>Elsewhere in the patch, From Software has fixed a large number of bugs, which you can view below:</p><ul><li>Adjusted camera behavior when activating the Guardian's Ultimate Art, “Wings of Salvation.”</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Duchess's Character Skill “Restage” where Status Ailments would not trigger when built up from other players' attacks.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some attacks of Raider with Greataxe and Great Hammer weapon types had higher damage than intended.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some “Those Who Live in Death “ enemies would revive when &nbsp;defeated with the “Sacred Blade” skill.</li><li>Fixed a bug

            <p>A new trailer for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> has been released, showing off 20 mini games and 14 tech demos that'll be playable to those who pick the game up alongside their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Games shown include a timed survival game in which you pilot a little space ship and dodge spiked balls, a match-the-tile memory game, a first-person balloon popping game, as well as a driving game that allows you to lean on two tires by tilting the Joycon controller.</p>
<p>As for tech demos, we see a side-by-side comparison between 20fps and 120fps as a football soars across the screen, alongside a model viewer that allows you to quickly swap between different resolutions to see the shift in visual quality firsthand.</p>

<p>Plus, a macarena shaker demo was briefly shown, which looks to let players feel how the motors inside each Joycon feel with different settings. We don't get to see everything in store of course, but we can assume each demo will be dedicated to a specific use case for the fancy new features.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, there's also an in-game quiz that seems to test you on all the new hardware and software features on the console. Who doesn't love homework with their new video game console?</p>
<p>All in all it looks to be a fairly comprehensive overview of the console, giving eager beavers with a shiny new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> a way to familiarise themselves with its new gizmos without having to pour through a big instructions manual.</p>
<p>However, many still wonder why this game is being sold as its own release, rather than it being included alongside the Switch 2 for free like we saw with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astros-playroom">Astro's Playroom</a> on the PS5. The former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">Reggie Fils-Aime referenced the Welcome Tour being sold for $10</a> by speaking about the past, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> was released for free alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/wii">Nintendo Wii</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo itself has defended selling the game rather than bundling it in with the console, stating that the game is being sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-charging-for-switch-2s-tutorial-game-because-of-the-amount-of-care-and-work-put-into-it">due to the "amount of care and work" put into it</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be released on June 5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">alongside the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It will cost £7.99 here in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
