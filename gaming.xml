            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Flood plain, fire risk, black mold, and it's going to fall into the ocean."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has partnered with real estate website Zillow to create Zillow for Warcraft, a goofy Zillow-like website intended to promote the game's new player housing feature with humor, information, and a free in-game item.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The website, accessible at <a href="https://zillowforwarcraft.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zillowforwarcraft.com</a> or <a href="https://zillow.com/warcraft" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zillow.com/warcraft</a>, is, to be clear, a goof. At the moment, it doesn't seem to be showing off actual houses built by real players. It instead has a curated selection of both Horde and Alliance homes that seem to be intended more to offer inspiration to players working on their own homes than anything. Besides, it's not like you can actually buy someone else's fully built and decorated house in the game, anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The website is cute, though. It's got a handful of different housing options on different plots in both the Horde and Alliance neighborhoods to skim through, with humorous descriptions of decor decisions and, frankly, some pretty good ideas that I hadn't really thought of for my own rustic shack. You're guided through the website by Bek'tar Donhammar and Hazyl Fizzlehorn, two fictional Azerothian real estate agents who each have their own profiles with "reviews" from satisfied customers, all rife with in-jokes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main reason you might care to visit the website, though, is to get the free item. If you link your battle.net account, you can get a free "Naturally Elegant Doormat" which will show up in the in-game mail after the fact and become available for use in decorating your house. It's not a bad doormat! Worth the, like, four clicks it takes to get it. Once you have one, you can also buy more copies of it from Tuuran and Gabbi near the Trading Posts in Stormwind and Orgrimmar, in case you want a house just full of mats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps even more delightful than just clicking around on the website though are some of the player reactions to the feature. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/zillow_teams_with_world_of_warcraft_for_player/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a> about the announcement, a number of individuals have popped in to offer pleasant snark about the crossover, generally mixed in with commentary about how expensive real-life houses are nowadays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"last sold in ‘88 for 49,000, now going for 449,000, cool cool cool," reads the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5uwst8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top comment by u/Helios420A</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hasn’t had work done since Blackhand was Warchief," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5wmdnm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes u/Thesleek</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Does this mean blackrock will somehow get involved next?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5ux553/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked u/notmyworkaccount5</a>, making a very well-placed pun on BlackRock Inc, the investment company, and Blackrock, the World of Warcraft orc clan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that I have my doormat, I will proceed to log in and rearrange my living room for the umpteenth time, wasting several hours before finally admitting I will never make anything as magical as the <a href="https://zillowforwarcraft.com/#/homedetails/alliance-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ban'ethil Bohemian</a>, and go back to adding spikes to my roof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Highguard, the free-to-play PvP "raid shooter" announced at The Game Awards last year and released to preemptive criticism and mockery only for most of its developers to be laid off just weeks after launch, was apparently financially backed by Tencent, according to a report.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File, which reports</a> that the Chinese gaming mogul was the primary financial backer behind developer Wildlight Entertainment, an arrangement that was not publicly shared by either company. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to this report, it was unclear who was funding Wildlight, despite Highguard seemingly being in development for a number of years prior to its announcement at The Game Awards in December. Its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wildlight-entertainment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official LinkedIn page</a> has long included the line that Wildlight is "a new, fully-funded entertainment studio."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That grand announcement, its time and place <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/17/highguard-did-not-pay-for-its-infamous-game-awards-finale-slot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instigated by The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley</a> rather than the studio, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-we-stop-dunking-on-highguard-before-its-even-out-please">sparked weeks of mockery online</a>, with a number of content creators declaring the game dead before it had even released. Upon launch, Highguard <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-launches-to-big-steam-concurrents-but-its-getting-absolutely-destroyed-in-user-reviews">netted nearly 100k Steam concurrents,</a> but critic reviews <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-review">(including ours)</a> were just so-so and user scores were low. Just a few weeks later, developers from Wildlight revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-studio-wildlight-hit-with-layoffs">most of them had been laid off</a>. Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-highguard-developer-reflects-on-disastrous-announcement-and-launch-we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-1">one developer who worked on the game</a> has reflected that Highguard was "turned into a joke from minute one" due to false assumptions made from the TGA trailer, and a number of other high-profile developers have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/when-did-it-become-trendy-to-hate-on-a-new-game-as-highguard-struggles-to-win-over-the-internet-video-game-developers-come-to-its-defense">come to its defense</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains unclear how heavily reliant Wildlight was on Tencent, or whether a decision to pull funding was made at some point that led to the mass layoffs. Wildlight's future as a studio also remains unclear, with a studio statement saying that it would retain a "core group of developers" to keep Highguard going. However, the game's <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website went offline</a> earlier today and has yet to be restored, leading some to speculate that the game or even the studio is about to fully shut down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is in a bit of a Schrödinger's cat situation. That's because at the time of writing, the <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">official site</a> only shows the shooter's logo, and text that reads "This site is currently unavailable. Please contact support@codethirtytwo.com for assistance," alongside links to its official Discord server and Dwitter page. This, of course, could just be a blip, but even as I'm writing this it's been the case for several hours, and there's not a single word from developer Wildlight about why it's down. So, it is both dead and not dead until someone opens the box.
</p>
<p>
This obviously isn't an immediate confirmation that the game is shutting down, but given that last week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">most of the team was apparently laid off</a>, there is certainly reason to question whether this is that famed writing on the wall you so often hear about. The silence from Wildlight in both the game's Discord server and social pages certainly adds to the writing.
</p>
<p>
Parallel to all of this, a report has emerged from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment">Game File</a> that sheds a tidbit of light on how Highguard came to be. Namely, that the game was predominantly funded by Tencent. It's been unknown up to this point just who funded the game, given Wildlight's proud proclamation of independence.
</p>
<p>
The framing of Wildlight as an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-devs-say-it-was-always-the-plan-to-go-dark-after-its-reveal-a-la-apex-legends-launch">indie studio</a> by founder Dusty Welch has been a sticking point for me since the moment I heard it, seeing as prior to the layoffs it was a 100+ person company. To hear a report that Wildlight were funded by a company as massive as Tencent doesn't offer me any sense of vindication, more frustration at the hubris at those at the top to think they can just repeat the success they previously had many years of changing industry trends later.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, here's hoping that those affected by the layoffs end up on their feet, and much the same to those who may or may not be out of work by the end of the week.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skyrim-switch-2-60fps-update-2000669806</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> on Switch 2</a> is looking and playing better after a new update added a much-requested 60FPS mode and plenty of fixes and tweaks to the game.</p> <p>In December 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156">Bethesda shadowdropped the 15-year-old open-world RPG <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. But unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557">the last time the company surprise released an <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game</a>, the reaction to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 wasn’t positive. Many players were upset over the game’s poor performance, visual glitches, bugs, and bloated install size. Well, Bethesda has fixed some of these problems with a new update out now on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld.</p>

 <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">Bethesda released update 1.2 for <em>Skyrim</em> on the Switch 2</a>. The big news is that this free patch added a 60FPS performance mode. Bethesda has also locked <em>Skyrim</em>‘s framerate to 30FPS when playing in “Prioritize Visuals” mode. Either choice should provide a smoother, more stable experience compared to what <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 played like previously.</p>

 <p>In the patch notes for the update shared online on February 17, Bethesda also dedicated two different sections to addressing fixes made to the game’s performance and visual bugs. This includes improved performance in certain areas, like the Talking Stone giant camp and during combat at Secunda’s Kiss. Issues with water not looking correct from a distance or while in a menu have been fixed, too.</p> <p>While it can be frustrating how often <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">Bethesda seemingly breaks their own classic RPGs with updates and ports</a>, I am happy that the studio seems committed to going back and fixing problems. And hey, if Bethesda doesn’t fix it, at least PC players can rely on talented modders to pick up the slack. Switch 2 and other console players are still at the mercy of Bethesda, though.</p> <hr> <p>Here are the full patch notes for the 1.2 <em>Skyrim</em> update on Switch 2:</p> <div dir="ltr"> <p><span

<h2>Reasons for worry</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thememorycore.com/gamehub-feb-11-2026/">a recent interview with The Memory Core newsletter</a>, GameSir admitted that its primary motivation for releasing a Windows emulation tool was to sell more of its controllers. But GameSir’s controllers aren’t required to use the Android version, which it says was sideloaded on 5 million (primarily Chinese) Android devices even before <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaoji.egggame">its official Google Play release in November</a>.</p>

<p>GameHub on Android has also faced controversy for including a number of invasive trackers (which are <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gamehub-lite-3608539/">removed in a community-built Lite version</a>). A GameSir representative told The Memory Core that this was just standard practice in the Chinese market, where there is less sensitivity to such user tracking, and that it has since been removed.</p>
<p>The representative also addressed concerns about reusing open source compatibility code in that interview, saying that its Windows emulator was “developed in-house by GameSir’s core engineering team” with its “own in-house compatibility layer (such as syscall hooks, GameScopeVK, and other technologies), rather than modifications to Wine’s core code.” That said, the representative admitted GameFusion “reference[s] and use UI components from Winlator [an <a href="https://winlator.org/">open source Windows emulation tool for Android</a>]… to maintain ecosystem compatibility and familiarity.”</p>
<p>The compatibility issues and controversial corporate entity involved here probably mean that GameHub for Mac won’t be the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">Valve SteamOS/Proton moment</a> that Apple gamers have been waiting for. Still, it’ll be nice for MacBook owners to have yet another option to play Windows games without needing to run a Windows install.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee and streaming giant Netflix have inked another streaming deal. The tabletop giant has signed global rights for official Ticket to Ride movie and TV shows to the streaming platform, bringing even more potential cinematic board game adaptations.</p><p>According to an official press release, this Ticket to Ride movie and TV deal secures exclusive global rights to adapt the board game series into scripted and unscripted projects across film, TV, and additional formats.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This deal is similar to another one struck by Asmodee and Netflix in October of 2025. That deal secured similar rights to another beloved Asmodee board game franchise, the resource-gathering social game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/netflix-catan-movie-and-tv-rights-secured-bringing-scavenging-and-diplomacy-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Catan</em></a>.</p><p>The press release confirms the first project under this deal will be an official <em>Ticket to Ride</em> movie. The film will be written by Ben Mekler (<em>Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts)</em> and Chris Amick (<em>Final Space</em>), and producers will include Asmodee's own Darren Kyman, Eric and Kim Tannenbaum, and Jonathan Levine and Gillian Bohrer.&nbsp;</p><p>This deal is another step in Netflix's more recent push for creating content out of recognizable board game IP. It aligns with deals to make streaming material out of the board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-tv-show-has-been-greenlit-by-netflix" rel="nofollow"><em>Clue</em></a> and <em>Catan</em>. It's also consistent with already produced tabletop game movies and shows such as <em>Exploding Kittens</em> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/family_pack_2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Family Pack</em></a>, an adaptation of T<em>he Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</em>.</p><p>The Ticket to Ride movie deal with Netflix does raise the question: how would you adapt it. <em>Ticket to Ride</em> is a game where players compete to collect and connect various train routes through major cities, scoring points for completing routes. It's essentially a top-down competitive management experience, which is difficult to express in film which tends to err on human scale struggles.</p><p>There's also the fact that the importance of train routes and railways is very cultural and historical. Do you make it a period piece about the rise of the rail? If so, which country do you center on? Is the tone wondrous, in keeping with the board game's kid friendliness, or a more cynical take? Those are the challenges the screenwriters will need to address one way or another.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/riftbound-origins-review-tcg-with-movement-strategy-im-in" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70845ca1-ba9b-48fd-ae51-be30d1b4ed06" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em> TCG</a> has now released its second set, expanding the number of Legends from <em>LoL</em> that you can let lead your deck alongside additional new mechanics. In our review of <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>, we'll take a look at some of the new mechanics and how they'll power a deck along with the new <em>Spiritforged </em>keywords and how they shift the battlefield.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>Equipment</h2><p dir="ltr">Equipment is a new type of gear card that has been added to <em>Spiritforged</em>. This Gear has a cost to be played, but then an additional cost to be equipped to your units.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment opens up a whole new level of augmentation in <em>Riftbound </em>letting you take fighters that might have not quite been viable, but give them a chance to have their Might boosted or alter other elements of the card.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment can give a Unit a few more Might to help them on the battlefield, additionally you can have equipment that will turn a Unit into a different type such as a mech. This kind of augmentation is extremely important for decks like the Rumble Champion Deck.</p><picture>

              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-equipment.jpg?itok=AQSwl3us 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I've gotten lost early on in a number of TCG because of how quickly new elements are added, and how quickly it invalidates any of the older cards. With equipment, not only are all cards getting an upgrade, but the changes that equipment can have on a card also open up a variety of possibilities where cards that wouldn't be viable before are now able to be played.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>New Keywords</h2><p dir="ltr">Five different Keywords have been added with <em>Spiritforged</em>. These expand the kinds of effects that cards will have as you play them, by keywording them they're faster to understand and respond to.</p><p dir="ltr">The first new Keyword is Echo, you'll see these appear on spell cards. The effect of Echo is that you can repeat the effect of a spell by paying an additional cost that's listed on the card. This is an easy way to let a spell have a standard level of effect in the early game, but as you build up more Runes, you're able to unleash more havoc with them as the game goes on.</p><p dir="ltr">In my few games playing with the effect, I loved the versatility of these cards and that by using them at different scales, you could do more or less with your turn. It wasn't a spell that was useful at the beginning of the game, but not impactful by the end of the game, and it also wasn't a card that felt useless in my hand if drawn too early.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-unique.jpg?itok=YVkI-bjN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-unique.jpg?itok=X_h51Fd4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The second new Keyword is an interesting one, Unique. This card effect means that you can only have a single copy of the card in your deck. This effectively moved what other TCG might call a Restricted list into the Keywording on the card itself. It has the dual effect of meaning a player won't need to know the ins and outs of a ban-list to know if they've built their deck legally, alternatively a card with Unique as a Keyword is certain to immediately catch a player's eye, as they might come up with a strategy to unleash this powerful card.</p><p dir="ltr">The final three new Keywords that were introduced in <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> have to do with the new Equipment type; Quick-Draw, Equip, and Weaponmaster.</p><p dir="ltr">Equip has you simply paying the listed cost to attach a piece of equipment to a Unit, Quick-Draw lets that equipment as a reaction, attaching it to a unit you control immediately. These are keywords that define how to activate and equip your equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">The Weaponmaster Keyword is one that you'll find on Units. This lets you summon a unit and then attach equipment to it immediately, whether it's in your base or attached to a different unit for one recycle less than the cost listed on the card.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-battlegrounds.jpg?itok=9krrPVpV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I am a big fan of the equipment mechanic, but also the different speeds you can implement for getting Equipment on the field, and in the hands of your Units. It was also incredibly helpful that, outside of playing and equipping these cards normally, you could either have it react faster with an ability of the equipment or an ability of a Unit. This gives a healthy level of flexibility when building your deck around equipment and how to best get it onto your field.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Has <em>Riftbound </em>Evolved?</h2><p dir="ltr">The aspect of Spiritforged that I think I'm most excited about is that elements have been added to the game, adding powerful but Unique cards and involving equipment to augment your current cards, but overall it hasn't invalidated the <em>Riftbound </em>cards from the initial set.</p><p dir="ltr">So often I watch new TCG sets release where a new set means everything prior is out sped or overpowered by new cards coming out.<em> Riftbound Spiritforged</em> feels like it has instead elevated the whole game, meaning you can take your old deck and make slight changes and bring it into competition with the latest cards instead of having to completely remix your approach to the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> is an evolution of the formula. There are more Legends, and more permutations on how you can approach building a deck with new mechanics, but nothing you previously had is left in the dust.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to continue to play your favorite deck and Legend, you can use this set to introduce Equipment to have them hit harder, or substitute cards in with new abilities without invalidating all of the cards you already own.</p><p dir="ltr">The flip side of this is that there really are so many different Legends with different abilities that if there wasn't a strategy that was previously speaking to you, there probably is now.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest issue I still have with pulling booster packs of Riftbound is how few Runes you receive, and how many Battlegrounds you get instead. Especially when trying to start your initial Rune collection it can be rough to see so few come out of packs.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Riftbound Spritforged was reviewed with cards provided by the publisher</strong></em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

Normally $49.99, you can currently buy the hardcover version for $41.08 (about $9 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metroid-Prime-1-3-Retrospective-Official/dp/1913330273?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMetroid-Prime-1-3-A-Visual-Retrospective-The-Official-Art-and-Making-of-Metroid-Prime-1-3-Hardcover-9781913330279%2F14437707119" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, which is one of the first discounts we’ve seen on the tabletop book.</p><p>Developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, Piggyback’s 210-page retrospective is an excellent homage to the last 20 years of <em>Metroid</em>. The book itself resembles a piece of art, stitched-bound in a canvas-like cloth hardcover, with a red embossed outline of the series’ iconic protagonist, Samus Aran. Inside, you’ll find a trove of concept drawings and sketches spanning the entire trilogy — as well as <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> — including detailed illustrations of environments, common enemies, and bosses. It even features concept art that never made it into the final games.</p><p>What really makes the book stand out are the behind-the-scenes stories, however. It touches on everything from Retro Studios’ burnout upon shipping <em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em> to insights surrounding Nintendo’s secretive development process. The margin notes from series producer Kensuke Tanabe are especially entertaining, as they reveal design debates from over two decades ago.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDMx"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sheena Vasani</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/821108/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective-art-book-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

No chance.</h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game"><u>Magic: The Gathering</u></a> is a great game, but there’s no denying that Commander has become its most popular format - and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/magic-the-gathering/Every_MTG_Commander_Precon_Deck_in_Order"><u>Wizards has released a mountain of preconstructed decks</u></a> for players who want to jump right in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-updated-2026"><u>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set</u></a> was originally announced, it felt like we’d be getting one Commander deck per Turtle, Heroes vs Villains, or some other combo, so I was particularly surprised when Wizards said it’d be cramming attitude and pizza as much as possible into a single, 100-card deck. Having seen just some of the cards included, though, I’m impressed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic’s New Turtle Power Precon Looks Awesome</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I should preface this ‘precon preview’ with an explanation that in our behind-closed-doors look at the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set, Wizards revealed around a dozen cards from the Turtle Power precon - but there are more reveals to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means we’ve not been able to see how the deck plays, but we do know that your Commander of choice can be any of the Turtles, two of them partnered up with the Partner ability, or all five with the Heroes in a Half Shell card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s nothing truly revolutionary about this modular approach (swapping Commander precons to use other Legendary Creatures within them as their leader is part of the fun of the format), but having five options for Turtles means that no one is left behind.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the likes of Splinter (who has the Partner mechanic, too), but also members of the TMNT’s rogues gallery like Baxter, Fly in the Ointment, Leatherhead, Iron Gator, and, of course, Shredder, Shadow Master.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also some fun nods to the gaming history of the awesome foursome. Electric Seaweed from the hard-as-nails NES game makes an appearance to strike fear into gamers of a certain age, while other cards reference the squad’s love of arcade machines, like High Score and, uh, Arcade Cabinet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will the deck play well? We’ll have to wait to find out, but in terms of cramming as much personality into a single precon as possible, I think Wizards of the Coast may have just nailed the assignment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set launches on March 6, with preorders already available for the Turtle Power precon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

"Huh." This, as admiringly as I can make this sound, was the first thought I thunked when I put down the demo for Titanium Court. Here is a game that is many things. The first thing it is is a play, in perhaps a literal sense, perhaps as a tool to immediately allow one to suspend their sense of disbelief at everything that is about to follow. We're watching a play, a narrative vehicle where anything can happen as long as what's on stage is convincing enough to make us believe it's happening. And truthfully, I'm still trying to wrap my head around what did happen.
</p>
<p>
Right, so, the genre descriptors, let's establish those. It is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, sure. Then it's also a match three game, which is where the wheels are forced to start turning. You find yourself at the center of the Titanium Court, a single tile on a field of many. There are mountains, forests, rivers, and other courts (evil, nasty courts filled with Them) who want to kill you. Not during the match three portion, however, during that section you match until you run out of moves, gathering up resources to then use to send out farmers to collect more resources, or soldiers to destroy Them and their courts, as a timer runs down until you either win or die trying.

These are the mechanics as they were presented to me, and they're all very neat and tidy. It's the thing that surrounds the mechanics, the surreal, almost Hylicsian quality to the story. By Hylicsian I mean that the world does not do you the kindness of explaining itself. There is a tutorialisation of the gameplay, sure, but the characters, including the likes of a very hungry cat and a man who can only answer questions you haven't asked, do not act as emitters of exposition. You must take what you are given, and figure out what to do with it.
</p><p>
There's very much an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alice-in-wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> quality to it all as well, a feeling of characters talking at you, putting you, or I suppose the nameless woman (an understudy in the play) in the role of queen, adding on all the expectations that comes with it. Undoutably it would be remiss of me to not frame it as at least somewhat Lynchian, though in a direction entirely of its own making. It is a game you can only describe as odd, or alluring, or maybe they're one in the same! Either way, I'm tickled pink by it, so I've thrown it on the ole wishlist, and you can do so too right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2364580/Titanium_Court/">here</a> (and check out its demo too!).

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/mtg-lorwyn-eclipsed-designers-talk-bringing-back-classic</link>
            <guid>1438762</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since last month's release of the latest <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, we've been busy blighting our goblins, turning our merfolk sideways, and spending <em>way</em> too much mana on Elementals. But I wanted to know what went into the design of the set, so I got the chance to chat with a few folks from the design team - read on for our interview about the creation of Lorwyn Eclipsed.</p><h2>Flavor First?</h2><p>I've heard the design team talk a lot in the past about designing cards that are either "flavor first" or "mechanics first," and I wanted to know which of these approaches was easier to build around, and how they approached this set.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-elf.jpg?itok=cOLhe5pX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-elf.jpg?itok=0IdyH3GU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>"It depends on the set," explains Mark Gottlieb, Principal Game Designer. "For example, returning to Kamigawa was more of a flavor-driven design - there was a pretty deep trope space to work with, plus the concept of tradition vs futurism led to a lot of designs."</p><blockquote><p>The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor ... is very solid and pretty universal...</p></blockquote><p>But as for Lorwyn, Gottlieb explains that the original set was inspired by Celtic folklore, which - while exuding a distinct vibe, didn't offer up a deep well of concrete tropes to play with. "The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor, though—typal, hybrid, color-matters—is very solid and pretty universal," Gottlieb explains, "So I’d say Lorwyn Eclipsed was much more of a mechanic-driven design."</p><h2>What Stays, What Goes</h2><p>When bringing a set as beloved as Lorwyn back for the first time, it must have been difficult to decide what elements were important to implement vs. what could get left behind. "The question we asked ourselves," Gottlieb continues, "is 'What is definitional about Lorwyn?' And the same for Shadowmoor. What do people immediately think of as the identity of those sets?"</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-goblins.jpg?itok=Hqo5sLY_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-goblins.jpg?itok=pgkDXuK6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Gottlieb says they ran an exercise of dissecting the original sets into their component parts, slicing them up into "Must have," "Nice to have," and "Don't need" categories. "The 'Must have' group," Gottlieb explains, "was mostly filled with broad mechanical space, like typal, hybrid, and -1/-1 counters. Most of the original keywords, though, like clash, reinforce, and conspire, didn’t carry the same weight."</p><h2>Aging Like A Fine Kithkin Wine</h2><p>Next I wanted to know in which ways, when designing the new set, did the team "feel the age" of the original Lorwyn block. Were there any mechanics, original designs, etc. that felt like they needed a serious update? &nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky," admits Gottlieb. "But we didn’t really think about the set in terms of 'Ugh, what do we have to fix?' The thought process was much more along the lines of 'What new and exciting things can we create out of the original sets’ elements that meet the moment for modern Magic?'"</p><blockquote><p>A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky...</p></blockquote><p>"Blight uses -1/-1 counters in a new, proactive way. Vivid takes advantage of hybrid in a way we haven’t before. We’d never had the opportunity to mash up Lorwyn and Shadowmoor elements before, since the story had previously kept them separate from one another." Gottlieb says that mindset gave the team the opportunity to come up with a whole new cycle of Elemental Incarnations, "as well as a new take on “champion” that takes advantage of newfangled 'behold' technology."</p><h2>Saying Goodbye To The Block</h2><p>To that end, I wondered if there were any challenges that came from designing this set as a single release, when we had a whole block with the setting the last time we visited Lorwyn.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"Yes, absolutely," Gottlieb replies. "It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go. But the competition for space was a crucible, in a way. Only the best stuff could stay. Everything in the set had to earn its spot."</p><blockquote><p>It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go.</p></blockquote><p>Gottlieb went on to describe a particular challenge in their design, which was the fact the the mechanical spaces Lorwyn Eclipsed focuses on (creature types matter, color matters), involve, as he puts it, "universal elements among <em>Magic</em> cards. Just about every creature card has both color and creature types, but they don’t really speak to one another, and keeping track of eight creature types and five colors across your board state can be burdensome. So it was certainly difficult to balance the focus between those two pillars of the design."</p><h2>Getting The Band Back Together</h2><p>With a set with this kind of legacy, I was curious if any of the original designers came back for this set. "Yes, multiple designers overlapped the original sets and the new one," explains Gottlieb. "I was the Vision Design lead for Lorwyn Eclipsed, and I was the Rules Manager during Lorwyn, and was a member of the Shadowmoor design team."&nbsp;</p><picture>

But all the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history. And the Worldbuilding team did a spectacular job immersing us into the setting, which really helped everyone zero in on the tone we wanted to capture."</p><blockquote><p>All the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, I closed out my questions with my classic ender: Do you have a favorite card from the new set? Is there a card you don't think is getting enough attention yet that you think will be a powerful addition to limited, constructed, or Commander?</p><p>To this, Jadine Klomparens, Principal Game Designer chimed in. "I really like Mutable Explorer and think there’s a lot of potential for it to show up in strategies that are interested in ramp or low opportunity cost changelings, or both!" I agree - Mutable Explorer's one of my favorite cards in the set!</p><picture>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790</link>
            <guid>1438750</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Developers at Wildlight Entertainment were very open about <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em>‘s development</a> back when it launched last month. Everything except where the money to make it came from. A week after mass layoffs at the studio, it’s come out that the source of funding for the hero shooter’s four-year development cycle may have been Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=155iz&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">new report by <em>Game File</em></a>. It claims Tencent studio group&nbsp;TiMi, responsible for online hits like <em>Honor of Kings</em> and military multiplayer shooter <em>Delta Force</em>, is the one backing Wildlight Entertainment.</p> <p>Wildlight was cofounded by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">ex-Respawn Entertainment veterans</a> who worked on<em> Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But unlike many recent startups which happily publicize their investment backers, Wildlight has kept that fact a secret. When pressed about the studio’s funding last month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-30/-highguard-maker-wildlight-entertainment-talks-about-the-game-s-dramatic-launch">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, CEO Dusty Welch said, “We don’t really speak publicly about the business, and the economics and the financials of our company.”</p>

 <p>As <em>Game File</em> points out, it’s unclear why the relationship has been kept secret. Tencent is no stranger to investing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-world-s-biggest-game-company-just-keeps-getting-big-1826294558">in Western game studios</a> and companies. It has billions in holdings across companies big and small, from Larian Studios and FromSoftware to Epic Games and Ubisoft. Usually these are just partial financial stakes. In Wildlight’s case, TiMi appears to have been the primary backer.</p> <p>Questions about the funding have taken center stage following Wildlight’s layoffs last week and fan questions about just how much longer the live-service game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192"><em>Highguard</em> can continue</a> in its current state. It’s lost over 95 percent of concurrent players on PC from its peak at launch, even as an unknown pool continues to play on console.</p>

 <p>As a free-to-play shooter, its revenue comes entirely from in-game microtransactions for skins and battle passes, things players are much less likely to buy when they think a game won’t stick around. Wildlight has yet to update players on the game’s revised roadmap or future plans and today, <em>Highguard</em>‘s official website was discovered to <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734">have been taken offline</a>.</p>

<p>As Highguard’s struggles continue amid collapsing player counts and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" id="175994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs at developer</a> Wildlight Entertainment, a new report has shed light on who was funding the game all these years.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a>, Chinese conglomerate Tencent was the “lead financial backer” of the studio. Specifically, it’s said that TiMi Studio Group is the main studio backing the game.</p>







<p>Up until now, the funders behind the game have been kept quiet. In past interviews, the studio has declined to comment on who was investing in the studio.</p>



<p>Totilo adds that neither Tencent nor Wildlight provided a comment on the matter by the time of publication. Insider Gaming has also reached out for comment, but has not received a response. </p>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26th to nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam. Since then the game has seen its playerbase fall to under 2,000 peak concurrents on the platform. It has also received mixed reviews. </p>

              <p><span>Between the game’s seasonal crops, time-locked fish, and pressure to keep up relationships with townspeople, most </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>players wouldn’t think of wasting a single in-game day by going to sleep early. Squeezing every possible hour of productivity out of the workday might just be the difference between completing the game’s Community Center and having to wait another in-game year to finish the challenge. However, one player has now done the unthinkable and slept through…an entire 1,000 in-game years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Late last week, Reddit user Holozard </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1r3xzkg/slept_for_1000_years_straight/"><span>shared</span></a><span> screenshots of their absolutely ridiculous farm, which they left unattended while sleeping in-game for what has to be a record-breaking stretch of time (</span><span>thanks</span><span>, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/stardew-valley-fan-recreates-wait-for-haunted-chocolatier-by-sleeping-for-1-000-years-in-the-farming-sim-wakes-up-to-sea-of-giant-mushrooms-and-chickens-that-are-immortal-but-understandably-grumpy/"><i><span>Gamesradar</span></i></a><span>). To put Holozard’s 1,000-year slumber into perspective, I’ve probably only gone through five or six years across all my farms despite putting hundreds of hours into the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Holozard apparently accomplished the absurd task by running their Switch for three weeks straight. The process involved wrapping a hair tie around the joystick to get their farmer to walk toward their bed automatically and using a controller’s turbo function to hit the rest button.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Their screenshots show off the most abandoned farm I’ve ever seen. Predictably, it’s absolutely overgrown and covered in rocks, grass, and trees. But it’s also covered in some pretty neat spawns that most players have never seen.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Most of </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-tips-tricks-beginner-2000669702">Stardew Valley</a>’s</span></i><span> random events work overnight, meaning every time a player sleeps, the game has a chance to select a random event. Some of these events are pretty rare and have less than a 1 percent chance to occur (and even if one of these rare events does happen, the game might still randomly select an incompatible tile, causing nothing to actually show up).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But it turns out, if you sleep for 1,000 years, even the game’s rarest events become common. Holozard’s screenshots show a farm littered with meteorites, mushroom trees, and stone owls, all rare items that have impressively low chances to spawn. Looking at these screenshots and trying to parse everything is like playing a messed up version of Where’s Waldo, but it looks like 1,000 years still wasn’t enough to land them the strange capsule item, another rare spawn that I can’t see anywhere in the screenshot. Maybe their farm became too overgrown before the item had the space to spawn?</span></p> <p><span>While poor Holozard had to go through a pretty tedious cleanup process (they said it took them three entire seasons to chop down the mushroom trees alone), it was apparently pretty profitable. “I now have lots of cool purple rocks all over my farm, and made almost half a million in mushrooms, so I’m happy,” they wrote in a Reddit comment.</span></p>

 <p><span>Holozard’s technique is quite the niche way to collect cash, but I guess if you’re desperate to fund your farm and have a spare hair tie and turbo controller, maybe sleeping for a while and crossing your fingers is worth a shot. You just might want to save plenty of time to clean up your farm before bringing either of the game’s two new marriage candidates, which ConcernedApe </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425"><span>plans to reveal later this month</span></a><span>, home.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-extra-premium-subscription-plan/</link>
            <guid>1438726</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pioner/" id="2245">PIONER</a>, the post-apocalyptic MMORPG with a vibe similar to STALKER and Fallout 76, has today introduced a new <strong>PIONER Extra </strong>subscription service. This service is entirely optional but allows the game’s most dedicated players to enhance their experience with a few key bonuses.</p>



<p>For instance, it unlocks unlimited stash storage, allowing players to store as much as they want, without any restrictions. In a game where loot is plentiful, this is admittedly quite handy.</p>











<p>In a post on Steam, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gfa-games/" id="3175">GFA Games</a> revealed that PIONER, the post-apocalyptic, PvPvE MMO, has a new subscription service, running for now at a ‘standard tier’ that will be upgraded in time.</p>



<p>Per the post, the PIONER Extra service includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Premium Currency Bonus: </strong>Every subscription period comes with an in-game currency reward, so you’re getting value back right away.</li>



<li><strong>Mobile Stash</strong>: Deploy a portable storage unit anywhere on the map. Other players on your server can use it too. It operates on a cooldown, and you’ll get a HUD notification the moment it’s ready again.</li>



<li><strong>Mobile Repair Station: </strong>Drop a repair bench out in the field to fix your gear on the go. Same cooldown system, same shared access for nearby players, same notification when it recharges.</li>



<li><strong>Unlimited Stash Storage</strong>: No more worrying about running out of space. While your subscription is active, your stash has infinite slots.</li>



<li><strong>Exclusive Cosmetic Item</strong>: Subscribers receive a unique role-play item to stand out in the world.</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at GFA advised that you subscribe and play, and when your purchased time expires, you can simply renew for as long as you’d like. There’s a new tier coming soon, with ‘even more features’, but we don’t know yet what that will look like.</p>



<p>There are some stark similarities here between PIONER Extra and Fallout 1st, the premium subscription service that runs in Fallout 76 and gives users many of the same benefits.</p>



<p>PIONER Extra costs as little as $4.92 a month when you commit to a 360-day subscription, or as much as $6.99 a month for a rolling, once-monthly subscription.</p>
