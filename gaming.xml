		<p>It’s been a long and busy week, with last weekend being a mad juggle of trying to play as much Switch 2 as possible while also covering Summer Game Fest streams and showcases. The Switch 2 gaming has continued through to this week, as Dom and I led the charge on doing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">a broad look at backward compatibility games</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077’s impressive port</a>, and I published our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/nintendo-switch-2-review-one-week-with-the-new-generation-handheld/">hardware review</a> after gathering my thoughts from the first week.</p>
<p>There’s still plenty more Switch 2 stuff to do, though. I’ll soon be telling you about how the Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is a “transfigurational” port. Can you tell that I’m happy with this reference?</p>

<p>For some reason, I asked everyone to tell me relay their week’s gaming while making it rhyme. Not everyone was up to the task, but we did get some nice poems.</p>
<p>Here’s <strong>Ade</strong>:</p>

<p><em>For review I played Alter, and I didn’t falter. It was very hard, like frozen lard, but I saw it through to the end, and confirm that money on it people should spend.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dom’s</strong> was more of a limerick:</p>
<p><em>I played Switch 2 with my wife</em><br>
<em>I thought to myself ‘what a life!’</em><br>
<em>But I didn’t let her win</em><br>
<em>My Switch 2 is in the bin</em><br>
<em>Who knew Mario Kart causes such strife?</em></p>
<p>And here’s <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> effort:</p>
<p><em>I start by playing Balatro,</em><br>
<em>Then Warhammer, I’m sure you know,</em><br>
<em>But then I remembered a review,</em><br>
<em>That is what I should do,</em><br>
<em>So I looked at Baldur’s Gate and said no!</em></p>
<p><em>Instead I played Zombie Army,</em><br>
<em>And after that the Atomfall DLC,</em><br>
<em>The reviews will come soon,</em><br>
<em>Before the full moon,</em><br>
<em>Because then a werewolf I’ll be.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, I’m a werewolf.</em></p>
<p>Sadly nobody else was willing to take on this task, <strong>Steve</strong> even said that these efforts caused him “significant discomfort as a lecturer in English Lit and Creative Writing.” So we’re back to the boring land of basic prose, and he played “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/ten-horror-game-demos-to-chill-and-thrill-you-in-steam-next-fest-this-week/">a whole bunch of Steam demos</a> and put a few hours into Mario Kart World.”</p>
<p>Speaking of Mario Kart World, <strong>Nic’s</strong> son decided to add a little bit of “4D haptics” to his gaming by whacking him in the Mushroom Kingdom’s crown jewels. Ouch! He also played Split Fiction, Survival Kids and Bravely Default’s remake on Switch 2, with reviews for them all still in the pipe.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> tired of playing games where he wasn’t the named protagonist, so went back to Blades of Fire to fight some things. He’s also reviewed Tainted Grail Fall of Avalon, which is a good game marred by so many technical issues.</p>
<p>After checking out Nioh 3’s demo some more, and revisiting Dynasty Warriors: Origins for a Shu playthrough, <strong>Jim</strong> moved on to the Cairn demo. “It’s a truly unique game about climbing a mountain, from the devs who created the fantastic Furi, that somehow manages to be zen and infuriating at the same time. I’m looking forward to playing the full release though I’m hoping the performance improves drastically on PS5 (the demo was super choppy).”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> got to keep quiet about Death Stranding 2 a little longer.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/as-switch-2-breaks-records-worldwide-sony-reminds-us-that-ps5-still-exists<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 / PS5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a208dca657808/switch-2-ps5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has been out for a little over a week now, and it's already breaking records in multiple regions. Nintendo has confirmed that the console <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold 3.5 million units in the first four days of sale</a>, but it's also become the fastest-selling Nintendo console in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>, and Japan. In the latter region specifically, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">Switch 2 also beat the PlayStation 2</a> to become the fast-selling console <em>of all time</em>. Crikey.</p>
<p>Naturally, thoughts are inevitably turning toward Nintendo's direct competition, and whether the likes of Sony and Microsoft might be concerned about the Switch 2's monumental success. Well, <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html">according to SIE's new president and CEO, Hideaki Nishino</a> during a Business Segment fireside chat, the company isn't particularly bothered (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-sony-says-ps5-performance-required-for-great-experience-on-a-big-screen/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>When asked if the Switch 2's improved specs and Nintendo's relationships with third-party publishers caused any concern, Nishino was keen to reiterate the appeal of the PS5 against its competitors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We closely monitor the overall gaming industry, including the actions of other market participants. Additionally, catalysts in the market are great for the industry as a whole, as they invigorate the excitement and demand more broadly. So it’s great to have people launching new things.</p>
<p>“However, as I mentioned previously, we have a differentiated strategy. PlayStation 5 is designed for an immersive gaming experience, and this includes the innovative DualSense controller features as well. We believe PS5-level performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering for players and creators in this current console generation.</p>
<p>“However, publisher strategies are increasingly shifting towards being multi-platform, so more platforms can run the same game, which is great from a creator’s perspective. Among those platforms, our mission is that we will continue to be the best place to play and publish.</p>
<p>“As such, we have empowered our creators to leverage our offering and services to create amazing, unique experiences for players with high engagement and great monetisation opportunities. We have done this consistently as the industry and competitive dynamics have evolved. And of course, PlayStation Studios, our franchises, have a special role in showcasing the PlayStation experience and then strengthening the player’s vision with us.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair to Sony, the PS5 is a great system, though we'd be lying if we said that its first-party offering was thriving at the moment. Sony has struggled recently with its ill-conceived focus on live-service games, resulting in the highly-publicised failure of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/concord">Concord</a>, the cancellation of <strong>The Last of Us Online</strong>, and ongoing concerns around Bungie's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>That said, PS5 will have pretty tempting exclusives this year in the form of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/saros">Saros</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> following later.</p>
<p>There's room for all, is what we're saying. But it's going to be interesting to see how the dynamic between the Big Three changes with the Switch 2. Chances are there are a few publishers who regret not supporting the Switch enough in recent years, so we suspect that will no doubt change going forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-may-allow-music-artists-to-upload-their-music-directly-in-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is set to revolutionize music handling in open-world games, if a well-known music producer's recent revelations are true.</p>
<p>Speaking during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newrorynmal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Rory and Mal</a> show, Grammy-winning music producer Jermaine Dupri surprisingly revealed that artists will be able to upload their music directly to an unspecified Grand Theft Auto game. While the music producer did not specifically mention Grand Theft Auto VI, there's no way this feature would get added to the fifth entry in the series so late after its release, so there's little doubt that this will be a feature in the game launching next year on consoles. Jermain Dupri also added that the rapper Drake will have his own radio station, and from his understanding, the rapper himself could upload music to the game that is not available anywhere, something that would turn Grand Theft Auto VI into a music streaming service like Spotify and the like.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jermaine Dupri, Ray Vaughn, Claressa Shields &amp; More Join us at the BET Awards Pt. 1 | NEW RORY &amp; MAL" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/le8zt-XrrNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While we have to take all the above with a huge grain of salt, it would definitely make sense for Rockstar Games to do something like this for Grand Theft Auto VI, considering how music has always been important in every entry in the series, and how the game is setting out to be the most successful game release of all time. I personally hope the option, if real, will be available to a wide variety of artists, as nothing would beat going around the game's beautiful world with some pumping rock and metal tunes, bringing back to mind the days of roaming about Vice City with Iron Maiden's 2 Minutes to Midnight, Megadeth's Peace Sells and Ozzy Osbourne's Bark at the Moon playing in the background.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a> worldwide.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you're desperate for some company of a non-Adoring Fan kind as you run around Cyrodiil in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, odds are the base game'll leave you wanting. Enter a new mod, which adds in a beast master system that'll let you tame a furry or scaly pet.</p>
<p>After all, one could argue you've not really experienced Tamriel unless you're having to stop after every fight to give your precious wild boar Bobo some heal minor wounds-infused tummy tickles</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4468">Beast Master</a> is the mod in question, and the latest example of prolific ColdTyrant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-right-there-oblivion-remastered-modder-imperial-watch-proper-joinable-faction-new-quests-and-a-corruption-system">working to revamp</a> 2025's most 2006 release by giving folks new stuff to try once they've had their fill of shutting spooky doors. </p>
<p>Building on the pretty basic command creature spell from the base game, which Wood Elves have as a racial ability, he's put together a means for you to tame any animal you come across in the wilderness via magic and have it permanently join you on your adventures as a named "combat pet". In addition to being commandable and aiding you in fights like any regular companion, these pets can be fed grub from your inventory and interacted with in order to check on their mood.</p>
<p>That last bit has no impact in gameplay, so the mod's more of the casual pet ownership experience than a full Nintendogs-style furry thing parent simulation that'll leave you feeling even more unnerved than usual about your real life ability to look after actual human children.</p>
<p>Further to that end, you can only have one pet at any given time via the mod, so if you want to replace your tamed Imp named Fatso with a brown bear named Bingus or a troll named Sapphire, you'll have to release the former back into the wild. As of right now, the mod has short lists of pre-defined names and recruitable animals for you to pick from, but ColdTyrant has indicated he's open to adding more options based on suggestions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the modder says he initially tried letting folks type in their own custom pet names, but had to ditch that option due to it being "literally impossible to rename an actor without clicking on them directly in the console" at the moment.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this Beast Master mod a go, you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282">Oblivion Remastered Script Extender</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966">MagicLoader 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a> are optional installs, but not hard requirements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sony%E2%80%99s-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games.1217499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PC version of Stellar Blade has finally launched, around thirteen months after the game's or<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iginal debut on Sony's PlayStation 5 console</a>. This version is also published by Sony and as such, it's interesting to compare its early player figures against other recent Sony-published games that made it to the PC platform.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3489700/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade has already more than doubled any previous single player games published by Sony on Valve's store when it comes to concurrent user peak. The action title peaked at 183.8K players around nineteen hours ago, with the potential to go even higher as we head into the weekend, when gamers have more time to play.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/PlayStation+Publishing+LLC/?sort=peak_desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> the previous record earlier this year with 77.1K, although it should be clarified that the game also includes a multiplayer coop mode, Legends. As such, it might be more appropriate to consider Sony Santa Monica's God of War, which peaked at 73.5K players, the previous record holder. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered reached a peak of 66.4K players; Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition stopped at 56.5K, while its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, peaked at 40.4K players. The Last of Us Part I registered 36.4K concurrent players on Steam, narrowly beating God of War Ragnarok (35.6K), The Last of Us Part II Remastered (30.6K), Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (28.1K), and Days Gone (27.4K). All the others are much lower in the chart. Interestingly, all the first installments registered higher peaks than their sequels.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade is certainly an acclaimed title, having sold enough to warrant a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>. That said, some of the other games mentioned above have rated even higher, despite reaching lower concurrent players on Steam. This new record might be surpassed soon, though, as the next Sony-published PC game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, will release on the same day as on consoles (August 29). It will be the first single-player game published by Sony to launch day and date on PC, and that might be enough to raise interest in the game, provided that it reviews well enough.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will be updated sometime this month with "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords", but as is often the way of updates, some of the relevant boss files are already in the current version of the game, and yes, there's a mod if you want an early crack at them.</p><!--more-->
<p>From Software teased the coming of spruced-up boss battles in <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">a social media post</a> on 3rd June, offering no clue as to what "enhanced" means in this context. Enhanced movesets? Enhanced haircuts? An inflated sense of self-esteem?</p>
<p>Subsequently, owl-eared, eagle-eyed players noticed that there were unused sections in every boss soundtrack theme that implied the addition of a third combat phase, together with unused boss relics that look like a reward for besting them in hard mode. Now, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftware-left-hints-for-elden-ring-nightreigns-enhanced-bosses-update-in-the-files-and-modders-have-already-dug-them-up/">PCGamer</a>, NexusMods user TerraMag has dug up the files that let you fight the "enhanced" Nightlords and released them as the obliquely named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/92">Enhanced Nightlord Fights mod</a>.</p>
<p>If you lack the fortitude to face these maxed-out titans yourself, or you just want to chill to footage of an apoplectic gigaroach, TerraMag has kindly released some videos of the enhanced fights. Bear in mind, of course, that these aren't the final, From-sanctioned versions of each enhanced boss, so they might appear rough and unfinished. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft centric website Windows Central <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the company had paused its work on the Xbox handheld project. This did not affect the partnership with ASUS to make the ROG X Ally and ROG X Ally X, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 for a holiday release window.</p>
<p>Originally, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to use this partnership as a stopgap while it produced its own Xbox handheld that would have been released alongside the next-generation Xbox home console. These plans, however, are more than just paused - they might be practically dead now, according to The Verge's Tom Warren. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>, Warren says that Microsoft will focus on the software platform instead. Furthermore, he points out that while there will be an 'official' next-generation hardware from Microsoft, OEM partners like ASUS may also release their own versions of a next-gen Xbox console.</p>
<p>In that regard, Warren believes that the ASUS-made handhelds are a sort of 'market test' for Microsoft's increasingly tight integration of Windows and Xbox, not to mention the ambitious goal of turning every screen into an Xbox. The Verge's journalist adds that, at some point, the emulation project established by Sarah Bond in early 2024 may solve the issue. Until then, Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming are doing most of the work in helping spread the brand across devices.</p>
<p>Last year, Microsoft has made some lofty promises when it comes to the next-generation console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming</a> that the successor of the Xbox Series X would deliver the 'largest technical leap ever seen' from one generation to another. That's certainly an ambitious goal that could possibly only be achieved through the implementation of machine learning algorithms, although we'll have to wait until Microsoft reveals its hand before assessing the veracity of that statement. The next Xbox is currently thought to be targeting a 2027 launch, presumably near the holiday season.</p>

			<p>After the news that Street Fighter 6 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 5 million units sold, CAPCOM has another sales milestone to announce this week, this time for Devil May Cry 5. The latest installment in the popular action game franchise has <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250613.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million units since its debut on March 8, 2019, for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Devil May Cry 5 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-2019-devil-may-cry-5-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 2 million units in less than a month, but then sales slowed down considerably. It wasn't until April 2022 that CAPCOM could <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-sold-over-5-million-units-globally-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the five million sales milestone. Notably, sales were at 9.1 million units as of March 31, 2025, meaning the game sold almost a million units in less than three months.</p>
<p>That's a lot for a relatively old game, but it's not impossible. For one thing, there was the acclaimed Netflix Devil May Cry show that certainly helped push game sales, too. CAPCOM says that with more than 5.3 million views, it ranked fourth globally in the 'Shows | English' category during its first week. It also ranked in the top 10 for seven consecutive days in Japan. Moreover, there was a <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910766029376262605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">franchise sale in April</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM is counting Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition separately. On its Platinum Titles chart, that version is listed as having sold 1 million units on its own, which means that DMC 5 as a whole has technically surpassed 11 million units.</p>
<p>DMC 5 earned high praise here on Wccftech from resident fan Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> the game 9.8 out of 10:</p>
<p>Devil May Cry V is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series so far, taking everything that made Devil May Cry 3 and 4 good and bringing everything up a notch. Those who only wish to play the game through once at regular difficulty will "only" see Devil May Cry V as a very good action game that can keep them engaged from beginning to end, but veterans of the series will see it as the deep, fun and engaging game they have been waiting for over ten years.</p>

<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cd4707bfde1a1/street-fighter-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> launched for the Switch 2 last week and if you've been wanting to throw your support behind this particular version of the game, but aren't confident it will be supported on the same level as other platforms, we've got some good news.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/jun/12/street-fighter-switch-2-tournament/">highlighted by EventHubs</a>, the Nintendo version has been declared tournament legal, which means the Switch 2 version is now officially acceptable for online and offline tournaments according to <a href="https://sf.esports.capcom.com/cpt/rules/">Capcom's Pro Tour website</a>. This update originally came into effect on 9th June, just days after the release of the game on Nintendo's hybrid platform.</p>
<p>While it might seem like this was always going to be the case, during past generations, certain third-party fighting games have isolated Nintendo builds – resulting in major updates and DLC at a later date. As the source notes, the Switch 2 version supports cross-play functionality (including Capcom's ID account system), which is a point of difference in this case, so it's "hardly a surprise".</p>
<p>Still, it's a nice contrast to some other fighting games on Nintendo platforms. For example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> (which landed on the Switch earlier this year) is still yet to receive the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/guilty-gear-strive-adds-another-dlc-character-to-its-season-pass-4-roster">latest seasonal DLC fighters</a>. So, it's once again great news to see the Switch 2 version of Street Fighter 6 being treated equally.</p>
<p>You can find out our thoughts about this version of Street Fighter 6 in our full review here on Nintendo Life. In some related news, Capcom this week announced the lifetime sales of the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-helps-street-fighter-6-achieve-five-million-global-sales">have now surpassed the five million mark</a>.</p>

In this particular case, we're actually referring to Piggyback's upcoming art book '<strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong>'.</p>
<p>This book, developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, was originally scheduled to launch in Summer 2025 and then <a href="https://x.com/PiggybackGuides/status/1894447510669705488">narrowed down the date to 24th June 2025</a>, but has now been pushed back to <strong>28th October 2025</strong>. <a href="https://www.piggyback.com/us/guide/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective/">Pre-orders have also gone live</a> since our last update.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>When this art book eventually releases, Metroid fans can look forward to a 212-page visual retrospective that goes behind the scenes on the series' development including a foreword by Metroid Prime producer Kensuke Tanabe.</p>
<p>This book will retail for <strong>£39.99 / €44.99</strong> and you can find out more about it in our previous coverage on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, it's currently set to arrive at some point in 2025, with Nintendo also recently revealing a Switch 2 version which will enhance the experience and also add some additional features like mouse control.</p>

What an introduction!</p><p>Given how volatile the video game community is these days, and how easily vital parts of it (reviews, social media, etc) can be weaponised against developers, I felt a pang of sympathy for the team. We've all seen how chuds can bury a game without having even played it, and this sure sounded like another example of that happening.</p><p>WRONG. This game sucks, and everything bad that anyone has ever written about it, for free or otherwise, is true.</p><p>I've tried playing the game over the last few days and have hated every second I've spent with it. I can see the outline of what was attempted here--a cyberpunk <em>GTA </em>clone, something like <em>Watch Dogs</em> meets <em>2077</em>--but what's actually here is a buggy mess of a game that looks bland, is boring to play and perhaps worst of all seems to have treated its story and dialogue with open contempt.</p><p>Given <em>MindsEye</em>'s developer is led by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Benzies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> prominent ex-Rockstar man Leslie Benzies</a>, the <em>GTA </em>similarities are to be expected, but like...just watch this, the first real mission you have to undertake. It does everything a <em>GTA </em>game would do, in that it gives you a car, tells you to drive somewhere to shoot some bad guys then fills the downtime with dialogue, but every single aspect of it here is just <em>dreadful</em>, from the pathfinding (look how long it takes you to get to the car!) to the stilted delivery of some meaningless lines to the limp, wet gunplay.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MindsEye – First Hour Gameplay - No Commentary Walkthrough Part 1" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2OGYUSIec8?start=2694&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I cannot <em>believe</em> how bad the writing and voice acting is in this game. Actually, let me be fair: I don't know if it's the acting itself, or just the way it's all been recorded and delivered in two-line packages, seemingly in isolation, meaning nothing ever sounds like it’s part of a natural, human conversation. I was only 20 minutes into this game before it started testing my patience; by the two-hour mark I was ready to mute it and just put subtitles on.</p><p>It’s like a <em>GTA</em> clone that was delivered by ticking boxes--cars, check; guns, check; cover system, check--without ever bothering to make sure if any of those boxes were any <em>good</em>. It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer. It plays like a cancelled PS4 game.</p><p>It's so bad that streamers<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/606496/mindseye-twitch-youtube-stream-cancel-glitches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> are having their sponsored streams cancelled</a>. It's so bad that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-mindseye-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> seemingly no major outlets were sent review code ahead of time</a>. There are so many bugs and glitches that<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1l8nl48/playstation_support_have_refunded_the_game_with/?share_id=3_-brSh2YLe4KNeaeC79I&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sony is reportedly offering at least this person a refund on technical grounds</a>, something it has only really done previously with <em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p><p>Some of this can be chalked up to it being <em>really hard</em> to make a good open-world game, which is why the few studios who <em>can</em> do it get paid so much and can sell so many copies. Some of it can maybe be chalked up to the fact that developers Rocket Boy<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-rockstar-north-boss-nets-110m-to-launch-what-sounds-a-lot-like-a-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> originally had plans for <em>MindsEye </em>to be part of a big metaverse grift</a>, which might explain the presence of an odd and seemingly useless creation suite within the game.</p><figure></figure><p>Whatever the reasons, and whatever the original intent, this is a very bad video game that's bad in such fundamental ways I don't know if it can ever be fixed with a patch or two.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 might pack much better hardware than the original, but a game I’m still surprised to see running at all (much less pretty well) on a Nintendo system is Cyberpunk 2077. I spent a few days with CD Projekt Red’s latest port to get a feel for how it runs, how it holds up, and how the Switch 2’s fancy new mouse controls work when applied to a high-octane FPS. The answer across the board is impressive, and if you haven’t had the pleasure of exploring Night City before, this seems like a solid way to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, let’s look back at what I said in my review of Cyberpunk 2077 when it first launched in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that was just for the PC version, and the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions were such a notorious mess that we had to go back and do <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-for-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review"><u>a separate review</u></a> with a much lower score once we got our hands on it at launch. (And don’t forget we also reviewed its excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review"><u>Phantom Liberty DLC</u></a> in 2023, which is included in the Switch 2 version.) Thankfully, the Switch 2 port is nowhere near the disaster it was on the old console generation – in fact, it’s pretty dang great.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077 looks pretty great on Nintendo Switch 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">All it takes is a quick glance to see that Cyberpunk 2077 still looks very good on Nintendo’s new console. The distinct neon glows and dirty streets of Night City all come through alive and well here, even if they aren’t quite as crisp and clean as you’d find on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X. This isn’t exactly the “definitive” way to play this game, but it’s more than good enough from a practical standpoint. This isn’t like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/14/witcher-3-switch-review"><u>Switch 1 port of The Witcher 3</u></a>, which felt like an “I guess we can make this function” sort of last resort way to play more than anything else. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The framerate is decent but not jaw-dropping</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You can check out the technical specs in our story about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2"><u>how CD Projekt managed to get Cyberpunk 2077 running on the Switch 2</u></a> – in short, it’s running at 1080p when docked, and 1080p or 720p in handheld, depending on if you’re playing in Quality or Performance mode, and it maxes out at 40fps. Your mileage may vary here, because despite my PC gaming background, I am not a huge performance snob and I have no issue playing at less than 60fps. So to my eye, Cyberpunk 2077 runs fairly well in docked mode, even if far from perfect. It has some dropped frames in parts and doesn’t run as buttery smooth as the Switch 2 Editions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update"><u>Tears of the Kingdom</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update"><u>Breath of the Wild</u></a>, but nothing is so distracting that it actively harmed my time with it in this context. If you can’t stand anything below a solid 60fps, this might be one you need to skip – anyone who is used to playing games entirely on the original Switch, however, should be comfortable enough here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cyberpunk Switch 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Switch 2 mouse controls work surprisingly well</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest draws of the Switch 2 for me was its ability to mimic mouse control with a sideways Joy-Con, potentially giving you greater accuracy in a first-person game like this. I am happy to say that’s exactly the case, as it was super easy for me to jump from my PC to this control option and get far more headshots than I would have with a regular gamepad. It’s not at the same level as a high-DPS gaming mouse or anything, but it’s absolutely my preferred way to play this game whenever I sat down to do so, and that’s a huge win. That said…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Joy-Con mouse isn’t great for long sessions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, the problem with the Switch 2’s mouse mode isn’t actually the quality of the mouse control itself, but the physical feel of using it. The Joy-Con is tiny compared to a normal mouse, and my hand was cramping up trying to get a good grip on it after long play sessions – even when I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social/post/3lqvjiltnfk2j" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>used a 3D-printed shell</u></a> to make it feel better. That’s because there’s nowhere to comfortably put your thumb while still being able to press the right stick, Y button, and A button, all of which are required for various actions as you jump between combat, conversations, and menu management. So while the mouse is better than I expected, I’m worried this awkward grip is going to stop me from consistently using it in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077’s motion assist options aren’t great</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the mouse controls are at least better than using motions to shortcut certain actions. The usual method of aiming with the right stick primarily and then fine-tuning that aim with motion controls is available and works just as well here as it does in stuff like Zelda, but the motion assist options are pretty useless beyond that. You can swing your Joy-Con to use your melee weapon in a way that gave me unflattering flashbacks to early Wii games, or twist and flail it to do actions like reload or heal, but doing so almost always made my camera wobble about at the same time. It may hurt my hand, but I’ll take mouse controls over this any day.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">This is still an awesome RPG worth playing</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, revisiting Night City reminded me just how great this game is, especially after all the improvements after launch. The world is moody and dangerous, and it does a great job of dropping you in and immediately making you feel like a part of the culture. I also maintain it stages its quest conversations better than any RPG I’ve ever seen, giving simple chats a cinematic quality without ever taking you out of the driver seat. If you’ve never played Cyberpunk 2077, I can absolutely recommend you check it out here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I am still working on my final <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review"><u>Switch 2 review</u></a>, but you can check out our reviews of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review"><u>Mario Kart World</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review"><u>Welcome Tour</u></a> in the meantime.

<p>Breaking records in less than a week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a6181ef1adbe/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo shared its first official sales data for the Switch 2 – confirming the new hybrid system had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide"</a> in just the first four days, making it the highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware within this amount of time.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the video game firm has revealed this new device is also the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware in the US" in four days. This was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe">reported by IGN</a> – with the outlet also told "Switch 2 sales in all regions were approximately twice those of the Nintendo Switch 1 across both consoles' first four days on the market". Nintendo has not provided specific sales figures for this region.</p>
<p>This follows reports about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">system's positive start in locations like the UK</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">and Japan</a>. Unsurprisingly, the launch is also benefiting certain franchises such as Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which has now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-helps-street-fighter-6-achieve-five-million-global-sales">surpassed five million lifetime sales</a> just a week later.</p>
<p>It's still early days for the Switch 2, and there were obviously some concerns about pricing and supply in the lead-up, but based on the official sales updates so far, it appears to be an excellent start. Nintendo will bolster the new device's software library next month with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and it's likely to welcome even more consumers to the Switch 2 family with games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> later this year.</p>

                <p>Former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista has made a name for himself as an actor over the last decade, but now he's moving into the video game space as a producer. Bautista and Titan1Studios have agreed to partner up to bring Cat Assassin to life as a new media franchise including an upcoming video game.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://gamerant.com/cat-assassin-game-dave-bautista-stray-neo-noir-franchise-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, Cat Assassin was created by Steve Lerner, the writer of the critically acclaimed indie game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-review-nine-lives/1900-6417917/" data-ref-id="1900-6417917">Stray</a>. While that title put players in control of an adorable cat in a city of robots, Cat Assassin's lead character, Hugh, is considerably less cuddly. He's described as "a skilled assassin navigating a chaotic world of warring cartels and corrupt power players." Presumably that's a role that Bautista may be interested in playing, but the announcement doesn't specify his involvement as an actor.</p><p>Cat Assassin takes place in a "neo-noir city populated by anthropomorphic felines." The video game is being planned as a stealth-action game with dark humor. The announcement notes that the Cat Assassin game is inspired by Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, and Sifu.</p><p>Bautista's Dogbone Entertainment production company is also developing Cat Assassin as a potential animated series and a feature film. Further details about their plans for the franchise and the upcoming game aren't currently known.</p><p>After wrapping his decade plus as Drax the Destroyer in the MCU, Bautista has expressed his interest in starring as Marcus Fenix in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dave-bautista-really-wants-to-play-the-lead-in-netflixs-gears-of-war-movie/1100-6509125/" data-ref-id="1100-6509125">Gears of War</a> movie in development at Netflix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/disney-universal-midjourney-ai-lawsuit-case-copyright<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have read yesterday that,<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/ai-creating-art-is-an-ethical-and-copyright-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> years after the alarm was first raised by artists</a>, media giants Disney and Universal are finally suing an AI image generator for copyright infringement,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/11/disney-universal-ai-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> alleging Midjourney has become a "bottomless pit of plagiarism"</a>.</p><p>Many rightly see this as the best chance yet for a blow to be struck against these AI companies, and while Disney is hardly a champion of artists’ rights,<a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/mickey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's also a company with an army of very good, very ruthless copyright lawyers</a>.</p><p>One thing that struck me <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/874749031/1-2025-06-11-Complaint-w-Exhibits-63#from_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while flipping through the case</a> was that I'd seen a lot of the evidence before. Disney and Universal's filing is full of examples of Midjourney images bearing a <em>remarkable </em>resemblance to screenshots from Disney properties, particularly films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The companies’ argument is that, if users were able to prompt an image so close to the source material as to appear identical, then the source material must have been used illegally.</p><p>Those comparison images aren't new; they were doing the rounds back in 2023, when veteran games artist Reid Southen and former AI evangelist, now anti-AI campaigner Gary Marcus<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> teamed up on a report</a> highlighting the depths to which image-generating platforms weren't just able to recreate copyrighted imagery, but could and would often do so even when they weren't directly prompted.</p><p>Seeing the comparisons form such an important part of this week’s case--Southen and Marcus' report is cited multiple times in letters between Disney and Midjourney, and their images also feature prominently--gave me a fresh chance to talk to Southen about the work he's been doing here since 2023.</p><p><strong><em>Luke Plunkett: Hey man, thanks for chatting with us. I remember seeing some of your comparison images what feels like a long time ago; how long have you been at this, exactly?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Reid Southen</strong>: Basically, on December 21st, 2023, Midjourney released the Alpha of their V6 model so people could use it and test it over the break. Someone on Twitter sent me a post they saw where someone prompted for the Joker from the 2019 movie, and it was almost identical to a frame from the film.&nbsp;</p><p>We'd seen this kind of regurgitation before with things like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Girl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Afghan Girl</a>, or the Mona Lisa, but never really with modern entertainment properties, so I was kind of taken aback. I overlaid it with the original, and it couldn't have been more clear they trained on this exact image.</p><p>I figured hey, this new model has only been available for a day, I wonder what else it can do and how deep the rabbithole goes, so I fired up an account and started posting my findings. Within 12 hours, they'd already banned me and then updated their Terms of Service in the dead of the night without informing their users. I [eventually] caught three bans in total, with no communication from Midjourney about why, and no refunds. David Holz, their CEO, months later offered me $100 to read books on the AI utopia instead of a refund, which is par for the course for him.</p><p><strong><em>LP: What about Gary, when did he get involved?</em></strong></p><p><strong>RS</strong>: Gary reached out almost immediately after I first started posting. We talked a lot, and with his expertise, platform, and contacts, decided to pursue it together and really get the word out about what's going on with these models and companies and how deep the infringement and plagiarism go.&nbsp;</p><p>It took the rest of December and early into January to really dig deep. I was under the impression the Alpha would disappear under the break and thought we had limited time, so I was sleep deprived trying to get as much as I could out of it, but it was honestly at those loopy moments at 3am that most of the breakthroughs happened.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately we went from being able to prompt nearly 1:1 frames by asking for specific properties all the way down to just a single word, "screencap", that would return copyrighted properties, some of them also very close to existing frames. That seemed like the logical conclusion of the work, how much more can you do when one non-descript word can return dozens of different copyrighted properties from different studios.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a lot of additional work that we've never published, but here's an example of some of the other properties:</p><p><br><strong><em>LP: Your report was first published over a year ago. Did you know at the time that it had made an impact like this? Why do you think it took Disney so long to get a suit together?</em></strong></p><p><strong>RS</strong>: I'd hoped the studios, especially Disney, would take notice. That was the ultimate goal, but it was never clear to me if they'd actually seen the work. I'm not certain why it took so long outside of them making sure their case was as strong as possible, and I was starting to worry it would never come, but here we are.<a href="https://aftermath.site/cara-i-art-artstation-instagram-facebook-artist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Artists have their own class action suit</a> against Midjourney and others, but it's really encouraging that some heavy hitters also agree that what AI companies like Midjourney are doing is wrong and likely illegal.</p><p><strong><em>LP: You're heavily cited, but not actually involved in it, so I hope I can ask: What do you think about the case itself? On the one hand it's good Disney is going after them because it's a company with serious legal clout, but on the other hand, Disney is also a company with its own copyright enforcement issues with relation to artists.</em></strong></p><p><strong>RS</strong>: I haven't been able to read through the whole thing yet, and while I'm no expert, I do think the case is really strong and I'm certainly glad it's happening. I don't think it's any secret that the studios are also pursuing AI for their own purposes, but it's my hope that in them going after AI companies, they'll better understand some of the broader issues and try to engage with AI more ethically, especially when they see how many people are in support of their lawsuits and don't want AI in their entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the issues with training these large, versatile models is that they require billions of high quality images. So even if studios want to train on their own catalogs, they'll still need a base model or dataset, and those generally aren't clean. So that would mean either potentially opening themselves up to their own lawsuits, or licensing all of the data they wish to use. It's possible a company like Disney might have enough subsidiaries and properties to make that happen and actually have the model be any good, but at the very least, the US Copyright Office has held firm on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/602096/copyright-office-says-ai-prompting-doesnt-deserve-copyright-protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI outputs not being eligible for copyright</a>, so there still has to be some people in the loop.&nbsp;</p><p>I do think there are going to be ongoing challenges in terms of job displacement regardless of how the lawsuits play out, and it's imperative that we keep that discussion going. My income has been slashed by more than half the last two years, worse than the first year of Covid when all of film basically shut down. I still worry that the work may never come back to its previous level, or be valued the same, but right now, I'll take all the allies we can get in this fight.</p><p><strong><em>LP: Before we go, having looked through all these comparison shots once more, I've got to ask: which one do you think is the most egregious?</em></strong></p><p><strong>RS</strong>: I'd say it's probably <em>Dune</em>, or the <em>Last of Us 2</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fractured-blooms-makes-me-feel-uncomfortable-and-i-dont-even-know-what-its-about<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A chilling surprise from the Summer Game Fest showcase last week was the reveal of Serenity Forge's new game, <a href="https://serenityforge.com/games/fractured-blooms" rel="nofollow"><em>Fractured Blooms</em></a>. Inspired by a true story, the trailer opens on a cosy cottage, before layered whispering and warping of the music begins to give away a more… horrific nature to this story.</p>

<p>At Summer Game Fest, I got to play a demo of <em>Fractured Blooms</em> at an event called The MIX, where indie developers from all over were able to showcase what they were working on.</p>

<p><em>Fractured Blooms</em> markets itself as a psychological life sim where you "Play as Angie, a girl who finds herself stuck in a time loop and a world that is soft and still."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gardening.jpg?itok=F8Tgdr5F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gardening.jpg?itok=qprpqrqF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Farming Simulation?</h2>

<p>Beginning the game, I walked up a path to a pretty house, with an even prettier garden. As you walk, Angie begins to narrate. She talks of the importance of raising the crops, and each step along the way, her narration lends itself to what you should do next.</p>

<p>Visit the garden, pluck a Tomato, place the Tomato in a basket, sow some beet seeds, water them, and then make your way inside to cook dinner.</p>

<p>All the while, you're completing simple tasks, and your stamina in the lower left of the screen slowly ticks away. The narration is simple enough, but as you'd expect from the voice of any little girl whispering in your ear, it's a little unsettling.</p>

<p>Cooking is when things began to go awry. Making sure to chop up the tomato, grab some herbs and meat, put it in a pot and let it cook for 30 seconds was slow and eerie enough, but when strange things began to happen like odd noises from the radio I was on edge.</p>

<p>Heading upstairs, a timer appeared on the screen for Angie to go to sleep, but first, I needed to gather the dirty laundry from the various rooms on the top floor. I would like to say that I was excellent at this, identifying all of the laundry and getting it in the machine well before the timer hit zero, but that just wasn't the case.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-timer.jpg?itok=sjfj6tAP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-timer.jpg?itok=ry9E4EAr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Deeper Secrets Of The House And It's Inhabitants</h2>

<p>Each of the rooms lent to a larger story, coded as if a boy or girl might be living there, and in the main bedroom, there was what I can only describe as the breakdown of reality glowing red and pixelated in the corner. For a house that only Angie is currently living in… there's far more to this story.</p>

<p>Going to bed, well after the timer had hit zero, Angie woke up the next morning, pulling apart reality and starting from the bottom of the hill as I had initially started the demo. This time, as I approached the house, it was far less cute…</p>

<p>A number of changes had taken place. Sinister red plants were growing all over, the sky was darker, and for failing to put away my laundry in time and getting to bed I was starting the day with one less stamina.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-04.jpg?itok=Zcf5lkxH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-04.jpg?itok=YkKyKq8j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Repeating the tasks from the day everything got that much more sinister. While watering the plants they grew in disfiguring ways, while cooking the TV turned on to static and the remote had been thrown half-way across the room, when I walked upstairs I was prepared to load the laundry as soon as possible. <em>Fractured Blooms</em> had other intentions though as it forced me to hide from… something, or hallways became impassable as red roots grew out of the walls.</p>

<p>I didn't load the laundry in time… I went to sleep tired again, fearing the effect on the next day, and almost thankfully, the demo ended.</p>

<p>I stepped away from <em>Fractured Blooms,</em> perplexed. I'm normally quite quick to pick up on a game, and have at least some idea of a direction it's heading. Impressively, all I came away from <em>Fractured Blooms</em> with was doubts and questions.</p>

<p>I wanted to know what could have been different if I had been more successful on the first day? What happened if I planted flowers instead of beets like the narration requested? Where was everyone else from the house, and if what Angie was seeing was real (including the warping portal in her bedroom) then what was the cause of it?</p>

<p>It also didn't help that I was greeted at the end of the demo by Z, the founder of Serenity Forge, who was interested to learn what I thought the game was about. I tried my best to piece together initial thoughts that it was a game about a warring childlike psyche and the negative impacts of the world around it, but that I didn't even have initial guesses about what the story of the house and it's inhabitants were.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gun.jpg?itok=bOMm4Qfk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gun.jpg?itok=XCklIV9m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The very fact that you get a gun at some point just reinforces that I am not aware of what's going on here...</figcaption></figure><p>The amount of time spent in the demo was just enough to pique my interest and now I want to go back in and explore every depth of the full game. Maybe it's just me feeling bitter that I was so confidant about planning a laundry route on the second go around and the game humbled me so intensely?</p>

<h2><em>Fractured Blooms</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Fractured Blooms</em> has all of the makings to be an incredible hit. A relatively smaller scoped world, jam packed with iteration changes, and a deeper story to learn about Angie and her view of the world.</p>

<p>Mechanics are simple enough for anyone to approach, but in order to best manage your resources and the punches that the world is going to throw at you it will demand quick thinking.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning not just how much deeper the story goes, but also the mechanics of growing crops in your garden, gathering them, and preparing meals for yourself, and I truly feel for whoever's story this is inspired by…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ronin-rpg-review-honor-and-chaos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Welcome to the eternal twilight. Death and horror can be found here in abundance, and you won't have to look far. But there's something different about you. The darkness doesn't like you, or what you represent. A small speck of light. A shred of honor. You won't last long. They never do.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> tabletop RPG by Slightly Reckless Games is set on the fictional island of Kage No Shima, in a feudal Japanese setting. The world is under a never-ending eclipse, and the terrors of the night, drawn from myths and legends, have come to take hold. <em>Ronin</em> uses the <em>Mork Borg</em> third-party license and&nbsp;was a successful Kickstarter back in 2023. SRG's latest Kickstarter,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slightlyreckless/ronin-densetsu" rel="nofollow">Rōnin: Densetsu</a><em>,</em> has just funded successfully, adding new accessories and supplements to the game, and for those that missed it, the pledge manager&nbsp;is planned to open on June 13.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ronin-rpg-2.jpg?itok=WigAfNtf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ronin-rpg-2.jpg?itok=JtEhjuf2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ronin</em> is full of art, and each page blends the artwork into the rules or background it presents [Credit - <em>Ronin</em> Rulebook, Slightly Reckless Games].</figcaption></figure><h2>Honor In The Darkness</h2>

<p><em>Ronin</em> uses the <em>Mork Borg</em> third-party license for its rules, which means that the rules for playing are similar, so anyone who's played <em>Mork Borg</em> will pick this up quickly. However, it is also its own entire game, so anyone who hasn't played <em>Mork Borg</em>&nbsp;will still find everything they need here to play. The&nbsp;<em>Ronin</em>&nbsp;rulebook is also as dark and beautifully chaotic as <em>Mork Borg</em>. A never-ending eclipse has darkened the world, bringing madness and terrors with it, and the chaos of the book layout reflects that.</p>

<p>This chaotic layout doesn't reflect the efficiency of how it gets the information across, quite the opposite. The punchy digest-sized <em>Ronin</em> hardcover (or 128-page PDF if you're digitally inclined) delivers the background lore of the setting, details the island of Kage No Shima and its locations, and the main factions that inhabit it, in its punchy first few pages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ronin-rpg-6.jpg?itok=Wv9UODyc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ronin-rpg-6.jpg?itok=68N43SQy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Character death is a part of <em>Ronin</em>, and blends seamlessly into the setting and mechanics&nbsp;[Credit - <a href="https://slightlyrecklessgames.com/pages/free-stuff-ronin" rel="nofollow">Slightly Reckless Games website</a>].</figcaption></figure><h2>Way Of The Sword</h2>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> rules are as light as the background, even for a rules-lite system. There's a single page on tests, essentially just a paragraph saying roll a D20 and add your stat vs the difficulty rating. A couple of pages cover combat, which is also kept super punchy, with the players making a roll for defense when they're attacked, no roll from the GM required. On their turn, there are a couple of attack options, a once-per-combat parry option, and details for fumbles and critical hits.</p>

<p>This simplicity transfers across to enemy details, which has stats for their attacks, armor/hit points, and any special rules they have, and to player characters, who are made up of 5 stats, swiftness, spirit, vigor, resilience and honor, along with their hit points, special rules and equipment.</p>

<p>Most of the stats are used for tests, but the honor stat plays a huge part in <em>Ronin</em>, beyond working out how others interact with you. If your character dies with less than 10 honor, you get a negative modifier to your next character's stats, and with honor 10 or more, a positive modifier. If you commit a dishonorable act, you can commit seppuku, or ritual suicide, by passing a spirit and then a resilience test to regain some honor.</p>

<p>If your character dies, all is not lost, you get 1 chance to win against a powerful demon, being resurrected in success, or dying as normal in defeat. The quickness of character creation should be an indication of how long your characters should expected to survive, and if it's not that obvious, the very first page of the rules is a woe table, where each day, the GM randomly determines a woe that affects the land, and there's only ever 7 rolls.</p>

<p><em>Ronin</em> has 10 different character classes, some drawn from history, others from popular culture. Character creation, and the options including equipment, take up a full quarter of the rulebook, and is by far the lengthiest section. The character class options are:</p>

<ul><li>Forgotten Ronin - The masterless&nbsp;samurai from history</li>
	<li>Eurdite Samurai - A scholarly samurai</li>
	<li>Drunken Monk - A zen master of the drunken kung-fu style</li>
	<li>Corrupted Shinobi - The elite warriors of the night, the ninja</li>
	<li>Onmyoji - Powerful magic users who harness the spirits</li>
	<li>Bakuto - Gambling tricksters</li>
	<li>Yamabushi - Spiritual hermit monks</li>
	<li>Wild Dancer - A katana and revolver-wielding warrior</li>
	<li>Reckless Sumo - The huge and powerful wrestling martial artists</li>
	<li>Sword Saint - A samurai master duelist</li>
</ul><p>Each character class has some modifications to the 4 stats, special abilities that can be chosen or randomly determined, and starting equipment. You can also opt to not use a class and roll up a character yourself using a slightly different set of rules.</p>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> core rulebook ends with details of some common types of enemies and the Blood Rains over the Crimson Jungle introductory adventure, but also currently available are two short Zines. The first, Frozen Tears of the Lady of the Snow, is another adventure for <em>Ronin</em>, and Tales of the Masterless, which contains tables and details for running a game of <em>Ronin</em> solo.</p>

<p>As explained above, because combat (and tests in general) are so simple and don't require rolls from the GM, <em>Ronin</em> plays extremely well solo, and the Tales of the Masterless zine simply gives you the tools to create scenarios quickly. It also provides the tools for the GM to roll up a scenario or dungeon effortlessly to keep the game flowing, and is a fantastic little supplement for both uses.</p>

<p><em>Ronin</em> is a rules-lite, incredibly thematic, samurai-themed apocalyptic RPG. Players should go into this not getting too attached to their characters, but the speed of character creation and play offset the length of character use. The honor system, resurrection, and subsequent character creation rules play very well into the system, and despite its small size, the book is full of details. It's gloriously chaotic, brutal, and a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Because of how lite the system is, it might not be ideal for first-time GMs introducing first-time players to roleplaying. That's not to say it can't be done, and fans of the setting, or related anime, manga, and video games, will make it work with knowledge of the background. The rules-lite nature does make running games very easy (especially if combined with Tales of the Masterless), but some knowledge of roleplaying games and feudal Japan will make it a lot more enjoyable for your players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mighty-boards-announces-art-society-deluxe-edition-kickstarter-alongside-new-board<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> is coming to Kickstarter. The tabletop publisher Mighty Boards is introducing a new and improved version of one of 2024's biggest games, along with a new board game project, at Spiel 2025 and Pax Unplugged.</p>

<h2>The <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> Kickstarter Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> is a revised version of the beloved board game. This edition will feature shinier paintings, wooden gavels, a redesigned storage solution, and a limited-edition game box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/art-society-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=AEYEQ1_a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/art-society-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=6haKfJ2c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The original version of <em>Art Society</em> was designed by Mitch Wallace and featured artwork by Veronica Grassi and Max Kosek. The game has 2-4 players act as art connoisseurs. You would take turns buying art pieces at auctions, then arranging those pieces into a curated gallery. Whoever has the best gallery at the end wins. Easier said than done since no one can predict what art styles will be fashionable in the future.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, details on the <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> are scarce. It is unclear if the campaign will include substantive stretch goals or campaign-exclusive expansion packs. But given the popularity and success of the original game, it is a strong foundation to build upon.</p>

<p>In the same press release, Mighty Boards announced that their newest project, <em>Red North</em>. The game, designed by James Dickinson, is the latest edition of Saer, a Viking-themed strategic card game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/red-north-box-artwork.jpg?itok=2ItBSiyM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/red-north-box-artwork.jpg?itok=3nYZqpNI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players compete through hidden hands of different warrior factions to conquer enemy outposts. But resources are scarce, so players will need to balance their deployed warriors and their reserves for the final round. That final round, called Ragnarok, is the final battle for all of the marbles. A battle so epic that even the Norse Gods are involved on the battlefield.</p>

<p><em>Red North</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $25. If you are attending either Spiel 2025 or Pax Unplugged, you can pick up your ordered copy at that event at no additional charge.</p>

            <p>
Okay, now, I know you've probably read that headline and thought to yourself "why on earth would outdated UI in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> be a good thing?" Allow me to explain! To be a contrarian for a moment, I think that a large amount of triple-A games have incredibly boring UI. It's very much because of that late 2010s trend of simple, emboss-free graphic design you see in logo design everywhere these days, and I hate it. 
</p>

<p>
Silent Hill f, however, as shown off during today's Konami Press Start showcase, looks to have UI that would fit right at home in a PS3 game. It's outdated, technically, but it looks like it's been built with a lot more thought. It's not even particularly complicated - there's a health bar, a stamina bar, some kind of… floral and crescent moon bars. There's a light ugliness about it that I think a lot of games on the PS3 also had, even games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, that I find a lot more appealing than the modern, clean aesthetic you'll see a lot of. Just compare the original Demon Souls and its remake, for example.

<p>
The showcase did also do a bit of a deep dive into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's gameplay, which, as is typical of the series, looks like you'll be swinging around a metal pipe a lot. Game director Al Yang did say the team is hoping to make sure the combat system is "fresh, but familiar, yet also be thematically appropriate and not overly complex."
</p>
<p>
I couldn't tell you if they've done that or not, though it doesn't matter to me all that much. It's not like I come to the Silent Hill series for exciting mechanics, I'm in it for the vibes. And the vibes do look good! There were some brief looks at some concept art, and the team spoke of how they set the game in the Showar era to tap into customs and superstitions "long forgotten in modern life."
</p>
<p>
I'm certainly a lot more interested in Silent Hill f than I am the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">remake of the first game that was also announced</a>. It's the first new entry in years (no I'm not counting Ascension), so if anything I'm morbidly curious as to whether or not the world can actually be expanded in such a way or not. Plus, again, I like how unclean the UI is! I'm a simple person, with simple needs.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f is due out September 25th, later this year.

                <p>Players have discovered the information <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> gives about the stats of its character and karts isn't entirely true, as testing certain combinations of characters and vehicles have produced some surprising results.</p><p>Just as in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/" data-ref-id="5000-167695">Mario Kart 8</a>, Mario Kart World displays basic character and kart information like top speed, acceleration, weight, and handling. These stats are affected by the size of the characters, which are categorized into different unofficial weight classes. Extremely small or light characters, like all of the game's baby characters as well as some others, will have higher acceleration and lower top speeds, while heavy characters like Bowser and Donkey Kong will have higher top speeds but lower acceleration. The game doesn't tell players this outright, but it can be gleaned by selecting the same kart with different characters and seeing how the stat graph changes or stays the same.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_j7KZJbAbk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_j7KZJbAbk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>However, there are seemingly even more hidden stats that the game doesn't tell players about. As highlighted in a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@svcTyler" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">svcTyler</a> on YouTube, it appears some character and kart combinations are simply better than others in specific situations, despite the in-game stat graph showing that they should be identical. According to the video, certain characters and karts secretly perform better on certain types of terrain. Wario, for example, goes faster on paved tracks, while characters like Cow go faster on dirt roads. That means even though Wario and Waluigi are in same weight class, and even if they use the same kart, Wario will always be faster when driving on a normal road.</p><p>Since Nintendo is unlikely to ever give players the data they want outright, more testing will need to be done in the days and weeks ahead to learn which characters and karts excel in which situations. It's a fascinating revelation that adds an interesting wrinkle when it comes to selecting what character and kart to use, as the answer to what is best will depend on the track you're racing on. The question still remains why Nintendo doesn't just put all this secret information in-game for everyone to see, but at least it gives hardcore Mario Kart World players something to pursue in their quest for top times.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">Mario Kart World review</a>, we said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Nintendo Switch 2 launch game</a> expands on almost everything that made Mario Kart 8 such a success, providing a "fun and rewarding kart racing experience that's easy to understand" while still providing "enough mechanical nuance to reward veteran kart racers."</p><p>Secret character stats aren't the only thing Mario Kart World doesn't tell players. It also doesn't disclose <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532291/" data-ref-id="1100-6532291">how to unlock Mirror Mode</a> or that you can actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dodge-blue-shells-in-mario-kart-world-with-this-one-weird-trick/1100-6532191/" data-ref-id="1100-6532191">dodge Blue Shells using the game's new rewind feature</a>.</p>

                <p>PvP is a big part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, Funcom's newly released survival MMO based on Frank Herbert's legendary sci-fi series, and some players have already found a busted strategy that the developers are looking to fix "ASAP."</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening released on June 5 for those who paid for the game's pricier editions (or June 10 for everyone else), and some players have already reached its PvP-focused endgame--the Deep Desert. It's there where the game's most precious resource, Spice, is found, and where players duke it out in large-scale PvP to come out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">As some players have learned the hard way, however, coming out on top can be quite literal, as a new meta involving the game's flying Ornithopter vehicles is seeing helpless players crushed from above over and over again. One player took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dune: Awakening subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) and posted a video of their plight. The video shows user Bombe18 repeatedly crushed by an Ornithopter crashing into the ground. Every time Bombe18 self-revives, they are crushed again, and soon a second Ornithopter shows up to make Bombe18's life even more miserable.</p><p dir="ltr">The video prompted a response from Funcom's Joel Bylos, who responded to the video by stating "Sorry about this. We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP." Bylos didn't go into more detail on what exactly the fix would entail, but players on Reddit seem to agree that Ornithopters should be taking damage from ramming into the ground at high speeds.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening does give players tools to deal with vehicles, such as explosive weaponry. Players being divebombed by Ornithopters could also use a vehicle of their own to try and escape or hit back. That being said, flying vehicles able to crash into the ground with no concern for their own well-being does seem like an issue that needs to be addressed, so it's good to see Funcom is paying close attention.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking to do their own Ornithopter diving runs, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">Dune: Awakening guide on how to unlock and craft vehicles</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/6-beginner-tips-to-help-you-survive-arrakis-in-dune-awakening/2900-6645/" data-ref-id="2900-6645">beginner tips for surviving on Arrakis</a>.

Kris can lead the gang into a closet full of empty gift boxes, and if Kris chooses to examine several of the boxes, Noelle will ask Kris what they're doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To this, Susie reponds, "I mean... gotta admit this room is kinda sus... especially that vent." Noelle then replies, "Haha, nice reference, Susie!" ...though Susie doesn't seem to know what Noelle is talking about ("Huh? ...reference?")</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Susie was, of course, accidentally calling to mind Among Us, both by using the word "sus" and referencing vents, which Among Us players frequently hide in. This has seemingly thrilled the Innersloth social media person, who <a href="https://x.com/AmongUsGame/status/1932974746993557525" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter to say</a>, "AHHHHH AMONG US REFERENCE IN DELTARUNE SKDJDSLSLX;LSKDK IMMA CRASH OUT" followed by "thanks king @tobyfox"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Fox decided to do a little trolling:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/2D52MGxkrD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2D52MGxkrD</a></p>— tobyfox (@tobyfox) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1933018467537727567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">He posted a fake screenshot of Deltarune patch notes, which read:</p><blockquote>We are releasing a hotfix for PC &amp; Mac to remedy some issues occurring in the game. You can confirm the version number on the bottom right of the file select screen.</blockquote><blockquote>Changelist</blockquote><blockquote>Ch4 v.0.0.088 8</blockquote><blockquote>Removed among us</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Innersloth replied with "RESPECT." If it's not apparent, Fox didn't actually remove the reference; he's just goofing around. Funnily enough, this gag is also a silly way to note that Fox has been playing around with version numbers: the 2021 release of chapters 1 and 2 was marked as version 1.0, but instead of chapters 3 and 4 being 2.0, the new release was v.0.0.087.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune chapters 3 and 4 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam">launched last week to immediate skyrocketing popularity on Steam</a>, and our own reviewer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">gave the full game a 9/10</a>, saying that even though the story's only halfway done, "Deltarune's incredible story is already bursting with hilarious charm, unforgettable characters, and an iconic soundtrack that make it worth investing your time in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">A new update has arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. The June 12 patch notes detail several improvements to Grief mode for Zombies. It also addresses a bug for the recently disabled "Numbers" skin for Woods.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the update focuses on multiplayer and Zombies. However, the patch notes address an issue with Season 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/">Essex Model 07 marksman rifle</a>, which previously prevented the rapid fire attachment from working properly in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-call-of-duty-skin-is-broken-and-temporarily-removed/1100-6532174/" data-ref-id="1100-6532174">Numbers operator skin for Frank Woods was disabled</a> for a visual bug, but this update addresses the issue. This means players who own this skin should be able to use it again in both games.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch details several improvements for Grief mode in Zombies, which are designed to help reduce the match length and intensify the rounds. These includes a five-minute cooldown for Gobblegums, a reduction to salvage drops, and the zombies now deal more damage to players. Treyarch says this damage change means it should only take four hits for a player to go down, assuming they have armor and perks. Additionally, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection streaks no longer drop from special and elite enemies, and the crafting of self-revives is now limited to one per player.</p><p dir="ltr">For another positive change, players who are AFK in Grief mode will be kicked from matches more quickly. This seems to be just the beginning of quality-of-life improvements for the mode. "We've got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all griefs more impactful," the developer wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for Black Ops 6 can be found below, as <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-04-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. This marks the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><h2>CALL OF DUTY GLOBAL PATCH NOTES</h2><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>Essex Model 07</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the Rapid Fire Mod was not functioning as intended.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the “Numbers Woods” Operator Skin for Woods would appear bright red in the lobby.</li></ul><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Liberty Falls</b><ul><li>Addressed an exploit with Shock Charges.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><p><strong>Grief:</strong></p><p>Today, we’ve deployed a new round of Grief tuning changes focused on reducing match length and increasing the intensity of each game. The biggest of these changes boosts the threat of the zombies, so even our base zombies feel dangerous early on and only get deadlier as the rounds go up. When the pace of the game increases, so should the danger of making a mistake! With these new damage values, we’re targeting 4 hits to go down for players who've been keeping up with their Perks and Armor buys.</p><p>We’ve also implemented changes to limit players’ ability to extend a match beyond its intended ceiling. Today’s update limits GobbleGum availability by extending the machine’s cooldown to 5 minutes, with more tweaks to GobbleGum usage potentially planned for the future based on player data. Salvage drops have also been reduced from 100 to 50 per pickup, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection can no longer drop from Specials and Elites, and crafting Self-Revives is now limited to 1 per player. This should all result in more intense sessions for everyone... and ideally fewer multi-hour matches!</p><p>Like you, we've also been bummed out by AFK players in our matches and will now kick them out sooner. We’ve got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all Griefs more impactful. Until then, jump in and let us know how these changes are feeling once you’ve gotten a few matches under your belt.</p><p>P.S.: For those unaware, each victory in a Capture Zone awards that team 2,000 Essence, so get on it!</p><ul><li>Enemy-based melee damage against players now escalates faster than Standard Zombies modes.  <ul><li>Starting at Round 1, enemies will do increased melee damage (1.5x) in Grief.</li><li>Enemy melee damage will continue to scale to a maximum scalar (4x) after round 20.</li></ul></li><li>Increased GobbleGum machine cooldown to 5 minutes.</li><li>Salvage pickup value reduced from 100 to 50.</li><li>Self-Revive crafting limit reduced to 1 per player.</li><li>Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection Support items can no longer drop from Special or Elite enemies.</li><li>AFK players are now kicked after 60 seconds of inactivity.</li></ul><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>AS VAL</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue that prevented players from viewing Barrel attachments for the AS VAL.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><b>UI </b></h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the player’s Equipment and Field Upgrade HUD elements could appear grayed-out when another player activated Mutant Injection.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Addressed various stability issues.</li></ul>
