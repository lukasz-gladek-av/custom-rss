            <guid>1385890</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Well, here's a nice piece of news! Fresh off a couple of nominations at The Game Awards, it looks like AdHoc Studio's superhero workplace comedy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> will be flying onto Switch and Switch 2 early next year.</p>
<p>A surprise listing has popped up on the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332">Australian eShop</a> (thanks to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/dispatch-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-early-2026/">Vooks</a> for the heads up), displaying the game and a free Switch 2 upgrade with a planned <strong>29th January</strong> release date.</p>
<p>And hey, this is good news! For those who missed out this year, Dispatch is a new comedy from the writers of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_from_the_borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/wolf_among_us">The Wolf Among Us</a>. It sees you step into the shoes of Robert Robertson (superhero alias, Mecha Man), who's forced to take a job in a superhero dispatch centre after his mech suit is destroyed in battle.</p>
<p>Strategically sending out supes is one thing, but a large part of the game is built around your decisions <em>outside</em> the action, with each choice having the potential to send the story in vastly different directions.</p>
<p>All of this is supported by a <em>stacked</em> voice cast, featuring the likes of <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>'s Aaron Paul, <strong>The Batman</strong>'s Jeffrey Wright, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s Alanah Pearce, <strong>Critical Role</strong>'s Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham and many, <em>many</em> more.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Shape the Story<br>
In Dispatch, every decision you make influences the unfolding narrative. From banter in the breakroom to life-or-death situations in the field, your choices affect your relationships with the heroes, their allegiances, and the path your own story takes.</p>
<p>&gt; Deploy Your Heroes<br>
Use the strategy map to review ongoing emergencies and deploy the right (or wrong) heroes to deal with them. Balance the risks and rewards as you make tactical decisions, knowing that each choice can have lasting consequences for your team and the city.</p>
<p>&gt; Manage Your Roster<br>
Managing heroes sometimes goes beyond their powers. Each hero comes with quirks, flaws, and baggage you’ll need to navigate to keep the team together. Upgrade their skills and unlock abilities to boost their effectiveness in the field.</p>
<p>Blending narrative, strategy, and humor, Dispatch explores what it means to be a hero, whether you're wearing a cape or behind a desk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Launching episodically earlier this year, Dispatch has gone on to rack up over 83,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/#app_reviews_hash">Overwhelmingly Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">Steam</a>. Our good friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/dispatch">Push Square</a> had this to say about the game's PS5 release: "While it's very light on meaningful gameplay, it tells a brilliantly paced, consistently entertaining superhero story that touches on some refreshingly adult themes".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Creepy Jar has released a brand new trailer for its base building survival game StarRupture, giving a positive look at what is a not so great situation. The representative of Claywood Corporation gives a cheery view to the prisoners and exiles of Arcadia 7 on the luxuries they can expect, including accommodation, access to new technology, and nice views. The only disadvantage is the work and the hostile animal life that wants to feed on your base’s resources.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture - &quot;Special Message&quot; Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0GBfgSq_5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Creepy Jar released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/starrupture-gets-10-minutes-of-showcase-footage-showing-gameplay/">10 minutes of showcase footage showing gameplay for StarRupture</a>, which focused on the world of Arcadia 7 and its dangers. Creepy Jar previously released Green Hell, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/11/green-hell-review-spirits-of-amazonia/">in our review</a> Steve said,&nbsp;<em>“Green Hell is a fantastic survival experience with an exemplary sense of place and peril. Creepy Jar have really nailed the feeling of loneliness and despair that true isolation would lead to and married this to some well balanced challenges and a refreshingly user friendly approach. The range of ways to play are really welcome and should ensure that even those players who may be turned off by the rigours of hunger and thirst mechanics can enjoy the immersive jungle experience. This may not be a welcoming jungle, but there’s plenty of fun and games to be had.”</em></p>

<p>StarRupture will launch into Steam Early Access on January 6th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Visual Design]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/game-of-the-year-2025-best-visual-design/</link>
            <guid>1385884</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Welcome back to our Game of the Year picks for 2025 as we look to hand out our gong for Best Visual Design. Every year, this ends up being a heavily contested category, always swinging between games that impress in terms of sheer fidelity, pushing gaming hardware to the very limit, and titles with peerless art direction that seek to do more with less. More often than not, the winner strikes a deft balance between the two, as proved by this year’s winner…</p>

<p>We’ve always had somewhat of a soft spot for all things <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/03/01/review-journey-ps3/">Journey</a>. We’re also big fans of anything developer Giant Squid puts their name to, the studio’s previous games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/09/abzu-review/">Abzû</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/10/the-pathless-review-ps4-ps5-xbox-mobile/">The Pathless</a> – have a distinct Journey-like quality to them. So, naturally, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/sword-of-the-sea-review/">Sword of the Sea</a> almost feels tailor-made for us here at TSA, coming full circle with Journey’s art director, Matt Nava, joining forces with Giant Squid for a visually stunning jaunt through carefully crafted vistas.</p>


<p>These games shred dialogue and exposition, presenting their stories through striking set pieces and multi-layered worlds that flit between calmly isolating and full of life. As you play Sword of the Sea, you’ll venture through familiar deserts as well as ruins, and snowy mountains, the hero’s trusty blade capable of transforming these areas into thriving aquariums teeming with enchanting sea life. It’s yet another gorgeous game from Giant Squid and a worthy winner of this year’s award for Best Visual Design.</p>
<h3>Lumines Arise –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>When it comes to the rhythm action genre visuals can be just as important as audio, as proven by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/">Lumines Arise</a>. It may not be quite as entrancing and new-feeling as developer Enhance’s previous game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/16/tetris-effect-connected-review-xbox-series-x/">Tetris Effect</a>, but it comes pretty close, pairing catchy tracks with immersive stage backgrounds and visual effects timed perfectly to match the player’s button presses. Together, these elements offer that near hypnotic sensory experience that elevates the Lumines formula and adds prestige to what started off as a gem for the PlayStation Portable.</p>

<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>Grabbing its second podium finish in this year’s Game of the Year awards, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> really is the full package. Aside from its gripping, emotional narrative and smart evolution of the turn-based RPG formula, it also boasts some of this year’s most jaw-dropping visual set pieces.</p>
<p>Making smart use of ready-made assets for environments and scenery, to let the team put their efforts toward the more impactful “hero assets”, Sandfall conjured up a&nbsp;distinct dream-like surrealness that gives Expedition 33 its own identity, galvanised by Art Nouveau and Belle Époque influences. It breaks free of fantasy and steampunk tropes, imbuing every aspect – from character designs to battle menus – with a masterfully curated touch.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/17/keeper-review/">Keeper</a></li>
<li>Once Upon A Katamari</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you come back tomorrow, for another aspect and accomplishment of game making to be featured.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/speedrunners-creators-are-back-with-new-game-sprint-city/</link>
            <guid>1385881</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The original creators behind Speedrunners, Casper &amp; Gert-Jan, have announced Sprint City which is being developed by Second Stage Games. Sprint City looks very much like a successor to Speedrunners, though there is also a Speedrunners 2 in development by Fair Play Labs. It seems 2026 will be the year of sprinting for games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sprint City | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2M4SkQLFRGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Co-Owner &amp; Game Designer at Second Stage Studio, Casper van Est, said <em>“With Sprint City, we wanted to focus on what we love most in games and what we’re best at, which is pure movement. It’s a shared world multiplayer experience built around how good it can feel just to move around, so we worked really hard on a satisfying game feel and a visual style that never gets in the way of that.”</em></p>
<p>In Sprint City, up to eight players can race against each other or free roam across different courses in the city, using wall runs and grapples to keep momentum going. Additionally, anyone who owns Sprint City will be able to invite friends in to play the game, even if they themselves do not own it. In multiplayer there will be leaderboards to climb as you aim to become the best sprinter in Sprint City.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no confirmed release date for Sprint City, but it is due to enter Steam Early Access in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sonos Offloads Ace ANC Headphones With Spatial Audio, Apple and Bose Suddenly Look Overpriced]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-ace-anc-headphones-with-spatial-audio-apple-and-bose-suddenly-look-overpriced-2000654149</link>
            <guid>1385854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium noise-cancelling headphones flood the market with excellent options from Apple, Sony, Bose, and now Sonos, which means choosing between them often comes down to price rather than dramatic performance differences.</p>
<p>The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/">Amazon currently offers the Sonos Ace at a record low of $279, slashed from its typical $399 price tag</a> which makes this the most affordable these headphones have ever been since their launch. If you’re already invested in the Sonos ecosystem or simply appreciate the brand’s reputation for audio quality, this deal removes the premium pricing barrier that kept many potential buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dynamic head tracking for spatial audio that really works</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dolby Atmos feature on the Sonos Ace gives you spatial audio that surrounds you</strong> with three-dimensional soundscapes instead of just sending stereo sound to your ears. Dynamic head tracking keeps track of how your head moves and changes the audio positioning so that sounds stay in their virtual places even when you turn or tilt your head: This technology changes how you listen to movies, immersive music mixes, and video game audio by giving you a sense of space and direction that regular stereo headphones can’t.</p>
<p>Bluetooth lossless audio streaming keeps the full quality of your music files without the artifacts that come with<strong> regular Bluetooth codecs and for truly lossless digital audio, you can also connect via USB-C</strong>. This is great for high-resolution music files or studio-quality recordings when you want the best sound quality possible. This dual connectivity method lets you choose between ease of use and the best sound quality, depending on where you’re listening and what you’re listening to.</p>



<p><strong>Active noise cancellation</strong> does a great job of blocking out outside sounds, even better than most of the products from Sony and Bose. The world-class ANC system easily blocks out noise from airplane cabins, coffee shops, streets, and offices, so you can fully focus on your audio content or just enjoy the quiet when you need a break from all the noise. When you need to hear announcements, have conversations, or stay aware of your surroundings for safety, transparency mode lets environmental sounds in which keeps you from feeling too isolated.</p>
<p>With Active Noise Cancellation turned on,<strong> the battery lasts for 30 hours</strong> which is enough for a whole week of commuting to work or weeks of casual listening between charges. The rapid charging feature lets you listen for three hours after just three minutes of being plugged in. This means that even a short charging session during a coffee break will give you enough power for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>You can easily switch between devices so you can go from watching a movie on your tablet to taking a call on your phone without having to go into Bluetooth settings and disconnect and reconnect. The headphones remember multiple paired devices and switch between them automatically based on which device needs sound at the time. When you use multiple devices throughout the day, this feature gets rid of the annoyance of having to pair them all the time, which is a problem with many wireless headphones.</p>
<p>At $279 instead of $399, you’re saving $120 on headphones that compete with flagship models from established audio brands that often cost even more at full retail price. The Sonos Ace delivers premium features like lossless audio, Dolby Atmos with head tracking, world-class ANC, and 30-hour battery life at a price that now undercuts many competitors that offer similar or inferior specifications.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="638">While many gamers have long wished for an official handheld Xbox console, it seems unlikely that Microsoft will make that dream a reality anytime soon. However, Asus is offering something very close with the release of the updated ROG Ally, now sporting official Xbox branding. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is a new handheld gaming device designed to compete with the likes of the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch 2. Though it launched less than two months ago, it’s already available at a significant discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/">Originally priced at $600, the device is now 18% off, bringing it down to $489—a savings of $111 so soon after its debut.</a></p>
<p data-start="640" data-end="971">What makes this revised version of the ROG Ally stand out from its predecessor? The most notable updates include the integration of an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and a redesigned Windows operating system, which aims to enhance the user interface, making navigation smoother and more responsive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="973" data-end="1001">Play Xbox Games Anywhere</h2>
<p data-start="1003" data-end="1631">The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is a portable gaming handheld that offers access to your entire PC game library on the go. Boot straight into your games with the new Xbox App UI and even stream Xbox titles directly from your console or via Microsoft’s cloud gaming service. The device also gives you access to the Xbox Game Bar with a dedicated Xbox button on the left side. While it’s optimized for Xbox games, the ROG Xbox Ally also supports platforms like Steam, the Epic Games Store, and other digital storefronts, so you’re not confined to Xbox-exclusive content.</p>
<p data-start="1633" data-end="1890">In terms of specifications, <strong>the ROG Xbox Ally features 16GB of dual-channel RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSD</strong>. If you find yourself running out of storage space for your growing game library, the device’s storage is upgradeable, allowing for easy expansion.</p>


<p data-start="1892" data-end="2459">The 7-inch screen boasts 1080p HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, placing it on par with other premium handheld devices like the Steam Deck. At just under 1.5 pounds, the ROG Xbox Ally is lightweight, maintaining a comparable weight to its main competitor from Valve. Its chassis design is inspired by the Xbox wireless controller, offering contoured grips that provide improved comfort during extended gaming sessions. Whether you’re playing on the go or connecting it to a TV using the dual USB-C ports, the ROG Xbox Ally gives you flexibility for a variety of gaming setups.</p>
<p data-start="2461" data-end="2685">To ensure long-lasting gameplay, the handheld comes equipped with a 60Wh battery that supports rapid charging. With just 30 minutes of charging, you can reach up to 50% battery life, so you can get back to your game quickly.</p>
<p data-start="2687" data-end="2967">The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is positioning itself as a top contender in the portable gaming market and with the current holiday discount, now’s a very appealing time to jump in.</p>
<p data-start="2969" data-end="3324" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For those who want even more power, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is available as an upgraded model. This version features a more powerful processor, additional RAM, and a 1TB SSD—doubling the base model’s storage capacity. It also includes an 80Wh battery for extended playtime, making it an excellent choice for gamers seeking a high-end handheld experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dispatch is coming to Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on January 29, 2026, according to an Australian eShop listing. </p>



<p>The new episodic adventure from AdHoc Studios, Dispatch, quickly found popularity among gamers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-two-million-copies-adhoc-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching 2 million copies sold in less than a month</a>. The title was also called the Game of the Year <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by The Witcher 3’s director</a>. Now, the developers are expanding the title’s reach, bringing it to more platforms. </p>







<h2 id="h-dispatch-arriving-for-switch-and-switch-2-in-january-2026">Dispatch Arriving for Switch and Switch 2 in January 2026</h2>



<p>Although we are yet to receive an official announcement for Dispatch’s release on the Switch and Switch 2, we already know the launch date. Spotted by <a href="https://www.vooks.net/dispatch-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>, the Australian Nintendo <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/aocs/70050000064441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eShop</a> has been updated with a new listing for Dispatch with the January 2026 release date.

                <p>It's no secret that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/" data-ref-id="1100-6536893">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hasn't sold as well as 2024's Black Ops 6</a>, and now Circana has released more sales data that speaks to the performance of the military shooter.</p><p>Black Ops 7 was the No. 1 best-selling game in North America for November, but the Call of Duty franchise experienced a double-digit percent decrease for full-game dollar sales compared to November 2024. Last year's game, Black Ops 6, was released in October. Despite the sales downturn, this marks the 18th straight year that a new Call of Duty game has ranked No. 1 for its launch month. For anyone keeping score, that streak began with 2008's Call of Duty: World at War.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is now the No. 7 best-selling game of 2025 so far, with EA's Battlefield 6 continuing to rank No. 1 for the year. For November, Black Ops 7 was No. 1, followed by Battlefield 6, NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and EA Sports FC 26 rounding out the top five for the month.</p><p>The Circana report doesn't tell the whole story of Black Ops 7's sales performance, as the company only tracks sales in North America. Additionally, Black Ops 7 is available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, which eats into full-game sales. For 2024's Black Ops 6, a report estimated that Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">lost out on $300 million in revenue due to Game Pass.</a></p><p>Microsoft no doubt also saw upside, too, though, with new sign-ups for Game Pass and engagement. To that end, Call of Duty--as a collective franchise spanning multiple titles--will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">finish 2025 as the No. 1 franchise for Xbox Game Pass.</a></p><p>In other news, Activision has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years.</a></p><p>It is rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-modern-warfare-4-rumors-cod-dev-says-not-to-believe-everything-on-the-internet/1100-6537000/" data-ref-id="1100-6537000">2026's new Call of Duty game is Modern Warfare 4 from developer Infinity Ward</a>, though this is not confirmed.</p>

                <p>Circana released its monthly sales report for November today, shining a light on how the North American video game business is performing. Hardware sales had a particularly difficult month, with sales falling 27%, from $949 million in November 2024 to $695 million in November 2025.</p><p>November 2025 represented the lowest hardware spending total for a November month since November 2005 ($455 million). A total of 1.6 million game hardware units were sold in North America for November 2025, and that's the lowest since November 1995 (1.4 million units).</p><p>While total unit sales dropped, the average price paid for a new game console reached a new record high for a November month, rising to $439, up 11% compared to November 2024. The higher average selling price is connected to the price increases that companies like Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, and others have implemented this year due to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>For November 2025, Sony's PS5 ranked No. 1 for both unit sales and dollar sales--it's the first time the PS5 is back on top since the Switch 2 came out in June. The Switch 2, meanwhile, landed at No. 2 for unit and dollar sales in November 2025, with the Nex Playground coming in third for hardware units sold. Xbox Series X|S ranked No. 3 for dollar sales in November 2025.</p><p>In terms of software sales for November 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-sales-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6537040/" data-ref-id="1100-6537040">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 ranked No. 1 for the month</a>, extending Call of Duty's streak to 18 years in a row where the franchise has debuted in the top spot for its release month. However, Call of Duty franchise sales experienced double-digit declines.</p><p>For 2025 so far, EA's Battlefield 6 is still the year's best-selling game in North America.</p>

That's why this update brings a number of new building parts, including the ability to change the color of building pieces and the "much-requested triangular pieces." The building menu UI has also been redesigned and reformatted into a list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not all. Melee combat has been improved to make it "more viable and fun," and now, when summoning a raid boss at the Summoning Altar, players can choose to either fight at their base as before, or take on the raid boss in a special Raid Area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These Raid Areas allow you to fight with all your might, without risking any damage to your base," the team explained. "You can build temporary structures and take items into these special Raid Areas." Which is just as well, as a new raid boss will also pop up after the update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"2025 has been an incredible year for Palworld, and we’re excited to end the year with v0.7, Home Sweet Home!" Pocketpair exclaimed. "The purpose of this update is to begin improving existing features, and while this update may not be as content-rich as previous ones, we hope players understand that it’s necessary for us to begin laying the groundwork now as we work on the development of Palworld 1.0."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last but definitely not least, PvP! Though the studio admits PvP has been a topic of discussion in the Palworld community for a "long time," and it’s "hard to fully integrate PvP into the game," it is trying to make the dream a reality, albeit with some careful parameters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are releasing all the necessary tools for players to set up their own PvP rules on their own terms," Pocketpair said. "Show off your skills and compete with other Pal Tamers! Please note that PvP is experimental, and as such, there may be some balancing issues."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld v0.7 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">ULTRAKILL Collab!</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added V1 and V2 armor sets!

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/farming-simulator-signature-edition</link>
            <guid>1385788</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161165/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>My pigs are starving and I do not know how to feed them.</p>
<p>The pig feed is ready to pick up at the shop, but I don’t know where the shop is. Once I find the correct establishment, I need to figure out how to pick up the pallets of food and take them back to my emaciated swine.</p>
<p>Later, after I purchased a front loader and the appropriate bucket attachment, I take the feed back to my farm. Then comes another problem. How do I actually deposit it in the trough?</p>
<p>As a casual guest in the world of simulators, having only played <strong>Train</strong> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/euro_truck_simulator_2">Euro Truck Simulator</a> for short spells, I must admit I was a bit overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/farming-simulator-signature-edition">Farming Simulator: Signature Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> will recognise the setup straight away. Your grandfather is getting a bit long in the tooth and wants to leave you in charge of his agricultural empire. It is up to you to tend the land, reap, sow, and explore the surrounding community.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161175/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike Stardew, this is not a cutesy, cosy life sim. Instead, it is a meticulously designed and realistic depiction of farming life. There is more painstaking attention to detail in a single combine harvester here than there is in most racing games.</p>
<p>After your grandfather takes you through a brief tutorial tour, you are free to tackle your life as a farmer in any way you desire. My immediate compulsion was towards animal husbandry, which, as mentioned, was far more complex than I imagined.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of the best things about these games is that there is no one way to play. The map, of which there are several to choose from, is a surprisingly biodiverse collection of land plots and population centres.</p>
<p>You are free to begin your career from scratch or as a mature farmer. Either way, the core loop of the game is in engaging with its many systems of commerce to earn a profit. Seasonal variation, layout, and topography vary between the maps, but everything else remains the same. You trade with the same collection of NPCs and the overwhelming contents of the in-game stores are the same regardless of career choice.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161163/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a newcomer, I chose to start a farm from scratch. There is a guided tutorial of sorts, but it only scratches the surface of the myriad systems at play. From there, I had to look up almost every aspect of farm life. While series veterans may not find the early hours as obtuse as I did, these kinds of games would still benefit from putting information more front and centre.</p>
<p>That said, there is a wealth of accessibility and quality-of-life options available throughout your farming adventures. Almost every task can be completed by an AI farmhand, who will cultivate fields, deliver yields, and handle all the repeatable work that you are too rich to bother with after reaching a certain level of maturity.</p>
<p>These simulators can be as simple or as complex as you make them, but there are still lots of plates to spin. On any given day cycle, you'll be keeping an eye on the calendar to grow crops at the optimal time, managing your animal produce, and steadily growing your empire to make grandfather proud. Then there is the farm equipment itself, each machine having a different purpose and slight variation on how to drive and control them. Every single task in Farming Simulator requires a specific tool to undertake. The late game almost becomes a collectathon as you populate your farm with a fleet of shiny tractors and attachments.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161174/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This kind of time sink is tailor-made for Switch. The just-one-more-hour compulsion and cyclical routine feel perfect for long trips in handheld mode, or for docked couch sessions. It is exactly the sort of game that fits the platform’s strengths.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, then, that the optimisation of this Switch 2 port is sorely lacking in places. General image fidelity is solid between modes, but performance is wildly unpredictable. The game struggles to hold a steady 30fps in both docked and undocked modes.</p>
<p>Some areas, particularly your hub farm, tank the frame rate considerably. Elsewhere, there are frequent graphical glitches and bugs. For me, this involved excessive clipping into terrain and loss of vehicle control. There aren't even any Switch 2 native additions to the experience, with mouse controls sadly missing. Touchscreen is present across all functionality, which, for a game where you spend most of your time in menus, is a mercy.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161168/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Audio is sharp, particularly in the sounds of the machinery, which are as distinct as their visual rendering. If you don't want to hear the endless chug of a tractor engine, there's a selection of original music on the in-game radio. Why not listen to chip tune anthems while cutting down deadwood?</p>
<p>The appeal of Farming Simulator is obvious, even from the perspective of a fledgling land tiller like myself. However, the uneven technical presentation will ultimately compromise anyone willing to sink a few hundred hours into the experience, especially if Giants Software does not find a way to patch in some much-needed stability.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Farming Simulator arrives on Switch 2 in a familiar state for returning fans. While newcomers will face an early spike of confusion before eventually settling into the addictive routine of virtual agriculture, veterans will immediately feel at home. Unfortunately, technical issues with the port will blight the careers of both camps.</p></section>

Adhoc Studios still aren't sure whether they'll make a second season of Dispatch, their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-superhero-comedy-dispatch-a-million-selling-success-story-it-could-be-that-weekly-release-schedule">startlingly popular</a> Telltale-style superhero comedy adventure, but they're thinking about it very "seriously". In brief, they're not confident they can bottle the lightning twice, especially if they want to release another season before 2032.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Dispatch's first season took seven years to develop, thanks partly to being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xdefiant-was-apparently-born-from-the-ashes-of-a-splinter-cell-game-being-made-by-the-team-behind-dispatch">dropped by its publisher part-way through</a>. Discussing that tortured development in a just-published interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">Eurogamer</a>'s Robert Purchese, game director Nick Herman says there were "zero expectations for Season 1 - external expectations. People just had to show up and enjoy it and not have a bunch of theories and stuff in their head." 
</p>
<p>
The same won't be true next time round, of course, and the developers are already finding the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/telltale-and-the-boys-make-mostly-beautiful-love-in-dispatch-a-slick-and-surprisingly-tactical-superhero-comedy">enthusiasm</a> for a follow-up a bit daunting. "People are mad that we haven't told them what we're doing," Herman told EG. "It's the new problem, right? It's like, are you doing it? Are you not doing it? We're days away from really sitting down and having the time - because we've had to support the game - where we're going to really sit down and lay those plans out." 
</p>
<p>
In the same retrospective natter, lead writer Pierre Shorette drew a parallel with music, commenting that "you have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second. And there's a little bit of that feeling." 
</p><p>
"We had so long with this - seven years is a lot of time," he went on. "If anything, it would have been embarrassing if it was bad. I mean, you took fucking long enough! We're taking GTA 6 amounts of time on this shit, you know - it better be good. I know we're not going to have that amount of time for Season 2 because we want to meet the demand."

I would play another season of Dispatch, though I'd like a change of protagonist. That said, I also couldn't fault Adhoc for hanging up their capes, retiring their mystic amulets and trying something new. Seven years is a long time to spend thinking about the likes of Waterboy.

              <p>Yes, in 2025, we here at <em>Kotaku</em> played a lot of video games. But we don’t just play video games every day. No, we all enjoy other forms of entertainment beyond interactive digital video games. And this year, we’ve decided to sit down and put together a list, in no particular order, of some of our favorite movies, books, podcasts, shows, and other non-gaming things we enjoyed in 2025. And please, let us know what non-video-game art and entertainment you loved this year in the comments below!</p> <h2><b><i>Star Wars: Andor </i></b><b>Season 2 – TV show</b></h2>  <p><span>When Disney announced a</span><i><span> Star Wars</span></i><span> TV show all about Cassian Andor</span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>from</span><i><span> Rogue One,</span></i><span> I remember barely caring at all. “Cool, I guess that dude from </span><i><span>Rogue One</span></i><span> gets a show, too.” Then I watched Season 1 in 2022 and was completely enthralled by its depiction of rebellion and fascism.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-ending-vgchat-star-wars-rogue-one-10-12-1851780720">This year’s season two was even better,</a> featuring more moments than I can count that made me sit up in my chair, hold my breath, and wait for the next scene or piece of dialogue to either break me or let me cheer. I say this as someone who loves the franchise dearly: </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>has never really been this good before, and it will likely never reach these heights again. And that’s fine. </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>can keep being a campy sci-fi series about space wizards that kids love, because we can always rewatch </span><i><span>Andor </span></i><span>whenever we want.&nbsp; </span><i><span>-Zack Zwiezen</span></i></p>

 <h2><b><i>My Perfect Console </i></b><b>– Podcast</b></h2>  <p><span>I listen to way too many podcasts. Especially video game podcasts. I read and write about video games all day. I play as many games as I can at night and on the weekends. And then I squeeze video game podcasts into all the other quiet moments: cooking, clean-up, driving in between errands. No gaming podcast this year has kept me as consistently entertained nor taught me as much as Simon Parkin’s </span><i><span>My Perfect Console</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The veteran game journalist interviews creators from all different backgrounds, including developers, about their favorite games; the ones that have meant the most to them throughout their lives or played pivotal roles in important moments. It’s an excellent premise for learning about some of the medium’s forgotten classics as well as the gaming luminaries who took meaning and inspiration away from them. It helps that Parkin is such a generous host who works so diligently to create space for members of a notoriously secretive industry to feel comfortable enough to divulge personal tastes and fascinating biographical details we would otherwise probably never get to learn about. – Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>It Was Just an Accident </i></b><b>– Movie</b></h2>  <p><span>Jafar Panahi might be the bravest filmmaker in the world. He’s certainly an artist of unwavering moral conviction. The Iranian director has repeatedly made films that have been censored or banned in his home country, and he’s continued making movies in defiance of the government, even when he’s been ordered to stop. His latest film, </span><i><span>It Was Just an Accident</span></i><span>, is a work of astounding humanity, moral complexity, suspense, and even humor. Affable mechanic Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri) feels his traumatic past flooding back when a man he believes once tortured him in an Iranian prison visits his garage in need of auto repairs. Overcome with anger at what he suffered under his former tormentor, he kidnaps the man with plans to kill him, only to find that he’s not absolutely positive the man he’s captured is the man he thinks he is, and so he can’t bring himself to do it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What follows is a journey to track down some of his fellow former prisoners and see if any of them can positively identify his captive as the one who tortured them all, all those years ago. It becomes a kind of loose, rollicking road movie that’s at times suspenseful, at times funny, and that’s always grappling with the question of what its characters should do with the memories that haunt them and the anger they so justifiably feel. In a way, this film makes an excellent companion piece to&nbsp;<em>Andor</em>, whose praises Zack sang above and which was essential viewing for me as well. That show offers a stirring depiction of the struggle against fascism and oppression. This film explores how those who suffer under such forces aren’t simply liberated the day they walk out of the prison gates, how the harm done by those in power can cast an enduring shadow over the lives of those who experience it.&nbsp;– Carolyn Petit</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>KPop Demon Hunters </i></b><b>– Movie</b></h2>  <p><span><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> had a bigger chokehold on my life than most things in 2025. Its infectious banger of a soundtrack was at the top of my Spotify Wrapped, I saw it three times in theaters, and I even hijacked my friend’s wedding party to watch it with everyone while they were hungover. I’m also planning on holding my family hostage and making them watch it over the holidays. The anime-inspired visuals and fight choreography set to Ejae’s incredible songs would capture anybody’s heart, but I’m still a sad gay boy at heart who loves a self-acceptance story, so Rumi’s inner struggle with her literal demons struck me right in my core. Months later, I still get choked up listening to “What It Sounds Like,” long after it passed the 700 plays mark on my Spotify. -Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b>Dallas Taylor’s YouTube Channel – Online Video Series</b></h2>  <p><span>I’m not a podcast person. Never have been. Never will be. Just can’t do it. So I had no idea who Dallas Taylor was when my YouTube algorithm fed me one of his videos about all the effort and tech that goes into making </span><i><span>Jeopardy! </span></i><span>sound good on TV. He has a </span><a href="https://www.20k.org/"><span>really popular podcast about audio</span></a><span>, apparently!</span></p> <p><span>Anyway, this is the shit I </span><i><span>love</span></i><span>. I’m the guy who watches all the behind-the-scenes footage on DVDs. And if you, too, are someone who loves looking behind the curtain and meeting the people who make the stuff you love and seeing how it all happens, I highly recommend checking out Taylor’s channel. He’s gone behind the scenes of how </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAmaQBlDsVw"><span>everything is recorded during an MLB game</span></a><span>, how </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlmK-QCLthI"><i><span>SNL </span></i><span>mixes its shows live</span></a><span>, and he </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Onja4f9Qfw&amp;pp=2AbAAw%3D%3D"><span>even talked to the guy who handles all the music in </span><i><span>Bluey</span></i></a><span>. These videos are sooooo good, and whenever a new one appears in my feed, I watch it instantly. -Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2>Hayley Williams’&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party – </i>Album</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@spotifypodcasts/video/7334031948316282117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.tiktok.com/@spotifypodcasts/video/7334031948316282117" data-sk="tooltip_parent">There’s an interview with Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams</a> in which she talks about how, when she’s asked to do features for other artists, she feels limited because people probably want the pop-punk version of her that sang “Misery Business” almost 20 years ago. Thankfully, Williams’ solo albums have been a pretty incredible outlet for the singer to play in whatever genre calls to her. She stays pretty firmly in the realm of pop on <i data-stringify-type="italic">Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party</i>, but the queen of pop punk croons, grooves, and wails over some of her most soulful work yet.</p> <p><i data-stringify-type="italic">Ego Death&nbsp;</i>is a 20-song confessional piece that has Williams exposing every wound she’s suffered and battle she’s faced in her nearly 37 years with the artistic abandon of someone who has gotten too big to care what any pop-punk purist might want from her. It’s her party, she’ll channel SZA’s soulful flow if she wants to. – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><b><i>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc </i></b><b>– Anime</b></h2>  <p><span>I hadn’t watched any <em>Chainsaw Man</em> before going to see the feature-length movie in theaters. There was initially not nearly enough actual <em>Chainsaw Man.</em> Then there was very quickly way too much of it. I loved every second. It’s jubilantly excessive at every moment, in every way, except for a handful of strikingly low-key scenes that are touchingly orchestrated. </span><i><span>Reze Arc</span></i><span> starts off with a wonderful montage of characters spending all day at the movies and winds down with Denji riding a demon shark sidekick around a city destroying a hurricane. No one has ever rendered an adolescent wet dream with such absurd detail and so many exuberant flourishes before.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I saw a surprising number of movies in theaters in 2025. Most of them were fun but forgettable schlock like </span><i><span>Tron: Ares</span></i><span> and <em>The </em></span><i><span>Running Man</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Reze Arc</span></i><span> proved why commercial cinema is still worth preserving. Heartbreak, especially between anime demons, does indeed feel better in a place like that. -Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Severance – </i></b><b>TV Show</b></h2>  <p><span>Damn, </span><i><span>Severance</span></i><span>’s second season feels like it was a lifetime ago. I might as well have been severed myself for how distant I feel from when everyone was glued to Apple TV for a few weeks before promptly canceling their subscriptions. I’m glad I waited to watch the Adam Scott-led dystopian workplace drama, because if I had seen the end of season one and had to wait three years for the second, I would have grown bitter and full of resentment. But my god, what a show. </span></p>

 <p><span>I know season three is on its way, but I still think it would have been a bold move to end it on the tragic, bittersweet irony of season two’s finale. A group of abused workers taking their agency back by force and turning their backs on their “outies,” who view them as less than people, and choosing to run away into the darkness of a sterile office in hopes of just a few more seconds together? Goddamn, that shit still hits. I got misty-eyed writing that. Go watch </span><i><span>Severance</span></i><span> if you haven’t. – </span><span>Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>Universes Beyond: Final Fantasy&nbsp; </i></b><b>– Trading Cards</b></h2>  <p><span>Everyone mocks the branded crossover until it comes for them. </span><i><span>The Simpsons</span></i><span> in </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> in </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Street Fighter</span></i><span> in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>, all trash. <em>Final Fantasy</em> in <em>Magic: The Gathering,</em> on the other hand, 100 percent unfathomable magic, like the splitting of the atom. I’ve been an on-again-off-again </span><i><span>MTG</span></i><span> player dating back to 2000. Life and CCG burnout always prevent me from getting pulled too far out from shore.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>No set has brought me back like the<em> Final Fantasy Universes Beyond</em> collaboration, though. The card designs are superb and the art is, mostly, fantastic. It’s an excellent celebration of both my favorite RPG franchise and my favorite real-life card game, one that’s rewards both physical collecting and casual play and buildcrafting online. Few toys have managed to bring me as much joy as an adult as flipping Exdeath, Void Warlock over once my graveyard fills up. -Ethan Gach</span></p>  <h2><em>Game Changer</em> – TV Show</h2>  <p>One of the best things I watched in 2025 wasn’t on Netflix, ABC, HBO, or Amazon Prime. Instead, it was on an indie comedy streaming network built from the ruins of <em>College Humor.</em> I’m of course talking about Dropout’s fantastic and twisted “game show,”<em> Game Changer.</em></p>

 <p>Each episode this season tossed unexpected curveballs at its comedian contestants and then let us, the paying subscribers, watch them turn pain, confusion, and trickery into comedy gold. You should definitely pay for a few months of Dropout and watch <em>Game Changer</em>‘s most recent season, as well as all of its past seasons. Then, when you finish with that, you can hop over to the other great Dropout show, <em>Make Some Noise</em>, and watch some of the funniest people improvise tiny scenes and characters on the spot. It’s awesome stuff, and in a year filled to the brim with horrific bullshit and slop, friends making themselves laugh via outlandish situations is exactly what the doctor ordered. Also, I should get a new doctor. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2><b><i>Heat 2 </i></b><b>– Novel</b></h2>  <p><span>This book came out a few years ago, but I read it this year, so damn it, I’m putting it on this list! Michael Mann’s </span><i><span>Heat</span></i><span>, the acclaimed 1995 crime epic starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, wasn’t exactly crying out for a sequel. After all (spoilers), one of the leads dies at the end, so you’d think the film’s central dynamic—the tension between a dogged cop and the skilled criminal he’s pursuing—has nowhere else to go. But </span><i><span>Heat 2</span></i><span>, which is a novel, not a film, is no conventional sequel. Rather than just continuing the story of the movie, it expands outward in both directions, letting us see who characters like Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna were </span><i><span>before </span></i><span>the events of the film, and letting us see what happens to the survivors afterward.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re a fellow admirer of Michael Mann, you know that he has a style, a visual sensibility that gives his movies a particular (and in my opinion, beautiful) aesthetic. What’s remarkable about </span><i><span>Heat 2</span></i><span>, which Mann co-wrote with crime novelist Meg Gardiner, is how it somehow seems to capture Mann’s sensibilities as a filmmaker, but in literary form. There’s a vividness to the imagery and a kind of shimmering but muscular poetry to the writing that gives the storytelling a distinctive identity. </span></p> <p><span>What’s more, you can really tell just how well Mann knows and understands these characters. There are so many moments here in which Hanna, or Chris Shiherlis (played by Val Kilmer in the movie), or some other character from the film says something that I could vividly see and hear the character saying because it rang so true to them as they were portrayed in the movie. Apparently </span><i><span>Heat 2 </span></i><span>is now in pre-production as a movie, but if you’re a </span><i><span>Heat </span></i><span>fan, don’t wait for this one to hit the cineplex to find out more about Neil’s tragic past and what wild shit Chris gets into after the first movie’s big heist goes sideways. You can watch the sequel on the amazing movie screen in your mind right now! – Carolyn Petit</span></p> <h2><b><i>The Day the Earth Blew Up </i></b><b>– Movie</b></h2>  <p><span>I’m so damn happy that someone stepped in and saved </span><i><span>The Day the Earth Blew Up.</span></i><span> This </span><i><span>Looney Tunes</span></i><span> animated movie was exactly what I needed in the dark year that was 2025. Porky and Daffy getting up to wild shenanigans in a glorious animated throwback to classic cartoons was such a splendid treat for me. </span><span>I still can’t believe that in 2025 I walked into a movie theater, sat down, and watched a brand new 2D animated</span><i><span> Looney Tunes </span></i><span>movie. And guess what? It’s really good and super funny. This might never happen again. I’m glad I got to experience it. </span><i><span>-Zack Zwiezen&nbsp;</span></i></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forza Motorsport Video Review In Progress</p>
      </div>
<p>First released in 2023, Forza Motorsport was designed to be a fresh start for Microsoft's sim-racing series, with ambitious plans to support it as a live-service game for years. Back in July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/">Turn 10 Studios was hit with massive layoffs</a>, and players noticed that new content for the game had begun to slow down. In August, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-studio-turn-10-breaks-month-long-silence-on-its-future-following-recent-layoffs/1100-6533793/">Turn 10 said that it still planned to support Forza Motorsport with several events</a>, but these quickly dried up toward the end of 2025.</p><p>The studio is now focused on <span>supporting Playground's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-release-date-trailer/1100-6535015/">Forza Horizon 6</a>, </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-forza-horizon-6-aims-to-get-its-japanese-details-right/1100-6535031/">set in Japan</a>. "Forza Motorsport is a triumphant return for the simulation racing series, and it has never been as approachable or rewarding," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forza-motorsport-review/1900-6418125/">GameSpot's review</a>, giving the game a 9/10 score.</p>

                <p>Xbox's December update is here, and this time it's focused on your off-console experience. The update brings new store functionality to the Xbox mobile app, as well as adding Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio support to the Xbox Wireless Headset, improving battery life and audio quality with certain Windows 11 devices.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-april-update-lets-you-buy-games-more-easily-stream-them-on-consoles/1100-6530912/" data-ref-id="1100-6530912">Microsoft added the ability to purchase games</a> and subscribe to Game Pass directly from the Xbox app. Now, making it even easier to buy games from your phone, the app is getting a store tab for quicker browsing. The update also adds your Wishlist to the app, as well as allowing you to search for add-ons directly in the app. The update is rolling out now across iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also rolling out a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/16/xbox-december-2025-update-mobile-app-updates-audio-support/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">firmware update</a> for the Xbox Wireless Headset that'll add support for Bluetooth LE Audio, a Windows 11 feature that not only improves battery life, but also boosts audio quality. The update boasts lower latency, longer battery life, and super wideband stereo audio for voice chat.</p><p>Microsoft is also previewing a new shared-audio feature on Windows 11, which will let you broadcast your game audio to multiple Bluetooth accessories.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbook-air-m4-price-played-yoyo-lately-but-now-goes-to-new-record-low-price-on-amazon-only-2000654145</link>
            <guid>1385752</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MacBook Air pricing has bounced around considerably on Amazon over the past few weeks while Apple’s own store maintained full retail pricing. Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip and 256GB storage sits at a record low of $749 on Amazon, down from its standard $999 price tag</a>, which beats even last week’s previous record of $799. Shipping estimates show <strong>delivery arriving after Christmas</strong> but before New Year’s, so this works perfectly as a self-gift or for anyone who doesn’t need the laptop wrapped under the tree on December 25th.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s fourth generation of custom silicon and makes things go faster than the M3 in both single-core tasks and long-term workloads. The built-in GPU runs graphically demanding games and 3D rendering tasks smoothly while using just the right amount of power to keep that famous MacBook Air battery life. Apple’s unified memory architecture lets the CPU and GPU share the 16GB of RAM without the problems that come with traditional memory systems that are separate.</p>
<p>You can use it for up to 18 hours on a single charge which means you can get through a full workday, an international flight, or a long study session without having to look for outlets. You won’t notice any performance changes when you’re plugged in or running on battery power alone because many Windows laptops slow down when they’re not plugged in. The M4 lasts a long time because it is efficient, not because it has huge batteries inside and keeps the laptop very thin and light at only 2.7 pounds.</p>



<p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports one billion colors and has amazing picture quality that makes videos and graphics stand out with deep contrast and accurate color reproduction. The high pixel density makes text very clear, which makes it easier on the eyes when you read or write for a long time. The screen can get as bright as 500 nits, so you can work comfortably in bright places or near windows without having to squint to see what’s on the screen. The edge-to-edge glass and thin bezels give you the most screen space possible while keeping the laptop’s small size, which makes it easy to fit into bags and backpacks.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration throughout macOS adds AI-powered features that help you write and automate tasks that you do over and over again without sending your data to external servers. The M4’s neural engine runs the system locally, so your personal information stays on your device instead of being processed in the cloud, where it could be accessed or compromised. Privacy protections keep even Apple from seeing your data.</p>



<p>Connectivity has all the basics with two Thunderbolt 4 ports that can be used for charging, data transfer and display connections through one flexible interface. MagSafe charging is back, and it has a magnetic connection that safely comes apart if someone trips over the cable instead of pulling your laptop to the floor. The headphone jack works with wired headphones or external speakers without needing dongles. Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 make sure that networks and peripherals can connect quickly over wireless. The laptop can connect to up to two external displays and turns it into a powerful workstation when you’re at a desk but still being portable when you need to work somewhere else.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get Apple’s newest laptop generation for $749 instead of $999 and this is a savings of $250. This price makes the 2025 MacBook Air competitive with mid-range Windows laptops that look cheaper on paper but have worse build quality, shorter battery life, and less powerful processors.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-pushes-final-clearance-on-wireless-controllers-2025-even-lower-than-black-friday-as-stock-runs-low-2000653990</link>

              <p>If there’s an Xbox showing up under your tree and you’re going to have more than one very eager gamer dying to get at it, we’re about to save you from a potentially sticky situation. The Xbox consoles come with only one controller. Thankfully there’s still time to get a second controller to avert the epic sibling clashes that come from attempts at sharing, and it’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">the 2025 model Xbox Wireless Gaming Controller in Carbon Black, on sale at Amazon for a sweet 42% off.</a></p>
<p>This is the model that comes with the Xbox console, so you’re also avoiding the “why can’t I use the cooler controller” fights — you would have two identical cool controllers that look good, play great, and come with a long list of great features and customizations. Even if your console is going to a solo gamer, buying a backup controller while it’s just $38 — down from $65 — is a super smart move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Console, PC, Smartphone…</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, one of the best features of the Xbox Wireless Gaming Controller is how much use you get out of it&nbsp;<em>apart</em> from the Xbox. It’s an Xbox controller that’s widely compatible away from the console, able to hook up via Bluetooth or with a USB-C cable to Android and iOS devices, Windows PCs, Fire TV Sticks, Smart TVs, and VR headsets. For compatible gaming headsets, there’s a 3.5mm audio jack built into the Xbox controller. While they’re just $38, you can make a solid case for picking up an Xbox Wireless Controller even if you don’t have an Xbox console.</p>
<p>Regardless of which platform you’re using the Xbox Wireless Controller for, you’re going to deeply appreciate its design for both performance and comfort. The curved design is intended to fit your hands with maximum comfort and control, and there’s a textured grip finish on the triggers, bumpers, and back case so you’re not missing those key moves or shots because your hand slipped off. The new hybrid D-pad is another new enhancement.</p>



<h2>Customize, Play, Share</h2>
<p>Customization is key if you want to make the Xbox Wireless Controller play the way you truly want it to, and that’s now easily done with the custom mapping feature that’s part of the Xbox Accessories app. Custom mapping lets you program the buttons the way you want, as many times as you want. One button you will not be wanting to alter, however, is the Share button that lets you capture screenshot, recordings, and more from your gaming adventures, and then share them with friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">The number of reasons to go to Amazon and buy an Xbox Wireless Controller while it’s just $38 far outnumber the excuses not to</a>. Even if it doesn’t arrive until after Christmas, it’s going to be very well received, and used on a daily basis for years to come.</p>

<p>This Roblox Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending guide will help you earn 300 Toilet Paper fast, allowing you to blitz through the objectives and escape via the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pre-Christmas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-spin-a-brainrot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Dig to Escape update featured the debut of the third ending. Dubbed as the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending, players must purchase the Illegal Keycard and head into the kitchen to access this new escape route. This ending is seen as an easier option compared to the Janitor’s Ending since all you need to do is spend 300 Toilet Paper to reach the kitchen vent. That said, the final part of this ending will remind you of Subway Surfers and the iconic rooftop chase from the “The Chase” mission in GTA Vice City. This guide will help you earn those 300 Toilet Paper faster, walk you through the objectives, and complete the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-kitchen-ending-in-dig-to-escape-nbsp">How To Get Kitchen Ending In Dig To Escape&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-you-need-to-know-before-going-for-the-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending">What You Need To Know Before Going For The Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Your first goal towards the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending is to earn 300 Toilet Paper.</li>



<li>You’ll need 200 Toilet Paper for the Illegal Keycard and 100 Toilet Paper for the Crowbar.</li>



<li>Once you spawn in your cell, roll up the carpet and start digging in a rectangular pattern.</li>



<li>Digging straight down limits the number of items you find. Clearing the ground in a rectangular shape helps you uncover more items in less time.</li>



<li>Since you need 300 Toilet Paper, consider buying the Toy Shovel. It increases your digging speed, allowing you to collect more items and clear more ground quickly.</li>



<li>Trade only for Food and the Shovel. Avoid spending Toilet Paper on Energy Surge or Storage.</li>



<li>It usually takes 9–10 in-game days to save 300 Toilet Paper. On Hard difficulty, it may take longer.</li>



<li>The kitchen door is located on the left side of the Chef. Use the Keycard to scan and open it.</li>



<li>Once you’ve saved 200 Toilet Paper, buy the Illegal Keycard and head straight to the kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-to-do-after-buying-the-illegal-keycard-for-the-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending">What To Do After Buying The Illegal Keycard For The Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending</h2>



<ol>
<li>Scan the door and enter the kitchen area. There’s plenty of Food all over the place, collect them, and head back to your cell.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Continue digging for items and leave your cell only to sell them.</li>



<li>The free Food should keep you going without needing to trade for more.</li>



<li>After earning 100 Toilet Paper, return to the kitchen and open the freezer room.</li>



<li>Inside, you’ll find the Frozen Chef. Interact with him to buy the Crowbar for 100 Toilet Paper.</li>



<li>Walk up to the vent, equip the Crowbar, and use the interact button to remove the plants.</li>



<li>Move through the vent to reach the Janitor’s office in a new building.</li>



<li>Climb the five sets of ramps to reach the rooftop, then open the door to begin the final phase of the Kitchen Ending.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending">What Happens At The End Of The Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once the rooftop door opens, a short cinematic plays. When it ends, the chase begins. Follow these steps to escape safely:</p>



<ol>
<li>Your avatar must outrun the prison guard to avoid getting caught. You’ll have a flashlight and a dark path ahead, with the guard chasing.</li>



<li>Keep running forward and get over obstacles like building gaps, planks, and slow-down zones.</li>



<li>After covering some distance, climb the ladder and continue moving forward.</li>



<li>Jump only when you reach the edge of a building. This is safer and helps you avoid falling.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Use your mouse to see the path before you.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You need to be fast and accurate at the same time, as untimely moves can end the run.</li>



<li>If there’s a plank connecting to the next building, use it instead of making risky jumps.</li>



<li>Once you lose the guard, walk into the white blip to unlock the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending.</li>
</ol>



<p>The best Classes for the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending, are the Bargainer, Heavy Lifter, and Speedster.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Emergency Hamburg monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, XP and much more.</p>



<p>Emergency Hamburg transforms players into heroes of Hamburg, Germany’s virtual streets in this immersive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-merge-and-fight-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience. As first responders, you’ll tackle emergencies across a sprawling cityscape that developers have expanded by over 60% since launch. Choose your path – join the police force to maintain order, become a firefighter to battle blazes, work as a paramedic saving lives, or experience city life as a civilian. Each role offers unique vehicles, equipment, and responsibilities within the game’s dynamic emergency system.</p>







<p>Progression in Emergency Hamburg centres around earning and spending coins, the game’s primary currency. Players accumulate coins by responding to emergencies, completing missions, and performing their professional duties. This currency lets you purchase new vehicles, equipment upgrades, and specialised tools to enhance your emergency response capabilities. While dedicated gameplay naturally earns rewards, players can use promo codes shared by developers on social media and Discord to claim free coins, exclusive vehicles, and limited-time boosters, significantly reducing the grind required to reach higher ranks and acquire better equipment.</p>

<p>Emergency Hamburg codes can be found through several official channels, making it easier for players to boost their emergency response careers with free euros and special items.

And increasingly, access to this audience is seen as a lucrative and highly accessible method of marketing everything from big-name brands to Hollywood blockbusters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, worries over how safe Roblox is for its enormous audience of players — many of whom are under the age of 18 — remain offputting to Disney, a new <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/roblox-fortnite-hollywood-collabs-safety-1236597852/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> report has highlighted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While some had suspected Disney was avoiding Roblox due to its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-buys-15-billion-stake-in-epic-games-to-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite">$1.5 billion investment in rival gaming platform Fortnite</a>, sources told Variety that Disney was instead avoiding Roblox specifically because the company did not believe the larger platform was safe at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney content is of course deeply embedded within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, which regularly hosts Star Wars and Marvel crossovers, recently featured a well-received The Simpsons mini-season, and now includes a small army of licensed skins for everyone from Maleficent to the Mandalorian. A specific Disney Fortnite mode is also in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now at least, Roblox fans shouldn't expect anything similar, the report continues. That's despite Roblox's far larger audience (Fortnite averages between 30 and 40 million daily users) and the platform playing host to other large brands, such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Squid Game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Roblox The Hatch Event - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following signficant, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sustained criticism of its player safety protocols</a> and amid <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-faces-new-lawsuit-claiming-it-lacks-child-safety-measures" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/texas-sues-roblox-alleging-it-flagrantly-ignores-safety-laws-and-deceives-parents-about-the-dangers-of-its-platform">lawsuits</a>, Roblox has added a series of stricter requirements designed to limit who its young audience can interact with. Most recently, the platform <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robloxs-new-safety-features-include-an-ai-that-will-guess-your-age-based-on-a-video-selfie">added facial age verification to limit communication features in select countries</a>, with a U.S. rollout to follow. But this too has been criticized as something of a band-aid. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The issue is basically the ability of younger players to cheat those systems — to pretend to be older, to use the older siblings, to use facial identity to get into those systems," Ron Kerb, CEO at child safety platform Kidas, told Variety. "And we know that it's happening on TikTok, we know that it's happening on gaming platforms, on Roblox. Platforms are trying to block kids, and kids are going to find ways to open it up."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Roblox's most recent <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/safety-snapshot-november" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Safety Snapshot</u></a>, the company said it "continued to innovate around safety," and revealed it had open-sourced a version of <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/open-sourcing-roblox-pii-classifier-ai-pii-detection-chat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roblox PII Classifier</u></a>, which "has significantly enhanced" its ability to detect and block attempts to violate its policies around sharing personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Katelyn Mulcahy/Getty.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
