<hr><h2>Fifth Place - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2>



<p>Developer: Square Enix | Release Date: Februrary 29th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>The reimagining of Cloud's legendary adventure took its second big step this year. With the escape from Midgar and quest to seek Sephiroth, the doors of the world flew open and Square Enix managed to take core elements of what made <em>Remake </em>so great; enhanced combat, compelling performances from the cast, and incredible visuals and improve on them even more.</p>

<p>This adventure made further deviations from the original story, continuing to remind fans of the original game of what made the adventure so great, while also providing new mystery all leading to an incredible and action-packed finale.</p>

<h2>Fourth Place - Astro Bot</h2>



<p>Developer: Team Asobi | Release Date: September 6th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p><em>Astro Bot</em> took Game of the Year at Geoff Keighly’s The Game Awards, so it’s no wonder this delightful platformer makes an appearance on this list.<em> Astro Bot</em> is pure childhood joy molded into video game form, creating an experience that’ll have you smiling from start to finish.</p>

<p>Though <em>Astro Bot</em> features a myriad of PlayStation mascots and other gaming characters, the real highlight is this platformer’s stellar level design. Each level is a new experience to enjoy, as Team Asobi made sure to incorporate as many fun ideas as they could into one video game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its use of DuelSense is another marvel in game design. It’s not just an auditory and visual experience, but a tactile one as well. It’s something you’ll just have to experience for yourself, and once you do, you’ll see what makes <em>Astro Bot</em> such a triumph.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Balatro</h2>



<p>Developer: LocalThunk | Release Date: February 20th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Blair Bishop</p>

<p>When The Game Awards announced the nominees for their awards show, some saw <em>Balatro </em>not just as the token indie pick, but as something that took a more deserving spot from something like, say, <em>Silent Hill 2</em>&nbsp;or <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Not only were they wrong, but it was the first year where the token indie nod had a legitimate chance to upset the entire industry and come out on top.</p>

<p>While it wasn’t meant to be, that still doesn’t detract from the sheer power <em>Balatro </em>possesses. Since its 1.0 release in February of 2024, it’s only grown bigger and bigger, a supermassive black hole which sucks up your free time. A true indie powerhouse, it’s an incredible time-sink, a deceptively welcome experience, and a soaring entry into the upper echelon of roguelikes.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is the <em>Indiana Jones</em> adventure of the 80s we never got. This game features an almost perfect blend of exploration, puzzle solving, and combat that allows you to get invested not only in the greater mystery of the game, but in the world as you stumble into interesting side quests and puzzles alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most impressive of all is how the character of Indiana Jones is performed so faithfully with a mix of nailing Harrison Ford-esque facial expressions and a stellar performance by Troy Baker. We're transported to the past while also getting to enjoy the evolution of action-exploration games.</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by&nbsp;Veerender Singh Jubbal</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio’</em>s Bond system improves upon recent mainline <em>Persona </em>games’ Social Link mechanics to expedite the relationships your player character has with the cast and allows more player choice in building teams the way you would like. Being able to defeat lower-level enemies in the overworld to not trigger an encounter or being able to easily restart any battle, so you can get the best results pushes you further in tackling the game’s tough enemies even on the Normal difficulty setting.</p>

<p>One of <em>Metaphor</em>’s main theses early on is: can fictional media change the views and ideologies of real people for the better? Can fictional representation in stories bring about real-world change? The game handles the topics of racism/xenophobia directly and poignantly with hopeful lenses, but also does not shy away from showcasing that hatred/discrimination/despair to the player through degradation and ostracization in an impactful way from NPCs exuding microaggressions, subtle racism and/or unapologetic racism—all of various levels, types, and intricacies.</p>

<p>A remarkable and all-new intellectual property that showcases colorful style with its cutscenes, artful UI, dedicated substance, and an excellent soundtrack with simple, but effective gameplay mechanics ushers in a new age not just of JRPGs, but RPGs as a whole is TechRaptor’s 2024 Game of the Year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-details-trading-update-due-later-this-month.1085133/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is getting trading sometime this month, and while we still don't have a release date for the update, we do now know a little more about how trading will work.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, the devs behind the app confirm that trading is still planned to arrive in January, and they also reveal more details regarding what you'll be able to trade and with whom.</p>

<p>According to the post, trading will only be possible between friends, and only cards of the same rarity can be traded, so you won't be able to demand that your friend trade their ultra-rare Mewtwo card for your Caterpie.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-cards.jpg?itok=S3QiZ_k0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-cards.jpg?itok=1LZJM9yD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Trading is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, but there are several caveats.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, only "certain cards" from&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s first two sets - Genetic Apex and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">expansion set Mythical Island</a> - will be tradeable at the time trading launches. The devs say they'll be expanding the booster packs you can trade in the future.</p>

<p>Only the first five rarity tiers of cards will be tradeable, too, so you can't trade anything with a rarity rating of two stars or above. The&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>devs don't provide any kind of reason for this decision (or, indeed, for any of the other restrictions being imposed on trading).</p>

<p>Finally, it sounds like there will be some kind of unique currency for trading, as the devs say "items must be consumed" if you want to trade.</p>

<p>It looks as though the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>community isn't particularly happy with some of these terms, as in a <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880027099836411924" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message</a>, the devs say the community's "concerns are seen" and that players should wait until the feature has arrived to "try it and provide feedback".</p>




<p>Unfortunately, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>devs don't provide any info about when we can expect trading to arrive, but it's set to launch sometime in January. You can play&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>

Three-person Danish team The Outer Zone and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> creators 11-bit studios have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-howl">Death Howl</a>, a very gloomy soulslike deck-builder set in a "stone-age Nordic-inspired" open world that consists of biomes with names like "the Forest of Howling Shadows". Lots of howling round these parts. 
</p>
<p>
You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

"Each realm visited offers unique deck types and mechanics, enriching and deepening the strategic layer," howls the press release. "Players can further enhance their decks with shamanic totems, ensuring they are best prepared for the deadly encounters ahead." What's more, "each region not only unlocks aforementioned new cards to craft, but also unveils fragments of Ro's story, steeped in themes of love and loss, and uncovers the forgotten lore of this mysterious spiritual world."
</p><p>
I quite like the game's stark, emaciated, slightly rotten pixelart. It looks like somebody's taken a chisel to a seam of obsidian and discovered a layer of organic matter beneath - pinkish bones, greening flesh. The cards are pleasingly grisly. "Take Skin", for example. Eesh! There's another one with a drawing of an arrow going through somebody's leg - hopefully the owner of that leg survived and is now living out a prosperous second career as a guard in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'm less sold on the game's self-serious narrative direction, which make me think of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellblade">Hellblade</a> at its shoutiest. "The loss of a loved one is universal - an inevitable part of the human experience," howls director, artist and writer Malte Burup in the press release. "We believe our narrative approach, enriched by compelling lore and a fresh take on the deck-builder genre through its fusion with soulslike exploration, will resonate with players of all kinds." 
</p>
<p>
I'm always up for a good Universal Theme, but foregrounding your takeaways so baldly feels false, and a certain amount of clunky melodrama seems inevitable when your tale of woe is literally called Death <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/howl">Howl</a>. The talk of wrestling with one's mortality sits a little uneasily alongside the paint-by-numbers Steam tag spectacle that is "open world soulslike deckbuilder". I wonder if I'm going to end up feeling about this game the same way Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gris-review">felt about Gris</a> and its massive, sobbing statues. 
</p>
<p>Still, all that could be more of a marketing problem than an issue with the game - and it's clearly "resonating" with me to some extent, or I wouldn't be writing this. Death Howl is out later in 2025, and there's a demo coming to Steam on Monday 20th January.

What is ostensibly a simple game of multiplayer tag for pre-adolescent children is also, I have recently discovered, a wild hotbed of ludicrous in-universe conspiracies fuelling a genuine belief among its players that the game is somehow haunted. <em>Gorilla Tag</em> is one of the strangest games I’ve encountered in a very long time. This is a story that involves a microcosm of the meme-based internet, and somehow the very first song ever sung by a computer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For Christmas 2024, we finally succumbed and bought our 10-year-old son a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/b67jzedbdpxpr&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/b67jzedbdpxpr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meta Quest 3S</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-vr-is-going-to-be-an-enormous-flop&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-vr-is-going-to-be-an-enormous-flop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As a VR skeptic</a></span> (Meta will give up on it in 2026, focusing only on AR from that point) I’ve always held off, but then was broken down by peer-pressure-by-proxy—my son’s close friends are all gaming together after school via the machines—and the sudden affordability of Meta’s latest model. The kids’ game of choice is <em>Gorilla Tag</em>. People, this gets weird, fast.</p><p><em>Gorilla Tag</em> is an online multiplayer game of VR tag where everyone plays as a gorilla. (The clues are all there in the title.) In a very genius decision, the gorillas have only arms, no legs, making sense of movement in a way so many VR games do not: you frantically propel yourself around with your arms, whether grabbing and yanking at the ground in front of you, or climbing by hauling yourself upward. In its most popular mode, Contagion, when you get tagged you become a “lava monkey” (there is no distinction between monkeys and apes here, sorry naturalists), and can then tag others. Last one tagged is the winner. That’s how it starts, and pretty much sums up how it was intended, at least, to be played. But then you start hearing about the ghosts…</p><figure id="" data-id="559186c2098fe37fd0d766b0805bac2d" data-recommend-id="image://559186c2098fe37fd0d766b0805bac2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A collection of Gorillas around a campfire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A collection of Gorillas around a campfire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Another Axiom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="559186c2098fe37fd0d766b0805bac2d" data-recommend-id="image://559186c2098fe37fd0d766b0805bac2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A collection of Gorillas around a campfire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game itself looks like a 3D <em>Minecraft</em> world where these brightly colored gorillas, severed at the torso, all lope about the various blocky biomes in an effort to turn each other to lava. Along the way, there are fun little wintry details in the game just now, like the ability to scoop up and throw snowballs at one another, and lots of little easter eggs for players to introduce to one another like veterans welcoming in the new recruits.</p><p><em>Gorilla Tag</em> was officially launched in late 2022 for Meta Quest, then SteamVR in early 2023, and most recently PSVR2 at the end of 2024. Mostly the work of one person—Kerestell Smith (known as Lemming), later joined by a small team—the free game crossed $100 million in revenue last year, and achieved this with no paid advertising or publisher backing, just pure word-of-mouth mania. Being free to play (and genuinely so, with only cosmetics costing money) means it’s often at the top of the “most popular” lists for VR platforms, and so it’s a game kids often notice when they first start poking around. That is, if they haven’t begged for virtual reality goggles specifically to be able to play this game.</p><p>At first, what we as parents experienced was the hilarious sight of our son cartwheeling his arms around as he pantingly attempted to escape from taggers, in what is absolutely a superb work-out on top of a silly game. However, what we absolutely weren’t ready for was open chat with complete strangers. Thankfully, the Quest lets you hear what he’s hearing, and we quickly developed stringent rules that as soon as there was extensive cursing or any hint of racism or other bigotry, he needed to change server. (His own approach, endearingly, was to believe he could convince other pre-teen children not to be racists with heartfelt encouragement.) It was deeply demoralizing to hear the n-word so frequently, from squeaky pre-adolescent voices.</p><figure id="" data-id="b8271c6136d674083209f03be9851449" data-recommend-id="image://b8271c6136d674083209f03be9851449" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink gorilla brandishing a unicorn head on a stick." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pink gorilla brandishing a unicorn head on a stick." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Another Axiom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8271c6136d674083209f03be9851449" data-recommend-id="image://b8271c6136d674083209f03be9851449" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink gorilla brandishing a unicorn head on a stick." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, in addition to playing <em>Gorilla Tag</em>, our son was also compelled to watch YouTube videos about <em>Gorilla Tag</em>, beginning with guides on “pinch climbing” and snowball-based exploits to propel oneself across the map, but the algorithm almost immediately directed him toward videos about the ghosts. Oh, so many ghosts.</p><p>So let’s be very clear about something: <em>Gorilla Tag</em> is not some sort of <em>Poppy’s Playtime</em>-adjacent horror game being marketed to children. It is, from top to bottom, completely innocuous (beyond the foul mouths on the children playing). It’s perhaps because of this complete innocence, and the absolute lack of any internal narrative, that the game is so ripe for conspiratorial invention, a blank canvas on which rumors can be created, spread among its players, and then amplified by YouTube. And how. According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gorilla-tag-ghosts.fandom.com/wiki/Gorilla_Tag_Ghosts_Wiki&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gorilla-tag-ghosts.fandom.com/wiki/Gorilla_Tag_Ghosts_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan-made Wiki</a></span>, there are over 1,000 named ghosts believed to be inside the game, each with unique characteristics and reasons to be fearful of them. And they just aren’t real.</p><p>However, to hear my 10-year-old playing, you would think he’d somehow gotten hold of the most terrifying piece of creepy-pasta.</p><p>“I SAW IT!” I’ll hear him bellow. “GUYS! I SAW IT! Look over there! His head’s on backward!” This is inevitably followed by my yelling right back to stop scaring younger kids who might be playing (and note I can use my phone to see exactly what he’s seeing in the headset), with the ulterior motive of reassuring him it’s not a “ghost” without making him feel patronized. With so many young kids playing, and most of them so very new (it’s not exactly a game possessing enough variety or inventiveness to engage long-time play for most), any older cosmetic they’ve not seen before is immediately parsed as impossibly exotic and almost definitely proof of supernatural content. Let alone if they see a player glitch, lag, or suddenly vanish when their internet drops. “GHOST!”</p><figure id="" data-id="aa4b38508d1540fb60146dd4b3d9999e" data-recommend-id="image://aa4b38508d1540fb60146dd4b3d9999e" data-format="jpg" data-width="384" data-height="283" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lucy, the skeleton gorilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucy, the skeleton gorilla." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->SuperSlimeGuy / Fandom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa4b38508d1540fb60146dd4b3d9999e" data-recommend-id="image://aa4b38508d1540fb60146dd4b3d9999e" data-format="jpg" data-width="384" data-height="283" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lucy, the skeleton gorilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As it happens, <em>Gorilla Tag</em> does in fact have <em>one</em> ghost: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gorillatag.fandom.com/wiki/Lucy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gorillatag.fandom.com/wiki/Lucy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucy</a></span>. The skeletal gorilla was added to the game in Halloween 2022 as a joke, in response to the furore among players who were convinced the game was somehow possessed. Lucy appears if players stand around at a certain position in each of the game’s regions for an unspecified length of time. She then picks a player at random and runs toward them, grabbing them, and lifting them into the air. And, of course, this gives fuel to every other conspiracy.</p><p>My son was told, in no uncertain terms by multiple random players, that Lucy only appeared if a player put their hand into a cauldron that just happens to be near that map’s spawn point. He then went on to immediately spread this misinformation to others. There were many different theories as to what or who controlled Lucy, with a seemingly fervent belief that it was the role of a “moderator” who would join random games and punish players for imagined infractions. It is this, it seems, that creates the widespread belief that so-called “mods” will appear in games as ghosts or malevolent creatures and ban players for as much as a year. “My friend got banned for two weeks by PBBV!” a player insisted to our boy, naming one of the most popular (but entirely non-existent) ghosts believed to be in the game.</p><p>PBBV, it is said, emits audio that repeats “PBBV let’s go PBBV,” but—and god bless ‘em, it’s good they’re sticking with the classics—if you reverse this audio it instead says, “PBBV is watching, PBBV is here.” This is all absolute gibberish, but it’s gibberish that gets passed between players as severe truth, backed up by so, so many trolls who join games and just blast the relevant tunes and phrases through their microphones. This latter aspect is made far easier by multiple Spotify playlists that offer all the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/17hXKVAHjgodZoRGjkeTyM?si=110d6133076043fa&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/17hXKVAHjgodZoRGjkeTyM?si=110d6133076043fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“ghost trolling songs”</a></span> anyone could ever need to scare a bunch of other middle-school kids.</p><p>Key among these is a (non-existent) ghost called Daisy09. She is pink, it’s believed, but can change colors as she walks, and all the while emits the song “Daisy Bell” as performed by an IBM 7094.</p><p>The 1892 ditty about sharing a bicycle went on to become the very first song sung by a computer. In 1961, physicists John L. Kelly Jr. and Carol Lockbaum of Bell Labs in New Jersey programmed a computer-synthesized voice to sing “Daisy Bell,” accompanied by computer music pioneer Max Mathews. It was an amazing achievement. And yup, it sounds spooky as hell today.</p><p>“I HEARD IT!” screams the boy, emphatically explaining to us that Daisy09 <em>is</em> real, because he heard the song in the game, but wasn’t able to find the ghost before it disappeared. And yeah, I’m the sort of spoilsport who can’t let that lie, and explained it was just some goof playing the song into their mic, and he remained very skeptical of my skepticism. In the two weeks that have passed since, he’s long moved on from such foolish, youthful naivety, now quick to explain to others in-game that it’s just a troll and they shouldn’t worry, before yelping in horror because he thinks he just saw Echo (cyan, plays the song “Run Rabbit”) or J3VU (a hacker, by the mythology, who can change the color of other players’ gorillas via his enormous moderator menu).</p><p><em>Gorilla Tag</em> becomes the most fascinating microcosm of internet behavior as performed by children. Memes are rife, disbelief is suspended, and rumor rules above reality. Kids desperately want to be seen as the ones in the know, moving from mark to troll to mark again at the most astonishing pace, fervently believing while being far too cool to be seen doing so. Hierarchy develops in any given lobby at lightning pace, the most confident kid in the room rising to the top, leading the others on a “ghost hunt,” the others all immediately handing them authority and tagging along in terror.</p><p>It’s still possible for my son, and every other kid, to have a fun time just playing <em>Gorilla Tag</em> properly. The core tag mechanic is fun, and with the ability to climb, levels are exciting chase sequences across three axes. As recently as last night, after a bollocking for spreading nonsense about seeing ghosts to other players, he had a brilliant time just playing the game as intended. Albeit using a new exploit to reach an out-of-bounds area with the game’s latest update to snowballs.</p><p>(There is one feature the game very much needs to update: it’s currently not possible to create private, passworded lobbies to play in with friends when playing on a child’s account, so in order to give kids a safer, controlled game without strangers able to join, you have to have them logged in as an adult, meaning all the other parental controls are lost. I realize that unsupervised access to private lobbies is a whole other very serious issue, but if access required a parent’s approval, that’d easily be solved. It’s a big oversight.)</p><figure id="" data-id="2c429a622af0646de2bfd0624dfedc7d" data-recommend-id="image://2c429a622af0646de2bfd0624dfedc7d" data-format="jpg" data-width="898" data-height="506" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink gorilla using the in-game computer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pink gorilla using the in-game computer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Another Axiom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2c429a622af0646de2bfd0624dfedc7d" data-recommend-id="image://2c429a622af0646de2bfd0624dfedc7d" data-format="jpg" data-width="898" data-height="506" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink gorilla using the in-game computer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I love and hate stuff like this in games. Those weird communities that develop among complete strangers, connected only for minutes never to play together again, but spreading myths, rumors and lies like they’re in one massive, interconnected school yard. That the non-existent ghosts even have names everyone agrees on is miraculous, given the chaotic nature of how the game is played. It’s a fascinating phenomenon, and one that brings me enormous concern as I try to regulate the nonsense that’s being spoken into my son’s ears and protect his imagination, while letting him enjoy the thrill of the fear in the moment.</p><p><em>Gorilla Tag</em> has led to pride, terror, bemusing arguments, and so much laughter for our kid, as well as providing him with the most extraordinary daily workout. It’s been an emotional rollercoaster for us as parents, too, remotely navigating the horrors of online multiplayer and giving us a chilling preview to the impending years of helping defend a teenage boy from far darker, crueller conspiracies. But perhaps what captures it all more than anything else is the absolute weirdness of hearing a 10-year-old in 2025 walking around his house murmuring, “Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do…”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Ro, you’ll face relentless spirits in grid-based, turn-driven battles that demand not only tactical precision but also the ability to adapt. To forge a path through despair and stand against formidable enemies and fearsome bosses, players must craft and refine their decks. Each realm visited offers unique deck types and mechanics, enriching and deepening the strategic layer. Players can further enhance their decks with shamanic totems, ensuring they are best prepared for the deadly encounters ahead.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In addition to the run-based gameplay, <em>Death Howl</em> inserts deck-building mechanics into an explorative open world, divided into grim biomes, like the Forest of Howling Shadows or Meadows of Delusion. Each region not only unlocks aforementioned new cards to craft, but also unveils fragments of Ro’s story, steeped in themes of love and loss, and uncovers the forgotten lore of this mysterious spiritual world.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p>Bungie has revealed a bunch of new abilities and balance changes that will be released with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s next episode, Heresy. The content update will include a brand-new verb, Bolt Charge, for the Arc subclass, as well as three new Aspects that can utilize the verb.</p><p>According to the Abilities team's notes, Bolt Charge was designed to be a powerful damage tool--something that was previously missing from the subclass. Bolt Charge is a stacking buff, which builds up over time to release a bolt of Arc lightning when it reaches its max. Stacks can be built up from multiple sources, and the verb will be integrated with Arc and Prismatic subclass suites.</p><p>"The loop of gaining a Bolt Charge stack, building it up through combat, and then receiving a big payoff ties deeply into the fantasy of Arc’s momentum-based gameplay," Bungie says of the new mechanic, saying it will open up plenty of new build-crafting options for the Arc subclass.</p><p>The update will also bring three new Aspects, which have been designed with Bolt Charge in mind. The first, On The Prowl, is actually a Void Aspect for Nightstalkers, while Storm's Keep and Ionic Sentry are for Arc subclasses Striker Titans and Stormcaller Warlocks respectively.</p><p>Storm's Keep is designed to use Bolt Charge to its highest potential, granting stacks of Bolt Charge to the player and nearby allies under specific circumstances. Ionic Sentry allows Warlocks to charge up a powerful Arc turret, which targets enemies with chain lightning and grants Bolt Charge stacks on kill. On The Prowl is designed to fulfill the fantasy of "hunting down prey and being rewarded for the kill," for Nightstalkers, and is triggered when the Hunter enters invisibility. While On The Prowl is a Void Aspect, Nightstalkers can still build Bolt Charge stacks through other means.</p><p>While the new verb and Aspects are the major new abilities coming with Heresy, the update will also include major balance changes to allow for the new additions and integrate Bolt Charge with existing abilities. The full list of balance changes can be found below.</p><p>Destiny 2 is finishing off its current arc, Revenant, and will be moving into Heresy in February, when the new abilities will be released.</p><h2>Heresy Abilities Update</h2><ul><li>New Arc verb: “Bolt Charge”</li><li>Three new Aspects added</li><li>Heresy ability balance pass</li></ul><h3><strong>On The Prowl</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>On The Prowl</strong><ul><li>Entering invisibility marks a nearby enemy as a priority target for you and your team.  <ul><li>Note: this does not enable players to see marked targets through walls in the Crucible.</li></ul></li><li>Defeating priority targets creates a weakening cloud of smoke that makes you and allies invisible when passing through it.</li><li>When priority targets are defeated, you and nearby allies gain increased weapon reload speed and stability for a short duration and are granted grenade, melee, and class-ability energy.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Storm's Keep</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Storm’s Keep</strong><ul><li>Cast your class ability to grant a moderate number of Bolt Charge stacks to you and nearby allies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/opinion-yes-the-switch-2-is-alarmingly-sensible-but-let-s-all-just-take-a-deep-breath<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How do you follow a console that has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-lowers-fiscal-forecast-with-switch-hardware-and-software-in-decline">sold over 146 million units worldwide</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">? That's the conundrum Nintendo is attempting to untangle with the Switch 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Switch has become the best-selling Nintendo home console of all time by some margin, eclipsing the 101 million lifetime sales of the Nintendo Wii with apparent ease.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If it can top the 154 million sales mustered by the Nintendo DS, it will cement its place as the best-selling Nintendo console in history. That would represent an enormous achievement for the Japanese company–and you have to wonder if it would ever be surpassed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, irrespective of whether the Switch eventually takes that crown, the hybrid device will forever be known as the console that proved Nintendo still had the juice. Its predecessor, the Wii U, sold just 13.56 million units across its lifetime.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a measly return in the aftermath of the Wii's meteoric ascent and raised questions as to whether Nintendo had shot itself in the foot by failing to effectively differentiate the Wii U from the Wii in the mind of consumers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For better or worse, Nintendo isn't making that mistake this time around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-shell-nintendo-finally-unveils-the-tktk-its-successor-to-the-nintendo-switch">In its fleeting reveal trailer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Nintendo slapped a colossal '2' next to the Switch logo and showed the original console transform into something familiar yet different.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like a serpent shedding its skin, the Switch 2 is a more refined version of its forebear. A distinctly 'new' offering that still feels immediately recognisable. New buttons, more curves, additional ports, and reworked Joy-Cons that some viewers believe hide a spark of creativity are the immediate differentiators, but those additions represent iteration rather than revolution.</span></p><p>It's definitely another Switch</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo has previous in that regard. The company often produces revamped versions of existing tech. The Switch OLED, Nintendo 3DS XL, and Wii Mini all spring to mind. Where the Switch 2 differs is in how it will mark the beginning of a new hardware cycle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For years, we've become accustomed to Nintendo kicking off a fresh generation with barmy, unpredictable experimentation. Irreverent technology (and jubilant first-party software to match) that can't reasonably be compared to the rotund boxes released by Microsoft and Sony. This time, Nintendo is joining its rivals in playing it safe. In promising more of the same, but better, and hoping that'll be enough to repeat the success of the past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's an understandable position given the company's not-to-distant failings, but one that feels distinctly un-Nintendo. It's entirely possible the Switch 2 is hiding a few new tricks. Some keen-eyed viewers posit the reworked Joy-Cons could double as mouse-like controllers, offering new ways to play. Yet, Nintendo doesn't plan on releasing concrete tech specs for another couple of months, so that remains wishful speculation.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reinventing the wheel is overrated–just ask 12,000 years of wheels">Reinventing the wheel is overrated–just ask 12,000 years of wheels</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking into account what we do know, the Switch 2 appears overwhelmingly beige. The vibrant colourways of the original Joy-Cons have been ditched in favor of homogenous grey. A bigger screen promises a little extra real-estate, but it's unclear whether Nintendo is prepared to make OLED the standard. A new 'C' button has spawned theories galore, but it's probably sensible to temper expectations as to how much innovation can be squeezed into a single input.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact there is so much speculation over so little suggests the industry is struggling to reconcile itself with the idea of a Nintendo that is content (at least for now) to temper its adventurous side in pursuit of what it must feel are guaranteed returns.</span></p><p>A modern mystery worthy of Miss Marple</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we've already covered, the Switch sold like diamond-encrusted hot cakes slathered in gold. A key part of that success was how Nintendo was able to hit a palatable price point and gently iterate with the Switch Lite and OLED models, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/20-of-last-year-s-switch-sales-were-to-households-that-already-owned-one">encouraging multiple sales within the same household</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If it can do the same again, you'd have to expect a comparable uptake.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo's first-party catalogue has also been superlative over the years, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (a more complete version of the Wii U release) having </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">sold over 64 million units on the Switch alone</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's no surprise Nintendo seemingly chose to tease a new entry in the franchise alongside the Switch 2. Others like Animal Crossing, Pokemon, Super Smash Bros., Super Mario, and The Legend of Zelda chipped in with aplomb, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">selling eye-watering amounts over the years.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond that, it's vital to consider the console's wider impact. If imitation if the sincerest form of flattery, then Nintendo must feel like the bell of the ball. A massive list of hardware companies and platform holders have attempted to replicate the form factor of the Switch in the eight years since it launched. The Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and so many others all promise some version of portable gaming in a Switch-like package. Hell, even Microsoft is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-touts-new-consoles-teases-handhelds">openly talking about developing a handheld</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in what would be a notable first for the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the reality of the post-Switch world. It cannot be understated just how influential Nintendo's hybrid device has become since debuting in 2017. For the first time in decades, here was a machine that genuinely changed how we played by dissolving the barrier between handheld and home consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will I be disappointed if the Switch 2 is completely devoid of whimsy? Yes, there will be pangs of melancholy, but then I also trust Nintendo to innovate in other ways. This is the company that turned The Legend of Zelda into a physics playground with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, implemented a mechanic called 'Mouthful Mode' just to let Kirby swallow an entire automobile, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-000000000010013963">developed an alarm clock dubbed ALARMO</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because why the fuck not?

		<p>There’s an incredible looking year of games ahead of us, both in terms of what we already know about with the likes of Monster Hunter Wilds, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">GTA 6</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/15/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-3-doom-the-dark-ages/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and so, so much more… but only one game can top our list of most wanted games of 2025. That game is Ghost of Yōtei.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7z7kqwuf0a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In anticipation of a Ghost of Tsushima sequel’s almost inevitable announcement, we were all wondering the same thing. How can Sly Cooper and inFamous creators, Sucker Punch Productions, possibly follow up on one of the most celebrated PlayStation exclusives of the past decade? By sacking off the main character, of course, jumping the game some 300 years in the future, and taking us to a completely different part of Japan. It’s so obvious!</p>


<p>Jokes aside, the change of setting makes perfect sense for Ghost of Yōtei. As much as we enjoyed Jin Sakai’s Mongol-murdering revenge quest, he wasn’t the most compelling of characters, the mantle of “Ghost” now free to pass onto another protagonist. There’s a lot we don’t know about newcomer warrior, Atsu, or what motivates her but we love the idea of telling different sagas throughout history, instead of clinging to a single storyline and its cast of characters.</p>


<p>That said, we expect Ghost of Yotei to hit many of the same beats as its predecessor in terms of gameplay, visuals, and the sequel’s approach to open world game design. The new Hokkaido setting will give us yet another gorgeous slice of feudal Japan to explore, while the 17th century timeline allowing for a new arsenal of weapons and technologies. Where the Mongols mainly fought with swords, bows, and cheap tricks, Atsu will likely encounter an array of newfangled gunpowder arms.</p>
<p>The Edo period of the 17th century contrasted with the chaotic Sengoku period that preceded it. Set in 1603, Ghost of Yōtei will be right at the time that Tokugawa Ieyasu was given the title of Shogun by Emperor Go-Yōzei, settling the now unified country into a period of relative peace and stability, albeit with increasing restrictions on social heirarchy and, by 1639, a strict isolationist policy that booted almost all foreigners out of the country. Ghost of Yōtei will be just at the tipping point of this era, and it will be fascinating to see the tale that Sucker Punch tell on this backdrop – of particular note, Atsu’s status as an onna-musha, a female warrior, naturally clashes with the neo-Confucianism and the lessening and changing roles that women had more generally in this world.</p>

<p>Where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, along with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-tlou2/">The Last of Us Part II</a>, helped push the PS4 to its limits just month before the PS5’s arrival, we’re fascinated to see how Sucker Punch makes use of Sony’s newer console, especially the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. We’re hoping to see larger, more cinematic battles, with Hokkaido’s many beautiful vistas brought to life with stunning fidelity.</p>
<p>For now, we still know very little about the game apart from its 2025 release window. If there’s one request we’d like to highlight on our wishlist, it’s the return of Legends, the fantastic online co-op mode that kept us coming back to Ghost of Tsushima long after the original credits rolled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-clock-speeds-8nm-no-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 leaked clock speeds, which look rather legitimate, further suggest how the system is powered by an 8nm chip, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-undocked-tflops-have-been-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> leaked clock speeds</a> of the new system, highlighting how they look reasonable enough for the type of system the Nintendo Switch 2 will be, although with some caveats, such as the handheld GPU clock speed looking a little low for the type of cooling the system has, and the CPU clock speeds, which are not particularly low for an 8nm CPU sporting eight Cortex A78 cores, being higher in portable mode than docked. The latter is particularly interesting, as it suggests there is still something we do not know about how the system works in this case, as it might disable cores in portable modes to save battery, or could have different CPU frequency modes in docked mode. Still, everything considered, these clock speeds are definitely in line with what an 8nm chip can achieve, further suggesting that it is the process node used for the T239 chip that powers the system. Speaking about the specs, one point of concern could be the low memory bandwidth in portable mode, especially if the system uses a 1080p screen as rumored. The reveal trailer, unfortunately, did not specify if the screen sports a higher resolution than the one of the original system.</p>
<p>What the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer also failed to show is how the system will take advantage of the T239's Ampere architecture. The short Mario Kart footage was not at a very high resolution, and it looked aliased as the vast majority of Nintendo games, and in no part, it showed evidence of using NVIDIA DLSS or any other advanced feature that the architecture can deliver. Speaking about NVIDIA DLSS, Digital Foundry rightly highlights during the podcast how the Nintendo Switch 2 could be able to use the new Transformer Model, but its viability remains a question, considering the new model is computationally heavier than the current CNN model and wasn't developed for a mobile system that's essentially a few generations old at this point. Considering the recent patent essentially details a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">lightweight DLSS</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2, we are unlikely to see the same identical desktop Transformer model running on the system due to computational limitations.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide later this year. More information on the console will be revealed in a dedicated Direct scheduled for early April.</p>

            <p>
Mario Kart fans are pouring over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">yesterday's reveal of a new entry in Nintendo's racing series for Switch 2</a> - and have come up with a few more clues on how the game might play. 
</p>
<p>
Our first look at Mario Kart 9 - or whatever it ends up being called - was, on the surface, a pretty straightforward affair. We saw one racetrack, 12 returning characters and not a lot else.
</p>
<p>
Except for the fact, as we noted yesterday, there are now 24 spaces on the track's starting grid. Huh! Let's hope Nintendo has improved its online servers to allow for 24 players.
</p>
<p>
Overnight, fans have analysed the trailer in more detail - with an eye to working on what Mario Kart 9's main 'gimmick' might be. We've had underwater racing and gliders, anti-gravity tracks, and now... could Mario Kart 9's big change revolve around conserving fuel?
</p><p>
One fan spotted a rather conspicuous fuel tank added to the side of Mario's otherwise familiar kart, labelled "1-UP Fuel". The same fan also pointed to the mysterious glowing power-up seemingly placed outside a pit-stop burger joint - perhaps a fuel-replenishing power-up.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">haven't seen anyone else talk about this but the gimmick of mario kart 9 is definitely a fuel tank<br>karts have conspicuous fuel tanks now and there's something on this track that doesnt look like an item box <br>it'll be a resource you can use freely to boost <a href="https://t.co/bhGnEOe8Xo">pic.twitter.com/bhGnEOe8Xo</a></p>— chloe (@payapaberii) <a href="https://twitter.com/payapaberii/status/1879956048762794250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Another fan pointed to the presence of a large gas station by the track itself, with a large sign that reads: "Fire Flower Gas Station". 
</p> <div>

<p>
Other changes  noted yesterday include slight tweaks to Mario and Donkey Kong's character designs. (We think they now deliberately look more similar to those seen in the Super Mario Bros. Movie!)
</p>
<p>
For lots more chat about Mario Kart 9 - including our theories on whether the game might be open-world, or feature user-made courses, be sure to watch the latest episode of the Eurogamer Newscast, below.

            <p>Nintendo said it believes "in giving proper credit" to those who work on its games, after recently omitting the original development team at Retro Studios from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>'s credits.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a remaster of 2010's Wii release, which was originally developed by Retro and published by Nintendo. This year's remaster, however, has been helmed by Forever Entertainment, which is front and centre of the new release's credits. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-removes-retro-studios-staff-from-credits">Nintendo has omitted the original developers from the ending</a>,  simply stating the HD remaster was "based on the work" of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a> team.</p>
<p>Now, in a statement to Eurogamer regarding its crediting policy, Nintendo said: "We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game's creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process."</p>

<p>Nintendo did not state why then it had still omitted the original Donkey Kong Country Returns team from the HD remaster's credits. We have asked for further clarification on this, and will update if we hear more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously been called out for missing those who worked on a game from its credits. </p>
<p>In 2023, former Retro Studios engineer Zoid Kirsch said he was "let down" by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-retro-studios-engineer-let-down-by-metroid-prime-remasters-lack-of-credit-for-original-team">lack of individual credits in Metroid Prime Remastered</a>. Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">translators contracted from firms outside of Nintendo voiced their disappointment at not being credited for work on high-profile games</a>.</p>

Asked by former Lumon retiree Mark W. (Bob Balaban), the question’s target is Miss Huang, played with bone-chilling apathy by Sarah Bock. Huang is one of the newest additions to the <em>Severance</em> world, and her mere existence on the severed floor comes with some disturbing implications. And that’s before we get into how she acts like a Lumon Terminator awaiting kill commands.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Season 2 premiere isn’t the Season 1 epilogue we may have hoped for given the cliffhangers of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ben-stiller-apple-severance-season-1-finale-news-1851741591?_gl=1*1487cjo*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzA2MjIzMi4yOTYuMS4xNzM3MDYzODgyLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ben-stiller-apple-severance-season-1-finale-news-1851741591?_gl=1*1487cjo*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzA2MjIzMi4yOTYuMS4xNzM3MDYzODgyLjYwLjAuMA..">that season’s finale</a></span>, but it does expand that maze of a world in terrifying ways. In the aftermath of what Lumon has dubbed the “Macrodat Uprising” involving the Macrodata Refinement crew’s Innies awakening in the outside world, Lumon has tried to clean up its act in a way only a soulless corporation would if their insidious operation was exposed to the public. Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) has been replaced by Seth Milchick (Tramell Tillman) as the floor manager, with her manipulative intrusion into Mark S’s life reduced to her being a sadist scapegoat who “developed an erotic fixation on [Mark S.], and had plans to pursue [him and his Outie] in what may be termed a ‘throuple,’” according to Mr. Milchick. </p><p>The break room is now a lounge instead of a punishment chamber, a new family visitation room will allow Innie Dylan George (Zach Cherry) to spend time with his Outie’s wife, and Innies can walk around freely with a Hall Pass like grade schoolers. Lumon’s rebrand is suspicious at best, and deceptive at worst. And Ms. Huang is a reminder of how evil that company truly is.</p><p>Outside of the baby goats, no type of child has been seen on the severed floor, which makes sense because the work of adults is seldomly appropriate for a child. The fact they brought her in after an employee tried to hang themselves, another employee bit a superior and broke into the security room to wake themselves up, and the former floor manager was stalking one of the other employees either means they have no regard for a child’s safety, or that child is frighteningly equipped to deal with all of that. By the looks of the Season 2 premiere, it might be the latter.</p><p>Ms. Huang’s jovial nature is as contrived as that of any Lumon superior, and she can go from friendly to ferocious frighteningly fast. When Mark S. sarcastically intimates that she’s one of his new friends, she shoots him one of the iciest stares in <em>Severance </em>history before telling him, “I have to remind you I’m a supervisor...not a friend.” Then, she lets her subtle scolding hang in the air in a staring standoff with Mark S., almost as a way to let him know she is not to be fucked with like past supervisors. </p><p>There’s no telling how brainwashed the youngest<em> Severance</em> speaking character is but even so, the Season 2 premiere put enough fear in our hearts of just how depraved Lumon will reveal itself to be in the new season. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another PGA Tour title, another dilemma about which edition to buy. PGA Tour 2K25 has more editions than I have holes-in-one (zero, for what’s it worth), and each one has a unique selling point designed to pull you you in.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is the next iteration of 2K’s next-gen golf game. 2K23 was a step up from 2K21, but 2025’s big dog is ready to eat. It’s sporting new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-courses-in-pga-tour-2k25-dlc-courses-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">courses</a> and revamped features across the board. It’s like the excitement of the new Driver season where you can’t wait to see what the big brands have been cooking up.</p>



<p>2K hasn’t just been hard at work on gameplay and longevity, we have new editions to peruse.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-pga-tour-2k25-edition">Every PGA Tour 2K25 Edition</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Decisions, decisions. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Standard, Deluxe, and Legend Edition are available to pre-order for PGA Tour 2K25. </strong></p>



<p>Choosing a new launch’s edition is the equivalent of standing on a tee and deciding whether to slice the ball OB or snap hook it in the trees. All options are possible—and inevitable—but the choice is a tough one.</p>



<p>If 2K25 is your first foray into simulated golf or a new season in your accomplished career, we’ll help you with this agonizing decision.</p>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-standard-edition-explained">PGA Tour 2K25 Standard Edition Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Standard Edition. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>Standard is the basic edition of PGA Tour 2K25. It comes with the game—a cool pre-order bonus—and that’s it! If you’re mainly after 2K25 in its most basic and simplistic form (and cheapest), the Standard Edition is probably the one for you.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you get with the Standard Edition of PGA Tour 2K25:</p>



<ul>
<li>A base copy of PGA Tour 2K25.</li>



<li>Extra Butter x Adidas Pack
<ul>
<li>Chris McDonald Playable Character (Shooter McGavin from Happy Gilmore).</li>



<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Hat.</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-deluxe-edition-explained">PGA Tour 2K25 Deluxe Edition Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Deluxe Edition. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>Upgrading to the Deluxe Edition gives you a few extra yards off the tee—probably not, but you never know. I can say for sure you get the game, the pre-order bonus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>, and a few more goodies. The Deluxe Edition might be digital-only, meaning you have to buy it from an online storefront if you want it.</p>



<p>This is everything included in 2K25 Deluxe Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>7-Day Early Access.</li>



<li>A base copy of PGA Tour 2K25.</li>

<figure><figcaption>Legend Edition. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you didn’t think your bag could get any more full, in steps PGA Tour 2K25 Legend Edition. Again, this seems to be a digital-only edition. But getting it gets you six extra bundles to go along with Early Access and the game itself. This is for the ultimate golf enthusiast and also Tiger Woods fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> developer Creatures Inc. has finally unveiled how the incoming trading feature will work, but the community response was so poor it had to release a follow-up response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, and perhaps feared, by the Pokémon TCG Pocket community, there are fairly severe restrictions on the incoming trading mechanic, which still lacks a release date despite being confirmed for January. Creatures Inc. announced these on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Complaints are headlined by the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher. This means no ex level alternate art cards can be traded, not in their basic forms, rainbow bordered forms, immersive forms, or gold (Crown rarity) forms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. said only "certain cards from the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs will be able to be traded," though it's unclear if this solely refers to the 2 Star or higher restriction or if there are further cards banned from trading.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This all but confirms trading will arrive alongside the next full set, however, which is also due in January. Creatures Inc. is likely emphasizing that those new cards cannot be traded upon their release, but will seemingly be opened up to the feature later when it's less relevant. It also means the often timed exclusive Promo cards cannot be traded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other restrictions to trading apply too. Cards can only be traded between friends, which the community has deemed makes sense, and only cards of the same rarity can be traded, which has been accepted too. The last element that's frustrated many, however, is that "items must be consumed in order to trade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear what this means exactly. Pokémon TCG Pocket uses Hourglasses to pace certain features including pack opening, wonder picks, and event battles. One booster pack can be opened for free once every 12 hours, and one Pack Hourglass, for example, reduces that amount of time by one hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's therefore possible Trade Hourglasses will be implemented as an item, essentially restricting how often players can trade without spending real-world money. Another popular theory is that Shinedust, an item considered by many to have little value as it solely changes the visuals of cards, will work for trades too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pay Day</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This mechanic, alongside the other restrictions, are likely being implemented to encourage (and maintain) player spending, as Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">is estimated to have made $200 million in its first month alone</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as the digital TCG follows the standard mobile and free-to-play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real-world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">outside of the occasional set drop like Mythical Island</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading is undeniably a strong addition to Pokémon TCG Pocket that will improve the overall player experience, but fans have complained it's also fairly clearly being implemented as a means of increasing revenue too. Items being consumed in order to trade certainly alludes to this, as whether it's Trade Hourglasses or Shinedust or something else, players wanting to trade more regularly than the game deems okay will have to pay real money to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also evidenced in the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher, which after almost three months of play for dedicated fans, are the majority of cards they are still missing. But making these cards available to trade would be a threat to Creatures Inc.'s revenue; if players could immediately trade for their missing cards, they wouldn't need to spend $10 or $100 for a random chance of getting them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As noted by the player who spent $1,500 on completing the first set, it's these final few pieces that are most difficult to get and thus require the most money spent. The standard $9.99 purchasing option grants 57 PokéGold, an item which can be used to replace any of the Hourglasses otherwise available but at an increased rate. One PokéGold replaces two Pack Hourglasses, for example.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending $9.99 therefore lets players open 28 booster packs for a total of 140 cards. Booster packs work in the same as their real-world counterparts, or in digital terms, loot boxes, meaning nothing of (relative) value is guaranteed, never mind the specific card players are looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket does offer a mild alternative to finding these cards in the form of Pack Points; players earn five for every pack opened, and these can be exchanged for any card in the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exchanging a 2 Star rarity card costs 1,250 Pack Points, however. This means players must open 250 booster packs in total, or around $220 worth of PokéGold, for a single card. Considering there are 29 different 2 Star rarity cards in the first set alone, plus three 3 Star rarity cards which cost 1,500 Pack Points and three Crown rarity cards which cost 2,500, there are fairly sobering restrictions to this mechanic.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Trading Complaints</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading was therefore seen as a saving grace for players looking to collect every card (which is encouraged in-game via missions and rewards), but those hopes are all but dashed given Creatures Inc.'s announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not being able to trade 2 Star at least really makes me want to drop the game," said lilgalois on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1i30m2w/tcg_pocket_official_update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. "Trash system," said Ashamed-Teaching6837. "So extra 3 Star cards are just dead cards. What a crock," said Analogmon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Social media is full of such complaints, which seemingly grew so excessive that Creatures Inc. had to issue a rare response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you, everyone, for your immediate thoughts on this topic," Creatures Inc. said in a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880027099836411924" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> post. "Your concerns are seen. Once this feature becomes available, I'd like to invite everyone to try it and provide feedback. This way, the game can continue to evolve in an enjoyable way for everyone." Crucially, Creatures Inc. failed to say it would consider this criticism and aim to make changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-marvel-rivals-bot-conspiracy-explained<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There are no strings on me.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> continues to land atop Steam and Twitch charts, one issue has fans suspicious of their time with NetEase Games’ new hero shooter: bots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The superhero-themed competitive multiplayer experience launched in December to critical acclaim and praise from fans thanks to its style and creative use of iconic characters like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and, most recently, the Fantastic Four. It’s achieved so much success that hundreds of thousands of gamers are still firing up Marvel Rivals every day on Steam alone (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>). While NetEase’s new hero shooter has managed to dodge some of the pitfalls that trap other competitors in this space, fans have spent weeks raising concerns regarding how AI enemies have been implemented across several of its game modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know people may feel differently but playing against bots in (Quickplay) just doesn’t feel good at all to me,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnamlz/comment/m41caaq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>. “AI should be in AI modes and that’s it.”</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like other multiplayer games released over the last 15 years, Marvel Rivals offers practice modes that make it clear players will be competing against what many refer to as “bots.” These AI-driven opponents can often have their difficulty tweaked to a user’s liking, cementing these modes as valuable tools for those looking to improve their skills or cool down between the often more intense matches against human players. Where the Marvel video game is running into trouble is the appearance of what many believe are bots in standard Quickplay matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For weeks, social media has slowly flooded with posts from users concerned that they are being tossed into matches against low-level bot players, with some reporting that their teammates are also occasionally being replaced by bots. The jury’s out on what triggers these bot matches, but the working theory is that Marvel Rivals will match players into these comparatively easier matches after the occurrence of one too many losses. It’s a tactic that could keep players from feeling so defeated that they quit the game, and it may help users load into Quickplay matches without delay instead of sitting through long queue times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there is little transparency from NetEase regarding which players are bots or if there are bots in Quickplay matches at all — and the company has remained quiet thus far (IGN has asked for comment). More than a few posts caught fire on social media in the weeks since launch as players tried to establish what is and isn’t a red flag in the hope of finding their own solution. Examples include bizarre-but-repetitive behavior in-game to similarities between each teammate’s names, including team names filled with single words and all capital letters or names split between one full name and one half name. The most telling sign, though, is when every enemy’s career profile is labeled “restricted.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The fact that you can even get bot games after wins and that the game doesn't tell you that you're against bots is what gets me about this,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnamlz/comment/m42u5ep/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. “You don't want to learn new heroes in comp because people will understandably rage at you for doing that, but if you try to learn a hero in (Quickplay) you now have to second guess if you actually are getting any better on that hero or if the game is just making you think you are because it's handing you free wins in the form of bots.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of bots in multiplayer games is far from new; players have argued about how bots could be impacting their Fortnite performance for years. As for Marvel Rivals, some have called for the option to toggle bot matches on or off, while others want the feature removed completely. There is also a selection of players who don’t mind fighting against the occasional bot lobby, explaining that they use these matches as an opportunity to complete a few specific hero achievements. Reddit user ciaranxy began to question some of their matches shortly after launch and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnamlz/everything_you_need_to_know_about_marvel_rivals/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created a post calling on the community to do the same</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, you can choose to believe this is an issue or not – that is your CHOICE,” ciaranxy says in the post. “But – for everyone else – when you press Quickplay, NetEase does not give you a choice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played Marvel Rivals for more than a few hours since launch, there’s a good chance you found yourself in one of the questionable lobbies that has others so fired up. I can confirm running into at least one suspicious Quickplay match that featured more than a few of the elements players have warned of, including stiff player movement, similarly structured names, and three teammates and an entire enemy team with restricted profiles. We’ve reached out to NetEase for clarification about the matches that have players concerned and the alleged existence of bots in Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While users flock to investigate bots across gaming, you can learn more about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-are-using-the-invisible-woman-to-detect-alleged-bot-matches"><u>how some Marvel Rivals players are using the Invisible Woman to literally stop bots in their tracks</u></a>.

            <p>Riot Games is running in-game events from next week to raise funding for those impacted by the LA fires.</p>
<p>After hundreds of thousands of people were placed under evacuation orders and the devastation of the wildfires sweeping across Los Angeles became apparent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-tells-staff-impacted-by-la-wildfires-that-what-matters-most-is-taking-care-of-yourselves-and-each-other">Riot was one of several video game companies to reach out to employees</a> to tell them to take care of themselves ahead of work.</p>
<p>Now Riot is inviting its players to support those impacted by the catastrophe via in-game donations through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and Valorant.</p>
<p>From 22nd-30th January, Valorant's EX.O Collection will become a Give Back Bundle, with proceeds from weapon skins and accessories in the bundle going to the Riot Games Social Impact Fund, a donor-advised fund account sponsored by ImpactAssets.</p>
<p>In League of Legends, from 23rd January until 5th February, proceeds from Firefighter Tristana - who will be unvaulted for this fundraiser - will also go to the Riot Games Social Impact Fund.</p>
<p>Riot also launched a "double-donation" campaign last week, tripling the charitable contributions of its staff to organisations like the California Fire Foundation, Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation, International Medical Corps, American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen. Riot has also made direct donations to the California Fire Foundation and International Medical Corps to support relief efforts.</p><p>"While these are incredibly difficult times and there is a long road to recovery ahead, I’m grateful that we’re collectively in this together - no matter where we are in the world," said CEO A. Dylan Jadeja. "Thank you for all of your support."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Dragon Age: The Veilguard Game Director is reportedly leaving BioWare after having worked on the game since February 2022.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<span>reliable journalist <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1880113210470371790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Grubb</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer reported</a></span>, Corinne Busche will depart the team responsible for so many excellent role-playing games in the coming weeks. The studio, on the other hand, will not be affected by any other changes. According to Eurogamer, the game's performance on the market did not affect this departure.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard definitely did have an easy development. The new entry in the celebrated series has been in the works for over ten years and went through a few development reboots before finally releasing last year. Despite all the development troubles, the game turned out well, as Alessio highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, but sales likely haven't been stellar, as both BioWare and EA have not commented on them since launch.</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>Announced today, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC will be playable on the Steam Deck on release day.</p>



<p>When Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC is released on January 23, 2024, Steam Deck owners <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1879895195178901895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can play the game</a> anywhere they want: on the train, in the park, on a flight, or in the car. The official announcement post also features the game running on the handheld console, and it seems the device can handle the title seamlessly, with no visible stuttering or performance issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the arrival of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck, Square Enix has revealed a limited-edition Fluffy Chocobo Steam Deck. The custom edition covers the entire handheld console in bright yellow Chocobo feathers. The game developers have stated that they don’t advise wrapping up “high-tech gaming gear in fur at home, ” so they have made the casing removable.</p>

<p>Apart from the Steam Deck, FF 7 Rebirth PC will be best experienced on a desktop where you can take advantage of enhanced features such as 120fps, refined lighting, improved environment detail, and more detailed textures. Depending on your setup, you can also benefit from improved framerates and image quality with NVIDIA DLSS.

            <p>
Japanese police have arrested a man accused of modifying and selling Nintendo Switch consoles.
</p>
<p>
It's the first time someone under suspicion of breaking the country's Trademark Act by handling modded Switch consoles has been arrested, <a href="https://news.ntv.co.jp/n/rkc/category/society/rcc5bf23d3d9bd40b5bc4da1bb34648d49">NTV News</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-man-arrested-for-selling-modded-nintendo-switch-consoles-setting-a-new-precedent/">Automaton</a>) reports, potentially setting a new, harsher precedent for the future.
</p>
<p>
The 58-year-old suspect is believed to have made a business out of modifying second-hand Switch consoles so that they play pirated games, and reselling these modded units for 28,000 yen (about £150) apiece.

<p>
The man, who has reportedly admitted to the charge, also offered a bundle of 27 pirated games to play on the modded consoles for an additional fee.
</p>
<p>
Today's news comes just days after the deputy general manager of Nintendo's Japanese intellectual property department said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-attorney-explains-why-its-strengthening-measures-against-illegal-emulation">the company was beefing up its stance against illegal emulation</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is of course no stranger to legal action when it feels its products are under threat, and has made an example out of individuals in the past.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jail-term-for-nintendo-pirate-gary-bowser-was-unique-opportunity-to-set-example-court-documents-reveal">Nintendo lawyer pressed to ensure the maximum five-year jail time was handed down to the infamous Gary Bowser</a> - who worked as part of another business that enabled Switch piracy - as it would be "a large benefit to further education of the public".
</p><p>
Speaking last year, Bowser - now freed from prison but in financial debt to Nintendo due to fines for the rest of his working life - said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-says-nintendo-wanted-to-send-a-message-with-sentence">his sentence had been designed like a message</a> "to other people that [are] still out there, that if they get caught ... [they'll] serve hard time".

            <p>Director and writer David Lynch, known for his surreal work across film and television, has passed away at the age of 78.</p>
<p>Announcing his death on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidlynchofficial/posts/pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl?rdid=581XjlBlb3GqM8zP#">Facebook</a> yesterday, Lynch's family wrote: "It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch. We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There’s a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole'. It’s a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way."</p>
<p>While Lynch is best known for his work on TV series such as Twin Peaks and films like Mulholland Drive, the creator is also a memorable part of PlayStation's history, responsible for several iconic PS2 adverts which arrived with that unmistakable Lynchian brand of surrealism and shades of neo-noir.</p>

<p>The most famous of these adverts is the brilliantly bonkers black-and-white affair known as Welcome To The Third Space. Kicking off with a wailing siren, a voice asks through a speaker: "Where are we?" A man walks through a corridor, his head detaches from his body, it reattaches, an arm comes out from his mouth.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Third Place," quacks a suited duck. </p>
<p>The iconic trailer was shared by <a href="https://x.com/PlayStationAU/status/1880104053184811213">PlayStation Australia</a> in the early hours of this morning. "RIP David Lynch," PlayStation AU wrote. You can experience the trailer once again in the video above.</p>

<p>Posting on social media last night, Remedy boss and Alan Wake writer Sam Lake shared his sadness at Lynch's passing. "David Lynch has been a huge inspiration to me and a huge influence on my work," he wrote. "Rest in peace."</p>
<p>In a separate post, Lake revealed that Remedy's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> team had used the code name "Big Fish" for its surreal sequel, a nod to Lynch's autobiography and self-help guide Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity.</p>
<p>"I think David Lynch is swimming with the big fish now," Lake shared with an image of the book. "His influence goes far and wide and will live on."</p>

<p>It’s not even been a full day since the Nintendo Switch 2 was revealed, and the pre-order sign-ups have already started popping up for the upcoming console. Best Buy was the first to join the fray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sign-up-for-notifications-at-best-buy/1100-6528859/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a>, you will see a new sign-up page for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders if you go to <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch/nintendo-notifications/pcmcat1736965129196.c?id=pcmcat1736965129196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy’s website</a> right now. However, the signup doesn’t confirm the pre-order for you; instead, it sends out notifications when pre-orders go live, announcements regarding games for the upcoming console are released and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details such as pricing or availability have not been provided on Best Buy’s Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order sign-up page, as the company has yet to release that information. However, Nintendo will reveal the pricing, release date, games arriving for the console, and the device’s capabilities during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Direct event</a> for the Switch 2 on April 2, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, only the console and some of its functionality have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>. The Switch 2 will feature a larger console and joy-cons that snap to the device now instead of sliding in. The console’s colour has changed too, with the company going for an all-black casing with red and blue accents. Players can also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-experience-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on experience</a> with the highly anticipated Switch 2 in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hype for the Nintendo Switch 2 has been unreal, so much so that analysts have already claimed that the new console will sell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-20-million-sales-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 20 million units</a> in the first year. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here’s a guide</a> on all the Nintendo Switch 2 leaks, rumours and other information.

            <p>Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war">God Of War</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">a report</a> by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demons-souls">Demon's Souls</a> remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The natural worry here is that the decision will lead to layoffs. Sony confirmed the cancellations, saying they took place after an internal "review". However they wouldn't commit to an answer about employee job security, saying only that they didn't intend to close the studios. Meanwhile, a memo was sent in an effort to reassure staff, letting them know PlayStation would try to "ensure there is minimal business impact". The company would be working with the studios to figure out what they'll be working on next, PlayStation <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfrztbks25">told Bloomberg</a>. </p>
<p>"Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family," they said in a statement to Bloomberg, "and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects."</p>
<p>Ominous. We didn't hear much talk about the God Of War game before now. But we knew something was afoot at Bend when they began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-devs-are-getting-back-in-the-saddle-and-hiring-someone-with-live-service-experience">hiring for staff with experience making blockbuster live service games</a>. Even at the time it seemed unusual for this single player studio to pivot to live service, but this is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">general trend chased by Sony</a> since 2022, albeit one they seem to be abandoning of late. The company have cancelled a few other live service projects in recent years, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-cancel-the-last-of-us-online-while-teasing-new-single-player-projects">a multiplayer game based on The Last Of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alleged-leaked-spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-shows-off-insomniacs-cancelled-co-op-spin-off">a co-op Spiderman</a> game. </p><p>Cancellations are fairly common in the industry, so arguably this is not that unusual. But it does look like the fear has truly been injected into Sony by hydraulic needle following the fate of online hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, a flop estimated to have cost the company at least $200 million, with the real cost likely being higher than that. That includes the human cost of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">all the workers who lost their jobs</a> when the studio was shuttered as a result.</p>
<p>Live service is an interesting monster in the grander ecosystem of videos gamesing. Huge corporations are attracted to the model thanks to certain heavy hitters like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> retaining a magical dollar-shitting ability for years and years and years. But they can be massively attention-demanding for the average player - how many of this type of game can you really play on the reg? My feelings about games-as-a-service is broadly in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">Edwin's recent eloquent scribblethoughts</a>. Here's a good part of that: </p>
<blockquote>Even before they became ubiquitous, live service games felt like a burden. They are inherently exhausting to think about. The business model is the experience in a way that it isn't for anything you "buy once" and theoretically enjoy in your "own time", away from the sludgepumps of commerce - it breaks the golden rule that art created under capitalism should at least feel like it's an escape from capitalism, by forcing you to think of playing as an on-going interaction with an evolving product.</blockquote>

            <p>Nintendo's share price has dropped in the wake of the Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-switch-2-is-the-end-of-innovative-nintendo-theres-much-to-be-sad-about">"safe" debut</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/17/nintendo-shares-tumble-as-switch-2-reveal-disappoints-fans">Al Jazeera</a>, stocks fell by as much as 7.2 percent after the hardware's formal announcement. Prices did bounce back a little, but by 4pm local time, share prices were still down 4.2 percent.</p>
<p>That said, since the end of last year, Nintendo's share price <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTDOY/?guccounter=1">has been so strong</a>, the Japanese firm's stock value still sits on a near all-time high.</p>

<p>Whilst many factors contribute to a company's share price - and we still don't yet know all the technical specifications - it's widely speculated that due to the furore generated by the rumours over many weeks and months and the perceived lack of innovation between the two generations of hardware, the reception to Switch 2's debut from some quarters was somewhat flat.</p>

            <p>After eons of waiting, Nintendo has <em>finally </em>debuted its next console. Yes, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> - as we can now call it officially - was revealed yesterday, with a brief teaser video full of magnetic Joy-Cons and some really rather yummy noises.</p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer have our own thoughts on Nintendo's reveal (be sure to check out Bertie's feature<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-switch-2-is-the-end-of-innovative-nintendo-theres-much-to-be-sad-about"> If Switch 2 is the end of innovative Nintendo, there's much to be sad about</a> and Donlan's one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-the-switch-2-is-safe-then-im-jason-statham-and-i-want-to-star-in-it">If the Switch 2 is safe, then I'm Jason Statham and I want to star in it</a>, for two sides of the discussion).</p>

            <p>Superheroes often conceal their identities behind masks, capes and in my case, a pungent snood-and-hoodtop combo that makes me look like I've crawled out of a drain. No, don't ask what my real superhero identity is. After all, knowing my secrets might expose you to the wrath of my enemies. And in any case, I don't trust you. It turns out <em>some</em> of you people have been keeping secrets from me, as well. You have been furtively playing superhero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> with a keyboard and mouse adapter, which makes it look as though you're playing with a controller, so that you can take advantage of controller features such as high-sensitivity aim-assist in competitive play. </p><!--more-->
<p>Well, get ready to be unmasked, you awful sneaks, because developers NetEase are planning to crack down on this duplicitous practice. If they catch you faking a pair of analogue sticks, they might even suspend your account.</p>
<p>"We define keyboard and mouse adapters as the use of software or hardware to mimic controller inputs with a keyboard and mouse," explains <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250113/40955_1206338.html">a post on the game's forums</a>. "This method can grant an unfair edge in competitive play, for example, harnessing high sensitivity with the aim-assist features. Some common adapters include the XIM series, Cronus Zen series, Titan Two series, KeyMander series, and Brook Sniper series, among others. Any device enabling keyboard and mouse emulation of controller inputs, even if not explicitly listed, will be considered a keyboard and mouse adapter."</p>
<p>Perhaps you think you can slip the strong grasp of Justice by means of ratlike cunning. Fool! Ratlike cunning is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Tomalin">the exclusive preserve of journalists</a>. And besides, NetEase "have forged a strong detection tool" which they will "couple with the keen judgment of our watchful human eyes to accurately identify those using keyboard and mouse adapters."</p><p>I know that it's written in character, but I'm slightly alarmed that NetEase feel it necessary to specify that their eyes are human. Perhaps it's all a ruse. Perhaps everybody in the office is an Ultron clone, and banning mouse and keyboard adaptors is all part of some globe-toppling Master Plan.</p>
<p>Even if it is, I can't argue with the point that tricksy M&amp;K bolt-ons give some users an unsporting edge. "We believe that gaining an unjust advantage through such methods significantly impacts the gaming experience for our players," the NetEase post continues. "Therefore, whether on PC or console, we will take measures to vanquish this nefarious behavior. Penalties for users of keyboard and mouse adapters may include temporary or permanent account suspensions, removal from leaderboards, or other punishments depending on the circumstances."</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to be very popular. And chaotic, given that the entire cast are superheroes. This is a game in which everybody needs to feel like they could dominate. I don't envy the devs trying to distinguish the superpowered from the overpowered, let alone flush out the cheaters. If you missed it earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-new-heroes-every-three-month-season-say-netease-and-no-theyre-not-adding-role-queue">they're planning to add two new characters a season</a>, so the balancing is only going to get more complicated from here.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Allow me to explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supersleuths on the Hollow Knight subreddit</a> noticed that on January 15, co-director of Team Cherry William Pellen had changed his Twitter/X profile picture to a picture of a chocolate cake. Pellen tweeted: “something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow</p>— little bomey (@everydruidwaswr) <a href="https://twitter.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal was rumored for January 16, and so it proved. That was the day <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">Nintendo finally announced the Switch 2</a>, although there are still a number of burning questions we have about the next-gen console. Had Pellen really asked followers to keep an eye out for the Switch 2 reveal? If so, why?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the point where the Hollow Knight community went into overdrive — or off the deep end, depending on your point of view. Fans reverse-searched the picture of the cake, which led them to a recipe for Brooklyn Blackout Cake on cooking website <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bon Appétit</a>. The date the recipe was published: April 2, 2024.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/17/screenshot-2025-01-17-094610-1737107179081.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Is the cake a lie? Image credit: <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake">Bon Appétit.</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Why would that date be important here? Because Nintendo has confirmed Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 will air on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. That’s right, fans think Pellen has kicked off a Silksong alternate reality game (ARG) with that tweet and that picture of the cake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans haven’t stopped there. They’re currently trying to work out what Pellen’s new X/Twitter handle, @everydruidwaswr, means, if anything. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i36zi6/comment/m7l3uqu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor Representative-True has the best theory I’ve seen so far</a>: “The character limit on Twitter handles is 15 characters, which is the length of ‘everydruidwaswr.’ I think “wr” is likely the start of a word, like wrong or something. I have yet to decipher this, but the Druid of the Moss Temple is a Silksong NPC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plot thickens! Pellen has a new X/Twitter name to go along with the new handle and profile picture: little bomey. What’s that about? Fans have noticed Little Boomey is a wine from Southern Australia, where Team Cherry is based, but the spelling is different. What could it mean?!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch">when Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced</a>, Team Cherry confirmed launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. But that was six years ago. Has Nintendo snapped up Hollow Knight: Silksong as a Switch 2 launch title? Is it a timed exclusive? Is this all just bonkers behavior from information-starved fans?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have a few months to find out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/what-we-played-marvel-rivals-kingdom-come-dynasty-warriors-origins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve been starting 2025 with a bout of flu – thanks, 2025 – but on the plus side that’s meant I’ve been tucked up in bed with my ROG Ally, Balatro, and the end of Metaphor ReFantazio. These are all good things. Other than that, I’ve been slowly making my way through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-best-experienced-as-a-serial-just-like-the-films-that-inspired-it/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> (Microsoft’s cloud streaming for this is impeccable), some Kingdom Come: Deliverance to see what it’s all about, and a tiny bit of Marvel Rivals too. Life could be worse, in other words.</p>
<p>But what about everyone else? <strong>Aran</strong> played Space Marine, the first one, as it’s been in his backlog forever. He told us, “It’s a nice throwback to the PS3 and 360 era of third-person shooters with obvious heavy influence from Gears of War. I was also surprised to see that the online was still quite active. I’ve also been playing more Witcher 3 and have just landed on Skellige.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has been hopelessly glued to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> which he says is easily the best game in the series to date. Giving us some detail, he said, “After the mess that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">DW9</a> I honestly didn’t have much hope for the series, but somehow Omega Force has managed the impossible. Although there was a cathartic joy in mindlessly hammering out button combos, Origins offers a genuine test of skill and a wealth of content I’m actually eager to explore and replay. Hopefully its glowing critical reception will translate into commercial success, cementing a sequel, and an “Origins” style shake-up for Samurai Warriors.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played the System Shock remake, which he says “could have done with a bit more remaking, I get it’s a classic game but it just feels so dated.” He hasn’t really enjoyed much gaming this week, to be honest, saying, “I also played The Stanley Parable and I am going to be a grumpy old man and say I didn’t think much of it at all, the narrator started getting on my tits mansplaining everything. I also played Suicide Squad (spot the theme here?) which I didn’t get past the Shark guy tutorial because it was so fricking dull, it felt like someone had tried to make Destiny by committee. I also played the new Destiny 2 episode which wasn’t particularly great either. I do have LEGO Horizon sat on my table so I’m hoping that will save the week.” Let us know if it’s saved the day TC!</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 for review next month, Cuisineer also for review, and a bit of Black Ops 6 Multiplayer for not review. That’s not all, but much like TC, the further gaming hasn’t been all that enjoyable – “I’ve also been playing Veilguard, which is about fifteen layers of disappointment. It feels shallow, dialogue is poor, a main character’s voice can’t pull off the role, I can’t explore during actual missions without hitting twenty dead ends I have to come back to later. The only thing it almost excels at is graphics, but even then the generic aesthetic where even Qunari don’t look particularly alien anymore is just shite.”</p>
<p><strong>Reuben</strong> has only been playing Marvel Rivals, hammering away at the season pass and getting reasonably good with Squirrel Girl and Rocket Raccoon. He says, “I’m loving the new additions to the game with Season 1 and looking forward to seeing what the second half of the season brings.”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played through the first Gears of War on Series S (360 rather than remaster) as he fancied actually playing the series through (previously only played the remaster of 1 on PC). What did he think? “It was fun but hasn’t aged that well. Started the second one now which feels like a pretty big leap forwards. I’ve reinstalled Another Crab’s Treasure after getting distracted and completely forgetting what I was doing in it and it is still one of the best Souls-likes out there. Not resorted to using the gun yet but leaving it open as an option if I get super stuck. Picked up Blade Chimera on Steam (cheaper if you already own Bloodstained) as that’s been on my radar for a long while.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Tef</strong>. He dabbled with a little bit of the original Space Marine, similar to Aran dragging it out of his backlog, stomped through the opening level of RoboCop: Rogue City (which he previously played for preview), and played something secret and shadowy that he’ll talk about next week. He’s also just about to start playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-is-out-now/">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> and a roguelike Tetris kind of thing called Drop Duchy.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>
