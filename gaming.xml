		<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> – Escalation of Freedom update, the biggest update for the game so far, which will be coming out next month on 6th August</p>
<p>Escalation of Freedom will add a lot to Helldivers 2, bringing larger enemy outposts than ever, new and returning enemies for bots and bugs, new mission objectives and a new top tier of difficulty: Combat Rating 10.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Escalation of Freedom Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQl2BmhSCsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the most eye-catching new enemies is a returning monster from the original Helldivers, the Impaler, which sprouts tentacles out of the ground and does plenty of stabbing. There’s also the Spore Charger, which comes with a movable cloud of fog. Meanwhile the Automatons now have an artillery tank that can fire a barrage up and over to attack you. In general, there’s also other variants of other enemies to test yourself against.</p>


<p>Tier 10 will be the new top difficulty, but there will also be new supersized enemy camps and fortresses, which will be a real challenge to take on but promise even more high-end rewards: Super Samples. New mission objectives like Retrieve Larvae channel a bit of Death Stranding, but with larval cries bringing more swarming Terminids to you.</p>
<p>Helping to add more visual variety is a spookier version of the swamp planet, acid storm weather effects will also drain enemy armour as well as yours.</p>
<p>There’s more surprises waiting players on 6th August, but Arrowhead is also promising to fix and mitigate some pesky bugs and issues. A system to address kicking to grief will be implemented, so any player that is kicked will spawn into a new session as a host with all the team’s loot available to be picked up personally before extraction, though it’s still going to feel pretty crappy if someone kicks you from their party at the last moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has taken to social media to address the ongoing controversy surrounding one of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' main characters, the Black samurai Yasuke.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ubisoft describes the rationale behind making Yasuke explicitly a samurai, something which is a "matter of debate and discussion" when it comes to real history, as Ubisoft acknowledges.</p>
<p>The studio says that the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is all about taking "creative license" and incorporating "fantasy elements" in order to craft "engaging and immersive experiences", and the depiction of Yasuke as a samurai is "an illustration of this", according to Ubisoft.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-ubisoft-combat.jpg?itok=XTgcZR8u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-ubisoft-combat.jpg?itok=AnnuJ_UX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft's depiction of real-life historical figure Yasuke in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has caused controversy.</figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft goes on to say that it has "woven" Yasuke's identity as a samurai "carefully" into the storyline of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, and that shinobi Naoe, who's the game's second protagonist, is "equally important".</p>
<p>The studio also says it's "put significant effort" into making sure that its representation of Feudal Japan is "immersive and respectful", but that the intent with&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>was never to depict history as it happened. Rather, the point is to "spark curiosity" and learn more about the real historical settings in which the games take place.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft does acknowledge that its creative team worked with "external consultants, historians, researchers, and internal teams at Ubisoft Japan" for&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, the studio says that the creative teams alone are responsible for decisions "taken in the interests of gameplay and entertainment".</p>
<p>For <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology">elements in its promotional materials</a> that "caused concern within the Japanese community", Ubisoft says it "sincerely apologize[s]", but it asks players not to direct criticism at either internal or external collaborators.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-naoe.jpg?itok=AmE-uzBy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-naoe.jpg?itok=iPoXglD8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will have two protagonists.</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://time.com/6978997/assassins-creed-shadow-yasuke-controversy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">controversy</a> to which Ubisoft is referring revolves around Yasuke, one of the game's playable protagonists. He's a real-life historical figure, but there's a debate amongst some academics surrounding whether or not he was actually a samurai.</p>
<p>Some are angry that Yasuke has been cast as a samurai, while others suggest that the protagonist of a game set in feudal Japan should be a Japanese person (which is a little difficult to swallow given that Japanese shinobi Naoe is the game's other main character).</p>
<p>It's unlikely that Ubisoft's words will mollify some of the more...shall we say "intense" arguments against Yasuke's inclusion in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, but it will hopefully put some of the less rational arguments to rest.&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>launches on November 15th <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/shadows" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

So, it’s not terribly surprising that boutique keyboard maker Angry Miao is getting in on some of that sweet nostalgia with its latest mechanical board, the Game Boy-inspired <a href="https://store.angrymiao.com/pages/am-rgb-65">AM RGB 65</a>.</p><p>But the real surprise is that what at first blush looks like a near-$600 parts bin rehash of <a href="https://www.angrymiao.com/en/cyberboard/">an existing board</a> is actually Angry Miao’s best mech to date.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>There’s a lot of Cyberboard DNA here, but oh so much better.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The RGB 65 is a 65 percent layout keyboard, but its large dot matrix LED forehead means it takes up almost as much space as most 75 percent keyboards. It looks a whole lot like a shrunken-down <a href="https://www.angrymiao.com/en/cyberboard/">Cyberboard</a>, but thankfully, it takes more design cues from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/17/18306278/game-boy-30th-anniversary-console-pokemon-blue-video-games">one of the most beloved</a> handheld devices in human history than from a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184698/tesla-cybertruck-vandal-deface-elon-musk">frequently mocked</a> rolling dumpster.</p><p>The retro vibes are most pronounced on the white and purple versions, but all colors of the RGB 65 have small homages to Nintendo’s industrial design from the original “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy#:~:text=The%20codename%20for,01.%22%5B12%5D">DMG-01</a>” Game Boy. This includes a curved bottom-right corner with six slats mimicking the speaker grill, a negative relief D-pad cutout surrounding the USB-C port, and mock B and A buttons on the bottom, which replace the wireless charging pad found on other AM models. Another aesthetic flourish is a <em>Galaga</em> pixel art graphic adorning the plastic antenna window that lets the Bluetooth 5.1 and 2.4GHz wireless connections through the all-metal chassis.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</p><p><figcaption><em>The curved corner and slats pay homage to the original Game Boy’s speaker grill.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Typing on the RGB 65 is a breath of fresh air compared to previous Angry Miao boards. The marbly sound signature is still present, but the new Icy Silver V2 linear switches with their nylon housings and revised internal design give the RGB 65 a deeper, much more “thocky” sound than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23885308/dry-studio-black-diamond-75-mechanical-keyboard-specs-price-impressions">any other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23416961/angry-miao-adjustable-flex-alice-mechanical-keyboard-anime-availability-specs-price">AM keyboard</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23571851/angry-miao-65-design-touch-mechanical-keyboard-price-specs">I’ve tried</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Icy Silver V2 Pro switches are part of what gives the RGB 65 it’s thocky tone. The cutouts in the Polyoxymethylene (POM) plate combined with adjustable leaf springs give the keys a bit of flex while typing.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This board is actually bigger than my personal Meletrix Zoom75, which is a 75-percent keyboard with more keys in a smaller footprint.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’m relieved to see Angry Miao making strides in the sound and typing feel departments. While I’ve personally enjoyed the sound of most prior AM keyboards, it’s all very subjective. And the “meta” around what’s popular in the custom mechanical keyboard scene <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_N8k0u75eLQ">continues to evolve</a>. I think Angry Miao is doing a fine job keeping up with trends here, and it needs to.&nbsp;This is a very expensive keyboard that should feel good and sound great out of the box, especially when you consider it rehashes a big design element from the Cyberboard.</p><p>The 200-LED dot matrix panel on the Cyberboard always looked charming, but while it’s recycled on the RGB 65, it’s better implemented and slightly more practical. Instead of being angled away from you and upside-down like on the Cyberboard, it’s flat on the main deck and easy to see. It’s still mostly a flashy novelty to go along with the RGB light show under the keys, but you can use <a href="https://diy.angrymiao.com/index/am-rgb-65/">Angry Miao’s site</a> to do some deep customization or download fully baked presets from the community. It’s fun to tinker with, even if I end up using it as a big desk clock most of the time.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The RGB 65’s white version seems like the correct color for the most nostalgia.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Angry Miao</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>And the violet model has a unique surface treatment, made using multicolor anodizing, though it costs about $40 extra.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Angry Miao</cite></p></div></div><p>But the most underwhelming bit of the RGB 65 is this “cyber gray” color combo, at least in comparison to the white and “violet fury” options. It looks slick in its own right, sure, but the other two feel like where it’s at for the maximum Game Boy vibes. Perhaps if the gray model used opaque light gray or charcoal black keycaps, it could channel a tiny bit of the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FHardware%2FNintendo-History%2FGame-Boy-Advance-SP%2FGame-Boy-Advance-SP-627141.html">Game Boy Advance SP</a> or <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Boy_Pocket">Game Boy Pocket</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Like most Angry Miao keyboards, the RGB 65 certainly has desk presence.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Either way, the RGB 65 desperately needs some see-through <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-FL.jpg">atomic purple</a> or <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Jungle_green_Nintendo_64_%2810448842084%29.jpg/1200px-Jungle_green_Nintendo_64_%2810448842084%29.jpg?20170305103708">jungle green</a> action (which is another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products">ongoing trend</a>), so I hope Angry Miao considers a cheaper all-plastic version in the future. I’d even be willing to sacrifice a bit of that thock if Angry Miao can allow itself to not overengineer every little thing from aluminum.</p><p>The AM RGB 65’s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/angrymiao/am-rgb-65-mechanical-keyboard-with-diy-led-screen">Kickstarter campaign</a> launches today, starting at $449 for a bare-bones kit (no keycaps or switches) and tops out at $598 for a full prebuilt bundle in violet. Angry Miao is running an early-bird 8 percent discount for the first 48 hours of the campaign.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</em></p><div><p><strong>A note on crowdfunding:</strong></p><p>Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature: companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/fulfillment">study run by Kickstarter in 2015</a>, roughly 1 in 10 “successful” products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there’s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. </p><p>The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember: you’re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> will receive its biggest update yet in August, bringing higher difficulty, greater mission variety, and more.
</p>
<p>
Escalation of Freedom is the name of the update, which will arrive on 6th August. Details have been provided on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/?sf274009068=1">PlayStation Blog</a> from social media and community manager at developer Arrowhead, Katherine Baskin.

</p>
<p>
The update will also add new enemy types, including a favourite from the first game, and will make steps to mitigate the problem of grief kicking.
</p>

<p>

Fitting with the title, the update will introduce Combat Rating 10 as a new higher difficulty of Helldiving. "Super Helldive is our most challenging, most relentless dive difficulty level yet, and we hope that this is going to give players the intensity they're looking for on the battlefield. And with a great challenge comes greater rewards," said Baskin on the blog.
</p>
<p>
New mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts will be added too, with new Super Sample rewards. The mission objectives will be available on other difficulty levels, not just CR 10.
</p>
<p>
Next up are new enemies, including the Impaler from the original Helldivers with its huge tentacles and the new Spore Charger that's like the regular Charger but shrouded in fog. There will also be the Terminid Alpha Commander, a supercharged version of the Brood Commander.

<p>
As for Automatons, new bots are on the way like the formidable Rocket Tank and more.
</p>
<p>
The swamps will see a makeover too, with rolling fog, blackened trees, and a haunted atmosphere.

 </a>
<figcaption>Spooky vibes | <span>Image credit: <cite>Arrowhead</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Lastly, Arrowhead is looking to deal with grief kicking, where some players are using the team kicking to grief others.
</p>
<p>
With the update, the developer is introducing a new system where kicked players are spawned into a new session as the host with all loot from the previous session intact, while players in the previous session will receive a message in the chat widget.
</p>
<p>
"With these changes, all players have the opportunity to leave with all loot collected on mission, with no one Helldiver losing out," said Baskin. "We're committed to making changes that will improve the player experience and encourage healthy, cooperative gameplay."
</p>
<p>
Major fixes to the social menu are also coming to ensure playing with friends is easier.

The new trailer gives a better sense of the movie’s setup, how Harley and the Joker meet up, and the retro show biz-styled chaos that will ensue. </p><p>Take a look:</p><p>Incarcerated in Arkham Hospital after his rampage at the end of the first movie, Arthur Fleck and Harleen Quinzel begin indulging one another’s delusions of stardom while civil unrest boils up among disillusioned gangs of Jokerfied fans. The trailer ends with Joker and Harley on stage asking one another if they should give the audience what they want before blowing up the theater. </p><p> It’s possibly a meta-nod to the tension between what comic books fans might want from a Joker movie and director Todd Phillips ambitions in making what some insiders have referred to as a “Jukebox musical” structured more around vignettes and then overarching story. But the highlight for me was seeing Brendan Gleeson show up as a prison guard chiding a smirking Phoenix.</p><p>2019's <em>Joker </em>was a massive box office hit, bringing in over $1 billion worldwide despite its small budget. It hit at just the right time to give people fatigued from overdosing on the cookie-cutter MCU a different take on a comic book character origin movie, while also tapping into a lot of popular mythmaking populist undercurrents and anti-establishment sentiments during the first Trump presidency. It’ll be interesting to see whether the movie has anything to say about our national rerun five years later or it feels like a relic from a different, pre-pandemic era. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On the official <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO website</a>, new real-world LEGO sets based on Fortnite are now available for pre-order, with release dates currently slated for October 1, 2024.</p>



<p>The product line will include four unique sets featuring the iconic Battle Bus, Peely Bone, Durrr Burger, and Supply Llama. Although the United States LEGO site doesn’t have the Supply Llama online right now, its Fortnite theme page still mentions it. </p>



<p>Various leakers previously leaked these sets with <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1815518288404758919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts on X</a>, including ShiinaBR, ForwardLeaks, and SamLeakss.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Battle Bus comes with over 900 pieces and 9 minifigs based on classic Fortnite skins. Fans can pre-order the set now for $99.99. </p>



<p>LEGO lists Peely Banana as an adult set, with over 1400 pieces, movable arms, and a display stand. It also includes the “Peely Pick Pickaxe, paint launcher, and Banana Bag Back Bling.”</p>



<p>The Supply Llama includes nearly 700 pieces, a movable head and mouth, and a variety of familiar Fortnite gear like the Grappler and Slurp Juice.</p>



<p>The beloved Durrr Burger is the smallest set with just 193 pieces. However, it’s also the most affordable, coming in at $14.99.</p>



<p>The in-game collaboration between Fortnite and LEGO began in December 2023 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-lego-1200-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1200 cosmetics</a>. Fans widely praise the LEGO mode in Fortnite, so players are sure to enjoy real-world sets. </p>



<p>Most recently, Fortnite also rolled out a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/">Fall Guys crossover</a> today, alongside update v30.30.</p>

Each year, the Pokémon World Championships are held in a different city, and with it comes a Pokémon Center pop-up with exclusive merch themed after it. This year, the Pokémon World Championships are taking place at the Hawai'i Convention Center in Honolulu, so of course, the product line is tropical, colorful, and beachy. </p><p>"This year's unique items and motifs draw from the vibrant marine life and lush flora of Hawai'i, embodying the spirit and beauty of the islands," explained Cindy Ruppenthal, senior director of Pokémon Center and e-commerce at The Pokémon Company International. "The pop-up store’s design as well as the Worlds product line reminds fans to make the most of this amazing location—whether they’re lounging on the beach in Waikiki, hiking the Wiliwilinui Ridge Trail, or catching waves on the North Shore."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Exclusive 2024 Pokémon World Championships Merch</h3></div></output><p>Check out a large selection of what will be available at the 2024 Pokémon World Championships in the slideshow above. </p><p>Ruppenthal expects a strong demand for the Hawaiian-themed Pokémon ukulele, which appears to be the most exclusive and unique item in the lineup. The ukulele's MSRP is $59.99 USD. Ruppenthal also expects there to be a demand for other location-inspired products due to the Hawaiian theme, such as the Pokémon Aloha shirt. </p><p>Previously, The Pokémon Company International revealed a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Exclusive-Pikachu-Plush-and-Paradise-Resort-Promo-Card-Revealed-for-Up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sneak peek</a> of the Worlds-exclusive Pikachu plush in snorkeling gear and custom <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1813982078280560790" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Aloha shirt in a partnership with Reyn Spooner</a>, a local Hawaiian company known for making top-quality Aloha wear since 1956.

                <p>The US government didn't let Microsoft buy Activision Blizzard without a fight, although the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit to block the merger ultimately failed. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-takes-aim-at-microsoft-for-xbox-game-pass-changes/1100-6525134/" data-ref-id="1100-6525134">the FTC took aim at Microsoft again</a> with a filing in federal court that claimed the new Xbox Game Pass tier was a "degraded product." Now, Microsoft is firing back.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-slams-misleading-ftc-claims-over-xbox-game-pass-price-hike" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Microsoft responded to the FTC with a court filing of its own that was posted online by <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Ftomwarren%2Fstatus%2F1814438299844382964&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-fires-back-at-the-ftcs-claims-that-game-pass-has-been-degraded%2F1100-6525208%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge's Tom Warren</a>. The short version is that Microsoft acknowledges that the new Game Pass Standard tier is more expensive than the discontinued Game Pass Console tier, but it also offers multiplayer functionality that was previously sold separately. Additionally, the company argues that Game Pass Ultimate's price increase is justified because more new games will be available day and date on the service.</p><p>Essentially, Microsoft is claiming that the the FTC is trying to "reinvent" its case against the company's Activision Blizzard acquisition, and that it's "wrong to call this a 'degraded' version of the discontinued Game Pass for Console offering." The filing also notes that the FTC "barely mentioned subscription at trial" and restates that Microsoft signed a 10-year deal with Sony to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation as part of the original conditions for the merger.</p><p>So far, the federal court hasn't weighed in on the FTC's filing or Microsoft's response. It seems unlikely that the Activision Blizzard merger could be easily undone at this point. But it remains to be seen if the court will take a side in the latest battle.</p>

			<p>Once Human is a brand-new free-to-play <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-the-new-weird-survival-game-is-out-now-and-already-in-steams-top-10/">survival game</a> set in a post-apocalyptic world. You must survive in a world completely transformed by a cataclysmic event. You wake up in the unknown world and fight against the hundreds and thousands of alien-like creatures named the Aberrant, now infesting the planet. This game took off upon release on July 9, reaching over 230,000 peak players. With a number so significant as 230,000, it puts Once Human in fifth place on Steam's official charts for the most played games.</p>
<p>With the market of post-apocalyptic and survival games being heavily saturated, the unique art style and weird aesthetic of Once Human played into its favor. Alongside the fun combat and gameplay, these features helped boost Once Human to the top.</p>
<p>In addition to hitting 230,000 peak players in-game for Once Human, they have also reached 500,000 members in the game's official Discord server.</p>
<p>As the game has been highly successful so far, the developers for Once Human have shared their road map and shown what updates they plan on bringing to the game over the coming seasons. The first major update is due in September, and Starry Studios has begun to tease what players can expect from the upcoming update.</p>
<p>Players have already had a busy month in July. Not only was the game fully released, but players got to be introduced to the Manibus, an eldritch entity that is terrorizing the world, where you have to team up with others to fight against it in the Prime War.</p>
<p>The latest update for Once Human will introduce a new PvP gameplay scenario in which a battle breaks out between the world's major factions, Mayflies and Rosetta. Along with the PvP scenario, those who prefer to stick to the story and explore the world in solitude can look forward to a PvE scenario. Within the PvE scenario, a new region will be explored, where players can climb mountains in the north, fend for themselves against new monsters, and experience brand-new challenges as they navigate the rocky terrain.</p>
<p>While all of this information is available to learn more about on the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Once Human website</a>, a release date for the updates has not yet been released; however, the PvP scenario, at the very least, will be released relatively soon, with the website giving an estimated release date of September. As for the new PvE scenario, it is marked as "coming soon."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/amazon-prime-video-ui-subscriptions-fallout-1851602153<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a subscriber to Amazon Prime and watch its streamer offshoot Prime Video, you’ll know what an absolutely ghastly nightmare it can be to use. Shows and movies that you can watch for “free” as a Prime member are muddled with those that you need to buy or rent, <em>and </em>with those that come with add-on subscription packages; it’s a confusing and frustrating experience. It seems, fingers crossed, Amazon is about to fix this.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As spotted by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24203748/amazon-prime-video-interface-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24203748/amazon-prime-video-interface-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span>, the god-awful interface is going to receive a new tab that will exclusively contain programs and films that are included in the subscription. Yes, of course you would think it already had that, but no, it didn’t.</p><p>Rather brilliantly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-updated-steaming-experience&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-updated-steaming-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon boasts this new feature on its own site</a></span> as “bringing clarity and simplicity back to streaming,” as if it’s leading the charge in the streaming wars. It is, of course, the only service on the entire planet that had obfuscated its offerings in such a way.  It’s uniquely Amazon that has, so very deliberately, blurred the lines between what’s included and what’s just a purchase from the Amazon store.</p><p>It’s worth adding, it’s generally a <em>good thing</em> that Prime doesn’t limit its offerings to what’s “free” within the deal. (Although that deal recently got a whole lot worse, with the addition of lengthy, randomly interruptive adverts for those who don’t increase their monthly tithe.) If I’m enormously in the mood to watch <em>Die Hard</em>, and I can’t find it on any of the 37 streaming services I’m subscribed to, then having the option to pay a couple of bucks to rent it for the evening is a boon. The issue is having it appear front-and-centre on the Prime Video app that I pay a stupid amount of money for, and then finding out it was a trick.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-reality-game-show-prize-1851344900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-reality-game-show-prize-1851344900">MrBeast’s Amazon Game Show Makes History With $5 Million Prize</a></span></p><p>It’s hard not to imagine this confusion was also hurting Amazon. Too often I’ll entirely miss a Prime-made show because it’s so mired in their menus beneath the nickel-and-diming that I’ll entirely forget it was available. I <em>still</em> haven’t watched <em>Invincible </em>or <em>The Wheel of Time</em>, because Prime’s algorithm is so botched for me that they’re impossibly buried. It doesn’t bode too well that the same Amazon update boasts of its “generative AI” that will help me “discover content.” (Companies! Stop calling things “content”! No one watching ever uses this word!) That just leads to more of the same blinkered funnelling that has Amazon’s web store recommending you nothing but vacuum cleaners because you recently bought a vacuum cleaner.</p><p> “We’re always listening to customers and reviewing feedback,” says Kam Keshmiri, the VP of design at Prime Video, “and it’s clear that many are in search of a more intuitive streaming experience.” Which is bullshit for, “People just want to be able to find the stuff they’re paying for.” So, well, I’m glad that’s going to be possible.</p><p>There will also now be tabs for add-ons you’ve bought, like Max, Paramount+ and Crunchyroll, singling out their shows and films too, along with the ability to manage those subscriptions within. Which, again, sounds like a huge blessing. I hate realizing I forgot to cancel the MGM+ sub that was cheaper than renting that one film last month, and then not being able to find what it actually offers thanks to the combination of awful UI and algorithmic blind spots. (Also, everyone on Earth, add the MGM+ sub so you can watch the best thing on TV right now, <em>From. </em>Set a calendar reminder to cancel it.)</p><p>Now perhaps Amazon, who <em>love</em> listening to their customers’ feedback so much, could listen to everyone screaming at them to pay their employees properly, allow unions, and provide proper safety measures in their facilities. That’d be great!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, PlayStation announced that a new Escalation of Freedom update is coming to Helldivers 2 on August 6, 2024.</p>



<p>The update will introduce brand-new enemies, objective variety, and more. That includes a CR 10: Super Helldive, adding another difficulty level with greater challenges and rewards to match.</p>



<p>There will also be “new mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts for both bots and bugs.” These offer Super Sample rewards, but “many” of the new mission objectives will be available in the existing difficulty levels too.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Escalation of Freedom Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQl2BmhSCsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The new enemies will include the Spore Charger, which uses fog for cover, a Terminid Alpha Commander, and a Rocket Tank Automaton. However, the blog also teases “some other bot surprises we’ll be throwing your way.”</p>



<p>The environments are also getting a new update, with new fog and flora turning swamps into unpredictable areas that limit visibility.</p>



<p>The Escalation of Freedom update also brings a range of quality-of-life improvements. </p>



<p>It will address grief kicking, where kicked players “spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session.” Meanwhile, the previous squad’s loot will remain unchanged.</p>



<p>There will also be “major fixes to the social menu,” as well as “a ton of surprises to discover.” Most recently, Helldivers 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-receives-hotfix-for-infinite-drop-in-glitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolled out a hotfix</a> for the infinite drop-in glitch.</p>

Described as the game’s “biggest update yet,” it will add new enemies, mission objectives, difficulty levels, and more. <span id="more-900800"></span></p><p>Get the details below, via Arrowhead Game Studios social media and community manager Katherine Baskin.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to the Escalation of Freedom, Helldivers. We’ve taken the time to gather feedback from our players on the front lines, and we’re bringing greater variety to our content. From missions and objectives to enemies and planets, we’re delivering lots of new content for both our veteran players and brand-new Helldivers on the battlefield. Get ready for our biggest update yet!</p><p>Our community continues to show us how strong we all are when united against the mindless Automatons and the scourge of the Terminid. As we stand here, on the eve of the Escalation of Freedom, we reflect on the six months since launch. We could never have predicted how far this game would go and how many Citizens would answer Super Earth’s call to arms!</p><p>We’ve watched our forces expertly handle every conflict and challenge we’ve thrown their way, from flying enemies to the Terminid Control System, to saving the children of Super Citizen Anne’s Hospital. Now for this major update, it’s time for us to give back something big to the community and welcome in even more players to the <em>Helldivers</em> universe.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Helldivers, this is escalating quickly.</p><p><strong>Go on a Super Helldive</strong></p><p><em>—Go up against the new supersized bot fortresses.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Something that continues to amaze us is our players’ insatiable desire for more bugs, more bots, more liberation, and more destruction. We thought nine levels of Helldiving difficulties would be enough, but in the Escalation of Freedom we’re turning it up to 10… Combat Rating 10 that is.</p><p>CR 10: Super Helldive is our most challenging, most relentless dive difficulty level yet, and we hope that this is going to give players the intensity they’re looking for on the battlefield. And with a great challenge comes greater rewards.</p><p><em>—The larva retrieval mission has the Helldivers babysitting a bug.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>But a new difficulty level isn’t the only thing the community wanted. We’ve also heard your desire for mission variation, which is why we’re bringing you new mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts for both bots and bugs that offer brand new Super Sample rewards. These outposts will be heavily fortified, and require players to coordinate and strategize in order to take them out.</p><p>And if you’re new to <em>Helldivers II</em>, you don’t have to worry about missing out on all the fun until you unlock Super Helldive, because many of our new mission objectives will be playable on other difficulty levels.</p><p><strong>New Enemies and Dangerous Swamps</strong></p><p><em>—The Impaler returns!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Escalation of Freedom is unleashing some new threats to our liberty that will take some serious strategizing from the Helldivers to take down.</p><p>Back by popular demand: the Impaler! This big guy from the original Helldivers creates some new challenges. No longer can you run from the bugs when the Impaler is around–big, imposing, and destructive, it demands to be dealt with.</p><p>Also new among the Terminid ranks is the Spore Charger. As if the regular old Charger wasn’t scary enough, the Spore Charger is shrouded in fog to obscure its location until it’s right up on you, Helldiver.</p><p><em>—The new Spore Charger in the fog.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>Lastly, the Terminid Alpha Commander, which is a supercharged Brood Commander that’s bigger, meaner, and doesn’t hesitate to call in other bugs for backup.</p><p><em>—You thought the regular old Brood Commander was bad? Think again.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Don’t think we forgot about the Automatons. Their ranks are growing, too, with the addition of the formidable Rocket Tank, as well as some other bot surprises we’ll be throwing your way.</p><p><em>—The Automaton uprising continues.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>Explore the swamps but not as you know them, with rolling fog and the untamed flora, the blackened trees obscure the light and the air itself feels haunted. Keep your flashlight handy, as visibility is limited and light is key. The enemy could be hiding anywhere amongst the undergrowth.</p><p><em>—Get spooked, Helldivers.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Under the Hood</strong></p><p>The last addition I want to highlight about the Escalation of Freedom update is that we’re making changes to mitigate the problem of grief kicking in <em>Helldivers II</em>. While it’s our hope that players engage with the game in good faith and sportsmanship, we do recognize that some players are using the team kicking to grief others.</p><p>To help improve this we have implemented a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged.</p><p>With these changes, all players have the opportunity to leave with all loot collected on mission, with no one Helldiver losing out. We’re committed to making changes that will improve the player experience and encourage healthy, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [186 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>play.</p><p>Along with this, we’re also releasing other quality of life upgrades with Escalation of Freedom, including major fixes to the social menu to make diving with your friends easier.</p><p>Overall, we think this escalation is going to be packed full of awesome additions, long-awaited improvements, and a ton of surprises to discover! <em>Helldivers II: Escalation of Freedom</em> is launching on August 6!</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-supported-latest-games-include-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-marvel-rivals-beta-final-fantasy-xiv-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM's Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, NetEase's Marvel Rivals beta, and Final Fantasy XIV Online are among the latest games to support NVIDIA DLSS.</p>
<p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess was released last week, complete with NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and Reflex support, which deliver a high framerate experience with limited input delay, something I did highlight in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/">review</a>. Despite not being a fast-paced game, higher framerates definitely improve the experience as a whole.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Marvel Rivals definitely benefits from the higher framerate offered by NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and reduced input delay offered by Reflex. The game's closed beta, which will be available until August 5th, also supports both for a superior experience.</p>
<p>Joining the NVIDIA DLSS family of supported titles is the upcoming open-world RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/">Neverness to Everness</a>, F1 Manager, and Dark and Darker. The last two, however, only support DLSS 2, so no Frame Generation is available. Supporting NVIDIA DLSS 2 are also the Bladekisser DLC for Trepang 2 and<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-7-0-120-fps-playstation-5-xbox-series-x/"> Final Fantasy XIV Online</a>, which received support for the upscaler with the update 7.0 introducing support for the Dawntrail expansion. A new <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmark</a> was also launched to allow players to test their machine's ability to run the game. A free trial is also available for the game, allowing users to play up to level 70 with no restriction for free.</p>
<p>Since the release of its second version, NVIDIA DLSS has become a real game changer. You can learn more about the technology and supported games by going <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/">here.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/create-fall-guys-islands-in-fortnite-with-uefn-and-creative?team=personal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, the Fortnite team confirmed key details about the anticipated Fall Guys collaboration, which is finally available after its delay.</p>



<p>The crossover allows players to create Fall Guys-themed islands with UEFN and Fortnite Creative. Fans will have access to assets from both games, and outfits will automatically turn into beans. Naturally, non-Fortnite skins will be turned into default beans instead.</p>



<p>Today’s post adds that “you will be able to publish your Fall Guys islands starting August 6 via the Creator Portal.” Players need to publish their creations manually. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>According to the new blog, islands must have an ESRB rating of E for United States, and a PEGI rating of 7 or less for Europe.</p>



<p>Further, any islands that players build with the Fall Guys template also have a chance to end up in a “limited time Fall Guys row.” This should give the new islands a chance to shine, and help build the community in Fortnite.</p>



<p>The Fortnite team originally intended to release the Fall Guys crossover in May 2024. They later <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1783148869150248988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed it</a> until Summer 2024, with no concrete release window.</p>



<p>Today’s Fall Guys collaboration comes via Fortnite’s anticipated v30.30 update. The major patch also adds the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-league-adding-tesla-cybertruck-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla Cybertruck vehicle</a>, which drew some fan criticism. A recent leak also teased some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-6-will-introduce-new-movement-mechanics-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential new mechanics</a> coming to Chapter 6 in Fortnite.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-team-addresses-criticisms-in-new-message-for-the-japanese-community/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Since its announcement, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been heavily criticized. Players have raised concerns about historical accuracy, mainly around the game’s new protagonist, Yasuke. Recently, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japanese-petition-ac-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">petition</a> was launched in Japan to cancel the game entirely. The Assassin’s Creed Shadows dev team has addressed these criticisms in a new message for the Japanese community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The message underscores the team’s profound respect for the Japanese community and their rich heritage. The developers want to ensure that the Japanese community understands the depth of their respect and passion for the ‘historical and cultural integrity’ of their ‘rich heritage.’ This is why they have laid out a series of points to clarify their ‘intentions and creative decisions.’&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-authenticity-efforts">Authenticity Efforts&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The message first talks about their authenticity efforts and how they have put “significant effort into ensuring an immersive and respectful representation of Feudal Japan”. However, they want to clarify that they have never wanted Assassin’s Creed games, including Shadows, to become “factual representations of history, or historical characters”. On the other hand, they only wish to create intrigue and want players to learn and explore these historical settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The devs expand, stating that the team has “extensively collaborated with external consultants, historians, researchers, and internal teams at Ubisoft Japan to inform our creative choices.” At the same time, they understand that some “promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community,” and they sincerely wish to apologize for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the constructive criticism they have received, the developers have clarified that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will ‘keep evolving till launch’ and the development will continue until it is delivered. They want the community to know that they are listening and learning from their feedback, and they request the community not to criticise their collaborators, as the creative teams have made all the decisions “in the interests of gameplay and entertainment.’&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Official World Premiere Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vovkzbtYBC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-devs-address-yasuke-s-concerns">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Devs Address Yasuke’s Concerns</h2>



<p>The message further explains that the Assassin’s Creed games are works of fiction inspired by actual historical events, and the representation of Yasuke “is an illustration of this.” Yasuke’s mysterious and unique life made the character “an ideal candidate” for their Feudal Japan setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, they acknowledge that Yasuke’s depiction as a samurai has become a matter of debate and discussion. They have incorporated this aspect into the narrative of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The developers concluded by stating that they value the player feedback and encourage them to continue respectfully sharing their thoughts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the comments section, there has been a division of opinions regarding Ubisoft’s message on Assassin’s Creed Shadows. While some gamers empathize with Ubisoft, recognizing the game as fiction, others advocate for alterations or removing the protagonist. We are eager to hear your insights on the main character of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Share your perspectives with us in the comments.</p>

<p>In other news, Ubisoft was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-facing-exploitation-accusations-for-new-ac-shadows-dubbing-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of exploitation</a> for its AC Shadows content. Also, AC Infinity has been renamed “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animus-hub-ac-infinity-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animus Hub</a>,” and it might appear with the upcoming title.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EA Sports College Football 25 | Official Gameplay First Look Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>As an additional complication, the game is launching at the same time as the "summer roster movement that is natural to college football," EA says in its update. "For our very passionate Dynasty fans, you can hop in and play this week or wait for a roster update around college football kickoff for the most up to date experience."</p><p>Other than these visual and roster inaccuracies, EA lists a number of issues with the game's Dynasty mode that are high on the list for fixes and tuning. One particularly disruptive bug is impacting players when trying to load a previously established online dynasty, which EA has listed as high-priority for a fix. As well as bug fixes, EA is also looking at tuning the Super Sim Logic that drives the dynamic, long-term Dynasty mode, in line with player feedback.</p><p>EA has said that most of these issues will require a console-side update, which it refers to as a Title Update. You can check out the full list of known issues below.</p><h2>EA Sports College Football 25 Known Issues</h2><p><strong>AUDIO</strong></p><ul><li>Incorrect commentary when playing as the first game of the season in Dynasty at Utah</li><li>Florida State’s War Chant and Tennessee's “Rocky Top” are not audible when playing only on Xbox Series S</li></ul><p><strong>LOGOS</strong></p><ul><li>The following teams/conferences have incorrect logos: Stanford, UMass, Western Michigan, Jacksonville State, FIU, New Mexico, SEC, Conference USA, and the Sun Belt</li><li>UTEP and Wyoming display incorrect athletic branding on their equipment in Dynasty</li><li>Visual issue with conference patches when changing a small subset of teams Conference in Dynasty</li></ul><p><strong>DYNASTY</strong></p><ul><li>Super Sim Logic Tuning: The team is looking into tuning of the Super Sim Logic, including FCS schools upsetting too many Power 5 schools  <ul><li>Note: As we continue internal testing on the tuning of Super Sim Logic, Top 25 Polls &amp; the College Football Playoff seedings will also see an improvement.</li></ul></li><li>Issue when adding additional teams to the PAC-12 conference when using custom conferences does not generate a new conference schedule as intended.  <ul><li>Workaround: After adding teams to the PAC-12, open the Conference Rules and set Divisions to ON.

			<p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess starts, as many games do, with disaster. Mt. Kafuku has fallen to the Seethe, a collection of monstrous creatures who serve the Mountain Goddess. We shouldn’t be surprised that it’s all humanity’s fault, with the local populace growing greedy and taking all of the mountain’s wealth. You take on the role of Soh, a samurai called upon to assist the Maiden Yoshiro, and together you must purify the mountain, and return it to its natural state.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GiOLpNtcNNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While there’s plenty of hack-and-slash action here, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami</a> brings in elements of Pikmin and tower defence titles to create an invigorating amalgam of the three. As you enter each village you come across its inhabitants that have been petrified, and once you release them you can add them to your group, assigning them roles to help defend against the Seethe that will attack at night.</p>


<p>While these villagers are an essential part of your fighting force, it’s Soh that stands resolutely at the front, holding back the Seethe with pirouetting dance moves that send his blade swinging in all directions. You can upgrade Soh’s loadout with different Tsuba Guards containing unique and extremely handy powers, as well as a series of different skills which further augment your abilities. Soh’s controls are relatively familiar, and at times you may be underwhelmed by the limited number of combos, but you’ve got rather a lot to deal with elsewhere.</p>


<p>Each level sees you guiding the Maiden Yoshiro along the spirit path, leading her to a corrupted Torii gate, the source of blight on the area. Once you’ve laid the path, she dances along very, very slowly, meaning that she won’t generally make it to the gate during the first day. With the arrival of night, monsters start spewing from the gate, and you have to protect Yoshiro from them.</p>
<p>If you’ve played games like Hellwardens, Dungeon Defenders or Orcs Must Die, you’ll understand how this plays out. The monsters travel along different routes towards Yoshiro and your recruited villagers can be assigned roles to help fend them off. You empower them via different masks you unlock as you progress, starting with straightforward jobs like the Woodcutter with his axe and moving up to more unusual roles like the Thief who searches for hidden treasure before running away at the first sign of danger.</p>
<p>You have to carefully position your villagers along the route in order to maximise their usefulness, from where they’ll attack anything that comes into range. Each mask can be levelled up as well, improving their abilities as the monstrous foes become ever more challenging.</p>

<p>The enemy designs here are grotesque and thoroughly hateful, all based upon Japanese mythology. You’ll marvel at how otherworldly they are, with claws, tentacles and tongues that are often in places that those things shouldn’t be. While they start off as pure sword fodder for Soh and his compatriots, they become larger and more dangerous, punctuated at different points by huge boss battles that change the narrative further.</p>
<p>This is where elements of Capcom’s Monster Hunter series bleed in, with Soh facing off against immense enemies that require different tactics to take down. I have to admit that I found the opening of Kunitsu-Gami unbelievably easy, and worried that it would put up little resistance, but the arrival of a huge centipede creature in the third level put those fears away, as it thoroughly kicked my arse.</p>
<p>The answer, unsurprisingly, was that I needed to make better use of my villagers, and you need to call on them frequently in these encounters, moving them around, and having them rush back to defend Yoshiro when the boss comes too close. You cannot switch off for a moment here, and the ongoing bouts become steadily tougher, pushing you to constantly revise and update your tactics.</p>

<p>There are quieter moments, though. During the daytime dance through the village you have the chance to purify the area of corruption, collecting orbs which you can use to assign roles to your villagers, all the while Yoshiro dances along the spirit path. You can speed up time if you’ve done everything you need to, but as levels become larger, with multiple routes and gates, you’ll still find yourself rushing to be ready for the oncoming horde.</p>
<p>Once you’ve cleared a level, you can set up a base, repairing and rebuilding the monuments and buildings, and earning further upgrades and currency in the process. These offer a pleasant bit of downtime, reminding me of the older Monster Hunter villages, though occasionally it does just feel like busy work rather than something truly integral. It’s nice to see each area steadily coming back to life though.</p>

<p>While there are plenty of similarities, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is shorter and smaller in scale than Monster Hunter, but rather than being a negative, it’s refreshing to find something that’s going to take less than 20 hours to thoroughly make you way through. The pace feels just right, and it doesn’t overstay its welcome, coming to an end just when you might be starting to tire of the mechanics.</p>
<p>Themed after Kagura, a style of Japanese theatre, there’s very little like Kunistu-Gami. The entire narrative is told without words, with action and dance sequences the main storytelling devices. It works incredibly well, and you’re never unsure of what’s happening, despite the lack of exposition. It does feel like a sister project to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, but one that delves even further into Japanese mythology and culture, retaining and exploring an element of gaming that’s been sidelined by expanding Western tastes.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess offers a stunning and memorable aesthetic that matches well with its unusual, but compelling mix of different genres.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-confirmed-despite-negative-reactions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>IGN recently published a ten minute preview of Star Wars Outlaws and the reaction has been rather negative. Comments about frame rate drops, low quality explosions and the graphics of the game have all been posted. While it does look good in certain places there are other areas where it clearly needs a bit of polish, check the sequence around 5m50s where Kay Vess walks through a puddle, those are some PS2 era ripples in the water.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: 10 Minutes of Exclusive Gameplay - IGN First" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-M1Lu6iVhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The reactions have led to a Bank of America analyst discussing the game in an earnings call and asking Ubisoft if it would be delayed.</p>
<p>“The game has gone gold, so the date is well confirmed for August 30,” Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet commented. “We’ll shortly be seeing more content of very high quality and multiple hours that will really show the depths of the open world that is a key element of the promise to enjoy the exploration of the galaxy with multiple planets, so that should bode well for the game in terms of high-quality delivery.”</p>
<p>“As we’ve said also for Star Wars, the level of quality of the world and the experience is really very high,” adds Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. “We are really leveraging our engine, and I think people will love it.”</p>

<p>Set between the events of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, you’ll play as outlaw Kay Vess who’s trying to pull off one of the biggest heists ever in the Outer Rim. That journey will take you across several planets that&nbsp;<em>obviously</em> includes Tatooine, but also has less familiar settings and brand new ones, like the moon of Toshara.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will be released on August 30th for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, will you be buying the game?</p>

        <p>Will it give the map a boost?</p>

            <p>I've not played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter- Strike 2</a> in yonks, but I know a big update when I see one. That's right: Valve have added some new crates just outside of counter-terrorist spawn, near bombsite A. This means that players can now use these boxes to hop from CT up to catwalk with little fuss, where previously you'd need to use your teammates' heads as a springboard. What does this mean as a layperson who sort of plays the game sometimes? More than you might think!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Just outside CT spawn then, you'll find some new crates tucked just below the catwalk above. Here's a clip of the new boost in action:</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1e9u7bu/new_dust2_short_boost_route_july_22_2024_patch/">New Dust2 short boost route [July 22 2024 Patch]</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/super_shogun/">u/super_shogun</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/">GlobalOffensive</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>Before, as either a terrorist or counter-terrorist, you wouldn't have been able to get up to catwalk without: 1) help; 2) circling around the bombsite in a laborious fashion. With the latter made tougher when you add in the possibility of the exact smoke grenade shown in the clip above, alongside possible players on Long A (after you've crossed the smoke), or on the catwalk, or on the bombsite itself.</p>
<p>It seems like Valve's popped these new crates in as a means to even the balance. Dust 2 has historically been a terrorist-sided map (easier positional play for attackers, basically) and it now only requires one smoke grenade to block CT vision, whereas before it was two. With these crates, it means that CTs are less likely to get caught between their spawn and the smoke, letting them rotate and defend a bit easier. </p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I'm no CS strat-head. But the introduction of these crates almost certainly makes things easier for CTs and will likely manufacture a tonne of new plays - possibly, a new meta. A ten-years younger Ed would've taken to Twitch to watch how the pros adapt to these crates in an effort to climb the ranks. Now, those days are behind me and I think my stress levels thank me for that.</p>
<p>Other things of note in the update? No not, really. You can check them out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4363508865823029428?l=english">here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Cataclismo is the next game from Moonlighter developer Digital Sun and it's out now in early access.
</p>
<p>
The game was previously shown at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-todays-humble-games-showcase">2023's Humble Games showcase</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-of-the-triple-i-showcase">Triple-i showcase</a> back in April to generate plenty of interest. It's also published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publisher Hooded Horse.
</p>
<p>
Cataclismo is a twist on real-time strategy and tower defence, where players are tasked with building a fortress and defending it from endless hordes of demonic enemies, all with a unique moonlit art style.

<p>

In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422440/view/4372516065076900932">notice on Steam</a>, the developer highlights how involving the game's community during the later stages of development has "invaluable potential". It parallels the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a>, No Rest for the Wicked, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> in launching first into early access.
</p>
<p>
For now, the game includes a fully-voiced campaign of eleven levels, with more to come before the launch of 1.0, as well as a Skirmish Mode, Endless mode, a comprehensive Level Editor, and Steam Workshop compatibility to share maps.
</p>
<p>
"Over the course of Early Access, more biomes, features, and modes will be added, including additional content for the Endless game mode and new levels for the main campaign," reads the Steam notice. "Even though it's too early to say when our 1.0 launch will happen, we expect to be in Early Access at least through the first months of 2025."
</p>
<p>
It continues: "It's been more than five years since we released Moonlighter, and we owe every bit of success to our players' support. Whether Cataclismo is your first Digital Sun game, or you've stuck around since Will's grand adventure, we're grateful you've joined us on this journey."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Christian Donlan went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cataclismo-is-a-game-of-castle-walls-and-terrible-mistakes">hands-on with Cataclismo</a> a few months back and came away impressed. "But the key, I think, lies with two things: the simple things are very satisfying, and you are never far from disaster," he wrote.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus.934359/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Photos showing Lego's first wave of official Fortnite sets have popped up online, and feature a $99/€120 (roughly £76) Battle Bus set featuring an array of fan favourite characters as Lego minifigures.
</p>
<p>
Physical Fortnite Lego sets had been widely expected ever since the launch of last year's Lego Fortnite mode, which acts as the centrepiece of the two brands' deep integration. Fortnite now hosts an array of Lego minigames made both by fans and Lego itself, while almost every in-game character skin now has a digital minifigure version. 
</p>
<p>
Four Lego sets will reportedly arrive on 1st October this year, including the aforementioned Battle Bus, plus large models featuring a Supply Llama ($39/€39, about £30), the Durr Burger ($15/€15, about £12) and the Halloween-themed Peely Bone ($99/€99, about £76).
</p>
<p>
It's not the first time these sets have been detailed in leaks, although it is the first time we're seeing them in photos. 
</p>
<p>
Lego sets invariably leak long before their official announcement due to the long manufacturing and marketing process that sees production begin years before sets actually arrive (the recently-confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">Legend of Zelda Deku Tree set</a> is another <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-lego-zelda-set-seemingly-confirmed-by-copyright-removals">good example of this</a>).
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Eurogamer previously asked Epic Games about the likelihood of physical Fortnite Lego sets appearing - and they sounded a fair bet.
</p>
<p>
"Clearly there's appetite," Lego's chief product and marketing officer Julia Goldin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-feels-a-minecraft-for-the-metaverse-era">told me last December</a>. "Anything is possible. We plan our portfolio over the years to come - and again, it's just the beginning."
</p>
<p>
So, the Lego <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-own-developers-dont-seem-thrilled-at-elon-musks-cybertruck-being-added-to-the-game">Fortnite Cybertruck</a> next? Too soon.

            <p>
As players continue to struggle with the final boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, one savvy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> streamer has destroyed the boss in just one hit.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, this was only a matter of time. While reactions to the DLC initially focused on its high difficulty - particularly the final boss - players have slowly found various methods of getting through the encounter. And this might be the most impressive (and convoluted) yet.
</p>

<p>

The boss in question is Promised Consort Radahn who, in the second phase, is mounted by Miquella to become Radahn, Consort of Miquella. His high speed attacks become infused with golden light and it's this phase in particular that's caused players problems.
</p>
<p>
One answer is to skip the phase altogether by simply beating the entire boss fight in one hit.
</p>
<p>
That's what Twitch streamer Ainrun managed, dealing 93,000 points of damage with just one melee weapon hit. The streamer shared a clip of the win on social media site X, which has since garnered plenty of attention.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
So how is it done? Good question. Much of the clip sees Ainrun standing outside the boss door inflicting a whole string of buffs and debuffs to maximise damage output and decrease enemy defence.
</p>
<p>
Ainrun swaps between consumables, talismans, weapon skills, and armours extremely quickly, which inflict status effects sleep, madness, and poison, but with talismans to offer attack power buffs. The likes of Seppuku, Rallying Standard, and Royal Knight's Resolve are weapon skills to improve damage output, while the Rakasha armour set increases damage dealt and taken - thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-manages-to-one-shot-elden-ring-dlcs-final-and-most-difficult-boss">IGN</a> for listing out the items and effects used.

</p>
<p>
Then, in one hit, Radahn's health bar is completely wiped. And once the cutscene ends to introduce the second phase, he immediately falls dead. God slain.
</p>
<p>
What's even more impressive is Ainrun not only achieved this feat a second time, but upped his damage output to destroy Radahn with 105,000 points of damage in just one hit.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has put significant effort into ensuring Assassin's Creed Shadows is an immersive and respectful representation of Feudal Japan, but the game was never meant to be a factual representation of history or historical characters.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft shared a new message on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a> addressed to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-cancel-assassins-creed-shadows/">Japanese community</a>, which doesn't seem to be taking some of the developer's decisions too well, going over some of the controversies surrounding the next entry in the series set in Feudal Japan. As mentioned above, Ubisoft said that the entirety of the series isn't meant to be a factual representation of history, but it is aimed at sparking curiosity and encouraging players to learn more about the historical settings the developers are inspired by. As such, Assassin's Creed Shadows is designed, first and foremost, to be an entertaining game that tells a compelling fiction set in Feudal Japan.</p>
<p>Despite their sustained efforts, Ubisoft recognizes that some of the Assassin's Creed Shadows marketing caused concerns within the Japanese community, and for that, they apologize. At the same time, the development team reminded fans how the series has always taken creative license and incorporated fantasy elements to craft engaging experiences. It was the same in the new entry in the series with Yasuke, who's represented as a samurai despite this status being a matter of debate and discussion. This is woven into the narrative and with the other lead character, Naoe, to provide players with different gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on November 15th for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
