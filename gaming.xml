            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashes of Creation, an old-school MMORPG that dropped in an alpha state on Steam after <strong>years </strong>of development, has imploded this weekend. The game has been struck with a total collapse, as the team at Intrepid Studios has either resigned or been laid off. It was just two days ago that the team at Intrepid was posting updates and promising a roadmap of improvements to the game.</p>



<p>In a recent message on the game’s Discord server, the company’s founder and creative director for AoC, Steven Sharif, made a damning statement about the situation. He stressed he was forced to resign after ‘control of the company’ was shifted away from him, prompting a walkout that ultimately led to the entire remaining company being laid off.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-ashes-of-creation-shutting-down">Is Ashes of Creation Shutting Down?</h2>



<p>It’s almost <strong>guaranteed </strong>that Ashes of Creation, the ambitious, old-school MMORPG that was in development for almost a decade, will disappear forever. In his statement on the AoC Discord server, company founder <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1qsldun/ashes_of_creation_has_just_been_canceled_all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steven Sharif wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation.</p>



<p>Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.</p>



<p>Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership team resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</p>



<p>I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed by the situation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On Steam’s community forums, users came forward to declare the situation a ‘pump and dump scam’, with some suggesting that class action lawsuits should be sprung up to chase refunds.</p>



<p>However, that might be easier said than done. In a video shared on social media, an internal communication was shared, explaining that ‘all job titles and all positions’ would be hit by an ‘entire and permanent plant closing’. It was then explained that the expected payroll set to run on February 1 will <strong>not </strong>happen because of the company’s financial position.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>𝐀𝐒𝐇𝐄𝐒 𝐎𝐅 𝐂𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐋𝐎𝐎𝐊𝐒 𝐓𝐎 𝐁𝐄 𝐒𝐇𝐔𝐓𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐃𝐎𝐖𝐍</p><p>What some players thought would be the answer to all their MMO questions has come to an abrupt end with Game Director for Ashes of Creation (<a href="https://twitter.com/StevenJSharif?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StevenJSharif</a>) stepping down.</p><p>The news comes after more… <a href="https://t.co/q1q53dJX0x">pic.twitter.com/q1q53dJX0x</a></p></div>— N_Tys (@N_Tys26) <a href="https://twitter.com/N_Tys26/status/2017792177167036842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>That means that employees under the WARN notice will <strong>not </strong>be paid, which will undoubtedly prompt financial suits.</p>



<p>If you load <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ashes of Creation’s Steam page</a> <strong>right now</strong>, you still have the option to purchase it for £41.99 ($49.99). According to SteamDB’s aggregate systems, as many as 319,000 people may have purchased Ashes of Creation, which averages out to around $14 million.</p>



<p>Those customers who picked up this early access title that has now been dropped just a month after release will be <strong>demanding </strong>satisfaction and compensation.</p>



<p>Popular creator ‘Pirate Software’ addressed the situation on socials, standing up for the developer somewhat:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Not really. At that time in development the game was doing just fine. Stuff was moving forward and the areas of the game he showed weren't actually flat featureless environments as he described.</p><p>It wasn't until the last 6-8 months that shit really hit the fan and fell apart.…</p></div>— Pirate Software (@PirateSoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/PirateSoftware/status/2017849283043827851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Bizarrely, the situation took <strong>another turn </strong>when eagle-eyed and investigative fans turned up registration information for Intrepid Studios that confirmed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1qsnhhx/intrepid_studios_board_of_directors_is_just_steven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steven Sharif as the sole Board member</a>. This was taken from a filing made on December 30, 2025, and it lists Sharif as the CEO and an individual named John Moore as the CFO. </p>



<p>Sharif is the only named director on the Board, per the document. </p>



<p>On social media, users noticed a troubling clause <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791529601/ashes-of-creation-new-mmorpg-by-intrepid-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the game’s Kickstarter</a>, which explained that if the game <strong>doesn’t launch on Steam</strong>, full refunds will be issued to all backers. Well, guess what? The game <strong>launched on Steam,</strong> so that promise was effectively fulfilled. Coincidence?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-february-1-966/</link>
            <guid>1422037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new month, and that means it’s time to smash another batch of NYT Connections puzzles! I’m here as always to provide you with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions so you can start February on the upswing with a series of instant successes. Below, you’ll find all the hints and tips you need to get through today’s NYT Connections as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #966:</p>



<ul>
<li>WEDGE</li>



<li>HYPE</li>



<li>MORGAN</li>



<li>FLAT</li>



<li>BOP</li>



<li>THORN</li>



<li>BOOST</li>



<li>MULE</li>



<li>HEATER</li>



<li>SHARP</li>



<li>JAM</li>



<li>PLUG</li>



<li>GLUTE</li>



<li>CLOG</li>



<li>PITCH</li>



<li>BANGER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Ways to talk something up</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Footwear with a twist</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Tracks that absolutely go off</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Hidden instruments</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 1:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-1-966">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 1 (#966)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BOOST, HYPE, PITCH, PLUG</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLOG, FLAT, MULE, WEDGE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BANGER, BOP, HEATER, JAM</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – GLUTE, MORGAN, SHARP, THORN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is a whole new take on the world of Pokémon, where you'll be able to farm, grow veggies, collect resources, build things, decorate, and of course, make friends with many different Pokémon.</p>
<p>With the game scheduled to arrive on the Switch 2 on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, more pre-order bonuses are now beginning to surface online. As highlighted by Serebii.net, the latest one is available on Amazon in the US and Best Buy in Canada.</p>
<p>If you order the game from either of these places before the release date, you'll get a download code for a 'Flat Leaf Plant' item, which can be used to decorate spaces in the game. The same bonus has been previously made available on the Amazon store in Japan.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0fefb8d8c9db2"><a title="Pokémon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fefb8d8c9db2/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via Serebii.net / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're not planning on getting Pokémon Pokopia from these stores, you'll apparently still be able to get this plant through regular gameplay. So no trainer should miss out!</p>
<p>Once again, Pokémon Pokopia launches exclusively for the Switch 2 this March. You can see what other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/where-to-pre-order-pokemon-pokopia-for-nintendo-switch-2">pre-order offers and bonuses</a> there are in our guide here on Nintendo Life, and find out more about the game in our previous coverage.</p>

            <p>
Crafting a world that begs to be explored is a tricky thing to do, especially when the world is kind of sucky, doubly so when it's woven mostly through words with only supplementary imagery to provide a broader context. Yet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper's</a> is one I'm often thinking about because amongst all the grand sci-fi concepts is a grounded sense of reality that you'll always find in the best of the cyberpunk genre. And here I am, a year on from the second game's release, tempted to return once more, but this time in a form based on its tabletop origins.
</p>
<p>
Citizen Sleeper: Spindlejack is not technically a new game, it actually came out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-now-has-a-free-solo-tabletop-rpg">last May</a> as a free-to-download mini-RPG, but now through Lost in Cult it is being turned into a tangible, physical thing you can add to your dragon's hoard of tabletop RPGs. Spindlejack takes place in a particular corner of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Citizen Sleeper 2's</a> world, on the Far Spindle, a place where the airbike riders are "notorious." It's a solo TTRPG, where you fly around said airbike making tricky deliveries for "cryo, reputation and fun."

<p>
Where this release mainly differs is obviously the physicality, coming with a set of 10 themed D6 dice, some fancy bits of informative paper, and stickers, but it also comes with a couple of additional modules. One is Sprocket's Shop, which comes with new upgrades and items for some added tactics and techniques. The other is a story-based one, Kadet's Climb, where you play as Kadet from the original video game, who is "trying to survive on the far Spindle as she rises up through the ranks of the station's most infamous delivery couriers."
</p><p>
I am certainly quite tempted by such a luxurious item, but again, none of us have to feel FOMO as it's available to play for free through <a href="https://jump-over-the-age.itch.io/citizen-sleeper-spindlejack">itch.io</a>. If it is something you're interested in however, <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/citizensleeper2">here's a handy link for you</a>.

            <p>
There are not enough games in the world where it feels like the initial concept was born from the thought, "wouldn't it be funny if…" I'm no fool, I know this is because developing a video game is akin to getting hit by a car, miraculously coming away from it unscathed, only to be hit by six more cars as you continue your journey. In any case, this is still how I would like to imagine Trust Me, I Nailed It was born, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game where you have to make cool video edits of some warrior to make him seem like a monster slaying legend.
</p>
<p>
This is, through and through, a ridiculous concept, one that aesthetically maybe doesn't mesh entirely well, but I am still clowning with all the same. This is one of those fake OS kind of games a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/her-story">Her Story</a>, with the main bit of faux software you use being World Movie Weaver (i.e., Windows Movie Maker).

<p>
On your timeline, rather than finding the usual video section and audio section, there is an enemy attack pattern section, pre-filled, showing you exactly where an enemy will strike on the grid-based battlefield, and the warrior's attack pattern section, which you are dictating in the edit. You can drag different clips to make the warrior move, perform different types of or block attacks, there's "post-processing" modifiers that let him teleport, or even just take no damage at all. It's movie magic, baby.
</p><p>
Little bits of story are then relayed through emails and posts on MSN (Mana Scroll Network (nice once)), where you can see whether people believe this actually quite cowardly hero is as cool as you've edited him to be or not.
</p>
<p>
The lack of aesthetic meshing I mention is because the hero scenes are all sort of generic fantasy, and the fake OS honestly just looks straight up like Windows 98. I wish there was a stronger sense of identity, what would an operating system look like in a fantasy world? How would technology impact the world, and magic, in kind? This is just a small gripe, though, the concept is fun enough that I won't lose sleep over it. Plus it'll be free! Can't complain about free.
</p>
<p>
It's also due out really soon, as it's currently slated for release next week on February 6th, so in the meantime, you can wishlist it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4311000/Trust_Me_I_Nailed_It/">here</a>.

<p>The latest trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> highlights some gameplay changes and showcases a version of CM Punk that has never officially appeared in a video game.</p>



<p>During the WWE Royal Rumble event, a new gameplay trailer premiered for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461">WWE 2K26</a> video game. The trailer showcased the returning Inferno Match, the debut of the Dumpster Match, the return of the ability to stack tables, and the return of thumbtacks in WWE games for the first time since WWE Legends of WrestleMania in 2009.</p>



<p>Another key focus was the reveal of CM Punk’s Ring of Honor gear. CM Punk was shown in a square-off with his younger self. Ring of Honor is a promotion that launched the careers of wrestlers like CM Punk, Samoa Joe, and Bryan Danielson. The CM Punk model also featured his blonde hair from the early days of his career, from 2002 to 2003. This is the first time that this young version of CM Punk has been officially on display in a wrestling game.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-wwe-2k26-showcase-spotlights-cm-punk">The WWE 2K26 Showcase Spotlights CM Punk</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As first reported by Insider Gaming, the WWE 2K26 Showcase campaign features the career of CM Punk. It will also be narrated by CM Punk and tease some what-if matches that could have taken place had Punk not left WWE nearly a decade back in 2014.</p>



<p>CM Punk is also the cover Superstar this year. His first time on the cover since WWE ’13 back in 2012. That game also featured a spotlight on the WWE Attitude Era, as this game will. The WWE Attitude Era edition of the game will cost $129.99. See all game prices at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/" id="172964">this link.</a></p>

            <p>
You know, I'm surprised that EA has never made a Sims reality show where contestants have to act out odd, Simish challenges on a Truman Show-esque production lot, given how much the games themselves feel like simulators for the trashiest (said lovingly) TV show genre. In the meantime, while it isn't at all themed reality shows, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4's</a> next expansion, Royalty &amp; Legacy, seems like a perfect fit for a fictitious one of your own making.
</p>
<p>
A new gameplay trailer showed off how the packs dynasty system works, which is very much about family values. Starting your own dynasty begins with things like choosing your family crest, those aforementioned values, and the family members (or otherwise) you want included. There's also a prestige and unity meter, which can be affected in different ways, like, say, stabbing a mannequin, or getting a promotion because you're a nepo baby.
</p>

<p>
Your Sims also have personal ranks, and lowering the prestige and unity meter may also lower their rank, and another member could challenge your leadership. And then you can just start a new one, so who gives a hoot! There's even some conspiracy nonsense, affairs, scandals to take advantage of, can you see why I think this is ripe for a reality TV show scenario? That'll be up to you to figure out though.
</p><p>
Alongside all of that, there's three new neighborhoods to shape to your will, each of which is already ruled by a pre-established dynasty. Sims can now perform powershifts, which "add fantasy, storybook twists to your royal tale," according to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/royalty-and-legacy-expansion-pack">blog post</a> about the expansion pack, where they might pull the sword in the stone, or flirt with a fancy frog. Said blog post goes into a lot more detail about what you can expect, so head there for more.
</p>
<p>
You've not got long to wait for the new expansion pack, as it's currently slated for release on February 12th, just under a couple of weeks away.

            <p>Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has shared its 2026 roadmap, complete with hints of four seasonal events, two reworked maps, one completely new location, and a load of "major updates", including the player character overhaul, a Unity 6 update, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> release, and, of course, that highly-anticipated 1.0 release.</p>
<p>And it all starts pretty soon, too. That player character overhaul - which some had hoped would release last year - should be out by March, complete with free cosmetics, new character models, and "fine-tuned animations".</p>

<p>"Brave ghost hunters will need to gear up for a host of new spooks and scares, with the pivotal 1.0 launch set to release across all platforms simultaneously this year," Kinetic teased. "Set to be one of the biggest moments since the game's launch, players can expect lots of surprises, as this will also include what was previously known as Horror 2.0."</p><p>Following on from the reworked farmhouse maps, Willow Street and Tanglewood are the next residential maps to get the decorators in. While Tanglewood's layout will remain "similar" (interestingly, the same is not said of Willow Street, which is my personal favourite), players can expect "a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes, and more."</p>

<p>"For those with a keen eye, there's also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered," the team added.</p>
<p>As for the new map? Kinetic is playing its cards very close to its chest on that one, but it did tease that along with the return of the usual seasonal events, a mysterious one-time event is also planned for later this year, too.</p><p>"This year is set to be a big one for Phasmophobia, and we are so excited for our 1.0 launch, which will be one of the biggest moments since we released the game," said Daniel Knight , Kinetic CEO and game director of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"We are constantly working on creating a truly immersive experience for ghost hunters, and have been developing the game with this in mind. Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games reckons 2026 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026-will-be-one-of-the-biggest-years-in-the-history-of-co-op-ghosthunting-game-phasmophobia">"one of the biggest [years] in the game's history" as it moves towards the full release of the game</a>. In an update shared at the beginning of the year, the team says we can expect to see "more immersive animations" added to the early access ghosthunting game, such as physically seeing your character model turn on your EMF Reader, opening and closing doors, and picking up or dropping equipment.</p>

<p>I know, the 'precog' machine in that particular movie wasn't really a 3D printer, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2n7SXUM9m0">Tom's wee red balls</a> seemed to be made of some sort of weird wood rather than filament, but it was the same sort of magic inside my simple mind, and the first time I'd considered a machine that could create a fully 3D object in this way. So the two are forever connected, I'm afraid.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067truypm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now that I am the owner of a 3D printer, now that we live in the actual future, and not that far off from where Tom Cruise and his wee red balls (and that really angry dude with the blonde hair) exist, I have to say, it feels rather mind-blowing to be able to create so many <em>things</em> so very readily.</p>
<p>I'm excited, is what I'm trying to say, and as a very excited gamer, you can bet your bottom Rupee that the first thing I've done with my precious new printer is dive headlong into a whole new world of knocking out my own accessories and smart little bits and bobs for my beloved Nintendo consoles. Oh yes, my sweet babies, daddy is going to take care of you now, you better believe it.</p>

<p>Sorry. Yes. I've been busy pumping rolls of filament into a big noisy machine that's currently located in my sitting room (*cries in wife*), browsing all of the sites and taking all of the notes on the best unofficial docks, grips, cartridge holders (and lots more) that are currently out there for 3D-printing fiends.</p>
<p>So, without any more nonsense, let's get on with taking a look at some of the best I've found and printed thus far, shall we?</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="a-quick-lesson-in-3d-printing-jargon">A quick lesson in 3D printing jargon</h2>
<p>To be as helpful as possible to anyone who might be browsing for something to 3D-print, I'll be dropping the time it takes to print off each of the objects I've made, as well as how much filament I've used to create each one. So, let's talk about a few simple things first.</p>
<p>There are different types of 3D printer out there. You could go with a resin one, which I have heard does <em>slightly</em> better fine details on models, or, like me, roll with a filament machine. This was an easy choice in my case as I have a busy house and some companies, such as Bambu Labs (other brands are available, but it's <a href="https://uk.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?srsltid=AfmBOor04U7NzjPojHuBAs55yckzd5ur_qvEiSJKtOYVuLfRRA9SpSYS&amp;id=578772891943051270">Bambu Labs' P1S with AMS</a> that I'm using here) have got a sort of Apple design aspect going on that makes it so you can have a printer in your house and it almost looks nice, and without any unreasonably bad mess or fuss. Well, it's a bit noisy sometimes, but not so much that it keeps me awake on a night print.</p>
<figure data-uuid="68c258caaa1d0"><a title="3D Printing Guide" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/68c258caaa1d0/3d-printing-guide.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Filament is bought in rolls of colour ranging from bog-standard to fancy with reflective textures, wood effect, glow in the dark, holographic - basically anything you can think of. There are also different types, grades and levels of filament for different jobs. Oh, and you can change out your printing plate for different textured finishes on your plastic creations, too. So maybe you'll want a brick-grid one for Mario walls, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>For the models below, I'm keeping everything as cheap as possible, using basic PLA filament from a generic brand, but you could also grab PLA+ and onwards and upwards into tough and hard-wearing varieties, or go in other directions for the appropriate material to build, for example, a light and flexible insole for your shoe.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-find-the-designs-to-print">Where to find the designs to print</h2>
<p>All of the designs I've used can be found at <a href="https://makerworld.com/en">Makerworld.com</a>, or you can also grab them off the Bambu Handy app, if you've already got that installed on a device, and I'll drop links to the creations as we go through them as well!</p>

<h2 id="all-the-best-stuff-ive-3d-printed-so-far">All the best stuff I've 3D-printed so far</h2>
<h3 id="mario-warp-pipe-controller-stand-with-storage-for-7-game-carts">Mario Warp Pipe Controller Stand (with storage for 7 game carts)</h3>

<p>This was my first Switch-related print, and it's a belter!</p>
<p>A nice, easy first print to get started, with no complications such as adding supports or any of that nonsense. This controller holder includes the warp pipe itself along with a smart little insert which can manage a grand total of seven of your precious Switch carts.</p>
<p>I had no green filament left when I printed this off, so I've gone with an orange one, but I will be painting it gold very shortly with some acrylic paint! Yessir. SPECIAL PIPE.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 1 hour 48 minutes<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 64g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1502329-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-stand-warp-pipe#profileId-1571705">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Stand Warp by @Dave_D_W -</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-snap-lock-grip">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Snap Lock Grip</h3>

<p>I actually wanted one of these, and so instead of stumping up a wad of cash-cash-money, I've quickly knocked out this very impressive alternative.</p>
<p>There's not much that can go wrong with this sort of design, except perhaps the smaller attachments that keep the Joy-Con in place, but there were zero issues and it's a great fit. In terms of toughness and look/feel, it's also just as good as anything I'd likely find in a store.</p>
<p>To use, you hook on the left and right locking grip, by attaching to the top and bottom of your Joy-Con, then insert the controller into the main body of the grip to push the lock in there permanently. You can now easily click your Joy-Con in and out. Also, it's really light grip, so bonus points for comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> Main Body takes 1.2 hours, whilst the left and right locking grips are 10 minutes each<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 25g for the main body, and 10g per grip lock, for a total of 45g<br>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-1-andamp-2-game-display-storage-10-slot-version">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Game Display Storage - 10 Slot Version</h3>

<p>This very useful display storage is well worth printing out for any serious (and very professional) Switch gamer, such as myself, as not only can it hold lots of lovely game cases and some carts at the front (with gaps so you can see their stickers!), it can also be added to a clever wall-mounted system - for which you print off a few extra parts.</p>
<p>Also, the size can be adjusted from a 4-case holder all the way up to a big 18 model. So there's lots of choice here, and you can add to the storage over time. I've gone with the 10 slot version for this print, and I'll be honest, I should have gone with the 4 because I'm a <em>very</em> futuristic man who is almost 100% digital on the Switch game front these days. Physical media is Dickensian in my eyes. That's right, take your 'cartridges' out of my sight.</p>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-zelda-royal-crest-dock-cover">Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda 'Royal Crest' Dock Cover</h3>

<p>Why waste time printing off an entire dock when you can just make a faceplate to hide the unrelenting grim blackness (looks dark grey to me, to be honest) of Nintendo's vanilla offering? This is my biggest print thus far, clocking in at 6.5 hours and costing 204g of tasty filament, but the result, especially if you choose a snazzy filament or paint the result, is well worth it!</p>
<p>There are tons of cool Nintendo-themed plates and docks to choose from out there, and you could go crazy with fancy filaments such as gun metal and realistically shiny gold to really make this Zelda one pop off. Also, the design I've printed off here, which I've linked to below, has a whole bunch of other covers to choose from once you click into its printing screen.</p>
<p>As you can see, I've been a right bore and gone with the classic option, but you can be damn sure I'll be firing up 'Auld Betsy' later to print myself off a Yiga Clan one.</p>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-1-andamp-2-mini-game-cases">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Mini Game Cases</h3>

<p>What's better than having a whole bunch of Switch or Switch 2 game cases on your shelves? I'll tell you what, having a whole bunch of <em>mini</em> Switch or Switch 2 game cases on your shelves. Mate, that's what.</p>
<p>These may, at first glance, seem as though they are meant to be more for fun than anything else. However, they do also provide some much-needed protection. In fact, they are actually a great space-saving idea if you usually cart your cases around when going mobile.</p>
<p>One thing with these: the basic PLA I used seemed a little brittle at first, but the edges do soften up when you bend them, then you're free to add any covers you want to print off and add.</p>
<p>As you can see, I ran out of time on decorating this one, but jump to the link below to see how amazing a printed cover makes them look. Oh, and that all-important click as you snap the cat into place is reassuringly present.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 19 minutes per case<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 8g per case<br>

<h3 id="switchrest-car-headrest-mount-for-switch-2">SwitchRest Car Headrest Mount For Switch 2</h3>

<p>When I'm out and about and being driven around by either my wife or children, I like to recline fully in the back seat and make full use of my time by playing my beloved video games whilst yodelling loudly. No talking when daddy is playing his games and yodelling, please. Not unless you're offering me a snack. Thanks.</p>
<p>So, given my life preferences, it seems obvious that I might want an in-car Switch console holder. Of course I do. And this one is nice and quick and very straightforward to print, too!</p>
<p>There are lots of designs for car holders out there, and some of them get very fancy with retro NES looks and so on. However, the way this one hooks on is, perhaps, one of the better designs. It's very solid and secure as it hooks onto the fully extended kickstand, holding the console firmly in place. Oh, and it just happens to take way less time and materials than most of the rest.</p>
<p>Now I can combat boredom as my wife drives me to the local sweet shop by indulging in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/race_with_ryan_road_trip_deluxe_edition">Race With Ryan</a> in the car. Hey, it feels like I'm really driving!</p>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-multi-game-case-mario-mushroom-edition">Nintendo Switch Multi-Game Case (Mario Mushroom Edition)</h3>

<p>These delightful little containers hold four game carts and are absolutely fantastic quality when you see them finished off. The twisting mechanism on the top here actually surprised me with how robust and smooth it is. These will 100% properly protect and take care of your carts.</p>
<p>What's more, as with anything else you 3D print, you can change the size, so you could have a giant version, a 50% scaled-up version or whatever you fancy. There is also, of course, the opportunity to go wild with colours, matching all in-game types and maybe doing some weird trippy ones while you're at it. Hey, they are mushrooms, amirite? Hello? Mario?</p>

<h3 id="articulated-ancient-guardian">Articulated Ancient Guardian</h3>

<p>Okay, so I cracked and decided to do some less useful items, one of which is an articulated Guardian that, I'm not gonna lie, I might actually be fully in love with.</p>
<p>Articulated figures such as this, I want to point out, are one of the best things to print for instant fun I've found, as some of them really go to town with giving you loads of posing options.</p>
<p>So whether it's this big guy (which you could scale up to make even larger) or any of the many other characters out there, get stuck into articulated stuff. Put the word 'articulated' into every search. Change your name to Articulated. It's your life!</p>

<h3 id="kirby-mouse-mode-joy-con-2-adapter">Kirby Mouse Mode Joy-Con 2 Adapter</h3>

<p>Oh Kirby, you quietly violent little blob. How I adore your ways. So much so, in fact, that I just had to choose a Kirby design for my first Mouse Mode controller adapter. I mean, just look at him!</p>
<p>I didn't, as it turns out, have any pink filament to go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_classics_kirbys_adventure">classic Kirby</a> colours here, but all that means is I got to experiment with something a little different instead. Remember with this print, if you choose to go with it, that you'll need a total of 6 hours and 20 minutes for both left and right adapters, so you might need to plan a little in advance, and this one uses lots of colours by default</p>
<p>So, if you want the classic Kirby look for a primo finish, make sure to stock up on pink, blue, black, white, and red PLA.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 3 hours 10 minutes per adapter<br>

<p>I couldn't finish up without adding this chap, could I? Oh, and in searching for this model, I discovered you can put pretty much <em>any character you can think of</em> into a search and something will turn up to print off!</p>

            <guid>1421821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> just held its 2026 summit this week, and with it came a bevy of details about future updates and plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game. Oh what joy for you scaper or runes! The main thing that got a look-in was the game's next big update, Dowdun Reach: Madness of Zamorak, which certainly has an air of someone looking at any section of a given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> and thinking "yeah, I want a fortress like that."
</p>
<p>
This update comes following some feedback the devs received over a desire to see more locales with interiors and buildings to fight through and explore, hence the castle keepy nature of this update. There's a bunch of big scary knights to fend off, and in March more details will be shared regarding the kind of loot you'll be able to pick up ahead of its release at the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
What's perhaps a touch funny about this update is that the level cap for all skills will be raised to 99, "even though the skills aren't finished yet." Perhaps an odd choice, but one that's again based on some feedback of folks "wanting to grind out levels and not waste XP." So, if you're someone that likes the grind, technically for now you'll be wasting your time, but any level-locked bits will be automatically available to you as they get added in.
</p>
<p>
After this big update, the next big one is Umbral Sands: Fire of Fuzan, planned for release this summer, which brings you to a deserty area where during the day the sun will be your biggest enemy, requiring you to find shade or build shelter to avoid its rays. There's also a big ole dragon called Fuzan you have to be cautious of, because, well, this game is called Dragonwilds after all.
</p><p>
And lastly, there's Scorned Wilderness: Rage of Kuldra, which is currently planned for launch this autumn. Details are slim on this one, but a <a href="https://dragonwilds.runescape.com/">blog post</a> does have this to say: "What we can tell you is this: Kuldra must die. Face off against the God-Eater and bring down their tyrannical reign as you muster your allies, drive into the wilderness to acquire Rune Armour and delve into the heart of the Anima storm." Why does it always have to be the God-Eater? Can't it be something nicer, less fire-breathy for once?

            <p>
I'm sure there's been many a Dweet and forum post about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is already a dead game or some such silly thing to say about a game that's not even a week old, but it does at least seem like developer Wildlight is paying attention to some of the more constructive bits of criticism about the game. Namely, that many aren't fond of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> 3v3 Raids simply because it feels like there aren't enough people for such large maps. So in turn, there's already an update adding in an experimental new raid mode.
</p>
<p>
Quite simply, as opposed to 3v3 the headcount is upped to 5v5. "We heard the feedback!" reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/538877446766724427">Steam blog post</a>. "For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!" A couple of tweaks have also been made to account for the added numbers, the first being that raids are now 10 lives instead of six, and respawns take a bit longer during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused."
</p>
<p>
With this update also comes a new base called the Soul Well, a "dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak." You should notice some small improvements here and there, for things like animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and "other gameplay systems." On top of all that, you can also turn motion blur on or off now.
</p>
<p>
None of this sounds particularly massive on the offset, but for a game like 5v5 does sound like it should liven things up a bit. We'll just have to wait and see what the results are after this weekend!

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>Wildlight has deployed another update to its live-service hero shooter, Highguard, introducing a 5v5 limited-time mode that will only be available this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of the most recent update you'll also find a brand new base, Soul Well, wherein "Wardens can now experiment with this dark relic from a lost age" in both the 3v3 and 5v5 rotations. You can find out more in the teaser below:</p>

<p>To accommodate the bigger fireteams, lobbies have been updated to permit parties of five, and raids are now 10 lives instead of six. You should also expect slightly longer respawns during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused", and the Firing Range cannot support 5v5 at this time, so expect the option to be greyed out if your party has more than three players.</p>
<p>"As one of two major patches released during launch week, this update is emblematic of the Highguard team's dedication to creating a 'ready for live service' game, resulting in immediate action," the team said.</p>
<p>"Just this week, the team has squashed hundreds of bugs, improved performance across the board: yesterday’s update, Patch 1.0.4 introduced a variety of bug fixes, new video settings, and highly-requested features."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Here's the full patch notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We heard the feedback!</p>
<p>For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!</p>
<p>The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live. Grab 4 friends and jump into some hectic raids!</p>
<p>A few small tweaks for this mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6</li>
<li>Respawns are slightly longer during raids to allow generators to be planted/defused</li>
</ul>
<p>Dev note: As most of you know, we are working on optimizations across the game. Many are in this patch and 3v3 should see good improvements! But… adding 4 more players to the game is not going to improve performance, right? Please keep that in mind as you try 5v5!</p>
<p>Dev note 2: Firing Range does not support 5v5 at this time, so the Play button will be grayed out if your party is over 3.</p>
<h2>New Base - Soul Well</h2>
<p>Soul Well is a dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak.</p>
<p>This new base will be added to the rotation in all modes.</p>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>This patch contains several optimizations that touch on animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and other gameplay systems. These optimizations benefit console and PC, but every PC is different, so the exact speedup to overall framerate is dependent on GPU, CPU, and other factors.</p>
<h2>Quality of Life</h2>
<p>Enabled these visual settings on PC and consoles</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion blur toggle for PC and consoles</li>
<li>Anisotropic materials toggle for consoles (PC has this already)</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one." Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-update-reduces-crashes-by-90-adds-crouch-toggle-option">Wildlight released an update</a>.</p>

<h2>The Roster</h2><p>WWE 2K26 boasts over 400 superstars, both current and legends, at launch, the biggest day one roster to date. While we only know of a small handful of names currently, the roster includes a host of new talent. Here are the confirmed superstars so far:</p><ul><li><strong>Andre the Giant</strong></li><li><strong>Bret Hart</strong></li><li><strong>Blake Monroe</strong></li><li><strong>Bron Breakker</strong></li><li><strong>Charlotte Flair</strong></li><li><strong>CM Punk</strong></li><li><strong>Cody Rhodes</strong></li><li><strong>Drew McIntyre</strong></li><li><strong>Eddie Guerrero</strong></li><li><strong>Iyo Sky</strong></li><li><strong>Izzi Dame</strong></li><li><strong>John Cena</strong></li><li><strong>Kane</strong></li><li><strong>Liv Morgan</strong></li><li><strong>Logan Paul</strong></li><li><strong>Myles Borne</strong></li><li><strong>Naomi</strong></li><li><strong>Penta</strong></li><li><strong>Randy Orton</strong></li><li><strong>Randy Savage</strong></li><li><strong>Rey Fénix</strong></li><li><strong>Rhea Ripley</strong></li><li><strong>Roddy Piper</strong></li><li><strong>Roman Reigns</strong></li><li><strong>Rusev</strong></li><li><strong>Seth Rollins</strong></li><li><strong>Stephanie Vaquer</strong></li><li><strong>The Undertaker</strong></li></ul><p>Additionally, former TNA World Champion and recent WWE signee <strong>Joe Hendry</strong> will be included as a pre-order bonus.</p><p>When asked if Lucha Libre AAA, which WWE acquired in 2025, would have any representation in WWE 2K26, Visual Concepts coyley replied, “Maybe. Stay tuned.” It’s worth noting that the game’s website features a teaser of a desk laden with WWE easter eggs and one suspiciously prominent photo of an iguana, potentially a nod to AAA star Mr. Iguana.</p>

<h2>New Match Types And Gameplay Updates</h2><p>WWE 2K26 will introduce four new match types: Inferno, I Quit, Three Stages of Hell, and Dumpster. Like 2K25, every match can be contested under intergender rules, so male and female wrestlers can compete against each other. The commentary teams now include Wade Barrett and Booker T as well.</p><p>Before the match starts, you can spice up and have more agency during introductions thanks to more interactive entrances. As superstars make their way to the ring, you can now toggle one of three pre-set special animations and interactions based on superstar face/heel alignment (such as offering/rejecting pre-match handshakes). You can similarly trigger pyro on the stage or in the ring. Players can also now choose to start matches in different ways, such as hyping the crowd before initiating contact or rushing an opponent before the bell rings.</p><p>As for gameplay updates, thumbtacks and shopping carts can now be used as weapons. Tables can also be stacked on top of each other in another much-requested addition. Visual Concepts touts improved reactability to falling/getting slammed on weapons, where superstars behave more realistically and take more damage from weapon offense.</p><p>They also tout smaller touches, such as how thumbtacks will visually stick to the bodies of characters to display damage. 2K26 also features improved and expanded crowd and barricade combat features. Other presentational touches include the addition of championship belt podiums at ringside during title matches.</p><p>The reversal and stamina systems have been revamped, and physics interactions have been upgraded. Visual Concepts compared 2K26’s physics as being akin to Smackdown vs. Raw 2011, for reference.</p>

<h2>Ringside Pass</h2><p>Visual Concepts is ditching its usual DLC pack model to introduce its version of a traditional battle pass. Called the Ringside Pass, it consists of 60 free tiers and 40 premium (paid) tiers where players can earn XP to unlock new content simply by playing the game.&nbsp;</p><p>The team describes this as an "added value upgrade to DLC" in that players will pay the same amount of money they normally would for the old DLC packs, but the Ringside Pass rewards more content. Players earn XP across all game modes, and players who reach tier 40 of the Ringside Pass Premium Season can unlock Superstars, cosmetics, customization items, VC, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Visual Concepts also confirms that unlockable DLC superstars are available in the first section of the Ringside Pass, so it seemingly won’t take as long to gain new faces. The studio points out that Superstars and Legends that used to be part of the Supercharger, which is no longer a thing in 2K26, will instead be obtainable in the Season 1 Ringside Pass' free tier.&nbsp;</p><p>Six Seasons of Ringside Pass will be released throughout the year, with the Season 1 pass launching alongside the game.</p><h2>Showcase Mode</h2><p>2K26’s Showcase Mode will center on the career of cover star CM Punk. Narrated by the champ himself, this interactive documentary lets players relive Punk’s biggest matches and moments as well as engage in “What If?” style fantasy matches. For example, Visual Concepts says Showcase will explore the feuds and matches that could have happened if Punk hadn’t left WWE for nearly a decade in 2014.</p>

<h2>The Island</h2><p>The Island, the explorable quest-filled hub that debuted in 2K25, makes its return in improved form. This mode is available on all platforms this year (including PC, where it was absent last year). The mode’s story builds upon last year’s iteration, with a player choosing one of three factions battling to fill the power vacuum left after Roman Reigns’ fall as the tribal chief.</p><p>The Island’s progression system has been reworked, and it features a new environment: Scrapyard Brawl. It also features more immersive quests with cutscenes and dialogue screens. The Island boasts new Towers, shops, and branded gear for players to purchase using in-game and paid currency.</p><h2>My Rise</h2><p>The story-driven campaign is back with two new division-based storylines, and Visual Concepts says the babyface/heels decisions have a larger impact this time. My Rise is also more replayable, as players can continue engaging with the mode after wrapping up the main story to earn additional unlockables and achievements.</p><h2>My GM</h2><p>The popular general manager simulation mode features more match types, more possible matches, and more outcomes. Players can book intergender matches as well as bouts pitting 5, 6, and 8 superstars against each other. My GM now has more shows per season, the option to play a 50-week season, more cross-brand PLEs, and new management challenges to test would-be showrunners.</p><h2>My Faction</h2><p>WWE 2K’s collectible card game has new intergender lineups and the ability to “Quick Swap” cards during battles for more instantaneous and strategic play. &nbsp;New My Faction chemistry allows players to boost card performance and run-in support. Of course, you can now collect new card designs and enjoy a regular release of new themed card packs and seasonal content throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Universe &amp; Creation Suite</h2><p>The simulation-based Universe Mode features the WWE Draft as the big new addition. Money in the Bank cash-ins have been improved, and more promo types have been added.

            <p>Developer AdHoc Studio has issued a statement insisting it was not "trying to hide" a disclaimer about censored content on Switch, but did admit it had inadvertently put the notice in "the absolute worst spot" on the Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dispatch released on Switch consoles. However, many were disappointed to learn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">explicit content censorship would be implemented as standard</a>. As we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-comments-on-dispatchs-switch-censorship">reported at the time</a>, this meant black boxes would conceal explcit graphics, and sex noises would be toned down.</p>
<p>AdHoc said this would not impact Dispatch's gameplay or narrative, stating these "core" experiences remain "identical to the original release". Nintendo's own statement said: "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organisations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines".</p>

<p>Now, acknowledging it has been "quiet for the last few days not because we don't want to address this stuff, but because we've been trying to make sure we're being good partners with Nintendo", the studio has issued a statement.</p><p>"As Nintendo states, any game that's going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to 'meet [Nintendo's] established content and platform guidelines'. This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn't meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That's what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we're the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms," AdHoc wrote.</p>
<p>"We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved."</p>
<p>The statement adds that AdHoc "absolutely need[s] to take full ownership" of the placement of that disclaimer, and while it "didn't have complete control of the language" the disclaimer contained, it did have control of its placement.</p>
<p>"It was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled 'Disclaimer', instead of the 'About The Game' section. We didn't catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it."</p><p>The team takes ownership of this, writing: "This is 100 percent our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We've also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, AdHoc says it is "already working with Nintendo on a path forward", and while "can't make any specific promises just yet", it is "confident we'll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content", albeit in several weeks' time due to the console submission process.</p>
<p>"To our fans who were looking forward to playing the uncensored version on Switch, we're truly sorry. People have a right to be pissed," the statement concluded. "Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon."</p>
<p>Dispatch is already hugely successful, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a>, possibly with even more sex scenes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>.</p>

<p>Will it be a big one?</p>

<figure data-uuid="e11972b3541b7"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Yoshi and the Mysterious Book" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e11972b3541b7/nintendo-switch-2-yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're already a month into 2026, and it's been a pretty solid start to the year for Switch 2. But there's <em>plenty</em> to come over the next 11 months, including many likely surprises for Nintendo's newest console.</p>
<p>Amidst big anniversaries for <strong>Zelda</strong> and <strong>Metroid</strong>, we already have a pretty solid suite of games coming out over the next few months for the Switch 2, from the Big N itself to third-parties like Capcom and Square Enix, who have gone all-in on the hybrid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> may have kicked things off all nice and familiar, a there are a lot of unknowns still, but with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> serving up an ace soon, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious</a> Book keeping us cosy with the kids, things are looking bright — and a little bit different. A brand new <strong>Fire Emblem</strong>, a <strong>Splatoon</strong> spin-off, a new <strong>Resident Evil</strong> day-and-date, and a long-awaited indie Zelda-like from the creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a>. All that and more should make the Switch 2 the place to play games in 2026.</p>
<p>So, there's a lot go get excited about — but what are <em>you</em> most looking forward to in 2026, dear reader? Yes, we want you to tell us about the games you're excited to play on Switch 2 for the rest of the year. Only confirmed games, of course; no speculation allowed here! (well, <em>maybe</em> a little).</p>
<p>So we've listed out a handful of big Nintendo Switch 2 titles coming out this year in the poll below, but you can also add your own suggestions using the search bar at the top. If you're looking for some suggestions, then you can use our list of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/35-upcoming-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-to-look-forward-to-in-2026">most-anticipated games for the year</a> or our library of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?sort=date&amp;status=soon&amp;system=nintendo-switch-2">all the upcoming Switch 2 games</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:181925 @ 1769933236 -->
<p>Oh, and for this poll, we're looking for Switch 2 titles only, for now at least. We're sure you're all as jazzed as us (read: this writer) to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, but that's a Switch 1 game.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, pick up to five games you're really looking forward too; get voting, now!</p>
