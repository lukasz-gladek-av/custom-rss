            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> hadn’t been out even a few hours before the tweets started rolling in: <a href="https://x.com/SBCoop89/status/1978582662752178301">Shiny pokémon <em>don’t despawn</em></a>. You can walk away from a shiny, and it’ll still be there when you come back.</p><p>To shiny collectors, this is <em>big</em> news. In other <em>Pokémon </em>games, like <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, pokémon despawn after you get a certain distance away from them or trigger a loading screen. I’ve missed out on my fair share of shiny pokémon this way, my heart sinking as I spotted them right before they disappeared forever.</p><p>You can still miss out on shiny pokémon in <em>Z-A</em>, but we’ll get to that in a bit.</p><p>I first discovered the new spawning mechanics myself. I heard the sparkly sound effect that signals a shiny, spotted an oddly colored Swirlix on top of a roof, and realized I had no way to get up to that roof without walking very far away. Not knowing any better, I figured I was just out of luck. (This Swirlix had a one in 4,096 chance of being shiny, so I guess I had <em>some</em> luck.)</p><p>I did try to get up to the roof, but night was about to change to day — which triggers a mini cutscene that I was sure would despawn the Swirlix — and I was in a hurry. I tried to take a shortcut through the adjacent Battle Zone. It was full of trainers ready to challenge me on sight, though, and I ended up in a battle immediately. I hadn’t forfeited one of these battles before, so I tried that, thinking maybe I’d get out of the battle and up a ladder in time to catch the shiny Swirlix… and ended up magically transported to a faraway Pokémon Center. If the night-to-day change wasn’t enough to despawn the Swirlix, I thought, surely that would do it.</p><p>A bit later, I was on some rooftops heading to an objective when I heard the shiny sound effect again. I realized it was the same Swirlix, an Alpha, still there and still shiny. I immediately messaged my colleague Charles Pulliam-Moore, who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2">reviewed <em>Z-A</em> for <em>The Verge</em></a>, half in disbelief. I thought at first it was only because the Swirlix was an Alpha, since certain Alphas always spawn in the same locations. But after launch, players and <a href="https://www.serebii.net/legendsz-a/shinypokemon.shtml">other websites</a> quickly reported that persistent shiny spawns apply to <em>all</em> shinies.</p><p>There are some exceptions, though. Charles and I were chatting about this new spawning mechanic, and he sent me a clip of a shiny Patrat he’d encountered — and which he’d barely spotted before it ran away from his character and disappeared into the ether. Patrat is one of a handful of very skittish pokémon that will flee when you get too close, and the process of fleeing <em>does</em> despawn the pokémon in question, even if it’s shiny.</p><p>That also applies to any shiny pokémon you’ve defeated in battle but failed to catch, which isn’t great news for pokémon with lower catch rates. For those, you’ll have to rely on saving — and you can’t disable autosave in <em>Z-A</em>, unlike in other recent <em>Pokémon </em>games. That sounds bad, but I’ve found that the autosave doesn’t trigger too frequently as long as you don’t fast-travel to a new location or catch a pokémon. It should still be possible to save right before battling a shiny and reload that save if you knock it out.</p><p>Fleeing pokémon aside, the new shiny spawning mechanics are great for a game so heavy on roundabout, vertical, on-foot exploration. The shinies <em>have</em> to stay in one place because reaching a pokémon in order to catch it isn’t always as simple as walking over to it. Sometimes you have to run around looking for a ladder, or get past a lot of other people who want to fight you, or run away from a wild pokémon that’s about to knock you out. It’s a relief knowing that <em>most</em> shiny pokémon will be waiting for you to reach them on your own terms.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/802089/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting]]></content:encoded>

<p>The console's staggered rollout across the US makes its launch a bittier affair than the orchestrated, worldwide drops we're used to these days. But four decades ago, the first units were purchased in the United States and Western gamers began playing with power.</p>
<p>Europe saw similarly piecemeal launches in the years that followed. Mario became a household name there, too, although the NES wasn't the same, all-conquering hit across the pond, where SEGA had a stronger foothold.</p><div><figure data-videoid="1cjcr-XtVQw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f68bgjnmtx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Still, with such a strong library from Nintendo itself, plus third-party powerhouses like Capcom and Konami delivering brilliant games while British dev Rare established itself as a premier Nintendo partner, the grey-brick-box carved out mindshare all the same. You couldn't play Mario on a Mega Drive, could you?</p>

<p>For decades, the NES has had a monopoly on the retro video gaming space in a popular sense, thanks to a mix of undeniable quality, the console's sales success, and sheer nostalgia that comes with a system so many people enjoyed as a kid. But is the latter is falling off a tad? Is this platform's outsized mindshare being chipped away by Father Time?</p>
<p>Years pass, new gamers are born and raised, and there's now a generation of video-game-loving parents for whom the Nintendo Entertainment System <em>wasn't</em> a formative console. When their kids go digging through wardrobes, they won't find a dusty NES and a box of frayed cardboard boxes buried in the back. Asking about this titanic 40-year-old system may well elicit quizzical looks these days, even from Nintendo fans. Do you have any NES carts in your collection? How many of you reading were even born in 1985?</p>

<p>Naturally, over a long enough time scale, familiarity and enthusiasm fall off. Not <em>respect -</em> there's still plenty of that. You're being deliberately obtuse to deny the transformative effect of the console and its library. But actual, card-carrying fans with firsthand affection for the NES? It feels like they're on the decline - at least if the genial shrugs of the people I've asked in the run-up to the 40th anniversary are anything to go by!</p>
<p>With the wealth of video games available and the enormous history of the medium to digest, no wonder people's passions are shifting as the medium ages. Anyone gatekeeping or dismissing younger players who — <em>tsk</em> — haven't done their homework and played OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Wonder</a>, or for whom the DS is 'their' first Nintendo, needs a talking to.</p>
<p>The NES is also possibly the most discussed and dissected console in video game history. Every five years since the turn of the millennium, we've seen retrospective blowouts and generational deep-dives across every strata of games media. <em>Haven't we been there and done all that on the 15th, 20th, 25th, 30th, and 35th anniversaries!?</em></p>
<p>Well, perhaps. But as we move forward, there's always worth in reviewing where we've been - and it's never been easier to sample the 8-bit bottle. This vintage is drinking now, so pour on, garçon!</p>
<figure data-uuid="f1a55772114d0"><a title="NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1a55772114d0/nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking around at the official options to play NES games in 2025, there's always room for improvement, but Nintendo is doing a fair job of surfacing its 8-bit library with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-nes-game-ranked">79-game-strong selection</a> of first- and third-party titles on Nintendo Switch Online, ranging from classics to curios to <em>Somebody picked up a cheap licence, hmm?</em> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/urban_champion">Urban Champion</a>.</p>
<p>Some of us, though, the possibility of access being unceremoniously revoked — which has happened with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_soccer">one Super NES game</a> at the time of writing — makes us wary of relying on access through subscription services like NSO.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are innumerable ways to play NES games 40 years on. Perhaps you're rocking an NES Classic Mini conveniently sitting under the telly. Maybe you've taken the MiSTer route or grabbed an Analogue NT or another FPGA system - or maybe a rough-and-ready clone console. Hell, you can play these games in a browser these days. (I'd say they deserve better than <em>that</em>, but of course I would.)</p>
<p>Or do you — <em>shocker</em> — still play on your original console? Have you gone down the retro rabbit hole and invested the price of a PS5 Pro in an incredible upscaling setup?</p>
<p>Or do you just <em>not</em> play NES games these days?</p>

<p>No judgement here! We're just interested to get a temperature check on how you tend to enjoy Nintendo's 8-bit output in 2025. Let us know in the poll below, and join Team NL in wishing Nintendo's little (read: actually quite large) grey box the happiest of birthdays. Why not go retro this weekend, hmm?</p>
<p><em>*goes and turns on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>*</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Easy Delivery Co. is a cozy, Lynchian dream]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/800733/easy-delivery-co-review-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/easy-delivery-co-is-a-cozy-lynchian-dream.1328512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I have been a fan of David Lynch ever since a friend’s older brother interrupted a 13th birthday celebration to insist we all watch <em>Eraserhead</em>. In the realm of horror movies, it’s a common way to be introduced to a seminal film: be it in a friend’s basement, illicit underage viewings, or a stray recommendation from a pot-smoking sibling. It feels apt, then, that my first introduction to <em>Easy Delivery Co.</em> was a friend insisting I drop everything because a game exists that lets you play as a cat driving a kei truck.</p><p>I admit, those two things don’t immediately correlate. But it’s clear that Lynch, particularly <em>Twin Peaks</em>, was a major influence for developer Sam Cameron, in what the Steam description explains is “a relaxing driving game, with <em>definitely </em>no secrets.”</p><p><em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>starts you off gently. You are a nameless black cat, rendered in the style of <em>Animal Crossing </em>on the GameCube, working as a delivery driver in a sleepy mountain community. Day and night, you shuttle supplies between shops and businesses snowed in by a perpetual blizzard. Like most real-world delivery drivers, resting is discouraged. Instead, you neck energy drinks and coffee to keep at bay the biting cold that threatens to overcome you the moment you set foot outside the adorably small cabin of your kei truck.</p><p>That cold will likely be your first sign that all is not what it seems. Succumbing to the blizzard as you shuffle to a vending machine or take too long shutting your truck’s tailgate briefly transports you to a dark and ostensibly endless maze, before you wake to resume your deliveries. Yet, as your world expands to other towns, you’ll also find that, curiously, all the shopkeepers remain the same. Then there’s MK, the only character you’ll meet outside — and the only dog in town — who leads you away from the repeating web of deliveries to set you on the path to unraveling the mountain’s mysteries.</p><p><em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>is not a complex game. You drive, pick stuff up, and spend your earnings on the means to do more of that. This low-poly mix of <em>Lake </em>and <em>Silent Hill</em> makes for an interesting concept, even if, like many indie games that hit upon an intriguing hook, the story is a little clumsy — especially as the game shifts from a meandering string of ostensibly unrelated tasks toward its narrative climax.</p><p>There are rough edges, too. Among a few minor bugs I encountered, dropping cargo — which you’ll do often on these icy roads — can sometimes leave you unable to retrieve it even though it’s right in front of you. Those rough edges, however, are not terminal. That specific bug is easily remedied by aborting the job and picking another, as <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>is pleasingly forgiving, levying few penalties for leaving a job or having a rough drive.</p><p>Driving, the thing you’ll do the most in this game, is relaxing without being passive, a hard balance to strike. Setting <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>in a snowy tangle of mountain roads, delivering a variety of items that impact how your truck handles, is a smart turn. You can zone out somewhat, but not completely, as you have to adjust for the conditions and loads. This is something you’ll become accustomed to after you careen off the road and roll down the mountain a few times — something I did a little more often for playing with the perfectly manageable keyboard controls, rather than a controller. None of that is frustrating. In fact, more than once a mistake led to an accidental shortcut, achieved mostly by somehow surviving a lengthy cartwheel down an incline with my cargo intact.</p><p>If I have one glaring issue with <em>Easy Delivery Co.</em>, it’s the balance between direction and freedom. Many mechanics in-game are found in readable tutorials but also able to be puzzled out. For instance, I appreciated being able to ignore guidance and work out how to make coffee myself or that my lighter will let me stay out in the cold for longer. Being ushered through the game’s main quest by MK, I found myself — oddly for someone usually allergic to obfuscation — wishing there was more of the central mystery to discover independently, more secrets beyond the odd collectible to solve myself. Though that, I think, comes from a desire to spend more time in <em>Easy Delivery Co.</em>’s eerier side<em>.</em> Either that or I’m just a cat person.</p><p>It’s a sign of how versatile <em>Easy Delivery Co.</em> can be, however. You can, if you’re inclined, race through the game’s main story with minimal deliveries in the space of a few hours. You can also completely ignore it — and MK — and stay frozen in a sequence of deliveries, basking in the low-poly, nostalgic environment and listening to catchy jingles through the radio.</p><p>My favorite way to play was to make <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>small in the corner of my screen, where it remained perfectly visible and playable, while watching YouTube or TV… which may have contributed to how much time I spent off-road. I might be biased, if only because <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>feels like it’s been developed from a Venn diagram of my specific interests (especially adorably proportioned motor vehicles). But one of my gaming holy grails is something I can play and enjoy while watching something else to pass tired hours — in <em>Easy Delivery Co. </em>I’ve finally found that.</p><div><p><sub>Easy Delivery Co. <em>is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3293010%2FEasy_Delivery_Co%2F" rel="sponsored">available now on Steam</a>.</em></sub></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/800733/easy-delivery-co-review-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Roberta Williams’ The Colonel’s Bequest was a different type of adventure game]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/roberta-williams-the-colonels-bequest-was-a-different-type-of-adventure-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roberta-williams%E2%80%99-the-colonel%E2%80%99s-bequest-was-a-different-type-of-adventure-game.1328506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>However, my mom was another story. I remember her playing <em>Dr. Mario</em> a lot, and we played <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> together when I was young—standard millennial childhood family gaming stuff. But the games I most associate with her from my childhood are adventure games. She liked <em>King’s Quest</em>, of course—but I also remember her being particularly into the <em>Hugo</em> trilogy of games.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, I struggled to get hooked on those. Fortunately, we were able to meet in the middle on <em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em>.</p>
<p>I remember swapping chairs with my mom as we attempted additional playthroughs of the game; I enjoyed seeing the secrets she found that I hadn’t because I was perhaps too young to think things through the way she did.</p>
<p>Games you played with family stick with you more, so I think I mostly remember <em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em> so well because, as I recall, it was my mom’s favorite game.</p>
<h2>The legacy of <em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em></h2>
<p><em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em> may have been a pivotal game for me personally, but it hasn’t really resonated through gaming history the way that <em>King’s Quest</em>, <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, or other adventure titles did.</p>
<p>I think that’s partly because many people might understandably find the game a bit boring. There’s not much to challenge you here, and your character is kind of just along for the ride. She’s not the center of the story, and she’s not really taking action. She’s just walking around, listening and looking, until the clock runs out.</p>
<p>That formula has more niche appeal than traditional point-and-click adventure games.</p>
<p>Still, the game has its fans. You can <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fthe_colonels_bequest">buy and download it from GOG</a> to play it today, of course, but it also recently inspired a not-at-all-subtle spiritual successor by developer Julia Minamata called <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fthe_crimson_diamond"><em>The Crimson Diamond</em></a>, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/the-crimson-diamond-is-a-wonderful-ega-like-graphic-adventure-game-for-2024/">we covered here at Ars</a>. That game is worth checking out, too.</p>

              <p>The laptop market is drowning in hundreds of models, each claiming to be the perfect fit and honestly, it’s exhausting trying to figure out which one actually delivers daily performance without unnecessary extras. If you need a powerful machine that handles real work without drama, this Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop (16GB RAM, 1.25TB Storage) checks every box, especially at its current price: Dell rarely drops discounts below 30 percent on its own site, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4851/">Amazon just slashed this model to an all-time low of $699, down from $1,999</a>. That’s a <strong>65 percent reduction</strong> on a laptop built for people who actually use their computers for more than checking email.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4851/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Processing Power That Can Keep Up With Your Load</h2>
<p>The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor is where this notebook diverges from budget laptops. This is the<strong> 10-core processor with hybrid architecture: two performance cores that operate between 1.3GHz and 4.6GHz to handle intensive jobs</strong>&nbsp;and eight efficiency cores that work between 0.9GHz and 3.4GHz to handle background processes.</p>
<p>The 12MB cache memory keeps often-used data on hand for quick grab and go, and eliminates the time your processor spends searching through RAM. Practically speaking, it means you can be on video conference calls and working on spreadsheet edits, churning out presentations and keeping hundreds of browser tabs open without the system grinding to an unresponsive crawl.</p>



<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM provides you the working memory you need to handle heavy multitasking. RAM is where programs youre currently running live, and more room means more smooth-as-silk performance when youre running several programs. Storage is provided by the lightning-fast 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD. <strong>PCIe NVMe SSDs are the fastest consumer storage tech available</strong> and cut boot times and file copies by orders of magnitude over old hard drives or earlier SATA SSDs. The system comes with an<strong> included second 256GB SD card</strong> to boost overall storage to 1.25TB to accommodate massive media libraries.</p>
<p>The 15.6-inch FHD touchscreen uses WVA panel technology. This ensures colors stay consistent when viewed from the side whcih is crucial during collaborative work sessions. The 1920 x 1080 resolution delivers sharp text and detailed images while the anti-glare coating reduces eye strain during long work sessions and makes the screen readable in bright environments. The narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without increasing the laptop’s footprint, keeping it portable while maintaining a comfortable viewing area. <strong>Intel Iris Xe Graphics handles visual processing</strong> and offers smooth performance for video playback.</p>



<p>The Realtek Wi-Fi 6 card has faster speeds and better performance in busy networks compared to Wi-Fi 5, which is essential for video conferencing and cloud office collaboration. Bluetooth accommodates wireless mice, headphones, and keyboard. <strong>Port options are USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A and Type-C to transfer data quickly, USB 2.0 to connect to previous accessories, HDMI 1.4 to connect an external monitor, headset jack, and SD card slot</strong>. The <span>bundled 8-in-1 docking station</span> accommodates more connectivity with additional USB ports and SD slots and an RJ-45 ethernet connector to remain connected by wire and output the HDMI signal to an external monitor.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Professional is available in S Mode to limit installations to Microsoft Store applications for increased security. S Mode can be switched off permanently if traditional desktop applications are required. The keyboard is full size and has the familiar 10-key numerical keypad to handle spreadsheet work and data entry.</p>
<p>With these specifications at $699, you get hardware worth $1500 to $2,000 even on sale.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES for short, has turned 40. Launching in the United States at a time when the industry was still dealing with the consequences of the huge Video Game Crash of 1983, the first Nintendo home system to launch in the West not only revitalized a dying market but propelled it to new heights, setting some of the standards that are still very much in place to this day.</p>



<p>To celebrate the system's 40th anniversary, we had a chat with Frank Cifaldi, Founder and Director of the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">Video Game History Foundation</a>. Backed by the foundation's efforts to preserve gaming history, Frank provided unique, research-backed insights into the console's success, the magic it created, its critical 1985 unveiling at CES, and its lasting legacy.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The interview was conducted with a written email Q&amp;A, and lightly edited for publication</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>1. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Nintendo Entertainment System, a console that arguably reshaped the entire video game industry. In your view, what were the key factors that made the NES such a success in the U.S and Japan?</strong></p>



<p>The late 80s and early 90s “Nintendomania” that swept the U.S. - the dominant video game market of the time - can really be boiled down to two things: Nintendo made a great product, and they were in the right place at the right time. Following the home console industry crash, there was a good year or two where there just weren't any exciting news products coming out. Nintendo, which had already released the Famicom in Japan over two years prior, came out swinging with some very high quality games, chief among them Super Mario Bros. The quality (and quantity!) of the games along with Mario’s instant star appeal ensured that when competitors Atari and Sega entered the market, they were left in the dust.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>2. For many people, the NES is a magical system, evoking feelings of wonderment that few other gaming systems do. From your research and interviews, what do you think gave the system this sense of wonder? Was it the games, the marketing, or something less tangible?</strong></p>



<p>If you weren't there, I think it's hard to understand just how dominant Nintendo was to children and teens of its era. The word “Nintendo” was synonymous with “video game” for a while there, and classic NES franchises like Super Mario Bros, Metroid, and Zelda were all introduced within the span of a year or two. Factor in all of the merchandising and even the television shows, and you've basically got nostalgia soup.</p>



<p><strong>3. Your recent work has focused on the only surviving press kit for the NES's unveiling at the 1985 CES. What makes this specific artifact so historically important, and what does it reveal about Nintendo's strategy for presenting the NES to skeptical American retailers during the height of the Video Game Crash?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://gamehistory.org/nintendos-lost-8-bit-console/">The AVS</a> represents such an interesting “what if” that historians like myself can't resist it. What if Nintendo had gone a more educational and high tech route than the more “gamey” NES? Would it have worked? And if it has failed, would something else have taken its place in our hearts and memories? Seeing the AVS is like peering into another timeline.</p>



<p><strong>4. Following the Video Game Crash, the NES's success in the U.S. was anything but guaranteed. How close do you think Nintendo came to a catastrophic failure before the system found its footing, and what was the single biggest contingency that saved the launch?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo’s take on the video game industry crash of the 80s was that Atari failed in two ways: first, they didn't prevent other companies from flooding the market with “unofficial” games of variable quality, and second, even the official games sold by Atari were often considered low quality, at least by Nintendo's standards. The launch of the NES was hyper focused on product quality and customer satisfaction, and while you could point at other factors, I believe this is the main reason they succeeded.</p>



<p><strong>5. Your recent research also covers Atari's near-acquisition of Nintendo before the NES launch. Why did that landmark deal ultimately collapse, and if it had succeeded, would we have seen the immediate recovery of the industry, or simply the collapse of a combined entity?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We don't know why the Atari deal fell through, we simply don't have enough of a historical record. I also can't speculate on what would have happened if it had gone through - sorry, I'm a researcher and a historian! I don't do “make believe” very well.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Frank Cifaldi is the founder of the Video Game History Foundation, a non-profit foundation whose primary aim is the preservation of historical media related to video games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>6. The NES legendary status among players is undeniable, as is its impact on the video game industry as a whole. From the iconic controller to how Nintendo managed its relations with third-party developers, which of the console's features has changed the industry so much that its influence can still be clearly felt today?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The existence of the “lock-out chip” inside of the NES is really the first time serious effort was put into preventing unofficial games from being sold on a video game system, and we have never looked back. This, to me, is the legacy of the NES, for better or worse. Video game consoles could have been like computers, where anyone can write and self-publish games without having to pay a share to the console maker, but the NES took technical, legal, and straight-up manipulative tactics to make sure this didn't happen, and video game consoles have been this way ever since. It's probably what saved the industry, even if it might have stifled some creative freedoms. Luckily we've swung back around, and it's easy to self-publish a game these days and find an audience, but for a long time you couldn't make a living making console games without giving the hardware maker a cut.</p>



<p><strong>7. The Video Game History Foundation has done incredible work preserving game prototypes, ads, and behind-the-scenes materials. What's the biggest challenge today in preserving artifacts from the NES era before they're lost to time?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Thank you, as we are incredibly passionate about the need for game preservation for future generations. The biggest preservation challenge we face when preserving material this old is human mortality, with a close second being the cost of real estate. The former, I hope, is self-explanatory, but the latter is based on how often we've heard people respond, “oh, I wish you'd contacted me last year, I had boxes of stuff that I threw out when we moved.” We want people to know that we are here, so if there are any artifacts they want to know about, or donate, the VGHF would greatly appreciate the support.</p>



<p><strong>8. Looking at the modern retro and preservation scene—from mini consoles to fan restorations—do you feel the industry is doing enough to preserve not only the NES legacy, but also that of other gaming systems and their games?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“Preservation” and “commercial availability” are two separate concepts. I don't feel that preservation is the duty of the commercial industry, that's our jobs as archivists. There is no possible future in which for-profit companies allow access to material that would cause them to lose money, which is frankly the majority of video game history, so we are working towards a future where libraries and archives can offer access to material without having to butt heads with political opposition funded by the industry that prevents us from doing our jobs.</p>



<p><strong>9. Considering how many games released on the NES, opinions vary on which titles defined the system. In your opinion, which first-party and third-party games contributed to this legendary status the most?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Based on sales numbers I can tell you as an objective fact that the three Super Mario Bros games sold more than any others. The fact that they're all still sold today, and remixed in products like Super Mario Maker, all but confirms that these are the titles that defined the system. Outside of that, it's really interesting to note how popular games based on entertainment franchises were. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Top Gun games sold significantly more units than most titles for the system.</p>



<p><strong>10. Finally, as someone who's both a historian and a lifelong Nintendo fan, what does the NES personally mean to you, forty years later?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The NES dropped in 1985 and defined what a home video game was, and I don't think it's changed much since then. Before the NES, video games were a fad. After the NES, they were an industry.</p>



<p><strong>Thanks for your time!</strong></p>



<p>Dear NES, happy 40th birthday! May you celebrate a thousand more!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/millennium-falcon-set-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-crushes-lego-star-wars-stock-prices-2000636914</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/millennium-falcon-set-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-crushes-lego-star-wars-stock-prices.1328476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been around LEGO collecting for any amount of time, you know the deal: <strong>Star Wars sets are the crown jewel of the entire catalog</strong>, the most popular licensed theme LEGO has ever produced, and discounts? They’re about as rare as finding a mint condition Boba Fett mini-figurine at a garage sale.</p>
<p>That’s what makes this current Amazon deal so unique: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">Millennium Falcon 25th Anniversary edition just hit an all-time low of $67, down from $84</a>. This is a commemorative piece celebrating a quarter-century of LEGO Star Wars magic, and seeing it at this price is the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come around often.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mid-Scale Marvel That Demands Attention</h2>
<p>There are <strong>921 pieces in the set and the final product</strong> is an accurately detailed replica of the Millennium Falcon exactly as it appeared in the first movie, A New Hope. All the important details are there: the celebrated cockpit where Han and Chewie plotted the movie’s famous narrow escapes, the satellite dish that’s almost as iconic as the ship and those cannons mounted cheek by jowl to blast TIE fighters to pieces. Details are incredibly fine giving the mid-scale size of the build: you can’t quite hide them away but they’re not so big that they’re nothing but eye candy.</p>
<p>The included stand isn’t just functional: it tilts the Falcon at a dynamic angle that makes it look like it’s banking through an asteroid field or making the jump to light speed. The stand features a nameplate and a commemorative LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary brick, and turns this from a simple model into a proper collectible piece. At <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide</strong> when mounted, it strikes that perfect balance between being substantial enough to showcase and compact enough to find a home on a bookshelf.</p>



<p>The set itself provides that elusive LEGO experience adults seek: substantial enough to be compelling over the course of multiple building sessions but not so gigantic that it’s a months-long affair like the 7,500-piece Ultimate Collector’s Edition. It’s included within LEGO’s Starship Collection, an individual line aimed specifically at adult builders who want display-worthy models but not furniture-sized builds. Over the course of several pleasant evenings, the 921 pieces come together to provide that calm and focused building experience that’s become one of the key attractions of adult LEGO sets.</p>
<p>For the price, it’s an affordable way to get into Star Wars collecting if you’re new to the franchise or an automatic purchase if you’re an existing fan. As a gift set, it’s perfect, the box presentation is high-end and the ages 18+ warning is an indication the set is aimed at adult sensibilities.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Shadow of the Colossus is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, October 18, 2025. Below, we examine the moral complexity of its narrative as told through its silent protagonist.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Does a silent protagonist equal a self-insert? The logic of many video games dictates yes. Heroes like Gordon Freeman and Link have been forever silent, only grunting or shouting. Even Master Chief, who does have a voice, obscures his face. Under his mask, there could be anyone there.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this common logic, silence is often alienating. Few games embody this better than the works of Fumido Ueda. The protagonists of Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, and The Last Guardian are taciturn, often silent or speaking only a fantastical language, which is either subtitled or not immediately understood. Moments of speech, or even of action outside of player input, are profound and rare.</p><p dir="ltr">Under the logic of silent identification, these protagonists would be simple, iconographic player stand-ins. Yet Ueda's curated gaps create an empathetic distance from his games' heroes. Over the 20 years since Shadow of the Colossus' release, it has proven its profundity as a moral fable because of its distance from the player.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="230429285"

format.     </p><p>Sorry, but you can't access this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">This is not to say that Shadow of the Colossus is uninterested in the video game form. Protagonist Wander's quest is grounded in games past. He seeks to rescue his love from death. To do so, he must slay the titular colossi: massive foes strewn across a forbidden land. The entity spurring Wander on, Dormin, is a voice from the heavens haloed in light. Wander wields a legendary sword--one whose connection with the sun guides him on his quest. In every superficial sense, he is the epitome of a hero. He has a noble quest, a holy tool, and monstrous foes meant for killing.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, Wander is the aggressor. For many of the colossi, he must fire his bow and arrow at them to even gain their attention. It is only when he intrudes on their space, and often not until he attacks them, that they will attack him. The colossi bleed black. It spurts from them as Wander stabs them. They moan, flail, weep, and scream as he climbs over and on them. Each colossus has an animal nobility, which Wander murders. Each element is a part of Shadow of the Colossus' rhetoric. Collectly, they change the usual aspects of heroic fantasy into something horrifying.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, Wander is not a cypher or a stand-in. Often, games with silent protagonists start from a position of relative normalcy. Think of Gordon Freeman's long train ride to the office in Half-Life, or Link's childhood stomping ground of Kokiri Forest in Ocarina of Time. In Shadow of the Colossus, we start midway through Wander's journey as he travels on horseback over the land. When he arrives and places his love Mono on an altar, we learn only a few things about him. One, he carries an "ancient sword," as Dormin calls it. Two, he is attempting to free his love from death and some curse. Three, his horse Agro is a loyal and courageous companion. There is the suggestion of a life lived outside the bounds of the games. There are things that matter that the player cannot yet see or know about.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Wander's exact motivations are shadowy. His relationship with Mono is never depicted. Instead we see how he acts without her. His journey to kill the colossi is strenuous and dangerous both, yet he continues with almost unfailing motivation. The player can direct him to stand over Mono's body on the altar. The camera zooms in, intimate in a way the game rarely is otherwise. Wander's love is profound, and perhaps selfish given how much he will destroy to see it restored, yet we do not witness it, and thus struggle to identify with it directly. Shadow of the Colossus builds this understanding through gestures that accumulate into cascading meaning.</p><p dir="ltr">Through these gestures, the game takes on a theatrical quality. The player inhabits Wander as an actor might play a role. The player makes some choices, like how often he visits Mono between besting colossi or whether their own skill will define him as a dexterous warrior or a clumsy, though strong-willed, commoner. Yet, the form is set. Wander has made his choices. The player can only interpret them.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a massive contrast with many other games, which are often concerned with the main character's morality. BioShock and Spec Ops: The Line, for example, use the main character as a player surrogate. BioShock's plot twist emphasizes how little agency the player actually has in the story, turning its hero into a hapless stooge. In Spec Ops: The Line, the player's will to finish the game and protagonist Walker's belief in the importance of his mission are equivocated. As Walker's determination damns him, it implicates the player too. In loading screens and monologues, Spec Ops admonishes the player to stop playing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586935-3346064-colossus_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586935" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586935-3346064-colossus_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586935"></a><figcaption>Shadow of the Colossus (2018)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586935-3346064-colossus_7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Both these games have a little more under the hood than mere player condemnation, yet there is something shallow about their approach to protagonist morality. The developers themselves are curiously absent from this logic, for example. BioShock's twist has dramatic force, but little emotional heft. The protagonist isn't anyone; he is only a tool. The twist relies on player identification that comes only from absence. Spec Ops: The Line fairs better in this regard. Walker is a character of at least two dimensions. Yet, if he is a character who acts on his own terms, why all this discussion of player complicity? The moral swing cannot quite implicate the player in any real way.</p><p dir="ltr">Shadow of the Colossus is also interested in agency, but not that of the player--, rather, of Wander himself. BioShock and Spec Ops are both loud. Antagonists Andrew Ryan and John Konrad explain tell the themes to the player in direct terms. Shadow of the Colossus is quiet. Its world is full of empty spaces and empty time. That emptiness leads to an empathetic, though still distant, stance. Through the process of play, the player comes to understand Wander. That process of embodiment is fuzzy, mythical, not simple or reducible. Shadow of the Colossus doesn’t treat the player as a hapless stooge, unable to really understand the situation at hand until the game’s writers offer their magnanimous help. Wander’s wrongdoing is not a twist. That fact allows the player to sit with it, even to embody it for a time.</p><p dir="ltr">Condemnation is cheap; it is understanding that is hard won and difficult. Though Walker has more voice lines and more writing, Wander still feels more real because his personhood is not attached to the player. Instead, there is a sense of an exchange. We feel for Wander and mourn for him. That relationship has a deeper and more profound bearing on our own morality than simple condemnation. If we ask whether we are guilty, Shadow of the Colossus will always be silent.</p><p dir="ltr">At the game's end, after a fellowship sworn to stop Wander arrives and seals him within the forbidden land, Wander goes where the player cannot follow. The sealing process has turned him into a child, which the successfully resurrected Mono seems to want to raise. All of Wander's heroics and strength have been sapped out of him. He is now a creature incapable of holding a controller.</p><p dir="ltr">That ambiguous end is part of what gives Shadow of the Colossus its lasting power. We were Wander's companions for a time. We walked with him. But his fate is his own. So too, is ours.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done">Game Informer</a>, co-director Jason Connell and lead writer Ian Ryan talked about how game developers get the "rare opportunity" to "ctually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story versus maybe what didn't or what are the holes", and use that feedback to shape further story DLC and content… if any further story is needed, that is.</p>

<p>"I think for us, we are at the spot in the project where we just get to put it out there and see what's resonating with people and what people love and what people feel like they wish they maybe knew more about Atsu," Connell said when asked about possible DLC. </p><p>"And I think for us, this is like the most important part of the project, in terms of making decisions like these, because same thing with [Ghost of] Tsushima. You can listen, you can be like, 'Oh, okay. People seem to want to know a little bit more about that relationship or what happened to the dad.' How do you further that character?"</p>
<p>He continued: "And you get this rare opportunity to actually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story versus maybe what didn't or what are the holes. And I think that's the mode that you want to be in. And that's sort of the gift. </p>
<p>"Certainly we love Atsu, and we think it's a great character. And just like with Jin, if there's room to improve it or to bring some new elements to life or clarity for the narrative's sake and it falls within what is best for Sucker Punch, then we'll certainly take a hard look at that for sure."</p>
<p>As for how it feels to receive criticism?</p>
<p>"For me, I think criticism is a gift," Connell said. "There's some people that are going to love what you make and some people are maybe not going to like it. There's criticism nobody ever wants to hear [...] but it makes you better creators, right? Because you think about the perspective of that player or another player. Maybe it's just okay this person didn't like this because this was maybe for this kind of player."</p><p>Ghost of Yōtei is Sucker Punch's follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, set in northern Japan around 300 years later. We awarded it 3/5 stars, writing in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-review">Eurogamer's Ghost of Yōtei review</a>: "Sucker Punch's sequel offers more great swordplay and heartfelt storytelling, but would be better served as a linear action game, freed of its poor sidequests and dated open world."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently emerging from brooding in their fortresses, the Helsmiths of Hashut, the Chaos Duardin, have decided to take back by force what's rightfully theirs, leaving destruction in their wake.&nbsp; In this article, we check out the new wave of&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> releases for the spiritual cousins of <em>Warhammer's</em> Chaos Dwarfs, the Helsmiths of Hashut.</p>

<p>We've been covering <i>Age of Sigmar </i>for a while on the site, and you can check out our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> 4th Edition launch box <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set" rel="nofollow">here</a>, as well as our review of the first Helsmith's release, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>. You can read our getting started with the <em>AoS</em> Spearhead style of gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>




<h2>Thick Beards, Horns, And Tusks</h2>

<p>Following the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>, which acted as an introduction to the faction (and included their Spearhead force and Battletome), they now get their full release of units to flesh out the rest of their army.</p>

<p>The Helsmiths playstyle focuses on a small number of durable and powerful units, in close combat and at range, and also uses demonic power points that can be placed on specific key units to make them more powerful. Like their noble Duardin cousins, the Helsmiths are also slow, and even as durable as they are, initial positioning during deployment and early movement choices are crucial to capturing objectives and countering key opposing units.</p>

<p>Urak Taar is an absolute beast, as would be expected of someone titled The First Daemonsmith. It is said that he trained directly under the Helsmith's god, Hashut himself. Urak Taar's miniature towers over the rest of the range, even the hulking Dominator Engines that came in the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>.</p>

<p>On the tabletop, Urak Taar is the only other Helsmith who can keep up with the Bull Centaur's movement of 10, which is great for getting them into combat, which you absolutely want to do. While Urak has a ranged attack with 6 attacks, each doing D3 damage (which can also shoot in combat), Urak and the massive Infernal Taurus, Ghorrakos that he rides, excel in close combat, where Urak has 4 attacks, each dealing D3 damage, and Ghorrakos has 6 attacks dealing 4 wounds each on the charge.</p>

<p>Urak also has a once-per-turn ability that deals D3 mortal wounds to an enemy unit if they charged that turn, and they can also move 2D6 inches after combat, but must end their move in combat, allowing them to skip over a unit into combat with another unit behind. Along with having bonuses to having demonic power points themselves (we discussed DPP in our&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>&nbsp;review), during the enemy hero phase, they can also reallocate 3 DPP between any units within 18 inches, allowing you to switch from units with offensive DPP bonuses to those with defensive DPP bonuses for your opponent's turn.</p>

<p>The Urak Taar miniature can also be built as a standard Daemonsmith on Infernal Taurus, but with Urak Taar's devastating attacks and abilities, the choice is always The First Daemonsmith.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-3.jpg?itok=qf9NbijT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-3.jpg?itok=bRBWlsk0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>War Despot</h2>

<p>The War Despot is the same miniature from the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>, but using them outside of the Spearhead gives them a slightly different profile. They're not mounted, so move at the same rate as the Helsmiths' infantry units. They boost the control scores of nearby infantry units, so you don't want them to drift to far from them anyway, but with each DPP, the range of the ability is boosted by 6 inches.</p>

<p>The War Despot also has the ability to make a friendly infantry unit within their fight range, fight immediately after them, boosting their attacks by 1 for the rest of the turn. For their own attacks, the Despot has a Daemonflame Glavie, with 5 attacks, each at damage 2.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-4.jpg?itok=tzxpG6dF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-4.jpg?itok=WDv_bSRS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Bull Centaurs</h2>

<p>I'd already spotted the Bull Centaurs as one of my favorite Helsmiths' units when reviewing the Army Set, and the miniatures don't disappoint, delivering everything you want in a Helsmiths unit, including all the beards, all the horns, and all the tusks. The box can be built as either 3 Bull Centaurs or 3 Anointed Sentinels.</p>

<p>Both the Centaurs and the Sentinels have a move of 10, giving the Helsmiths a much-needed fast unit ahead of the sturdy advance of their infantry, but the Bull Centaurs are much better offensively, with an extra attack and the ability to deal mortal wounds after they charge with their Bull Charge ability. Both the Centaurs and Sentinels add 1 to charge rolls for each DPP they have, so unless you need to save the points (Sentinels are slightly cheaper than the Centaurs), then you're always going to pick Centaurs (despite the golden bull head helmets looking super cool).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-5.jpg?itok=ZyXMUR-p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-5.jpg?itok=8spxW_RT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Infernal Razers</h2>

<p>Another of our favorite units are the Infernal Razers, who come in two distinct flavors. Armed with Flamehurlers or Blunderbusses, the flamehurlers have a shorter range, but more attacks, and the blunderbusses have a slightly longer range, but are easier to wound and deal 2 damage each. They both have the ability to gain rend for each DPP they have, and the flamehurlers can lower the control score of a targeted unit, while the blunderbusses can give a targeted unit strike-last by rolling a 6+, adding in the number of models slain by that unit to the roll.</p>

<p>Their box comes with 5 miniatures that can be built as either, depending on what role you want them to fill. They both look incredibly thematic, but the blunderbusses look awesome with their demon-possessed weaponry ready to unleash havoc.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-6.jpg?itok=iSM5WJln 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-6.jpg?itok=-oNpBmnY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Hobgrot Vandalz</h2>

<p>The final unit we're going to look at in this article are the Hobgrot Vandalz. The Hobgrots' entire existence is to get in the way of your opponent's units, and they do that with a slightly higher movement than the rest of the Hashut infantry and the ability to take a normal move during the deployment phase to screen ahead of your main force.</p>

<p>The Helsmiths' disdain for the Hobgrots means that all their abilities and the demonic power points don't apply to the Hobgrot (most specify non-Hobgrot), but that allows you to just throw them into combat, for which they have 2 attacks. Their box allows you to build 20 Hobgrot Vanalz, including a champion, musician and standard bearer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-7.jpg?itok=WSGxZkyq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-7.jpg?itok=MkDeghxK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Age of Sigmar Helsmiths of Hashut Army Units Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I absolutely love the Helsmiths of Hashut theme and the aesthetics of their miniature range. Urak Taar offers an incredible centerpiece, and the clean standardization of the range, infantry, cavalry, artillery, and chaff to screen the core units makes them easy to get into. As previously mentioned, their slow movement can mean that poor positioning and movement phase choices don't make them a forgiving force, but they are durable, and when in doubt, fire with the artillery and smash into targets with Urak and the Bull Centaurs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After the strong pushback to changes to the length of Conquest matches in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, Battlefield Studios has reversed those changes, and also adjusted the XP and progression in some really positive ways. Chalk this one up as a win for the good guys!</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Battlefield Studios pushed live a change to Conquest matches that reduced the ticket count by up to 30%, in an effort to make matches shorter and always completed. This got reams and reams of complaints from the vocal parts of the community, such that they hastily reverted the change, restoring all maps back to 1,000 tickets and 45-minute round timers.</p>


<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o8wtub/bfcomms_conquest_update_ticket_counts_restored/">They seem a bit miffed about this though</a>, as they say “Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm this change may lead to longer match durations.”</p>
<p>Yeah…. we know. That’s exactly what people said they wanted!</p>
<p>The community had also said that they wanted some faster progression, with certain key milestones set for after level 20, locking away some of the longer class-based challenges away until you’ve already spent a dozen hours in the multiplayer. This brings assignments from when your Career Rank is in the 20s down to the 10s, so you can make a faster start on them, and general XP has been boosted by 10% for match completion and 40% for Daily Challenges.</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o91xk4/bfcomms_battlefield_6_progression_changes_now_live/">The changes are as follows</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Match Completion XP per min increased by 10%</li>
<li>XP from Daily Challenges increased by 40%</li>
<li>The XP needed to unlock the first 20 Attachment Ranks has been reduced.
<ul>
<li>Please Note: For weapons that are already being progressed, the UI might display something inaccurate at first; this will resolve once a match has been played with that weapon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assignments requiring Career Ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require Career Ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team also notes that some of the challenges themselves have come in for criticism, putting a high bar on specific types of actions, like healing teammates within contested capture points, getting suppressing fire (which is more of a byproduct of missing your target), kills while using the Assault class adrenaline shot, or just needing to get some a really high volume of various things. They can be a bit of a chore, let’s say.</p>
<p>“As stated within the Community Update, we are aware of the frustrations regarding the challenges themselves. We are actively working on reviewing them, but it will take more time to develop, test, and implement these changes.”</p>
<p>Two big and positive changes, then. Hopefully the group keep it up!</p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o91xk4/bfcomms_battlefield_6_progression_changes_now_live/">Reddit</a></em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dead-space-franchise-creator-glen-schofield-really-wants-to-make-fourth-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-space-franchise-creator-glen-schofield-really-wants-to-make-the-fourth-game-thinks-ea-may-sell-the-ip.1328452/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Veteran game designer Glen Schofield <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to IGN</a> during the Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show about his desire to get Dead Space 4 made. Schofield shared that he petitioned Electronic Arts 'recently', telling them he'd be able to make the former Visceral Games leadership return, and that he could save the publisher between 30 and 40 million dollars by reusing the assets created by Motive Studio for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 remake of the original game</a>. However, EA turned him down. It is unclear if he was referring to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-4-pitch-from-original-creators-was-rejected-by-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refused pitch he had already outlined nearly a year ago</a> or if he had already tried again at some point in 2025.</p>



<p>Regardless, Schofield, who co-created the franchise back when he was at Visceral Games, isn't giving up. In fact, he told IGN that there might be an opportunity following <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA's $55 billion leveraged buyout by a Consortium of investors</a>, and he's already 'making calls' to see that come to fruition:</p>



<p><em>We'll see. I don’t know where EA's head is right now. I don’t think they made money on the Dead Space remake. Dead Space needs to be adapted to different mediums — movies, TV series, it would be great. But I am more optimistic, because somebody new could buy the IP.</em></p>



<p>Schofield is definitely right about EA not making much profit from the remake of the first installment, which is why Motive's pitch for a remake of the second entry was denied and the sci-fi horror franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-2-remake-was-never-greenlit-by-ea-franchise-is-now-once-again-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got put on hold once again</a>. </p>



<p>He might also be correct about the possibility of the publisher selling the IP. We know that after the leveraged buyout, EA will have to decrease its substantial debt with cost-cutting measures. That will likely involve layoffs, but analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have also discussed possible studio and/or franchise divestitures</a>. The widespread belief is that EA will consolidate around its top-performing franchises, such as the sports games and the Battlefield series, leaving little space for single player franchises like Dragon Age, Mass Effect, or Dead Space, which haven't always performed to their expectations.</p>



<p>It's interesting to see Glen Schofield taking an optimistic stance once again, though. In late July, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-the-callisto-protocol-directed-his-last-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confessed he might have directed his last game with The Callisto Protocol</a>, after he failed to secure backing for a new project. The Callisto Protocol was heavily inspired by Dead Space, but despite a big budget provided by Krafton, it was unable to meet the expectations of both fans and investors, leading to Schofield's departure from Striking Distance Studios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While attending Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show in Bangkok this week, IGN was given the opportunity to sit down with Rainbow Six Siege X’s creative director Alexander Karpazis to talk about how much the tactical live-service shooter has evolved in the ten years since its launch in 2015, where it might go next, the possibility of a campaign mode and Switch 2 port, the use of generative AI in development, and more. Read on for our full chat below! </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/18/s-8626233-0-1-1760775678782.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Alexander Karpazis, Creative Director of Rainbow Six Siege X.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: 10 years is a great achievement for a live service game, particularly since we’ve seen so many others come and go in that time. What do you put the longevity of Siege down to?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alexander Karpazis [AK]: I think one of the big points is just the sheer depth of the game. Like even within 10 years, I don't think you'll be able to master a game like Siege and as a gamer that's incredibly rewarding. It means that you're on a journey to learn, master and discover new things with a game that's always changing. And I think because of that, it's just grown and resonates with so many people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Has Siege evolved in ways that you could have never predicted at launch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Yeah, absolutely. I mean if you look at 2015 when the game first launched, the Bomb game mode wasn't the number one game mode. It was split between Hostage and Secure Area and Bomb. Back then eSports was something that was very grassroots and new, and now it's become this entire ecosystem where people make their livelihoods off of it, and that's something we could have never anticipated when it first launched. And so in these interesting ways it's built up to be something that is really significant and humbling to be a part of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’ve previously said that Siege X is setting the table for the next 10 years. Do you take it one year at a time? How much of a road map is there for the future? Are there 10 more years worth of ideas in the bank? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: When it comes to ideas, we actually sat down and we interviewed the entire team about their ideas for the game, and came up with over 40 pages of concepts that the team still wants to push for. So there is no end in sight when it comes to what we want to do with the game, and it's a balance of short term and long term. We're looking at the seasons ahead of us but also because of Siege X, we're looking at anticipating new technology, new platforms, stuff that's going to come out and it's going to affect the game. And so how can we anticipate that too over a longer stretch of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Hitting a 10-year milestone, does that increase the pressure on your team for the future, or do you feel like you’ve mastered it now and you know what you’re doing?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: We're always learning and we'll never stop learning. There's so much that goes into building a game like this, and it really comes down to listening to the community. They'll always be vocal in what they want to see and how things change and so yeah, it's not a matter of mastering where we are right now. It's being comfortable and knowing that we still have to listen to our community, we still have to adapt, and we still have to innovate as well. Maybe we're getting a little bit more comfortable in being uncomfortable, and that's how we keep on rolling the next 10 years. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: On the topic of listening to the community, how much of a challenge is it to balance your team’s vision for Siege X with the wants, needs, and complaints of the players?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: It is a challenge, and it isn't. Firstly, because this game's been around for so long I think the DNA is very well understood by players, new and old actually. They know it's a tactical game that has a lot of unique elements like destruction, like asymmetric attacker-defender characteristics. But it does mean that players do want to see change, and more of it more often, and that's where we have to anticipate better, adapt even faster. And in a way, that's sustainable, right? We are humans at the end of the day, the dev team is very human as well, and we want to encourage something that can last another 10 years and not only focus on the short term.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We want to encourage something that can last another 10 years.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What impact will Ubisoft’s creation of the Vantage Studios subsidiary have on you guys? How do you feel about it, and will it have any noticeable impact on the players? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: So when it comes to the player perspective, Vantage Studios is not player-facing so it won't be anything that's noticeable for players in the day-to-day or even long term. And even on the project we're not seeing any major changes, the focus is still on making sure that Siege grows, that it's invested in, and so that's something that we can confirm today. And it means that again, we're still very excited about the future. So it doesn't actually change anything for us right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: When Siege X launched in June, it surged on Steam to around 150,000 concurrent players. Now it appears to be hovering around 40,000. Is that sort of drop-off a concern?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Firstly, the players coming to the game, especially like a record number of new players checking out Siege X? It’s always awesome and it’s exactly what we had hoped for. And then yeah, there's always a bit of a tail afterwards, especially as the team was also kind of recovering from launching something as massive as Siege X. There are ebbs and flows, and a lot of it's expected. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for us, we're really happy with the game. We're happy with where it's going. We have the Munich Majors in November where we'll be sharing even more about where it's going next. And again, excited to see players continue to join Siege and grow from there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is it a similar trend on consoles?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Yeah, it is. PC and consoles share the same player habits that we see all the time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: At this stage, do you feel like switching to free-to-play was the right thing to do, or is it too soon to tell?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: For us, we're seeing the benefits already. We have more new players joining the game than ever before since launch, and that's exactly what we’d hoped for. We're seeing a new generation of Siege players as well, which again is really great even as we try to balance the needs of new players and also veteran players. It is hitting the mark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’ve got so many characters and 10 years’ worth of lore built into the game now. Have you at least entertained the idea of a campaign mode? Rainbow Six Vegas had such an awesome co-op campaign.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: It’s absolutely part of the heritage and yes, it is something that our players ask about. All I can say right now is we're still really focused on the PvP aspect. We have been playing around with storytelling within PvP, and we had an event called Assault on Hereford that players really loved, that did build on what our characters are doing, the tone of the game, and we will continue to explore that realm. But yeah, we have nothing to announce right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What’s your stance on the use of generative AI in games development, do you have plans to use it for Siege?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: If we just talk about AI at its core, it's something we've always been using, like machine-learning, developing new tools not only for anti-cheat but for things like our AI bots, where they're actually trained on our real player data. So these are all incredible tools that make us faster and more efficient. And so it's not a new concept. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, when it comes to generative AI, this is stuff that's still really new and so we haven't incorporated it into our pipeline of Siege. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When it comes to generative AI, this is stuff that's still really new and so we haven't incorporated it into our pipeline of Siege.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What's the fan response been like to the Dual Front mode? I know a lot of players were of the opinion that the District map was a bit too big at launch, are you reevaluating that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Yeah, there was a lot of feedback on the new mode especially when you're comparing it to veterans and new players. We see new players really jumping in more often than veterans, which is great. It's something that we hoped for. But there are still ways to improve it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we will be taking some time to make some bigger changes to the game mode that we’ll be really excited to share for Year 11 - Season One. So at the start of next year. We'll keep on shaking things up and seeing if we can get more good feedback on it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's definitely something that we want to stand apart from core Siege. Core Siege is very much competitive. The main draw is Ranked where it has this kind of competitive progression. Dual Front is still the place where we want to give all of the sandbox ingredients that you have in Siege in a more free form so you can play around with all of it, mixing attackers and defenders, mixing different kinds of strategies to attack and defend too. That's where it really shines. So making sure Dual Front is answering a clearly different need than Core is something that we're focused on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rainbow Six Siege X: Dual Front Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: We’ve seen Star Wars Outlaws come to Nintendo Switch 2, and Assassin’s Creed Shadows is rumoured to be on its way too. Is Rainbow Six Siege 2 likely to be next? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: For us the focus will always be on the platforms we’re on right now, making sure that it's the best experience and when we do new gameplay [that] it makes use of the platforms that we're on. So right now, any new platform isn't necessarily a focus for us. But again, we're a live game, it's 10 years. I learnt a long time ago to never say never, so we'll see as platforms grow and new opportunities come up too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Finally, do you have anything special planned for the 10-year anniversary?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: We’ve spoken a little bit about it and we'll share even more at the Munich Majors, but our plan is absolutely to celebrate this major milestone with our players. We have a big event planned for in-game. We have rewards that we have planned for our players as well. So yeah, we'll absolutely be taking advantage of this big moment and celebrating it with everyone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Looking forward to seeing what you have in store. Thanks for your time.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Thank you so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a senior video editor at IGN's Sydney office.

<p>It's the weekend, so it's time to recap some of the biggest stories from this week before we dive into some good ol' gaming.</p>
<p>First up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> went live, and while we certainly enjoyed our time with it, the game just doesn't quite match up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a>. We've also published our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-legends-z-a-walkthrough">ongoing guide</a> for the game, so if you're finding yourself in a bit of a bind, then definitely check it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/hollow-knight-silksong-receives-another-update-here-are-the-patch-notes">a new update</a>, while Takashi Iizuka explained why <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/takashi-iizuka-explains-why-sonic-racing-crossworlds-was-delayed-on-switch-2">delayed on the Switch 2</a>.

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm playing with lots of balls this weekend. That is to say, I'll be booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a>.</p>
<p>Both games are relentlessly addictive, and I'm hesitant to say which I prefer, but I'd probably lean a little closer to Xenotilt at the moment. It's just <em>so</em> damn good. My review will be live at some point today (Saturday), so be sure to check that out if you'd like to find out more.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Oh no, much to my surprise, I am having a good time playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt this with a new mainline entry, so I’m going to ride the wave for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Will I be tired of it by Monday? Maybe, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take for as long as I get to see my beloved Totodile waddle around next to me.</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly - Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I’m really hoping to spend a lot more personal gaming time than usual on the Switch 2 as I’ve gone mad and bought a bunch of new games for it. My haul includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, both of which I’ve yet to start, but am very, very excited about!</p>
<p>I’ve also added BALL x PIT to the mix, and Ollie has gone and got me well up for trying some Xenotilt, so that’s most likely gonna get snapped up too, before I forget about it due to just how many games are starting to pile in now. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> should be getting a shot too, but what hope do I have keeping up with all this lot? We’re gonna need more hours added to days soon.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm helping to judge a games award this month, which means playing lots of games that came out this year (and some that aren't out yet!) I can't talk about most of them, but it did give me a chance to finally play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>, and I had actually forgotten how clever the first game was.</p>
<p>The puzzles are really well-designed, with very thoughtful logic, and there are tons of neat features in Antiquities that make it even easier and more pleasurable to play. I had no idea what I was doing for the first few minutes (there isn't much of a tutorial, and I think it suffers for it) but exploring the small shop ends up being its own reward, anyway. It's really good!</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm basically only playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A right now, all for you lovely lot. I wish I enjoyed it as much as others seem to, but alas, I might just have to accept that Pokémon isn't for me anymore. Keep an eye out for some more helpful tips from yours truly, of course.</p>
<p>I have my eyes on Ball X Pit and Absolum, though — as soon as I have the time... Have a good weekend!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Since I haven’t really been a part of the Pocket Monster madness from the beginning, I will be entertained in a galaxy far, far away. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> is still delivering a ton of fun when searching off the main road. Super happy to finally have Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action on Switch because I can’t rotate my giant TV to play this in tate mode so portable mode it is (make sure you check the previous game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon’s Tilt</a> if you missed it). Still dabbing at Hades II and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gearbits">Gearbits</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 36 of 50 games played. More amazing stuff from this endless package, with the arena rogue light run’n’gun Overbold, the sequel to Campanella and the belt action Fist Hell being particular highlights.</p>
<p>Game of the week is BALL x PIT. I was already sold on the entire thing thanks to a recent STEAM fest demo but now, both on TV and on the go this is one seriously addictive game! Yee be warned!</p>
<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>I recently picked up Xenotilt, the endlessly replayable new pinball game with sharp cyberpunk aesthetics from the makers of the acclaimed Demon's Tilt. And it's a feast for the senses, to say the least. It's approachable, integrating fresh ideas like activating gun turrets and bullet hell mechanics with your ball, but deceptively technical—especially if you want to see all the table has to offer. I'll be playing a lot of that this weekend.</p>
<p>Likewise, I've just grabbed BALL x PIT, published by Devolver Digital. I haven't jumped in yet, but I've been extremely intrigued by this title ever since I saw the trailer for it. It's been described as a mix of Vampire Survivors and Breakout, with influences from other puzzle games and roguelikes, and I'm just a hundred percent on board with this. It really looks like nothing else, and the reviews have been very encouraging—so I wouldn't object to getting totally sucked in.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d3138bcbb383c"><a title="nes40" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3138bcbb383c/nes40.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 8BitDo</em></figcaption></figure><p>8BitDo has announced a brand new 'NES40 Collection' of products which incorporates an Ultimate 2 Bluetooth controller, 68-key Retro Keyboard, and a rather fetching Retro Cube 2 speaker.</p>
<p>The new range, which is now available to <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/nes-40th-anniversary">pre-order over at 8BitDo's official website</a> later today certainly looks stunning, and it manages to add a few nice little touches to a line-up that stick to the look and feel of previous "Retro" offerings from the company.</p>
<p>The keyboard (which this writer is 100% getting) is Windows and Android compatible and due to release in early 2026. It's certainly an enthusiast-level sort of deal, taking the excellent retro design from their past offerings and adding a very snazzy aluminium alloy shell, along with some lovely detailing and a fancy pouch.</p>
<p>It also comes with those super cool turbo buttons that we've been loving since we picked up our first <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-mario-teaches-typing">8Bitdo Retro Keyboard</a>.</p>

<p>The Switch 1 and 2 compatible NES40-themed Ultimate 2 controller, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">follows the company's Pro 3 Bluetooth controller</a> in including TMR joysticks and Hall effect sticks, releases on <strong>15th November 2025</strong>, and is also looking mighty slick as you can see below.</p>
<p>Set to retail at <strong>$79.99</strong>, it also comes with a bunch of changeable thumbstick pads, a keychain and a few other bits and bobs. Yeah...looking at these pics, we're probably gonna need one of these, too.</p>

<p>The final part of the collection is the Retro Cube 2, a dinky little portable speaker that's an upgraded version of its predecessor, and connects via bluetooth, 2.4G and USB. T</p>
<p>he speaker uses a D-pad design for its controls, which is rather cool, and has its very own charging dock to boot. This comes in at <strong>$49.99</strong>, and will release on 1<strong>2th December 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>The 8BitDo Collection is available to pre-order a little later today, and you can hit up the official site to go grab yours if they've tickled your fancy.</p>

<p>For some trainers, one of the most difficult decisions in a new Pokémon game is your starter Pokémon pick.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, the same traditions apply, where you pick from one of three Pokémon. This time you have a choice of Chikorita (the Grass-type), Totodile (the Water-type), and Tepig (the Fire-type Pokémon).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After arriving in Lumiose, certain events will lead you to befriending a Pokémon that will become your adventuring partner, thus beginning your journey as a Pokémon Trainer. Which Pokémon will you set off on your adventure with: Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile?"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59rlsiph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Now that the new game is available on the Switch and Switch 2, we're curious to know who you decided to add to your party in the end. Did you end up going with the same Pokémon you planned to <em>before</em> the game released, or did you go with someone else at the last minute?</p>
<p>So, vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>And just one other thing...<strong>spoiler alert</strong>...you can eventually get all three of these starter Pokémon in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but the catch is you'll have to wait until the end of the game. We'll be sharing more about this in our guide, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-18">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 18)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #860:</p>



<ul>
<li>HAND</li>



<li>HOCK</li>



<li>PEDAL</li>



<li>SKATE</li>



<li>BACON</li>



<li>CELL</li>



<li>PICKLE</li>



<li>CAGE</li>



<li>DODGE</li>



<li>COAST</li>



<li>FORD</li>



<li>BREEZE</li>



<li>CRUISE</li>



<li>RACQUET</li>



<li>FLOAT</li>



<li>TRAYED</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Think effortless motion across surfaces — air, water, ice, or pavement.</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Each word sets the stage for a different sport or quirky pastime</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – These names rack up IMDb credits like it’s a competition.</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Each word echoes a term for ‘to sell,’ but plays a phonetic trick.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 18.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-18-860">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 18 (#860)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BREEZE, COAST, FLOAT, SKATE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DODGE, HAND, PICKLE, RACQUET</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BACON, CAGE, CRUISE, FORD</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CELL, HOCK, PEDAL, TRAYED</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Now, a few more games have apparently been fixed and are now working on Nintendo's new hybrid system. This includes the RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic_ii_the_sith_lords">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a> and the third-person team-based shooter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plants_vs_zombies_battle_for_neighborville_complete_edition">Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville</a> (via Nintendo Everything).</p>

<p>Once again, this follows a recent batch of fixes that resolved issues with games such as the free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-just-became-steam%E2%80%99s-most-popular-extraction-shooter-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-even-close.1328404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders players are enjoying the ‘server slam test’ as we speak, pouring into the game to explore everything it has to offer two weeks before it officially hits the market. It’s the last opportunity to play the game for free before it launches on October 30, and it has been met with a seriously positive reception.</p>



<p>The hype driving ARC Raiders has proven to be such a success that the game has almost hit a peak player count of 200,000 concurrent users on <strong>Steam alone</strong>. That’s a phenomenal number that makes ARC Raiders the most popular extraction shooter on the platform.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders has been pieced together by Embark Studios, of The Finals fame. It’s a third-person extraction shooter that throws players into a world devastated by a robot uprising of sorts, putting them into the shoes of scavengers desperately trying to make a buck and resolve quests while avoiding death in the field.</p>



<p>The earliest beta tests of ARC Raiders were rampant successes, and Embark Studios has rolled out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a server slam</a> to test the game’s infrastructure before launch and the results have been <strong>dramatically </strong>positive.</p>



<p>On Steam, the game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2427520/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit an all-time peak</a> of 189,668 users as the server slam unravelled, effortlessly topping <strong>every other extraction shooter ever released on Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, here are some top numbers:</p>



<ul>
<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite – 66,007</li>



<li>The Cycle: Frontier – 40,854</li>



<li>Gray Zone Warfare – 72,548</li>



<li>Dark and Darker – 57,164</li>



<li>Escape from Duckov – 61,066</li>
</ul>



<p>Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most popular extraction shooter in the world, is set to be released on Steam on November 15, so it’ll be interesting to see if it can top ARC Raiders. We know that more than 500,000 people have Escape from Tarkov on their wishlist, but that only puts the game in 67th place on Steam’s wishlist activity tracker.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is in fourth place.</p>



<p>Do you think we’ll see ARC Raiders secure the top spot in the extraction genre? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Words of wisdom from Nintendo's legendary CEO</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="1fc9f76f433f4"><a title="Ask Iwata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fc9f76f433f4/ask-iwata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you never got around to reading Ask Iwata or just want an excuse to revisit it, VIZ Media has announced it's releasing an English paperback version in Summer 2026.</p>
<p>This book, edited by Hobonichi, compiles the former Nintendo president and CEO's famous interviews into a "motivational collection". Iwata touches on a range of diverse subjects, such as how success breeds resistance to change and why programmers should never say no.</p>

<p>Below is a sample of Nintendo Life's book review when the hardcover English version of Ask Iwata was released in 2021. When we find out more details about the paperback release, we'll let you know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a book that should be read by all — not just Nintendo fans, or video game fans — simply because Iwata espoused an attitude and outlook on the world that put happiness above all else, even when it was an aspiration in tough times. He wouldn't always succeed, as no-one does, but he'd keep trying. In a world that can often be cynical, his outlook is a welcome and hopeful beacon."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

What I didn't expect was to see so many Trainer Gallery cards drop in value, but I think this is more of a market correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was only at the beginning of the year that Gengar and Pikachu were in the pocket money binder at your local TCG and collectables stores, but those days are still a distant memory. </p><p id="crashers-and-climbers-lost-origin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers and Climbers: Lost Origin">Crashers and Climbers: Lost Origin</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Pokémon Mania 2025 still going crazy, everyone is trying to grab new release sealed product at retail, which means it's a great time to snag some overlooked cards from older sets before they climb up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, I got most of the cards in today's crasher section for around $5 each 12 months ago, so although they're currently lowering in price, they're still a great buy. Let's get straight into it.</p><p id="pokmon-card-crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Card Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/feature-image-42-1760714767311.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5XwrY?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gengar TG06/TG30</a> is a bit of a risk to play in-game, Netherworld Gate can bring it back from the dead without the need to evolve it, but you also get three damage counters. Screaming Circle can work out well then opponents have a full bench for one Psychic energy, but it's still a risk that might not be worth taking. The artwork itself is fantastic, and it's one of my favorite Gengar cards just for the bold colour and Gengar being fascinated by a washing line. This card has had a brutal crash from $56 to $38, but I see this as more of a correction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjR8K?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pikachu TG05/TG30</a> has the exact same charm, seeing it having a nap with the female trainer from Legends: Arceus. It's such a sweet image and can see why this card is worth over $26. It's come down from over $30, but I'm sure this will grow far past this point in the next 12 months. It's really not worth including in your deck, but it's a cracking pick for a trainers binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gold and black cards never really did much for me personally, so I can see why the value of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp47J4?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mew VMAX TG30/TG30</a> has dipped from $26.04 to $21.42. But that's besides the point, it's still Mew and there's plenty of people who need every Mew they can find in their collection, so this still isn't bad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7pNv?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard TG03/TG30</a> is another card im suprised to be calling a crasher this week. It's Charizard cuddling up with Champion Leon, which is a recipe for a banger card. We're seeing a lot of Trainer Gallery cards go through a bit of a correction right now, but a 25% drop from $23.95 to $17.98 is a bit rough. I'd reccomend picking one up before it ticks back up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/921x05?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pikachu VMAX TG29/TG30</a> is matching that Mew energy. I pulled this from a booster earlier this year, and it's a bit of an underwhelming card despite the rarity. It's not dropped by much, only 9%, and it will probably climb in the next year or two, but black gold cards could have been so much cooler.</p><p id="pokmon-card-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Card Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/feature-image-43-1760714810779.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6D2mZ?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giratina V 186/196</a> has gone through the roof and into the stratosphere over the last month. In September these we're going for $570, but it's now over $720, and I'm here for it. I'm yet to get my hands on one, but what an incredible work of art this card is. It illustrates the Distortion world perfectly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's nice to see Aerodactyl card climbing up in value, especially it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8Jyk?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">V Alt Art (180/196)</a>. It's a gorgeous scene of it slying over a tropical area, with a shedload of detail and some lovely use of color. It's easy to see why this card has been bumped from $129 to just over $180 in the space of a month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red and Pikachu, this is peak Pokémon generation one nostalgia at its finest. Showcasing Red checking out a map and Pikachu looking ready for a new adventure, there's no reality where <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMWGl?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pikachu V TG16/TG30</a> twouldn't double in value in a month. At $99.07 right now, trainers would be wise to add this to their collection sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/911jeq?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pikachu VMAX TG17/TG30</a> takes this nosgalia and kicks it up a gear into the Sword and Shield era of Pokémon with Pikachu Gigantamax form. The posture of Red ready for another challenge with chonky Pikachu just happy to be standing upright is a cracking scene. This card used to be $10-20 higher than Pikachu V, but is settling in the same ballpark at $96.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rotom is a cool Pokémon and no one will tell me any different. I'd have one in my phone making it fly around every day of the week, and i'd love to have <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4714?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rotom V 177/196</a> in my collection one day. It's cheap and cheerful at $26, but it's climbed up from $22 in a month, so I'd call that a low risk investment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

                <p>Prime Big Deal Days ended on October 8, but folks looking to upgrade their PC setup can still check out a few great Logitech deals available at Amazon right now.

Its PTFE feet also help it glide across most surfaces, and you shouldn't have to worry about any input lag thanks to Logitech's Lightspeed technology--which uses a USB receiver for rapid responses.</p><p>The wireless gaming mouse is compatible with both PC and Mac, though the deal is only available for the black model.

Both products are wired, and if you're playing an MMO or other game that could benefit from dozens of inputs, the G502 Hero Gaming Mouse and its 11 programmable buttons could be a good fit. It's also equipped with the Hero 25K Sensor like the G Pro X Superlight above, though its design is decidedly more aggressive and "gamer." As a bonus, its weight can be adjusted using five 3.6 gram weights.</p><p>The G413 SE Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a full keyboard with F Keys and a numpad, so it's a nice fit for both gaming and working. Its aluminum top case should make it durable enough to hold up nicely over the years (or during rage-inducing key smashings), and its tactile mechanical switches are built to be highly responsive. It also benefits from 6-key rollover, LED lighting, and PBT keycaps.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Alongside these two Logitech deals, a bunch of Asus products are also discounted at Amazon right now. This includes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCZQTF74?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Wireless Mouse</a> for $70.49 (was $150) and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Three-Layer-Hot-Swappable-PBT/dp/B0CLF3WYGC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Azoth Wireless Mechanical 75% Keyboard</a> for $155 (was $275). The former is even lighter than the Logitech G Pro X Superlight at just 54 grams, while the latter is a 75% board with a unique OLED display that can show your system info, an audio visualizer, or simple animations. It's a stylish model equipped with swappable ROG NX mechanical switches, tons of RGB lights, and support for Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connections.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3CX3QMD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Keris II Ace Wireless Gaming Mouse</a> is on sale for $100 (was $180), and with a 107-hour battery life, micro switches rated for 100 million clicks, and the reliable ROG AimPoint Pro 42K Optical Sensor, it's worth a closer look if you don't mind upping your budget. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Falchion-Hall-Effect-Gaming-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0DG7H487F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Falchion Ace HFX 65% Keyboard</a> is discounted, too, which could be a better choice if you're working with a small desktop or need to save space for sweeping mouse movements.

<section><p>Game Pass was the best deal in gaming. Now it's a deal in gaming, for some people.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Microsoft recently announced that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is climbing from the sweaty price of $20 US per month <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">to an eye-watering $30</a>. The "real" gamers around the internet already have a joke for it: "Xbox 360 dollars per year."</p><p dir="ltr">But while the jokes write themselves, determining if Game Pass is still of value to me at this new price has taken far more energy. Yes, the company has also added new incentives and moved some features around, but do these additions create value, or just even more confusion? Let's break things down a bit.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes access to all Microsoft-published games--as well as many other titles--on their respective release days. It also includes a subscription to EA Play, Ubisoft Classics, and will soon include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Crew. With Ubisoft Classics coming in at $80 per year, EA Play at $40 per year, and Fortnite Crew at $144 per year, the total value of these subscriptions is $264, which definitely helps sweeten spending $360 a year on Game Pass--if you actually use them.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's talk about the subscriptions that come with Ultimate and what they mean. First, there's Ubisoft Classics. If you look at the Ubisoft Classics website, the standard subscription tier costs $7.99 per month, but only offers PC play. Ubisoft Classics' Premium tier, however, features both PC and Xbox play for a total of $17.99 per month. Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow ">claims that its version of Ubisoft Classics adds $7.99 per month</a> of value <em>per</em> platform, meaning those playing on both PC and Xbox receive the greatest benefit. With the Game Pass version of Ubisoft Classics, you get access to a rotating menu of games in their standard editions rather than the 100-plus games--often in their Premium editions--that are promised in Ubisoft Premium. You're getting access on PC and Xbox, yes, but to a smaller library of games, in Standard editions instead of Premium. Microsoft wants you to think of this as a $15.98 value each month, but with all these caveats, it's hard to take the quoted "$7.99 a month per platform" value seriously.</p><p dir="ltr">EA Play, meanwhile, is more straightforward. Through EA, the subscription costs $5.99 per month and offers 10-hour trials on new games and "unlimited access to a collection of top EA titles," and it seems as though that's what Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is offering as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, in their standalone versions, both of these programs offer discounts on Ubisoft and EA games respectively; there's no word on whether those discounts would apply to Game Pass subscribers. We're guessing they won't, though, because as part of the price increase, Xbox also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-perks-discounts-ended/" rel="nofollow ">eliminated the game and DLC discounts</a> that previously were included as part of the service.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Crew is a bit more complex. If you stay subscribed to Fortnite Crew all year long, you gain access to all battle passes all year, and receive 1,000 V-Bucks per month (12,000 total in a year) and 12 sets of unique Fortnite Crew outfits. But while this might sound like a good deal, even if you play a lot of Fortnite, it still isn't worth the value. That's because not all the rewards you get for being a Crew member are created equal--Fortnite battle passes and Crew rewards are full of throwaway items you probably won't care about to fill out their offerings. These rewards mostly aren't the cool genre-bending collaborations like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">Scooby-Doo</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-morphin-time-in-fortnites-incredible-live-action-power-rangers-teaser/1100-6533692/" data-ref-id="1100-6533692">Power Rangers</a>, they're generic, non-copyright-infringing characters and songs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4587176" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4587176"></a><figcaption>A promotional image from Fortnite's Scooby-Doo-filled Fortnitemares event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'd have to love the Crew outfits, use the Jam Tracks, and play LEGO Fortnite modes--along with completing the Battle Passes--to really get your money's worth. The short version is that Fortnite Crew is $144 for about $100 worth of V-Bucks, some skins you probably won't use, some LEGO pieces you probably won't use, and Jam Tracks that you may or may not even care about.</p><p dir="ltr">Regular Fortnite players (myself included) will often buy a Crew Pass to complete a season's Battle Pass and earn the corresponding bonus V-Bucks. But as an ongoing subscription, you have to be <em>extremely</em> invested in Fortnite to justify Crew on its own merits.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, when speaking purely in terms of Microsoft-published games, Game Pass admittedly makes a pretty strong case for itself. This year alone has brought us <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gears-of-war-reloaded-all-cog-tag-locations/2900-6885/" data-ref-id="2900-6885">Gears of War Reloaded</a>, and I'd be remiss not to mention that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-681590">Keeper</a> are all just around the corner. This also doesn't include the various third-party games that come to Xbox Game Pass on Day One--games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. But again, the exact "value" here is subjective--you'd have to play a lot of those games for the math to actually add up.</p><p dir="ltr">Coincidentally, a study published by Circana shortly after the Game Pass price hike found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/majority-of-us-gamers-buy-a-max-of-two-games-annually-analysts-say/1100-6535300/">most US game players purchase two or fewer new games a year</a>. Sure, there is a lot of nuance to this statistic, but at the same time, when the majority of gamers report they spend around $140 a year on new games, does the average player truly find value in spending $360 a year just to temporarily gain access to a handful of them?</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that we can't rely on Microsoft to release that many games next year or the year after. It might happen, but again, we're talking about <em>potential </em>value.</p><p dir="ltr">To get the greatest value out of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'd almost have to use it to the exclusion of other gaming services, and that's not how the majority of gamers are using the service. Personally, I tend to like Microsoft-published games; by the end of the year I'll have played five of the above Microsoft-published games, along with a bunch of other third-party Game Pass games. I also play Fortnite <em>a lot</em> and tend to play games on my Xbox rather than my PlayStation. I'm one of the rare cases that can <em>maybe</em> justify that "Xbox $360" price tag. But even then, I hesitate.</p><p dir="ltr">In earlier days, Game Pass felt like a steal: You only had to play one or two games to justify the cost. Everything else was just gravy. With this price increase, though, the math becomes far more complex--to the point that it feels like you're talking yourself into giving your wallet to a guy who says he'll definitely bring it back and not to worry. And if that doesn't get you, the changes and transient nature of the service will.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Pass <em>was</em> the best deal in console gaming. Now, it's <em>a</em> deal in console gaming--but only under very specific circumstances.</p>

<p>Football Manager 26’s Open Beta date, launching ahead of its November 4th release, has been revealed.</p>



<p>The upcoming football management simulator, published by SEGA, has been highly anticipated by fans. Releasing on November 4th, the sports series plans to up the game with more realistic features and graphics. Even more so, FIFA announced a partnership for the title today for the upcoming World Cup. Fortunately, even with the November date nearby, the Open Beta is going to be even sooner, according to an article from our sister site, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-is-lauching-football-gaming-zone-a-new-football-focused-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a>.</p>

<p>In an exclusive from <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/exclusive-football-manager-26-open-beta-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Football Gaming Zone</a>, it’s stated that behind-the-scenes access to an alpha form of Football Manager 26 is out in the open. While access is reportedly only for professional footballers, the site learned that the code distribution email includes the release date of the Open Beta: October 24th. The information does work with a tease from developer Sports Interactive, who <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1978853555210457306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hinted at news</a> next week. While nothing is official until it’s fully revealed, it does seemly highly likely it’s set for then.</p>



<p>Dropping the Open Beta two weeks prior to the game’s release is a bit ballsy. However, the team has shown a ton of confidence in the product. A move to Unity Engine, as opposed to an in-house engine, has provided a lot more opportunities for the game to shine. Whether or not it will live up to fans expectations is unknown, but we won’t have to wait long to find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the latest Aftermath Hours, Luke and Gita are joined by Matt Leone, formerly of Polygon. This week, Leone launched <a href="https://www.designroom.site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Design Room</a>, a new site to house his oral histories of video games, starting off with <a href="https://www.designroom.site/shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a>.</p><p>We also talk about the adorable city builder <a href="https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Town to City</em></a>, because Luke and Gita simply cannot help themselves. Gita makes a brief tangent into the world of Digital Audio Players, much to Chris Person’s delight.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review and we’ll include it in our oral history of this podcast episode.</p><p><strong>Gita Jackson:</strong> I love this sort of <em>Rashomon</em> thing you get when you're asking multiple sources about a specific incident. We just talked about the last issue of<em> 52</em> on my podcast with Alex Jaffe, 52 Pickup, which is about this comic book that was, at the time, written by four of the top talents from DC. And we've spoken to Jeff Johns, Mark Wade and Greg Rucka. The only one we haven’t been able to talk to is Grant Morrison, which, who knows what the fuck they're doing. But we asked them all, what was the genesis of this? How did you get involved in this comic? And they all had a different, like, completely different answer.</p><p><strong>Matt Leone:</strong> Yeah, I think that's what makes it interesting. I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game. There's just how people remember it in most cases, because there's not always that much documentation of this stuff. Sometimes people want to put a spin on it to make themselves look good and have the story be more about them. And sometimes it's just that their memory is not that great, because you're talking about older things. So you may hear one version of a story and then take it back to somebody, and they may say “oh, I hadn't thought about that in a while.”&nbsp;</p><p>The best example I have there is, so I did a bunch of <em>Street Fighter 2</em> stuff. The origin story of <em>Street Fighter 2</em> is told quite differently by different people. Like, all the key people who worked on it kind of each should have their own version of that story, and they're not, like, dramatically different. And I feel like if you got them all in a room, they would probably defer to some of the other people's versions of it. But yeah, it's interesting, just like hearing each person tell it and like, again, it could be that they want it to be viewed a certain way, or it could be that they just don't remember it exactly the same way. It could also mean that, like, you know, it didn't actually happen the same way for every person, especially when you're talking about the older days with international departments. The communication was not always that good, so the people in the US office didn't always know what was going on in the Japanese office. And you look at old game magazines and all the errors you see in those and like, a lot of that is just because the US branches of these companies didn't actually know what was actually happening at the time. They were passing it on the best they could, but they didn't necessarily have what they needed to have.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I mean, even now, one of our contributors, Isaiah, writes a lot about anime, and they talk to animators that are in Japan. And even now, it's very, very difficult to get questions over to a Japanese artist, get them back in a timely manner, and then also get anything really useful at all from those answers, knowing you probably won't have a chance to ask follow ups. I see Luke nodding knowingly.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett:</strong> Interviewing Japanese developers is notorious for, like, you can get half an hour with them in person, but everything goes through a translator at both ends, and then the answer that comes back is so canned that you want to challenge it, but also you're running out of time. Then that challenge is to go back through the translators again, and it's a huge challenge for games media because there's time pressure. You know, it's an upcoming game, or it's a popular anime, and you sort of want to get your story published in the next day or week or whatever. Is that something you have to worry about, Matt or it's like, you've got not unlimited time? We're all gonna die at some point, but you've got a really long time frame for a lot of this stuff. Is that as big of a concern for you? Or you can just ride it out and just wait very patiently?</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> It depends. I've done a lot of stuff with Japanese companies, and there's a different kind of politics behind it too. Like some companies only want one spokesperson to speak, and they don't want other people lower on the chain to kind of talk about things even years later. There was an interview I did once where someone was like, I could talk to you, but you can't quote me to my name. You have to say this stuff came from this other person, just because he was the one who was approved to speak for that game. And I wouldn't do that, but that's just, like, what they asked for. You get requests from Japanese companies to check over your transcripts, and that stuff is just commonplace over there.&nbsp;</p><p>I think time is something that maybe I don't have to worry about quite as much on these because I'm not necessarily getting those 30 minute windows as much because I'm doing stuff on older games where people usually have a little more time to talk. So most interviews will do longer than that and have a little more time to breathe. But there's a time element of it, and there's a cost element to it. If you're hiring interpreters, or, you know, I re-translate stuff a lot to make sure we're getting quotes right. All that costs money. The difference between doing a story where you interview 10 people who speak Japanese on a game and a story where you interview 10 people who speak English on a game [is], like, thousands of dollars’ difference.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Speaking of Japanese developers, at time of recording, we've only just learned that Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at the relatively young age of 58. He's obviously an incredibly prominent figure in Japanese game development, especially for people of a certain age who have played the games he's most famous for. You obviously approach your pieces from a journalism standpoint. You're telling a story. But at the same time, we're starting to lose some of these voices and some of these people who were instrumental in shaping video games as we know them today. Is approaching your pieces as a piece of journalism and approaching them as a piece of history… are they one and the same? Or do you only focus on the journalism, and the history is just inconsequential? Or is that something that may have changed because you've been doing this for a long time as well? We start losing access to some of these stories, and so getting them told and written down is actually not just important for my website's metrics for this month, but is an important record for anyone who wants to study and learn about video games in the years and decades to come.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> It's funny because like, the <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> story I just did… I covered that game back when I worked at 1Up and I'm now doing retrospectives on games that I was around for when they first came around. This came up the other day, too: I was talking to somebody, and they were like, you know, this is preservation. And it is, because I'm talking to a lot of people and getting different accounts, and we're putting them out there in a place that we can keep out for a long time. I don't go into it thinking we're gonna lose this stuff if I don't save it. I think there's a lot of push from people to do that, and that's great in terms of saving, whether it's ROMs or interviews or whatever else like this. The idea of saving everything is really valuable, and I think that is something I am very supportive of. But that's not really something that I am conscious that I'm doing. I'm typically going into these like, okay, what is an interesting story? You know, what stories would benefit from having different people talk about them and stuff like that. You can't really separate it. It is both, whether I intend it to be or not.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope"><h3>I Will Go Down Swinging Against Windows 11</h3></a><p>The end of support for Windows 10 is a mess</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours]]></content:encoded>
