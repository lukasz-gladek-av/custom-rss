            <p>The Gearbox developers working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk Of Rain 2</a> have released a patch for its poorly received expansion, Seekers Of The Storm. The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-2-creators-still-believe-that-gearbox-is-heading-in-the-right-direction-despite-troubles-with-recent-dlc">thoroughly upset some fans</a>. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This DLC fell short of your expectations," said the developers in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/4608959311771420255">a Steam update post accompanying the patch notes</a>. "That feedback is fair. We’d like to take a moment and walk everyone through our plan to make it right."</p>
<p>A lot of the issues seem to have stemmed from a bug that "occasionally led to behaviors being erroneously tied to FPS." You can see why this might bother players on a slower PC. For example, one weapon, <a href="https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crowdfunder">the Crowdfunder</a>, would stop firing if the player's frame rate dipped below 30 frames per second. (This sounds similar to a bug reported in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> following its Lightfall expansion, by which any damage the player took from enemies was <a href="https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-enemy-damage-fps-link/">seemingly tied to the player's frame rate</a>). It's a substantial error. But considering the sheer amount of overlapping and ultra-stacking relics and effects in Risk Of Rain 2, I'm not surprised the code is easy to break. </p>
<p>That particular frame rate bug is now fixed, claim the developers, alongside a long list of other issues, like the cheekily invulnerable final boss, and another bug that prevented players from picking up items (somewhat important in a fast-paced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>). </p>
<p>"First, to be clear, we're committed to making the DLC everything that you expected and deserve," the developer continues. "This is a game that countless people love; anything that jeopardizes that experience is something we take very seriously. We hope that in the coming days and weeks, we can earn back your trust, and we know that’s going to take time and action."</p>
<p>The poorly optimised DLC garnered some annoyance but also some sympathy, in particular from Risk Of Rain's original creators at Hopoo Games (they sold the rights to Gearbox in 2022). "Definitely a hard situation for everyone involved," said the roguelike's co-creator Duncan Drummond last week. Since then, Drummond and his co-founder Paul Morse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-creators-wind-down-work-on-unannounced-project-and-take-jobs-at-valve">shuttered their studio so they could take jobs at Valve</a> along with other workers at Hopoo. In other words, it's been a dramatic couple of weeks for Risk Of Rain 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cosmetic-skins-spectre-divide/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spectre-divide-reduces-cosmetic-skin-price-from-90-to-70-after-backlash.973803/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cosmetic-skins-spectre-divide/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Spectre Divide, a new free-to-play 3v3 competitive shooter, has reduced its cosmetic skin prices by 17-25% following criticism that they are too high.</p>



<p>Mountaintop Studios, the development team behind Spectre Divide, announced its plans on Discord yesterday. The announcement read, “First and foremost—my personal apologies for the situation. We’ve heard the feedback on pricing, and we’re going to make some big adjustments.” Those “big adjustments” include a 17-25% reduction in the prices of weapons and characters across the board.</p>



<p>However, Mountaintop Studios has still faced criticism for the move as its skin prices are still way too high. One bundle, named the ‘Cryo Kinesis Masterpiece bundle’ will set players back 7000 Spectre Points, equivalent to $70.</p>



<p>For that price, for which you can buy a fully-fledged AAA title, you’ll get four very basic weapon camos and an axe melee weapon (which is still just a cosmetic overhaul to a knife).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even more concerning to players is that the bundle already had a 25% discount before the recent change, which would have set players back nearly $120. </p>



<p>Following the recent change, the game’s next bundle, named the “Medusa Bundle,” is cheaper but will still set you back 3400 Spectre Points, equivalent to $34. </p>



<p>Spectre Divide is out now for PC, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spectre-divide-console-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console versions of the game</a> expected to be released in the future.</p>



<p>What do you think of Spectre Divides’ overly priced cosmetic skins? Let us know in the comment below!</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s price is increasing from £10.99 to a very precise £16.75 ($20/€19.50) later today, 6th September.</p>
<p>The team says it feels "like this is a fair increase based on the amount of content and playtime added to the game since Early Access started almost four years ago".</p>

<p>"Thank you to all the dedicated Ghost Hunters worldwide for your ongoing support. We’re excited to welcome new recruits when Phasmophobia is released on PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X|S later this year."</p>
<p>Phasmophobia has indeed changed significantly since it first launched in early access four years ago.</p>
<p>Not only are there extra ghosts, maps, and difficulties, but substantial changes have also been made to your ghost-hunting tech, ghost behaviours, and challenges.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Developer Kinetic gave players "two-three" hours notice of the changes a couple of hours ago, so if you've yet to bite but are keen to lock it in at the early access price, you'd better move like a Jinn and grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all ghosthunters are happy with the price increase, which works out to be a 41 percent hike here in the UK.</p>
<p>"Here's an idea, maybe hold off on price gouging future hunters (console players) until you include one of the main features, voice recognition, that makes the game more immersive, and unique. It's only fair to hold off until you can release a full game, not just a half-assed one," <a href="https://x.com/JessicaMosley86/status/1831970577554518311">said</a> one.</p>
<p>"It's a disgrace they are upping the price without adding the voice recognition for consoles," added <a href="https://x.com/skippy1090/status/1831974746357199032">another</a>. "After the bs them saying it would be released a while back. No communication what so ever. I own it on PC but want it for console too."</p>
<p>There's currently still no word on when the ghost-hunting adventure will be released on console, but Kinetic says it's still due "later this year".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-3-quests-list">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 3 Quests List</h2>



<p>The game releases new weekly quests every Tuesday, each granting 20,000 XP to players. Fortnite’s Week 3 quests for the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Absolute Doom</a> season are as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-fortnite-week-3-quests">How to Complete Fortnite Week 3 Quests?</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-with-the-monarch-pistol">Damage opponents with the Monarch Pistol</h3>



<p>The first quest is simple, but acquiring the Monarch Pistol can take time. Players can find this weapon in common and rare chests across the island. If you are confident, you can defeat Doombot to get a hold of his legendary Monarch Pistol. Once you have the weapon, inflict 300 damage on any enemy player or NPC to complete the quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-collect-ammo-while-you-have-a-specialist-hired">Collect ammo while you have a specialist hired.</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 3 quest could be the easiest one of the season. All you need to do is head to Redline Rig or Grand Glacier and hire a specialist. Then, keep opening ammo boxes and chests in the area until the quest is completed. You only need 50 bullets to complete this quest.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-collect-weapons-from-eliminated-opponents">Collect weapons from eliminated opponents</h3>



<p>Now, this Fortnite Week 3 quest requires some skill from the players. You have to collect 15 weapons from eliminated opponents. However, you can complete this quest across multiple matches. To complete this quest, you can either approach aggressively and confront players at hotspots or play the long game and eliminate opponents as the match progresses.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-travel-distance-in-a-vehicle-while-boosting">Travel distance in a vehicle while boosting</h3>



<p>To complete this Fortnite Week 3 quest, get in a car and keep spamming the boost until you have covered 500 meters.&nbsp;Luckily, vehicles are spread across the island, so it shouldn’t take players too long to complete this.</p>



<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-2-quests-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 2 Quests Guide</a></strong></p>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-within-10-seconds-of-sprinting">Damage opponents within 10 seconds of sprinting</h3>



<p>The last quest for Fortnite Week 3 is challenging because it is time-consuming. Firstly, you must remember to sprint just before shooting at any enemy on the island. Also, you have to inflict 3,000 points of damage, which is challenging. Consider taking on Doombot or Emma Frost while completing this quest to get it done quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s all the quests for Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4, Week 3. In the comments, let us know which ones you will complete first.&nbsp;</p>

Microsoft has a long list of first-party studios currently working on various games due out across the next few years, but the mention of Activision, Blizzard, and Bethesda perhaps narrows down the list. Activision is set to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> in October, so perhaps the shooter will make an appearance. Blizzard, fresh from releasing World of Warcraft expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within">The War Within</a>, has Diablo 4 expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a> out in October, as well as ongoing updates for mobile game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>.

Microsoft recently announced that MiHoYo’s megahit <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-is-coming-to-xbox-gamescom-2024">Genshin Impact is finally coming to Xbox</a>, so maybe that game will make a big splash, too.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Microsoft closed its Japan developer Tango Gameworks</a>, with the studio having released Hi-Fi Rush to critical acclaim, as part of significant cuts that resulted in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">1,900 layoffs</a> across its gaming business. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/around-50-of-100-tango-gameworks-staff-moving-over-to-krafton">PUBG publisher Krafton later picked up roughly 50 of the 100 staff members employed at Tango</a>.</p><p>Microsoft is also heavily rumored to be working on an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024">Xbox handheld</a>, and has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">confirmed plans for next-generation consoles</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Remedy is set to update its original version of Alan Wake on PC, removing David's Bowie's Space Oddity from the credits in the process.</p>
<p>This, the developer has said, is due to "changes in licensing". Once this update goes live, players will instead be met with an original song by Petri Alanko, known as Strange Moons.</p>
<p>Alanko has also composed music for a number of Remedy's other games, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> and Control.</p>

<p>Resharing Remedy's post, Alanko said the upcoming replacement song was "written from a point of view of an astronaut who does have quite a few problems. But even _that_ is okay, as it is what it is".</p>
<p>The composer furthered this upcoming change to the original game "wasn't completely out of scratch (heh), as a section of the song was originally in a level in OG AW, but that level was cut out long before release".</p>
<p>This Alan Wake update will be going ahead this coming Tuesday, 10th September, across Steam, Epic Games Store and GOG. Can you hear me, Major Tom? Well, original Alan Wake players won't be able to from then.</p> <div>

<p>Having initially released in 2010 on Xbox 360, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-remastered-will-see-the-xbox-360-classic-finally-debut-on-playstation">Alan Wake got the remaster treatment</a> in 2021. This remaster <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-remastered-ditching-originals-product-placement">ditched the original game's hefty product placement</a>. A sequel, aptly named Alan Wake 2, was then released last year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-design-teased-by-sony-in-30th-anniversary-post-announcement-is-inbound-and-launch-is-set-for-november/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned leaker billbill-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-render-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the first look at the PS5 Pro earlier this week, and Sony has now basically confirmed the design as part of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation's 30th anniversary blog post</a>. In the celebratory image, Sony sneakily added a mockup that seems very much in line with the leaked one.</p>

<p>While reporting the story, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that developers have been told all games launched on or after September 16 will have to support the PlayStation 5 Pro, hinting at an inbound announcement. Insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-image-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that the current plan is to launch the mid-generation console refresh in November, thus mimicking perfectly the September announcement and November release seen during the last generation for the PlayStation 4 Pro, as we had surmised when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> developers talking freely about it at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>Next week is probably the right week for the PS5 Pro announcement, then, and the excitement may not end there for PlayStation fans. Another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-announced-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints</a> that Sony is also preparing a new State of Play broadcast to show off first-party games on the week of November 19-20.</p>
<p>Let's recap what we know about the PS5 Pro so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>45% performance improvement in rasterized rendering thanks to a larger GPU and faster memory</li>
<li>Hugely improved ray tracing architecture delivering 2-3x speedup on average, with peaks of 4x</li>
<li>Custom machine learning architecture that supports 300 TOPS at 8-bit to power the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling technique, Sony's version of Multi Frame Super Resolution based on the PlayStation Machine Learning (PSML) algorithm.</li>
<li>PSSR is an ML-enhanced version of Temporal Anti-Aliasing Upscaling (TAAU) that requires inputs similar to NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR and fully supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) pipelines. It also does not require per-game training like the latest version of DLSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no info on the pricing yet, but we'll let you know as soon as there is a credible rumor on the topic.</p>

            <p>About 12 years ago, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-survivors-jasper-byrnes-new-game-canned">drew our breath in pain to report</a> that Lone Survivor developer Jasper Byrne's new "Zelda x Demon's Souls" action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> was no more. "It was too big for a single person to make," Byrne wrote at the time. "This is the root of the problem. It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it." That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you never played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lone-survivor">Lone Survivor</a>, it's an excellent side-scrolling survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> that mixes together ideas from Silent Hill into something wholly its own. "The strongest praise I can supply is that this is a game clearly made by a man who understands why people still hope for a return to the glory of Silent Hill 2," Adam Smith (rest in BG3) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-lone-survivor">wrote in 2012</a>. "It's a game made by someone who appreciates that the best way to get under someone's skin is to make them think about that skin, not just the way that it peels off when a knife is applied, but the way that if feels to touch, the way that it covers our skulls and helps us to express ourselves, and the way that it wrinkles and ages." I will only add that the soundtrack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFiBkP3krjs">bangs</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure when, exactly, Byrne decided to revive his action-RPG project - he's been <a href="https://x.com/PRDXCL">posting WIP screens for years</a>, perhaps more for the pleasure of sharing than as an indicator of progress - but in <a href="https://x.com/jasperbyrne/status/1830588551526027732">one of this week's surprise Xitter updates</a>, he says he rewrote the whole thing to run in Unity at some stage. He also took an extended break from development when Covid hit. "[It] feels so fresh after a nearly 5 year hiatus," reads <a href="https://x.com/jasperbyrne/status/1830579798260781226">another TwiXter post</a>. "i never fell out of love with it but when covid started i got too much anxiety about it and made the call to hit pause. i only recently felt brave enough to try, so i'm seeing how it feels to work on again. let's see what happens".</p>
<p>Here's a shot of the project from 2013, back when it ran on the Blitzmax engine.</p>

<p>And here's one of the screens Byrne has shared this week. I really like the fog and how the choice of perspective works with the terrain textures.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/3_wGJAMxv.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/jasperbyrne/status/1830579798260781226">a further update</a>, Byrne says that he's "written down the 8 milestones needed to get this thing out the door. nothing but the bare minimum, because 12 years is plenty enough already". Fingers crossed it's relatively smooth sailing from here. If you'd like to give him a hand, and you've yet to play Lone Survivor, you can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1907440/Super_Lone_Survivor/">a remastered version on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s players have been complaining about a string of issues surfacing in the game recently. Issues including in-raid freezes, sudden black screens and other visual glitches have been reported, and Battlestate Games has <strong>just </strong>outlined why that is.</p>



<p>According to the developer, it’s a problem with the Discord overlay, which is causing conflicts within Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-don-t-use-it">Just Don’t Use It</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has advised that players ‘enjoy VoIP features in Escape from Tarkov’ while the Discord issues are resolved, and they assured the community that Discord developers are hot on the case. </p>



<p>In the meantime, perhaps you could use something like Teamspeak, which has one of the best social media profiles in the business on Twitter that’s packed full of self-deprecation.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Recent player issues that resulted in black screen, raid freezes and other visual problems are caused by Discord overlay not working properly. </p><p>Stay tuned for updates from Discord developers and enjoy VoIP features in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EscapefromTarkov</a>.</p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1831968536631406609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>This isn’t the first major issue to surface in Escape from Tarkov recently. In the last few days, players have also been wrestling with a cross-platform glitch between Tarkov and Tarkov Arena that has been resetting tasks. Battlestate had to turn off the linking/synching functionality while it investigated this problem.</p>



<p>It’s relatively typical for the top-tier extraction shooter, though. Every time the game wipes and a major update is introduced, problems are sure to surface. It has been a rough year for Escape from Tarkov, and it seems as though the game still isn’t out of the woods just yet.</p>

<p>Concord is going offline today after just a few days on the market, which is sure to break the hearts of the several hundred players who enjoyed it. In a record-short time, Concord imploded, thanks to a lacklustre marketing campaign, no existing fanbase, and a premium price point – plus character designs that flopped immeasurably in the face of the community.</p>



<p>But this isn’t the last we’re seeing of the game. It has been claimed that it’s still slated to appear in Prime Video’s Secret Level,  an anthology series revealed by Tim Miller during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-forgotten-but-not-gone">Forgotten But Not Gone</h2>



<p>Concord might have failed as a game, but there’s still a chance that it can succeed as an animated episode as part of Secret Level, a 15-part series focused on various franchises like God of War, Crossfire, Armored Core, and of course, Concord itself. </p>



<p>Each game will get a standalone, one-shot episode as part of Secret Level, which was the most hyped-up announcement during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live event.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent report by IGN</a>, it was claimed that sources close to the production have confirmed that Concord will remain in Secret Level, despite being such a travesty of a title that fell flat on its face immediately after being released.</p>



<p>Tim Miller is working as the executive producer of the series. Historically, he has appeared in works like Deadpool (director), Love, Death &amp; Robots (producer), and Sonic the Hedgehog (executive producer).</p>



<p>Are you eager to see what’s made of Concord when Secret Level airs on Prime Video?</p>

I absolutely <em>adore</em> the HD-2D visual aesthetic from the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> series, and I'll play anything that employs it. Is your game unpolished with a bug that may or may not ruin save files? I'll take my chances with it in HD-2D. Am I also looking at a 30-hour plot that reads like your intern randomly threw up gobstoppers labelled with names, places, and plot twists? How concerning—now gimme my HD-2D.</p><p>Obviously, if you choose to wrap this modern-meets-ancient art-style around one of the most celebrated RPGs of the golden age of gaming, well, winged serpents could not drag me away from your HD-2D quest.</p><p>I'll clear my calendar for such a rejig, even if I didn't grow up with the NES original because it didn't launch in my country. For a few Aussies, like me, our introduction to DQ3 was a Game Boy port of the SNES refresh, which sold a million cartridges on launch day in '96.

It’s a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-is-as-faithful-as-you-could-ask">faithful remake</a> that, despite the significant graphical revamp and refined narrative elements, doesn’t stray too far from the source material. </p><p>If you're already an uber fan, you'd know that the first three Dragon Quest games represent the Erdrick Trilogy, and (kinda sorta spoilers) this third installment was actually a prequel that outlines the first steps of the adventure. Semi-confusing, no?
</p><p>Anyway, you must fill the 16-bit boots of a 16-year-old child of a hero named Ortega, who was sent to defeat the villainous Baramos. Your old man cocked it up, so the king sends you and a group of companions to rectify his mistakes. 
</p><p>By the by, it should also be mentioned that you're not going to hit end credits and be left in a narrative lurch for long—<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-and-2-hd-2d-announced-along-with-3-remake-release-date-nintendo-direct-2024">Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD-2D</a> upgrades are in the pipeline for 2025. It's very much worth getting in on the ground floor now if you've been wondering what all the fuss is with this (soon to be) 12-games-thick franchise.
</p><p>While I only had roughly an hour's worth of hands on with DQ3, I found it to be surprisingly delightful and engaging, despite the somewhat creaky bones source material. I'm told that there will be new story elements and never before seen vocations for its heroes. Sounds like cutting room floor stuff that the diehard faithful will drool over. </p><p>Getting into the technicals, I noted Performance and Graphics modes on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, and more. The former translates to 60 frames per second, and the latter is a 4K resolution. Not sure why we can't have both there, to be honest. This being a turn-based combat affair with the only major motion being your top-down traipsings across the overworld...I just went 4K and was perfectly happy.  </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake Screenshots</h3></div></output></p><p>I also noted that the devs are offering a choice between two protagonist appearances and three difficulty settings. If you do take the plunge there, you can always fall back on some quality of life features, including autosaves (with manual saves still available). Given that the combat here is light on the animations to preserve the OG feel, I was glad for the ability to speed the fisticuffs up with my shoulder buttons. Just give me my XP and a host of victory affirming, 16-bit-esque sound effects, please and thank you.</p><p>Other welcome additions included two camera modes, and a mini map which could be toggled on. I also love this feature and wish it  was in more RPGs that I have to finish in dribs and drabs—an NPC conversation log that saves the last 30 interactions.</p><p>Looking back through my notes, it seems I also appreciated the now vestigial visual aesthetic where towns in the overworld appear like miniatures when compared to your super-deformed party. It's also cool that the level designers add in rolling topography to what were once pancake grid overworlds, not to mention some gorgeous dappled light caused by foreground trees and moving clouds up beyond your vision. It's modern things such as this—like the day/night cycle shoehorned in—that really make one appreciate the extra effort gone into enhancing this in sensible, non-destructive ways.</p><p>Unless my eyeballs and instincts are deceiving me, this package already has the feeling of being built by a team who worship the original article. Playing a remake like that is always an infectious experience, and I can't wait to fill the gaps in my understanding of the "in the beginning" of a series I came to love later in the piece. November 15th can't arrive soon enough.</p><p><em>Adam Mathew is our Aussie deals wrangler.

<p>If you spend time on the Steam forums, you probably know by now that people aren’t too excited about the system requirements for The Forever Winter. They’re beastly, requiring a potent gaming computer to run successfully. Here’s what you can expect from the minimum and recommended requirements for the extraction shooter!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-forever-winter-pc-system-requirements">The Forever Winter PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>As you’ll soon see from The Forever Winter’s system requirements, the game requires a monster of a gaming computer to run its recommended systems. The GPU and CPU will certainly set most people back a significant amount. It’s definitely going to limit the number of people playing the game with the graphics maxed out!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super (8 GB) / Radeon RX 5700XT (8 GB)</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Unknown (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5700X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (12 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 6800XT (16 GB)</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Unknown (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<p>While we don’t yet know how much storage space is necessary, you definitely want to install this one on an SSD to ensure you load into a raid promptly. You could lose a lot of gear, like in Escape From Tarkov, by loading in late.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-content-is-available-in-early-access">How Much Content is Available in Early Access?</h2>



<p>When The Forever Winter launches at the end of September into Early Access, it will do so with:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Four complete maps</strong></li>



<li><strong>Five playable characters</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dozens of unique weapons</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>You can customize those weapons, by the way!</p>

<p>It’s uncommon for extraction shooters to launch on consoles, though that’s seemingly changing. Hunt: Showdown is the big one available on PS5, and Delta Force is on its way, but if you want something more niche and hardcore, you’re out of luck. Of course, never say never! But is The Forever Winter coming to PS5?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-forever-winter-on-ps5">Can You Play The Forever Winter on PS5?</h2>



<p>Currently, <strong>there are no official plans to bring The Forever Winter to PS5</strong>. However, it’s not out of the realm of possibilities. When asked about a PlayStation 5 launch—or a console launch altogether—the studio said they’ll initially launch exclusively on PC, but depending on how successful they are and the community feedback, they may consider a “platform expansion” sometime during the game’s development.</p>



<p>Of course, developing for PC is a bit different than developing for a console. If the team intends to launch on PS5 later, optimizing the game for the system will take time. But hey, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-ps5-pro-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro is supposedly on its way</a>, and that console will likely handle anything developers throw its way!</p>

<p>If you were hoping for a free-to-play game to keep your attention this fall, The Forever Winter isn’t the one. It’s not a free-to-play title and will come with a premium price tag on day one. The studio wants to launch at an MSRP of <strong>$29.99</strong>, with a launch-day discount bringing it down to $27.99 for a short period.</p>



<p>It’s certainly not the most expensive title to launch these days, and with potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay, it’s a welcome sight!</p>

<p>To keep you busy until The Forever Winter launches on PC, why not check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-campaign-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space Marine 2 campaign length</a>? Everyone’s excited about the latest Warhammer game, and rightfully so!</p>

Its start was good for fifth overall on Steam's charts despite only being able to players who purchased the Gold and Ultra editions of the game.</p><p>But it wasn't an entirely flawless victory for the anticipated sequel. Players soon reported problems with joining the server, including members of the IGN staff. Fans quickly took to X/Twitter and other forums to express their frustration with the experience.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fix the servers. "Joining server" is killing all of us. And being stuck on "joining server" after completing a mission isn't fun. We have to close the game and reopen just to be told to redo the mission we just completed</p>— kurokami🌑⚡️ (@kurokamekami2) <a href="https://twitter.com/kurokamekami2/status/1831800775015797085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Similarly, while Space Marine 2's Steam reviews currently sit at "Mostly Positive," a few fans complained about graphics drivers and a lack of ultrawide support, among other issues.</p><p>Focus Home Entertainment acknowledged the problems in a post to its <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/forums/27-bugs/threads/43800-quick-note-on-the-most-common-issues#post-207833" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a>, saying, "We are aware of the technical issues you're encountering on #SpaceMarine2 and are sorry for the inconvenience.  Our teams are currently working to fix them.Please keep providing feedback and make sure your read this note on the most common issues."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Focus Entertainment (@Focus_entmt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Focus_entmt/status/1831803796776685611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The full post lists some of the most common issues, including crashing on the first cinematic, controller problems, and infinity loading. It also notes that linking Steam and Epic accounts is not required to play the game, saying that the Epic Online Services installation was implemented to "support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores."</p><p>Otherwise, we were generally positive in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">review of Space Marine 2</a>, writing, "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but they’re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own. And while the Operations PvE mode that accompanies it doesn’t currently offer enough to keep me coming back, the deep customization options for your Space Marine do look promising if it’s supported in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more">post-launch updates</a> as planned. Besides, when you’re eviscerating aliens on planets as pretty as these, it’s hard not to leave satisfied."</p><p>Space Marine 2 is slated to fully launch on September 9 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.  </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 came out of early access in 2023 and blew a lot of minds--it earned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">GameSpot's GOTY award</a>--and even a year later, it's tough to get it at a reduced price. If you've been holding out for a sale, now might be the time to strike: GOG is offering <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fbaldurs_gate_iii&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-baldurs-gate-3-from-gog-for-the-lowest-price-yet%2F1100-6526314%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Baldur's Gate 3</a> for $48, the lowest price yet for the acclaimed RPG. Yup, Baldur's Gate 3's price has behaved more like a Nintendo game than most AAA releases. The 20% discount is only available until September 9 as part of a weekend sale on Larian games.</p><p>An isometric, turn-based RPG, Baldur's Gate 3 puts you in the universe of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The game is particularly impressive because of the huge amount of choice it often presents you with. You can do some pretty wild stuff with your party of heroes based on the route you decide to take through the game and how you build your character. And famously, you get a whole lot of romance options, including a character in bear form.</p><p>GOG's discount takes 20% off the list price of $60, so while it's not a huge drop price, it's still a fairly significant reduction. Steam is also offering the same price of $48 on Baldur's Gate 3, if you'd rather keep yourself in Valve's walled garden. Baldur's Gate 3 is Steam Deck-verified, so if you're a fan of the handheld, that'd be a good reason to grab it here--but you'll have to deal with Valve's digital rights management, while GOG games are all DRM-free. It only takes a few minutes to get GOG games up and running on Steam Deck with the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heroic Games Launcher</a>. The launcher also supports Amazon Games and Epic Games Store, so you can play a lot of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-games-epic-games-store/1100-6476419/" data-ref-id="1100-6476419">weekly Epic</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-28-free-games-in-september/1100-6526296/" data-ref-id="1100-6526296">monthly Prime

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>Warning: The below story is packed with FULL SPOILERS for Baldur's Gate 3, particularly Karlach's new evil ending. You've been warned!</strong></p><p>Larian Studios dropped <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-long-awaited-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-alongside-massive-patch-notes">its highly anticipated Patch 7 on PC today</a>, and with it comes a slew of new cinematics for players doing evil runs. While fans hop back into the RPG and discover the new content, one origin character's new evil ending is getting a particular amount of attention.</p><p>If you're wondering why Karlach, everyone's favorite tiefling Barbarian, was trending on X/Twitter today, that's why. One fan showed her new evil ending, which you can watch below, and it's going viral just by virtue of being "absolutely metal."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Gali | Currently playing DA2 (Blind) (@gali_le0) <a href="https://twitter.com/gali_le0/status/1831725884174172231?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In the clip, we see Karlach, if you're playing her as an origin character, after she's taken control of the The Netherbrain, essentially making all of Baldur's Gate her pawns. No longer the golden retriever of the group, Karlach is fully embracing her newfound control as she gives a menacing monologue to the citizens in front of her before summoning a hoard of enemies from Avernus. </p><p>And, in a <em>truly</em> metal twist, the clip ends with her yanking her infernal heart out of her chest. About time she got rid of that dang thing.</p><p>In addition to just how badass the whole cinematic is, fans are also praising voice actor Samantha Beart's new voice lines. Beart even took the liberty of highlighting one fan's, uh, <em>passionate</em> response to the new ending.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So the last patch of BG3 has been implemented, the evil endings are out (careful of spoilers, Karlach enjoyers), and I'm framing this 👇🏼 <a href="https://t.co/yPzwzosbI4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/yPzwzosbI4</a></p>— Samantha Béart is Karlach ❤️‍🔥 (@SamanthaBeart) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamanthaBeart/status/1831746675574239675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Other fans talked about how the new scene displays the anger and darkness that Karlach has, as she also talks about Gortash, her friend/employer-turned-betrayer, in the clip. "THIS is the Zariel-brained anger filled darkness she has, absolutely unleashed," <a href="https://x.com/sailorgundam308/status/1831743513597506044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan wrote</a>. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HOLY SHIT this is utterly insane??? Woah,,,,, my heart aches for the path that would lead to this but DAMN THAT WAS AMAZING!?!?! <a href="https://t.co/QTuTlcZgTE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/QTuTlcZgTE</a></p>— Captian Mewonweyonweyon (@MellonWellon) <a href="https://twitter.com/MellonWellon/status/1831777271826542761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HOLY SHIT i don’t know how to feel about this one <a href="https://t.co/G1QiF01AQh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/G1QiF01AQh</a></p>— Dumbass (@slut_dumbass) <a href="https://twitter.com/slut_dumbass/status/1831772326524023143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It's somewhat ironic, too, that a Karlach ending is at the center of a Baldur's Gate 3 conversation yet again. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/put-those-baldurs-gate-3-karlach-romance-playthroughs-on-hold-shes-about-to-get-a-better-ending">In a previous patch</a>, Larian tweaked the ill-fated character's non-evil ending to give her story "better closure."</p><p>Karlach isn't the only one getting a new evil ending, however, and Larian already previously <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-new-dark-urge-ending-gets-first-look-from-larian">revealed a dark new cinematic for a Dark Urge origin character</a>. As for the console players waiting to dive into the Baldur's Gate 3's massive Patch 7, which also includes official mod support, <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1831689163898302757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larian said earlier today</a> that it should arrive on consoles sometime this October. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-acer-gaming-laptop-concept-has-built-in-controller/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Acer recently showcased its newest gaming laptop concept during IFA Berlin 2024, one of the world’s largest tech conventions, and this baby had some impressive features. Two of the most notable takeaways from this laptop concept were the fact that it had a built-in controller and detachable speakers.</p>



<h2 id="h-gaming-laptop-concept-by-acer-has-built-in-controller">Gaming Laptop Concept By Acer Has Built-In Controller</h2>



<p>The built-in controller was easily the biggest takeaway from the showcase. While many gamers stand by the fact that keyboard and mouse is the best way to play, there are still quite a few people who prefer a controller. In fact, some keyboard and mouse players prefer to take a break from their desks and just sit back and utilize a controller.</p>



<p>Gaming with a controller also appeals to more casual gamers, which could be a big selling point for this laptop.</p>



<p>The way the computer is designed, the mouse pad is actually detachable with two joysticks and buttons on the side. This means you can use the controller as just a mouse or you can use it as a gaming controller. Either option is pretty cool.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The computer even allows for dual controllers, as the company showcased the feature by having two people play Street Fighter 6 against each other on the system.</p>



<p>Although, the device does have a smaller battery and cooling system to give it more room for the controller. This has led to many questioning whether or not the computer will be able to handle high-end gaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-acer-laptop-showcases-detachable-speakers">Acer Laptop Showcases Detachable Speakers</h2>



<p>Another fancy little feature showcased at the event was the Acer laptop’s detachable speakers. Want your speakers facing a different way? Maybe you would like to have them facing directly at you instead of upwards? Well, this newest feature allows gamers to customize their gaming space with the new detachable speakers.</p>



<p>So, will Acer implement all of these ideas? As of now, this is just a concept, meaning Acer could completely scrap it. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">If you've ever read a book and thought, "This would be a lot cooler if the main characters knew their stats and could see their health points," then you might want to check out the new print editions of the popular Dungeon Crawler Carl series, which is getting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Crawler-Carl-Matt-Dinniman/dp/059382024X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hardcover editions for the first time</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Written by Matt Dinniman, the popular book series belongs to a subgenre of fiction called "LitRPGs" that integrates video game tropes like stats, health bars, and inventory screens directly into the story. Rather than being a choose-your-own-adventure story or a tabletop RPG, LitRPG books are prose novels where the characters interact with the world in a game-like way--often because they are transported into an alternate video game reality or because outside forces morph the real world into a game-like setting.</p><p dir="ltr">In Dungeon Crawler Carl, aliens have turned Earth into a 10-floor mega-dungeon, and each book in the series represents a different level of the dungeon with its own environmental identity, characters Carl meets, and objectives he completes in hopes of saving humanity.</p><p dir="ltr">If that sounds like a series you'd like to read, you're in luck--the first three Dungeon Crawler Carl books are getting print editions for the first time. The franchise began as an audiobook and ebook series, but now you can grab a h<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Crawler-Carl-Matt-Dinniman/dp/059382024X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ardcover copy of the first book at Amazon</a> for just $20 (was $30).

            <p>
Among the many questions observers had following this week's shock shutdown of PlayStation 5v5 shooter Concord (albeit not necessarily at the top of their list) was if the now-defunct live-service title would still make an appearance in Amazon's upcoming animated video game anthology series Secret Level - and the answer, according to a new report at least, is yes.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, if you haven't been following along, is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">15-episode series from the creators of Love, Death &amp; Robots</a> that'll feature original stories set in the world of games. More specifically, it'll include episodes centred on Armored Core, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-MAN, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, Warhammer 40,000, and a number of PlayStation Studios games.
</p>
<p>
More pertinently, though, it was also due to include an episode based on Concord - a decision made well before the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after launch</a> amid less-than-stellar player numbers. And while developer Firewalk Studios has suggested Concord may one day return, many wondered if its Secret Level episode would get the chop given it was essentially envisaged as an advert for a game that, currently at least, effectively no longer exists.

<p>
While Amazon is yet to officially comment on the matter, IGN - citing a "source close to production" - has now reported Concord will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source">remain a part of Secret Level despite its recent closure</a>. That's perhaps not entirely surprising given the significant investment Amazon has likely made in the episode, but it'll certainly hit differently knowing what we now know.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level is currently due to make its Prime Video debut on 10th December this year, if you want to pour one out for Concord as its episode airs.

<p>Fortnite Globals happens this weekend with the best Fortnite players in the world heading to Texas to compete against one another. Every year during this season, many esports organizations quickly pick up some of the top players and XSET is no exception. The popular esports team recently announced their newest signing, Veno.</p>



<h2 id="h-veno-signs-to-xset-going-into-fortnite-globals">Veno Signs To XSET Going Into Fortnite Globals</h2>



<p>The Fortnite Global Championship is an annual event, where teams who qualified during the year’s various FNCS tournaments come together and compete against each other for a massive $3 million prize pool.</p>



<p>Many of the biggest names in Fortnite qualify for this event, with quite a few of them represented by large organizations. XSET, who has some massive Fortnite names on their roster, recently acquired Veno.</p>



<p>Veno has already gone down in history as one of the best Fortnite players of all time, with more than one FNCS first-place title and a second-place title from the FNCS Invitational back in 2022.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Veno acquired quite a bit of fame back in 2022 after he and the European player, Queasy, dominated in various FNCS Majors and the FNCS Invitational. The player really took the spotlight, though, after he and Queasy attempted to land second place while they were holding first during the last game of the 2022 Invitational.</p>



<p>Since then, Veno has qualified and placed in many different large Fortnite tournaments, making him one of the most decorative players in the scene.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-players-in-xset">Additional Players In XSET</h2>



<p>XSET also has a few other Fortnite players on its roster, as the team has been preparing throughout 2024, getting as many big names as they can. </p>



<p><strong>Every Fortnite player on XSET:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Clix</li>



<li>Muz</li>



<li>Trashy</li>



<li>Ritual</li>



<li>Edgey</li>



<li>Cold</li>



<li>Veno</li>
</ul>



<p>Veno and Muz are the only non-North American players on XSET, at the moment.</p>

Its inclusion was thrown into doubt by PlayStation's decision to take Concord offline, seemingly spelling the end of the troubled live service game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Prime Video has yet to publicly announce whether or not it will remain in Tim Miller's anthology series, but IGN understands that the episode featuring Concord is indeed still slated to air this season.</p><p>In addition to Concord, Secret Level will include stories featuring God of War, Mega Man, Unreal Tournament, and other properties from throughout video game history. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-looks-like-keanu-reeves-is-in-amazons-armored-core-animation">Keanu Reeves is among the actors said to be starring in the series</a>.</p><p>Secret Level garnered attention at gamescom not just because of its large numer of familiar franchises, but because of Miller's involvement in popular anthologies such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/love-death-and-robots-vol-3-review">Love, Death and Robots</a>. It's currently slated to stream on Prime Video on December 10.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Concord, for its part, is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">slated to go offline this week</a> — less than two weeks after its initial release. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">Concord's low sales and tiny concurrent numbers</a> seemingly doomed the shooter, though it's unclear whether Sony plans to bring it back as a free-to-play release. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-players-are-jumping-off-cliffs-in-game-as-they-desperately-grind-for-the-platinum-trophy-before-shutdown">players are throwing themselves off cliffs</a> in an attempt to max out their level and get a coveted platinum trophy.</p><p>In our Concord review we wrote, "Concord isn’t the most innovative or content-heavy hero shooter you could play, but with such fantastic competitive gameplay, 16 compelling characters to master, and 12 well-designed maps, it’s got the makings of something that could go the distance in the months and years to come. In fact, it’s a testament to its FPS chops that even while it has a virtually nonexistent story and a serious need for a signature game mode, I still found myself losing dozens of hours to its PvP charms."</p><p>Concord is scheduled to go offline on September 6.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.
