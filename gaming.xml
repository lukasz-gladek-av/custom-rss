<p>Of course, Steam's most played games list tends to be dominated by multiplayer games - by their nature, they attract more players.</p>
<p>By contrast, the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> has a peak concurrent player count of 953,426, sitting at ninth in the all-time most played games.</p>
<p>Still, there's clearly interest in FromSoftware's multiplayer experiment.</p>
<p>The game is also available across PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-balance-adjustments-in-day-one-patch">day one patch is available to download</a>, which brings balance adjustments and bug fixes. However, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">FromSoftware has warned</a> some PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/woojer-vest-3-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Gaming is all about immersion. Visuals are the entry point to our digital worlds, gameplay the mechanical interaction, while audio can wrap, envelop and enhance the entire experience, but how can we take all of that further? Woojer know a thing or two about immersion, releasing a series of haptic-enhanced belts and vests over the last five years, designed to take your gaming immersion to a new level. Now, they’re releasing the Vest 3, the culmination of everything that’s gone before. If you’re looking for a new level of immersion, especially in VR, it’s the ultimate accessory.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meet Woojer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmP8ijaclmg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Woojer Vest 3 feels like a premium experience from the moment you open the box. The sleek, glossy packaging opens up to reveal the backplate of the vest, black leather, fabric and stitching pulled together by a white, rubberised Woojer logo.</p>


<p>Pulling it free of the packaging, one of the first things you’ll wonder is how much weight there is to it, and that’s despite slimming down from the previous version. The 1.5kg of weight is all thanks to the bevy of tech attached to the Vest 3, with all the fabric and leather punctuated by a chunky battery pack, control unit, and six haptic units. Frankly, it looks like something straight out of Cyberpunk, and it’s possibly the most exciting piece of gaming hardware I’ve seen in a long time.</p>
<p>You won’t notice that weight when you’re wearing it. The Vest 3 does a great job of dispersing the weight evenly across your back and shoulders, and when you’re focused on your game, it practically disappears. Save for all the thumping.</p>

<p>You’re strapped in via a thin clasp across the chest, and a chunky belt strap at the waist, and there’s plenty of variability for different body sizes. I’m relatively small and slim, and I have both the belt and chest straps nearly fully tightened, and there’s a lot of slack if you need it. Smaller players, like the kids in our house, were able to wear it too, though the effect wasn’t quite the same as the haptics couldn’t all sit directly against their body. Overall, I’d expect the majority of teens and adults to be able to wear it comfortably, living up to what Woojer describe as, “One size fits most”.</p>

<p>The front view gives you a clearer look at the haptic units, with two positioned at your chest, and another two attached to the waist straps. Each is a black plastic disc, etched with the Woojer logo, and when you touch them they actually feel lighter than you’d expect.</p>
<p>The main control unit sits on the left hand side if the vest, giving you easy access to all the controls you’ll need. It lights up brightly, depending on what you’re doing, and if you’re choosing to watch something via a flat panel display, it’s worth knowing that the lights may well reflect on your screen.</p>
<p>The control panel houses a large power button, physical volume controls and buttons for setting the overall haptic level, while there’s also LED displays for the connection types and the different levels. Meanwhile, the underside of the panel has 3.5mm sockets for incoming and outgoing audio, and a USB-C port at the centre.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is charge the Vest 3, and there’s some mild confusion to be found here, with the vest having two USB-C ports. The one on the front control unit is not for charging, so you’ll need to flip it over and use the one on the back. In fairness, there’s a very clear sign on the rear, and in the instructions, but I still managed to get it wrong. I imagine that plenty more will along the way.</p>

<p>That comes down to the multitude of inputs the Vest 3 is capable of, with wired USB-C audio sitting alongside analog 3.5mm and wireless Bluetooth connections. When connecting via Bluetooth you can use the Vest 3’s mutipoint connection to receive audio, before sending it to separate Bluetooth headphones, at the same time, while adding in its haptic response.</p>
<p>And what a response it is. We reviewed the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/08/woojer-vest-edge-review-can-strapping-haptics-to-your-body-make-vr-more-immersive/">Woojer Vest Edge</a>, and it felt absolutely great. The Vest 3 takes things up a step, and its Osci V2 TRX transducers – which claim to be the most powerful and precise iterations of this tech – thump away in unison in an utterly beguiling way. If you want to literally feel your music, movies and games, Woojer have a compelling solution.</p>
<p>I tested the Vest 3 across a range of different platforms and use cases, and I started with the PlayStation 5, wired audio connections, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/31/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-ps5/">The Last of Us Part I</a>. This is an interesting game to play with the Vest 3. The heavy-hitting action is punctuated by plenty of moments of silence, but then it ramps up, with percussive gunshots sitting alongside the game’s evocative acoustic music. It certainly adds an additional layer to the game, and the moments of light and dark make a perfect match for the Vest 3. There’s a sense though, that you’re not getting everything out of it.</p>
<p>What you need is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. If the Woojer Vest 3 needs a proof of concept for flatscreen play, then Doom is it. From the moment the id Software logo rumbles into view, and the Vest 3 responds with a resonating rumble, you know you’re in for something special. Combine the unbelievably weighty gunplay with the heavy metal soundtrack and ominous cracks of thunder and lightning, and the Vest 3 translates all of that into a full body experience. Doom: The Dark Ages doesn’t even feel remotely the same now playing it without the Vest 3, and if you’re a fan of this type of FPS, I’m telling you to start saving for a Woojer device right now. You’ll thank me later.</p>

<p>Of course, VR remains the ultimate expression of the Vest 3’s potential. Here, all of those brushes, rumbles and thumps become real and physical actions that aren’t quite translated in the same way when you’re playing on a flatscreen. Batman: Arkham Shadow is an ideal candidate for this, with its bruising, high-intensity combat made all the more enthralling by being able to physically feel the impacts you’re dishing out and receiving.</p>
<p>The best VR game? Given that it would sit at the top of most VR lists, it’s little surprise to find that Beat Saber gets even better when the music is coursing through your body as well as your ears. While you flail around with neon lightsabers, the music is translated into all-encompassing thumps and rumbles, making it all feel like some futuristic clubbing experience where the music is booming through your body. If you’re looking for the next step in a Beat Saber addiction, here it is.</p>
<p>As a side note, while the Vest 3 has some seriously powerful haptics, I don’t think they’d ever be capable of causing actual bruising, unless you’re medically predisposed to them. If you are, then I’d perhaps check in with a medical professional before playing.</p>
<p>There is plenty of customisation to the effects that the Woojer Vest 3 is capable of, which is pretty important to tune to your liking. The vest produces its haptic feedback based via the audio input, as opposed to triggering in tandem with a gamepad rumble – this would require game and platform-level support. To that end, the manual recommends turning up your source device to 100% and then altering the volume and haptic response on the Vest itself, but I had more success with turning the input down ever so slightly – to more like 80% – as that seemed to help the Vest 3 focus on the larger or more serious impacts or beats, rather than translating everything you hear into a rumble. It does remarkably steer clear of speech, and your setup will, of course, change from game to game, but I do recommend tweaking and tuning each time to find the right level of feedback.</p>

<p>At £450, the Woojer Vest 3 is a significant investment, though they are currently offering a serious reduction to £360 via their official website to make the price slightly more palatable. It’s clearly a luxury product, but if you’re a household that already has its gaming systems in place – particularly when it comes to VR – and you’re looking for the next level of immersion, the Woojer Vest 3 makes a very compelling argument for its pricetag.</p>

			<p>Hypercharge: Unboxed feels deeply nostalgic, like upending a toy box from your childhood and letting your imagination run wild amidst a sea of action figures, vehicles, building blocks, and other vibrantly-coloured plastic. Clearly inspired by late 90s animated movies such as Toy Story and, perhaps more notably, Small Soldiers, the game can be split into two parts: a wave-based tower defence mode playable either in solo or co-op, and a traditional spread of competitive PvP match types.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hypercharge: Unboxed - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbJRzi2CX0o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The former is the more fun and fleshed out of the two, featuring a list of campaign missions that task up to three other players (or bots) with fending off incoming hordes of enemies. They’ll make a beeline for your Hypercores, critical structures that can be reinforced by spending resources on walls and traps to impede enemies as you line them up in your crosshairs.</p>


<p>There’s an increasing variety of enemy types to help spice things up, from lumbering robots and speedy spinning tops, to evasive toy planes and towering bosses. Each of the maps are fairly small and self-contained with replayability coming mainly from running these stages on tougher difficulty settings while also crossing off a series of optional objectives to earn medals and unlock new customisation options and buildable fortifications.</p>


<p>Naturally, co-op with friends is the best way to enjoy this mode, putting your team tactics to the test against the toughest difficulty tier. While there’s an option to play alongside bots, they’re not the brightest bunch. Coordinating with other humans helps offset the creeping repetitiveness though this could also have been helped with more dynamic combat mechanics.</p>
<p>The gunplay in Hypercharge opts for arcade-like simplicity as you pick up weapons, ammo, and health packs, hopping through portals and launching yourself into the air using jump pads. It’s fun for a while though the Hypercharge arsenal lacks a certain depth or pizazz: there are no secondary fire modes, grenades, power-ups, or hero-style abilities that have become the norm in first person shooters. When facing down an opponent one-to-one in competitive play, wielding the bigger gun matters more than having a strategic play in your back pocket.</p>

<p>Speaking of competitive play, Hypercharge: Unboxed features five classic modes including Deathmatch, TDM, King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, and Infection, the latter being the most fun due to its unpredictable frenziedness. Each mode allows for 8 players which is an optimal number considering how tightly packed some of these maps are. However, much like solo play and co-op, the basic gunplay (and lack of engaging player progression hooks) quickly eats into the novelty factor.</p>
<p>One of the game’s highlights is seeing everyday settings transformed into makeshift battlegrounds, from cluttered bedrooms to playgrounds, creating vantage points and defences from otherwise inconspicuous objects. Developer Digital Cybercherries have also taken a page from the Aldi supermarket playbook with many toys and props accurately emulating well-known brands, augmenting them ever-so-slightly to avoid a copyright lawsuit. The game’s visuals are its strongest asset, with oversized environments and deep action figure customisation.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Hypercharge: Unboxed delivers on its promise of plastic-bashing toy warfare. However, for more mature gamers and fans of the genre, it doesn’t go deep enough, playing it safe with serviceable albeit rather basic gameplay.	</p></div>

			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different game from every other game developed by FromSoftware, sporting the mechanics made popular by their Souls series. Instead of making co-op multiplayer an optional element that can make certain segments of the game easier, the experience has been designed around co-op, resulting in a game that is clearly best played together with two other players.</p>
<p>Despite this, <strong>the challenges that the land of Limveld offers can be experienced by lone Nightfarers not keen on teaming up with others.</strong> Doing so it's extremely simple. All you need to do is <strong>interacting with the big table found in the central area of the Roundtable Hold</strong> main hub, press the <strong>R1 / right shoulder button</strong> on your controller to access the <strong>Matchmaking Settings tab</strong>, scroll down to the Expedition Type option and press either left or right to change between Multiplayer and <strong>Single Player</strong>. Once the option has been set to Single Player, any expedition you choose to embark upon will be played solo.</p>

<p>While it is definitely possible to play Elden Ring Nightreign by yourself,<strong> should you do so</strong>? In terms of incentives, the game provides none, as the experience has been clearly balanced around co-op, so by playing solo, you will still have to handle a massive number of enemies, even during select boss battles, with only lower hit point values than in co-op mode. As such, playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo can often end up being a frustrating experience, and should be considered as an option only if you want to practice against bosses, find optimal strategies and prepare for multiplayer sessions. Completing certain Remembrances episodes can be faster in solo mode as well. So, if you want to truly experience the game at its best, you will have to team up with others.</p>

            <p>A sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> trope I quite enjoy is arboretums that provide oxygen to ships or structures, both because it's a nifty (<a href="https://www.rbg.ca/botanicult-fiction-plants-in-space-fact-or-fiction/">if spurious?</a>) idea, and because I like the concept of people who've only seen iron bulkheads for months staring wistfully at small trees.

<p>This one's a single-player bad place explorer 'em up where you play as a stranded astronaut, squirreling away supplies and making shelters for periodic life support shorts, crafting weapons, and traversing dangerous junglefied environs, while also trying to keep your morale up. Among the game's features is a novel 'asphyxiation or treats' system, where you'll pry open sealed doors, not knowing if there's valuable supplies or just a horrible bit of space on the other side. More features! More!</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Cut through jungle corridors in search of crafting supplies, exotic weapons, and rare decorations.</li>
<li>Pry open long sealed bulkhead doors — just pray the void of interstellar space isn’t waiting for you on the other side.</li>
<li>Patch up rotted spacesuits, lead lined radiation gear, and other protective garments to traverse dangerous new areas.</li>
<li>Stockpile for the next cold snap; life support is on the fritz after centuries of neglect, and you can never be sure when it might fail… for days or even months at a time.</li>
<li>The jungle is alive, and extremely hostile. Will you chance a run through the serrated tendrils of crawling plant life, or barricade up and hide somewhere safe?</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Dev team Manzanita Interactive have roots in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-zomboid">Project Zomboid</a> modding community, and they say they've carried this spirit of customisation forward. As such, the game will ship with a custom map editor and its Lua API. "A game made by modders, for modders, from modders". I might have added that last bit. Release date is still TBA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-what-do-you-get-for-defeating-the-fell-omen-in-the-tutorial/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In true FromSoftware fashion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> features a challenging boss battle against a familiar face from the original game in the tutorial that is meant to be lost, which delivers a straightforward message: the game is challenging. While this first fight against the Fell Omen can be difficult, it can be won using a relatively simple strategy, and you will also get a nice reward for your effort.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529133512_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As the tutorial features a set number of enemies and specific equipment, putting together a <strong>winning strategy is much easier than in the actual <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> experience</strong>. Make sure to defeat every enemy you encounter as you proceed and open every treasure chest. By doing so, you can get to level 6 and have the Cold Katar and Rogier's Rapier Armaments in your possession. Equip both of them to use the powerful <strong>Hoarfrost Stump</strong> skill and activate the <strong>Multiple Periodical Glintblades</strong> passive.</p>
<p>With these Armaments equipped, head over to the ruins where the Fell Omen awaits, <strong>bring the Duchess back to life</strong> as prompted, and wait for the enemy to appear. When it does, keep your distance, let the Duchess hold his attention, and <strong>use Hoarfrost Stump or attack repeatedly with the Cold Katar after he uses any hammer attacks to inflict frostbite</strong>. Once you have accomplished this, keep your distance and attack only after the boss uses hammer attacks, letting the Continual Glintblades deal some nice burst damage without doing anything else. If the Duchess dies, use the <strong>Wylder's Ultimate Art</strong> to bring her back instantly. Try as much as you can to defeat the boss without dying, as you won't have the Duchess' help during your second and final try, making everything much more challenging.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529133752_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After defeating the Fell Omen, sit in the chair to end the tutorial and begin the proper Elden Ring Nightreign experience. As you awaken in the Roundtable Hold, you will be informed of having been gifted the Fell Omen Fetish relic, which boosts your attack power when you switch weapons, improves throwing knife damage, and increases Vigor by 1. If you have not defeated the Fell Omen on your first try, you can<strong>&nbsp;replay through the tutorial</strong> by accessing the Visual Codex, selecting Guide, and pressing the Square/ X button.</p>

			<p>Though rooted deeply into the hardcore action-RPG mechanics made popular by the Souls series, Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different sort of experience from what FromSoftware usually offers in its games. With a focus on co-op play and a time limit, playing the new game from the Japanese studio can feel overwhelming for those more used to the slower pace of typical soulslike.</p>
<p>To help you better understand the unique take on the Soulslike mechanics featured in Elden Ring Nightreign, and to start having fun just a few Expeditions in, here are a few tips that will be helpful as you run from one side of the other of Limveld, trying to stay one step ahead of the Night.</p>
<h2>1 - Plan For the Whole Game</h2>
<p>With the first two in-game days lasting only 15 minutes, you must upgrade your character as quickly as possible in Elden Ring Nightreign. As such, you will want to start planning what to do right from the start of a game. While the spectral hawk is carrying you to Limveld, open up the map and locate the most critical upgrades to have an easier time later in the game, and plan around their locations. Flask charges, situated inside the churches with a gold outline, are a must for survivability, so grab them as quickly as possible, possibly clearing a few other locations along the way to level up and get your first few upgrades. If you can, prioritize locations on the edges of the map, as there's a good chance they will no longer be available for the day once the Night approaches.</p>
<h2>2 - Level Up As Much as You Can</h2>
<p>While it can be tempting to explore an enemy camp or an enemy stronghold near your landing point at the start of the game, it's not a very good idea to head into them at a low level. Look around your starting location, find some mobs, and take them down to get some runes and level up to at least level 3 to have a much easier time. In Elden Ring Nightreign, character level matters a lot, as it not only increases stats but also allows your Nightfarer to wield weapons of higher rarity, so you will want to make some quick preparations before heading into any location guarded by bosses. Dying will also make you waste time, which you don't have a lot of in the game.</p>
<h2>3 - Ignore Mobs</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250520003440_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Killing mobs at the start of a game in Elden Ring Nightreign is the way to go to level up enough to handle bosses, but after reaching level 3, it's almost always a good idea to ignore all those mobs that aren't getting in the way. After a certain point, the runes you get from defeating them are not worth the time you need to dispose of them, which could be used to take down bosses, which give plenty of runes and offer you one between three different upgrades, which may be more crucial to defeating a Nightlord than runes to level up. This holds even more true when going through the Castle in the center of Limveld. This location is filled with enemies that reward Nightfarers with upgrades, so ignore the mobs to get to them as quickly as possible to reap some beneficial rewards.</p>
<h2>4 - Get a Ranged Combat Option</h2>
<p>By pressing the Triangle or Y button with the map open, you will be able to get more information on the upgrades that can be obtained in each location in Limveld, and you will be surprised by how many bows and ranged weapons can be found. There's a good reason for this: ranged combat options work great in Elden Ring Nightreign, as you have infinite ammo and can spam attack from a safe distance. Having to resort to healing as little as possible, taking out enemies from afar is extremely important, so make sure to get a ranged attack option for your character, no matter how good they may be at using it. The same goes for all magic spells, as they can make your life significantly easier under certain conditions. Most Nightlords don't leave themselves open too often, so having a ranged attack option is a great help against these powerful enemies as well.</p>
<h2>5 - Don't Go Off on Your Own</h2>
<p>Going off alone in Elden Ring Nightreign can be tempting, especially if you have uncollaborative companions, but doing so is never a good idea. Always stick together with your fellow Nightfarers, as there's nothing that you can do by yourself that can help the team as a whole. For example, you may defeat some bosses by yourself, but your companions will not receive upgrades automatically, only runes, rendering your efforts almost useless, in the grand scheme of things. With more experienced Nightfarers and excellent team coordination, spreading out may be a viable strategy to take down multiple bosses and rush from one location to the next picking upgrades, but this requires a lot of game knowledge as well, which you will obviously lack at the start of your adventure in Limveld.</p>

This makes for a fast-paced game focused on combat and exploration that's easy to set up and learn, but still offers much of the customization, continuity, and replayability of pen-and-paper RPGs.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">The game originally launched in 1989 and was out of print for several years until it returned with the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HeroQuest-Tabletop-Immersive-Fantasy-Adventure/dp/B08Q4J1XHZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HeroQuest Game System (2nd Edition)</a></strong>, thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign. You can pick up a copy for $91.60 at Amazon, which is very close to the lowest price this year. Though the retailer briefly sold it for under $50 in early 2024, the price has trended up ever since--it hasn't dropped below $85 since Black Friday. The price has bounced between $90 and $110 throughout 2025 (so far). HeroQuest's MSRP is $135.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a cheaper path to accessing the new expansion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-and-marvels-collaboration-remains-strong-after-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-committed-to-making-three-games-based-on-marvel-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We learned yesterday that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">EA had canceled its Black Panther game and shut down the team that was working on it, Cliffhanger Studios</a>. This immediately put into question the status of EA's other Marvel-based projects, like Motive Studios' Iron Man game.</p>
<p>However, according to statements from Marvel and EA that were sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-still-making-at-least-3-marvel-games-even-after-black-panther-cancellation">IGN</a>, the collaboration between the two companies "<em>remains strong,</em>" and EA is still committed to making three games based on Marvel characters, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-marvel-games-partner-3-new-action-adventure-games/">previously agreed to in 2022.</a></p>
<p>Originally, the three games would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">EA Motive's Iron Man game</a>, Cliffhanger's Black Panther game, and a third unannounced title. The Iron Man game is still in development, and, as far as we know right now, is still planned to be released.</p>
<p>"<em>Our partnership with Marvel remains strong and our multi-title, long-term collaboration continues,</em>" said EA Entertainment president Laura Miele in a statement.</p>
<p>For Marvel's part, a spokesperson for the company said, "<em>The multi-title, long-term relationship between Marvel Games and EA, a creative collaboration focused on original storytelling with various, beloved Marvel characters, remains strong. Development of our console and PC titles, beginning with Marvel's Iron Man, is led by Motive Studios</em>."</p>
<p>So after the Iron Man game, it sounds like, at least for now, Motive Studios is on the hook for two more games based on a Marvel character. Whether we actually get those games is another question. If the Iron Man game flops, it wouldn't be surprising if the other projects are canceled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">Marvel's Avengers</a> definitively proved that putting big-name comic book characters in a video game does not guarantee success in today's MCU-led market.</p>
<p>But that's the less likely scenario, since Motive has an incredibly talented team and there are no signs that it will try to mash a bunch of unwanted live service-focused features into its <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">single-player</a> Iron Man game.</p>
<p>Which seemingly puts Motive Studios in a similar position to Respawn, with both studios locked into making three games based on Disney-owned franchises. Once the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">third Star Wars Jedi</a> title from Respawn and the third Marvel game from Motive are out, EA might finally move entirely away from making games based on licensed series, as chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">Andrew Wilson talked about</a>. Sorry to all <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront III</a> hopefuls.</p>

Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Scuf is adding drift-resistant Hall effect sticks to updated versions of its wireless Envision and Reflex controllers. The revised models include the $149.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/pc-controllers/scuf-envision-pro-steel-grey-he">Envision</a> and $199.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/pc-controllers/scuf-envision-pro-steel-grey-he">Envision Pro</a> for PC as well as the $249.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/playstation5/scuf-reflex-base-black">Reflex Pro</a> and $279.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/playstation5/scuf-reflex-fps-steelgray">Reflex FPS</a> for PlayStation 5 and PC. Those are all starting prices, of course, as the Corsair-owned brand offers a wide variety of customization options that can take each model to even higher prices.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">Hall effect</a> upgrade brings Scuf’s wireless offerings in line with its wired-only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/616019/scuf-valor-pro-hands-on-impressions-wired-xbox-controller">Valor Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price">Nomad</a> mobile controllers, replacing the original Reflex and Envision pads that first debuted in 2021 and 2023, respectively.</p><p>Scuf is getting with the program on Hall effect sticks at a time when the magnetic, drift-resistant sensing option has become commonplace in other brands like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo</a>, Razer, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911052/gamesir-t4-cyclone-pro-wireless-controller-hall-effect-joysticks">GameSir</a>, but hasn’t appeared in controllers from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">Nintendo</a>, Sony, or Microsoft yet. But some controller makers are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">already moving on</a> to a more power-efficient drift-resistant technology: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR sticks</a>.</p><p>Scuf controllers may be even pricier than premium controller options from Microsoft and Sony like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>, but in my experience they’re nice for those willing to spend the money. They’re some of the few native wireless options for Xbox Series X / S and PS5, and Scuf’s rear paddles and clicky hair-trigger options are some of the best feeling “pro” upgrades around. The lack of drift resistant sticks has made it a little more challenging to recommend them, though. Take, for example, our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s">Xbox controller buying guide</a> where the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s#:~:text=A%20formidable%20alternative%20to%20the%20Elite">Razer Wolverine Pro V3</a> knocked off the Scuf Instinct Pro I used to personally love.</p><p>Better late than never, Scuf.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While you can play Nightreign as a solo player, the game is focused on pairing you with two other players for you all to fight and explore together. Fortunately, both the single-player and multiplayer functions in Elden Ring Nightreign are easy to use, allowing you to minimize your time between expeditions into the Living Lands.</p><p>Below, we'll show you everything you need to know about how to start expeditions and how to set up both single-player and co-op multiplayer runs in Elden Ring Nightreign, as well as the lack of proper cross-play support.</p><h2 id="How_to_start_expeditions_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to start expeditions in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First and foremost, let's go over how to actually get into expeditions once you're past the tutorial of the game that occurs within the first 10 or so minutes.</p><p>After the tutorial, you'll find yourself at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">Roundtable Hold</a>, a familiar location for Elden Ring fans. At the Roundtable Hold, you can interact with a variety of NPCs, but the main area you'll spend the majority of your time in is right in the center at the table itself. When you approach the central table, you'll get a prompt to "Commence Expedition," which you want to press.</p><p>When you choose to commence an expedition, the boss menu in Nightreign will appear on your screen. This lists all the current bosses you can hunt down in the game, providing a brief background on each one so you know what you're up against. Before you choose a boss, though, you want to tab over to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-matchmaking-psa-guide/1100-6531878/" data-ref-id="1100-6531878">Matchmaking</a> Settings by using the bumpers on your controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498397"></a><figcaption>Starting an expedition with the first boss in Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png"></figure><p>On the Matchmaking Settings menu, you're able to invite members to your party, create a password for your friends to use and join your group, and even change your Expedition Type to switch between single-player and multiplayer.</p><h2 id="How_to_play_solo_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to play solo in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First up, if you want to play solo in Elden Ring Nightreign, all you have to do is change the Expedition Type from the default "multiplayer" to "singleplayer." These are your only two options, so switching the type once will do the trick.</p><p>Once you have switched your Expedition Type, you can head into the boss menu, select your boss, and then commence a solo expedition. As a note, you'll default to the class that you currently have equipped in the Roundtable Hold, as you have no teammates to go through the class selection screen with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498400"></a><figcaption>Going through Nightreign in a party of one</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png"></figure><p>Other than that, everything is the exact same as it is in the multiplayer expeditions. You can do the same things, fight the same enemies, and try to defeat all of the bosses to eventually reach the final boss. Of course, as a solo player, this is incredibly hard, and once you die a single time, you're dead for good since you can't be revived.</p><h2 id="How_to_play_multiplayer_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to play multiplayer in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now, let's get into playing Elden Ring Nightreign the way the developers intended. By default, your Expedition Type is set to multiplayer, so if you want to play with two random players, all you have to do is commence an expedition, pick your boss, and then the game will take care of the rest. You'll be automatically matched with two other real players, and then the character selection screen will appear.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401"></a><figcaption>The tutorial box for setting up team expeditions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png"></figure><p>Only one person can select any particular class, so if a player gets to your favorite class, you need to have a backup or two. Once the characters have been chosen, all three of you will drop onto a map together, and you can start playing from there. There's no limit to staying near your teammates, so feel free to do whatever you think is best. However, you'll eventually wind up with your teammates at the end of the day as the zone encroaches around the map.</p><p>On the flip side, if you want to play with your friends instead of random players, you can do that from the Matchmaking Settings menu as well. All you have to do is select the "Invite Members" option from the menu, which brings up a list of your online friends from your platform. If you invite players, they become members of your party, and you can all hop into an expedition when everyone has readied up. As a note, <strong>if some players haven't progressed to your point in the game, they'll still be able to play, but could experience content they haven't seen yet</strong>.</p><p>To bypass the inviting and joining process, you can also set a multiplayer password. This allows you to matchmake with players using the same password as you, which gives you the chance to play with people that you're not friends with on your platform. You can choose to set the number of players with the password who can join, with a maximum of three players, which fills out the entire party. If you select one or two players, then the remaining spots will be filled with random players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402"></a><figcaption>Setting a multiplayer password for others to join off</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png"></figure><p>Finally, you can also set up to five group passwords. These passwords are so you can more easily see bloodstains, phantoms, and victor records from others who are using the same password. Of course, setting up five passwords takes some coordination if you're planning to use them across a large friend group, so make sure all of your friends are using the exact passwords.</p><h2 id="Does_Elden_Ring_Nightreign_support_cross_play_">Does Elden Ring Nightreign support cross-play?</h2><p>Now that you understand how multiplayer expeditions work, you might be wondering if you're able to party up with your friends or other players who are on a different system. Unfortunately, Elden Ring Nightreign does not support cross-play at launch, meaning that you can only matchmake with players who are on the same system as you.</p><p>However, there is one caveat to that rule. Nightreign does support cross-generation play, which means you can party up with friends and players who are using the same console brand as you. For example, if you're on Xbox Series X|S, a friend on Xbox One can still matchmake with you for an expedition. The same goes for players on PlayStation 4 and 5.</p><p>So, while the game doesn't offer full cross-play, there is a silver lining for those who have a friend group with some mismatched last-generation and current-generation consoles.</p><p>And that just about does it for all of the ways to set up an expedition in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>

She's a magic specialist with no way to regularly cast magic, an arcane character who doesn't handle dexterity-scaling weapons like katanas well, and a summons character who can, in the right circumstances, carry your team in close combat. There's a lot to contend with when you're using the Revenant, though with some careful selection, you can make her a potent fighter even without the ideal build.</p><p dir="ltr">Our Elden Ring Nightreign Revenant guide explains how to unlock the Revenant, how her abilities work, and which weapons and magic you should try to find for her.

The actual timing seems random, but if you keep completing expeditions--solo or in multiplayer, ending in success or failure--she'll eventually turn up in Roundtable Hold. Check the map after each expedition. When you see an exclamation mark outside the main hall, that'll be the Revenant.</p><p dir="ltr">Before you speak to the Revenant in the hold, change your active character to someone who isn't the Recluse. Speak with her when you're ready, and you'll end up in a spectral realm amidst some ruins. The Revenant is there with all her summons, and she challenges you to a fight. You only need to defeat her, though given the intensity of the attacks from her swordswoman and Pumpkin Head summons, you'll likely have to deal with at least one of them before you can safely attack the Revenant. Meanwhile, she'll be hurling Discus of Light spells at you, and her Giant Skeleton summon casts its beam of ghostflame.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502154-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502154" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502154-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502154"></a><figcaption>Take out the Pumpkin Head and swordfighter before targeting the Revenant.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502154-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Playing as the Raider or Executor is the easiest way to handle these obstacles, since both have high damage output and powerful ultimate arts.

She starts with a set of claws that has a higher-than-average chance of landing critical hits, but they're a close-range weapon. The Revenant also has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-more-healing-flask-charges-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531698/" data-ref-id="1100-6531698">healing</a> Incantation--though no built-in way to recover FP, so use it sparingly.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Necromancy"><strong>Necromancy</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">The spirits of non-boss enemies that the Revenant defeats join her in combat</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Summon_Spirit"><strong>Summon Spirit</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><p>The Revenant can summon one of three spirits at any time and dismiss them to summon another.

Unlike Helen and Frederick, Sebastian moves around very little, which means he's an easy target for fast-moving, hard-hitting enemies. He also struggles to keep up with bosses who move, so you have to re-summon him just to get him in attack range.</p><p dir="ltr">Frederick is the perfect middle ground when dealing with bosses, as he's mobile like Helen and has high damage output. Helen is decent at keeping bosses distracted, though she typically never lasts long enough to make a difference against more challenging enemies.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons__magic__and_Incantations_for_Revenant">Best weapons, magic, and Incantations for Revenant</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502162-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502162" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502162-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502162"></a><figcaption>You won't always find magic drops this good, but even just one decent spell helps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502162-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Revenant scales well with faith, and arcane and intelligence--aka sorcery--are close seconds. Everything else is a bit of a bust, which puts her in an odd situation. The Revenant can get by fine with a strength- or dexterity-based weapon, but the results are less positive than if she's playing to her strengths.</p><p dir="ltr">Nightreign has a handful of faith-scaling weapons, from the Erdtree Dagger to the excellent Sword of Night and Flame, and while the diminutive Revenant might not seem like a great choice for heavy weapons such as an axe or greatsword, her health scales high enough that you can risk using slower attacks without much harm. In an ideal situation, you'd give her something like Maliketh's Black Blade or the Grafted Dragon Head if you had very lucky item drops, though she's excellent with the Magma Whip Candlestick, Halo Scythe, and Winged Scythe as well.</p><p dir="ltr">If all else fails, just give her whatever <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-incantations-and-magic-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531836/" data-ref-id="1100-6531836">Incantations</a> and sorceries you can find and a weapon that causes blood loss. Rivers of Blood also works for her, thanks to its high arcane scaling.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Incantations, really, just use what you can get from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-incantations-and-magic-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531836/" data-ref-id="1100-6531836">magic and Incantation drop locations</a>. The Revenant has no specific requirements like the Recluse does, so whether you've stacked three variations of lightning spear or have a mix of dragon breath and fire spells, it doesn't really matter. Just make sure not to rely <em>only</em> on Incantations, since the Revenant has no built-in method of recovering FP. You'll have to use Starlit Shards or random passive buffs to restore her FP.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_relics_for_Revenant">Best relics for Revenant</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502163-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502163" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502163-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502163"></a><figcaption>The Revenant's two guaranteed Gems are among her best choices.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502163-elden-ring-nightreign-revenant-guide-7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Since the Revenant is built around Faith, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">best relics</a> for her help improve that stat.
