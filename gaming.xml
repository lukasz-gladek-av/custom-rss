            <p>I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/Daemonologie">Daemonologie</a>, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.</p>

<p>"Daemonologie is a short folk horror story influenced by the Scottish witch trials of the late 1600s," bleats the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048140/Daemonologie/">Steam page</a>. It didn’t actually bleat, to be fair, but bleating is all I can hear now. It’s a short one, apparently clocking in between 30 to 60 minutes for a single playthrough, but with secrets and other mysteries you’ll have to dig for. It’s from Katanalevy, who also made well-loved violin-em-up <a href="https://katanalevy.itch.io/symphony-of-seven-souls">Symphony of Seven Souls</a>. This one also started as an <a href="https://katanalevy.itch.io/daemonologie2020">Itch project</a>, though it looks to have come a long way in the intervening four years.</p>
<blockquote><p>Being from Edinburgh I knew of the North Berwick Witch Trials but it was really harrowing doing research for this project. There may be scenes representing torture that some people may find disturbing. I explored this largely through the sound design, which had a more visceral and emotional reaction for me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair warning, then, although I must admit "the research for this game messed my head up" just makes me want to play more. Here’s a little extra info:</p>
<blockquote><p>You play the role of a witch finder who has been summoned to the small Scottish village to uproot the witch that resides there. You must speak to the locals and sort their truths from their lies. If they are not willing to communicate then you have permission to employ further methods of persuasion.</p>
<p>At the end of each day you will experience prophetic, stop-motion style nightmares. While cryptic, they may provide you with some hidden truths.</p>
<p>It is recommended to take notes as you go as the game will not hold your hand or lead you in your investigation. The choices you make will be all yours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, this is about as in my wheelhouse as a game could be without also, somehow, containing Orcs. Spooky Month also being Orctober is a dissonant, though glorious, time, I tell you. Daemonologie is out today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Throwback turn-based RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-stars">Sea Of Stars</a> will get the free update that adds a local co-op mode next month, letting up to three players waddle through the game's story side by side (by side). The update will also include commonly requested features, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1244090/view/4668633908445699437?snr=1_5_9_">say developers Sabotage Studio</a>, like tweaks to the combat and a "revamped prologue" that'll see players able to get stuck into the action quicker. We'd previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sea-of-stars-is-adding-co-op-multiplayer-to-the-dazzling-chrono-trigger-inspired-rpg">heard about this update</a>, but now we know the actual release date.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's coming out on November 12th, said the developers <a href="https://x.com/seaofstarsgame/status/1840753624722309318">on Xitter</a>. Changes to the combat include "ways to break the spells of enemies each time a new type is encountered" and a "comprehensive balancing pass." Story-wise, there's at least one new cutscene, designed to "accentuate a pivotal moment in the original adventure". Plus a mysterious in-game relic has been added to help speedrunners. </p>
<p>But the local 3-player co-op is probably going to be the big attraction. Playing with friends makes sense for the storyline in Sea Of Stars, which is about pixellated pair Zale and Valere, childhood besties who've been trained in magic from their youngest days to become the mystical saviours of the world. No pressure. The third spot on the roster looks like it could be taken up by various other characters you meet along the way, like magicless buddy Garl or assassin girl Seraï. Or maybe you can simply choose to inhabit anyone from the party, I don't know.</p>
<p>"It might not have the deep, narrative consequences of something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>," said Katharine in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sea-of-stars-review">our review</a>, "but it moves along at a similarly decent clip, and maintains its momentum across its 30-odd hours much better than, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eastward">Eastward</a> ever did." We liked it enough to include it as one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">best JRPGs</a>.</p>
<p>This may also count as prep work for another upcoming piece of DLC, called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1244090/view/4261054972288589147">Throes Of The Watchmaker</a>, which will be free too, say the devs. It'll include a new story and a new playable character, and is due out in spring next year. It follows our two heroes as they visit a "magical miniature clockwork world threatened by a cursed carnival." Can you hear jaunty and unsettling circus music? Don't worry. That's just what the words "cursed carnival" do to the human brain. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Silent Hill: Townfall's reveal consisted of a series of unsettling images, with most of the teaser swapping between images of ocean waves in black and white (and, at the end, bright red) and a slow zoom in to a pocket CRTV, while a voice demanded to know why the listener was here.</p><p>At the time, No Code creative director Jon McKellan said Silent Hill: Townfall "respects the source material but also does something a little bit different with it."

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/listen-now-to-hans-zimmers-dragon-age-the-veilguard-main-theme</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/listen-now-to-hans-zimmers-dragon-age-the-veilguard-main-theme<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Oscar and Grammy award-winning composer Hans Zimmer has released his main theme for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which you can listen to right now just below. 
</p>
<p>
Zimmer, best known for his work on The Lion King, Gladiator, Pirates of the Caribbean and The Dark Knight, has composed only a handful of video games throughout his prolific career.
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard's score is co-composed by Lorne Balfe, a frequent collaborator of Zimmer's and the brain behind scores for a slew of films, as well as video games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> and Skylanders series.
</p>
<p>
A decade on from the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, BioWare's long-awaited follow-up finally arrives on 31st October. To get yourself in the mood, here's that main theme to listen to now:

<p>
After a couple of listens, I do like it - and it sounds fittingly Dragon Age. There are some great, malevolent brass undertones and rich fantasy grandeur in its strings. Is it as memorable as Inquisition's main theme that played out as we reached Skyhold? I'm not sure yet, but we don't have too long to wait. 
</p>
<p>
"After playing it all day, Dragon Age: The Veilguard feels like the series' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a> moment," Bertie wrote in Eurogamer's recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-playing-it-all-day-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feels-like-the-series-mass-effect-2-moment">Dragon Age: The Veilguard hands-on preview</a>. "Based on what I've played, I've absolutely no doubt The Veilguard will be an enjoyable ride. My only concern is how much of a memorable one it will be."

            <title><![CDATA[Pairs & Perils Preview – Remember to play your cards right]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/pairs-perils-preview-remember-to-play-your-cards-right/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I do like a good strategic card game, where both working out the best way forward and a bit of luck play a part in if your hand will prevail. Pairs and Perils is a roguelike dungeon crawler with a side of memory. The demo, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179860/Pairs__Perils/">available on Steam</a>, has a total of 15 rounds to get through, each having an enemy to defeat, with increasing strength and power.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pairs &amp; Parils - Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3Btn9XRazg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Pairs and Perils you need to pair up the cards on your side to deal damage to the enemy card. On your turns, you can flip two cards. If you pair a hero with their weapon, like an archer with a bow or wizard with a staff, they will deal damage to the enemy.</p>


<p>Once a correct pair is found, it will be used, and then will be moved from the table. If you flip a hero and get the wrong weapon card then no damage will be dealt, and the cards will be flipped back over. However, those are not the only cards you need to watch out for. Amongst the heroes and weapons are trap cards, which will deal damage to your own health points, and when you activate a trap card it does not disappear from the table, but returns to its original place waiting for you to forget where it is.</p>


<p>As you progress through rounds, more cards are laid out in front of you. Additionally, between rounds you can buy relic and consumable cards using the gold you have earned. Consumable cards are one time use, and can do things like restore health points, reveal trap cards, and reduce an enemy’s attack power. Relic cards are permanent cards that provide effects, like having the chance to block. Some relic cards have two effects that can provide a bonus but offsets it with a potentially negative effect for the player.</p>
<p>Enemy cards have an attack power rating and health points. They don’t attack every time you pick your own pair, but instead have a countdown before they will come at you, giving you a chance to deal damage and figure out where your cards are placed. Some enemy cards have special abilities, including the chance to steal gold from you and silencing you so you cannot use the consumable cards. These regular challenges show an early promise of Pairs &amp; Perils providing an evolving gameplay experience, though that will be dependent on the other cards that will be in the full version on both the relics side and enemy side.</p>

<p>The general style of the game is pleasingly minimal.&nbsp;In the centre of the screen is the table top with your cards, on the left your health points, the room number to say how far you have progressed, the amount of gold you have, the relic cards you have equipped. On the right is the pile of enemy cards, showing how many you need to get through, and the consumables you have. Using consumables is as simple as clicking on them and selecting the use option. You also have the option to sell your card, but the value is half of what you paid for it.</p>
<p>Pairs and Perils is shaping up to be a very fun card-based dungeon crawler, though that will depend on how many cards will be in the final version. It will also be impacted by how much variety there will be with hero cards, because while they do have different designs and weapons the effect is the same across them. Having hero specific abilities could really help with adding depth to some strategy. We look forward to seeing how this game grows on the run up to release.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill Townfall</a> is one of several projects based on KONAMI's premiere horror franchise&nbsp;<span>announced at the Silent Hill Transmission presentation in October 2022, alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake (due to be released in just a few days) and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-announced-60s-japan-higurashi-ryukishi07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill F</a></span>.</p>
<p>After that brief teaser, Silent Hill Townfall Creative Director Jon McKellan from No Code (the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/observation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Observation</a>) shared a message with the community:</p>
<p><em>I remember playing the original Silent Hill on PlayStation 1 back in 1999 and became a fan from that moment on. So, for us to work on this game with our friends at Annapurna feels like an actual dream come true. It's a real honor for us to bring a new title to this series that both respects the source material but also does something a little bit different with it. To say that Silent Hill has been an inspiration to No Code would be a massive understatement. Our previous two games, Stories Untold and Observation, both played with that same deep psychological horror, and at No Code, we are all about weaving that narrative and that experience into every aspect of our game design, our audio, our visuals, even our UI.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>McKellan also teased that fans would see more of the project in 2023, which hasn't really happened. Furthermore, following Annapurna Interactive's major woes (the entire team recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/stray-publisher-annapurna-interactive-entire-team-has-reportedly-resigned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned</a>), many questions were raised about the game's status. Thankfully, a few hours ago, the Twitter(X) accounts of No Code and Annapurna Interactive <a href="https://x.com/_NoCode/status/1840911139225403454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a reassuring message with the community:</p>
<p><em>We deeply apologize for any concerns about SILENT HILL: Townfall. SILENT HILL: Townfall will continue to be co-developed by KONAMI, Annapurna Interactive, and No Code.</em></p>
<p>The game is alive and well, then, even though we don't know when it will be unveiled to the public. Still, stay tuned on Wccftech and we'll keep you abreast of any rumors, leaks, and official news about this and any other Silent Hill project.</p>

Basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal has teased that he's joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> during a sweary DJ set you can watch a clip of on TikTok. 
</p>
<p>
Shaq, who's partial to spinning the decks under the alias of DJ Diesel, posted a clip of his latest set to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shaq/video/7420143472214297902?lang=en">TikTok</a> last night. At one point, screens at the venue in Toronto, Canada showed brief clips of Shaq's in-game Fortnite model, as a tease for the skin before its official unveiling. 
</p>
<p>
The video's post was captioned: "Toronto... last night was EPIC ;)", pointing to the star's apparent collaboration with Fortnite maker Epic Games.

            <p>Last week, Ubisoft announced they’d be delaying open world Tsushima-like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until 2025, citing concerns over a "softer than expected launch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>" in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/25/2953181/0/en/Ubisoft-updates-its-financial-targets-for-FY2024-25.html">financial targets update</a>. A new report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/">Insider Gaming</a>’s Tom Henderson has shed a little more light on the situation after talking to several developers on the project, who say they’ve been pushing for a delay "for some time", only for higher-ups at Ubi to just now take heed.</p>

<p>"While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title," read last week’s statement. "This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles." Ubisoft also announced they’d be dropping the odious play-early season pass model, and releasing the game day-one on Steam rather than keeping it captive behind the (dogshit, very dogshit, unbelievably dogshit) Ubisoft Connect launcher.</p>
<p>Both Ubisoft’s claims of the game needing more time in the oven, and of taking lessons from Outlaws’ release - the game has apparently shifted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million">just 1 million copies</a> - are true to an extent, says the report. What’s new here is the revelation that, short of being the sort of humble, savvy pivot based on new information Ubisoft are framing it as, developers on the project have allegedly been pushing for the delay for a while now. Here’s how the report frames it:</p>
<blockquote><p>So why was Shadows delayed? It’s a complicated question without a single answer, but it boils down to a strict development timeline, polishing, and addressing the Japanese community’s cultural and historical accuracy concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>As to that last point, sources told Insider Gaming that "the team has been actively addressing many of the historical and cultural concerns, which started before the game’s reveal following external playtests and were accelerated further following the game’s initial reveal and mass feedback." This includes "changing some of Yasuke’s story and how he’s portrayed in the game, fixing architectural details, and ensuring that the game is historically grounded while fitting into the Assassin’s Creed universe."</p>
<p>The report also quashes rumours that protagonist Yasuke is getting removed from the game. I haven’t heard these rumours personally, but I can take a wild guess to the sort of winning individual they originated with, and their incredibly sane and normal understanding of how games are made. It’s also worth pointing out how that "mass feedback" part chimes a little disconcertingly with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda">recent statement </a>from chirpy cockney urchin Yves Guillemot in which he said that Ubi’s goal was "not to push any specific agenda". Basically, it seems Guillemot is paying a little too much heed to people arguing in the wackest of faith.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/2(1).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"As for how these issues fell through the cracks," writes Henderson, "I’m told that historical experts were brought onto the project much later than usual for a project of this magnitude and that miscommunication between teams and cutting corners when it came to the approval process of assets to meet deadlines were also at play."</p>
<p>As for that "strict development timeline", Henderson writes that "seven developers working on the project said that they have been pushing for a delay for some time, and their situation had even been heard at other studios in the company. Ultimately, though, the delay comes down to a strict development timeline and the need to address issues caused by the set timeline". Ignoring concerns raised by the actual people making the actual art that actually makes you money, right up until the point where the money is threatened? Quelle surprise, Yves. Quelle surprise.</p>
<p>Ubisoft do seem to be feeling the heat at the moment. There’s a whole investor kerfuffle occurring over share prices that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">Edwin covered here</a>, and a second quarter performance that Guillemot says fell short of expectations.</p>
<p>In most cases, I generally find delays to be wholly positive news, usually indicative of developers taking the time they need to prioritise both their art and their health. Here, though? Well, time has shown it’s likely not Guillemot and co that’ll suffer if the game still fails to meet investor expectations after the delay. From 2022 to 2024, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-laid-off-1-700-workers-on-its-path-to-its-highest-net-bookings-ever">noted Game Developer</a>, Ubisoft’s "headcount declined" by 1700 people. Most recently, they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-across-cary-and-san-francisco-teams">laid off 45 workers in August</a>.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to launch on the 14th of February, 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Rogue Factor has shared an extended look at Hell is Us, their upcoming open world Souls-y action adventure. Jonathan Jacques-Belletete – Creative Director and Art Director – guides us through around 15 minutes of gameplay of the game, coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us - Extended Gameplay Video | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Mls_B19sTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in the country of Hadea, a nation gripped by civil war, it’s a grim, wartorn setting that you’ll have to navigate with melee weapons and a nifty drone to try and defend yourself with from some seriously creepy monsters. There’s definitely some Soulslike vibes to this, but Rogue Factor shy away from that genre moniker.</p>
<p>One of the main things that Jonathan describes at the top of the video is their design ethos, aiming to get back to more freeform 90s game design without reliance on game design crutches like waypoints and detailed maps filled with quest markers. In fact, there aren’t any in the game, forcing you to explore and figure the world out more organically, listening to NPCs as much as possible. You’re also not inundated with player character dialogue for puzzle hints. You do have a tablet, though, which will collect hints and details for missions that you might want to follow.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see how that pans out for the game, as waypoints are often quite necessary (if often used a bit too liberally). At the same time, this marker-less design pemeates the Soulslike genre.</p>

<p>There’s also plenty of combat shown in the game, which aims to be “midcore” and a bit lighter than a Soulslike – a bit more third person action RPG. The drone is your main sidekick to help with crowd management and lending you a variety of tech abilities like distracting an enemy, alongside limbic skills that are leant to you by the magical melee weapon in hand.</p>
<p>It’s an intriguing blend of themes and ideas. Keep an eye out for more details as we head into 2025.</p>

            <p>

PlayStation services have been knocked offline by unknown issues affecting players across PS5 and PS4.
</p>
<p>
Sony's <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">PSN status</a> website is awash with red warnings that "some services are experiencing issues". 
</p>
<p>
Impacted services include account management, including the ability to sign in, gaming and social features including the ability to launch some games, and the PlayStation Store - including the ability to purchase, download or redeem vouchers.
</p>
<p>
"You might have difficulty signing in or creating an account for PlayStation Network," a message from Sony states. "We're working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience."

<p>
Sony is yet to acknowledge the situation further, or offer detail on when its services will resume, other than a Japanese Ask Playstation <a href="https://x.com/AskPS_JP/status/1840930118379970616">post</a> on X that acknowledges a "PlayStation Network outage" and says Sony is "currently investigating".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Sony for more.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-homescreen-is-now-filling-up-with-ugly-outdated-ads-and-promotional-art">PS5 users expressed their distaste for the appearance of promotional news items on their console dashboard</a>, advertising long-gone events, or games which users already owned. Sony since said the change was a "tech error" and would be reverted.

<p>Ironmouse, arguably the most recognisable VTuber in the world, has just smashed the all-time high Twitch subscriber record, breezing past the likes of Kai Cenat to make history. This achievement comes days after Ironmouse’s YouTube channel was taken offline because it was affiliated with another channel that was previously banned.</p>



<p>These are the loftiest heights ever reached by a VTuber, which just goes to prove that you don’t need a face to be famous.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-set-in-stone">Set in Stone</h2>



<p>Kai Cenat has already spoken about hosting another massive subathon to reclaim his crown on Twitch — and he’ll probably do it, too. Ironmouse surpassing the record is something special, though. In recent years, the concept of the VTuber has exploded, and almost every popular game on Twitch and YouTube has representation from that community.</p>



<p>Typically, VTubers will use intelligent software to track their movements and translate them into an animated persona, while others will rely on an animated avatar that moves around using pre-programmed actions. Ironmouse is at the top of the table in the VTuber world – less than a year ago, she won the Creator of the Year Award at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>When the milestone was hit, Ironmouse issued an emotional thank-you to her community:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you guys so much; thank you all very, very much. Thank you for being my community and thank you for being my rock and thank you for giving me back my life and thank you for helping me and people out there like me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course, the controversial and downright irritating creator, Adin Ross, had to spew bile about the achievement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What the f*** am I looking at? Can somebody give me hte context behind this? I saw this picture earlier, I thought it was some kind of meme. Anyone that’s role-playing as this is a f***ing grown man, or has a bitch working in some type of basement. What the f*** am I looking at, dude? </p>



<p>How did she surpass Kai in this s***? How is this possible? </p>
</blockquote>



<p>He changed his tune when he learned that the subathon was in representation of a charity, but not before his chat warned him that he was in danger of being cancelled yet again.</p>



<p>What do you think about the rise of VTubers? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Haliey ‘Hawk Tuah’ Welch is attending DreamHack Atlanta for a meet and greet session, thanks to Kick.com. Nobody is really sure why, but ticket holders will be able to meet the social media sensation who rose to fame after going viral in a video wherein she detailed what ‘drives a man crazy in bed’.</p>



<p>You can’t see me right now, but I have the flattest expression imaginable.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-okay">Okay</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the DreamHack team revealed that Haliey Welch will be attending DH Atlanta on October 5 at 16:30 EST. While she’s there, she’ll be performing a meet and greet event and promoting Paws Across America, possibly the only good thing to come out of her rise to fame.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Paws Across America is Welch’s foundation that seeks to bring ‘awareness’ to animal-focused charities across the United States.</p>



<p>Recently, Welch proved herself a gamer by talking at length about Red Dead Redemption 2, but the connection that’s linking her to DreamHack Atlanta, one of the premiere esports events in the annual calendar, is thin at best.</p>



<p>Many have shrugged their shoulders and signed this behaviour off as par for the course for Kick.com, which has built a presence based on the viral nature of controversial creators and ‘celebrities’ with questionable premises. This event will also serve as a promotional stunt for Welch’s ‘Talk Tuah’ podcast, which has become one of the most popular shows in North America.</p>



<p>We were hoping that Welch’s fame would subside pretty quickly, but people seem intent on keeping her at the top of the table. This all comes from a ten-second clip that aired on platforms like TikTok showing Welch describing her fellatio tactics, so do with that information what you will.</p>

		<p>The PlayStation Network is suffering a major server outage, knocking <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PS4 gamers offline overnight, and with no indication from Sony of when and how this will be resolved.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update 10:21AM BST</strong> – PSN has seemingly been restored, with the various <a href="https://status.playstation.com/en-us">regional</a> <a href="https://status.playstation.com/ja-jp/">status</a> pages indicating full service. The <a href="https://status.playstation.com/en-gb/">UK page still shows issues</a>, but we’re able to access games the store and more on our consoles. If issues persist for you, restarting your PS5 might help reset the connection.</em></p>


<p>The <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">PSN Service Status page</a> shows the breadth of the problem for PlayStation gamers, with account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video and the PlayStation Store all affected – PlayStation Direct is fine, though. Issues affect all platforms – “Other, PS Vita, PS3, PS4, PS5, Web” – and started at 2:21AM BST.</p>
<p>For the all-important gaming tab, it notes that “You might have difficulty launching games, apps or network features. We’re working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.”</p>


<p>Thankfully for gamers in Europe, we’ve been able to sleep through all of this, and most won’t get to play during work and school hours, however, 2:21AM for us is 9:21PM on the US East Coast, taking out online gaming for a whole evening in America.</p>
<p>Of course, you should still be able to play offline games, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, but if you wanted to hop into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>, for example, then you could have issues. If a game is in need of an update before launching, this could also throw an error WS-116522-7 – noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258989/ps5-ps4-playstation-network-down-outage-offline">The Verge</a> – or games that need to authenticate while launching can end up hanging on their opening splash screen. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7,</a> for example, throws a “Something went wrong.” with code E2-CE210610.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-tgs-news-congalala-kut-ku-newest-revealed-returning-monster-is-a-farting-pink-ape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus, more Monster Hunter reveals out of Tokyo Game Show.</h2></div><section><p>We learned a lot of new information about Monster Hunter Wilds at Tokyo Game Show 2024 during the Capcom Online Program and extended Scarlet Forest gameplay stream, including the reveal of the foul Congala and fowl Yian Kut-Ku. Both monsters are returning to the series after a long absence. Here’s a quick breakdown of everything we’ve learned with comments from the developers.</p><h3><strong>The Fanged Beast Congalala, a Farting Pink Ape</strong></h3><p>Technically, we could’ve made an educated guess that Congalala would be returning to the series thanks to the distinctly pink armor the hunter was wearing in the official Dual Blades showcase. But it was finally officially confirmed during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ3L0-Q5tHw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlet Forest gameplay stream</a>, where the developers said fans have wanted Congalala to return for quite some time. Congalala is a Fanged Beast first introduced in Monster Hunter Freedom 2 for PSP (at least in the US). </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/congalala-monster-hunter-wilds-1727741278022.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Congalala resembles a gorilla, except it has striking pink fur and a tail that’s often holding a mushroom. Its main, disgusting way of attacking is through visible farts that throw brown debris into the air and belches that change depending on the food it most recently ate. In Wilds, before a certain move, Congalala will produce a special item called “Truffle de Conga” which can be stolen and used in your own cooking. </p><p>Congalala can also cover you in a “stench” so powerful you’re unable to consume anything, including health potions. Make sure to bring Deodorant out on hunts in the Scarlet Forest which is where you’ll encounter Congalala, at least for the first time. Luckily, recovering from such a stench is simple with Monster Hunter Wilds’ new <strong>Optimal Status Recovery option in the radial menu</strong>. With this, you’ll have quick access to whatever item is needed at the moment, so you won’t have to dig through the item pouch while it’s too stinky to think. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In an interview with IGN, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda says this new feature is meant to be a quality of life improvement, but you may not find yourself using it as often as you think because the Palico will be “on it” trying to heal you. The same can be said about the <strong>Optimal Health Recovery option</strong>, which will not only use guild-issued healing items like Rations before dipping into your hard-earned stores of Potions but will use the item that will get you closest to full recovery without overdoing it. </p><h3><strong>The Bird Wyvern Yian Kut-Ku, the Original “Tutorial Monster”</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/mh-wilds-yian-kut-ku-1727741328709.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Yian Kut-Ku is the very first flying monster Hunters faced in the original Monster Hunter for PS2, and has the honor of being the first returning monster to be revealed after Rathalos.</p><p>Like Congalala, Yian Kut-Ku is also pink, and resembles a goofy-looking, scaly bird monster. While Yian Kut-Ku moves around a lot and is fairly quick, it usually trips and falls when it charges. Kut-Ku’s other main attack is fireballs, making it an early resource for Flame Sacs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Monster Hunter Wilds executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka says Yian Kut-Ku was given the honored spot of first properly revealed returning monster afer Rathalos not just because they love Yian Kut-Ku, but because he thinks it’s “a sort-of well-known, popular, and beloved monster among the fan base.” Fujioka adds, “This choice of the next reveal was something that I think showed that we love Monster Hunter just as much as you guys do, and we’re always thinking about what would be fun to bring back.” </p><p>As for why Yian Kut-Ku is being brought back for Wilds specifically, Fujioka says it would be great to see how Yian Kut-Ku appears in Wilds' pack system, where the same large monsters can appear in a group for the first time. </p><h3><strong>Customizable Seikrets</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/screenshot-2024-09-30-at-8-24-13-pm-1727742286280.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Screenshot from the TGS Capcom Live Stream</figcaption></figure></output><p>During the Scarlet Forest gameplay, we also saw the hunter riding a differently colored Seikret. The Seikret is the mount in Monster Hunter Wilds, and it was confirmed during this stream that we can customize its colors. Not much else is known about the depth of this customizability just yet! </p><p>Alongside the two monster reveals, the Scarlet Forest gameplay stream also showed a portion of a hunt with Uth Una, the Leviathan revealed during the most recent PlayStation State of Play. There were also details on how fishing in Monster Hunter Wilds will be a little more involved when reeling in a big fish.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Lastly, though unrelated to Monster Hunter Wilds specifically, there were more announcements for Monster Hunter’s 20th Anniversary, including a special Rathalos Fender Telecaster guitar. Capcom also revealed that Monster Hunter is getting special collaborations with both Transformers and Digimon. For Transformers, a Rathalos Prime Transformer figure; and for Digimon, two special V-Pets featuring  monsters from Monster Hunter as well as special fusion monsters. RathalosGremon is a fusion of Greymon and Rathalos, and ZinoGarurumon a fusion of Garurumon and Zinogre. As of now, we’re unsure if these will be officially available outside of Japan.  </p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on February 18, 2025 simultaneously for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-revealed-during-state-of-play-new-monsters-shown-in-story-trailer"><u>State of Play trailer revealed even more about Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a>, including its flagship monster and more. </p><p>For more on <u>Monster Hunter Wilds, don’t miss our hands-on preview</u> and the <u>recently revealed recommended PC specs</u>. </p><p><em>Casey DeFreitas is a deputy editor of guides at IGN and has been hunting monsters since the original.

		<p>I love this time of year. I kicked it off by watching the extremely weird horror movie <em>Demon Seed</em> over the weekend. It's always good when you can find a movie that makes you go "oh god, why did they do <em>that</em>?" You can spend decades mining a single genre and still find surprises, however horrifying! That's the good stuff.</p><p>-pk, who may show up on a <em>Nextlander </em>podcast later this week, too</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>Rob and I recorded Sports!, which you should hear tomorrow. We're getting into a rhythm of recoding subscriber-only podcasts a week in advance, but with Sports!, we want to react in the moment, which throws off that cadence a bit. It's mostly a Bears-focused discussion this week, though obviously in the larger context of being sad about a team being bad. The next episode should be about the NFL season generally, plus the WNBA playoffs. I also spent a chunk of today preparing my Shocktober 2024 list of movies!!!</li><li><strong>TUESDAY:</strong> If all goes right, I'll click publish on my Shocktober list in the morning, a mixture of new/old movies that can guide your horror watching this month! In the afternoon, we'll be returning to <em>Space Marine 2</em> as a squad.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>Another scheduling change is recording Remap Radio in the mornings on Wednesdays, because we want Remap Radio to start arriving fresh in your feeds on Friday morning, as soon as you wake up! This should mean we're delivering you podcasts at the start and end of the week with a much more regular cadence. This has taken some working behind-the-scenes and it's not the sexist change in the world, but I hope you enjoy the results.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>Sadly, our GeForce NOW streams are over. (Chances are they'll be back again later in the year, though.) But we are returning to The Wheel of UFO 50, which was such a blast with Cado and Janet last week that we gotta do it again. Also, as a special Halloween treat, I'm going to be doing weekly spooky streams on (probably) Thursday evenings. When I start these streams, though, depends on when my children fall asleep. There's also a chance I do them on a different night, so just stay tuned to our social feeds for more information them.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY: </strong>Beyond a Rob/Patrick letter series that has yet to be determined, you'll have Remap Radio hot 'n fresh. There's a chance we sneak in an extra stream, but that depends on a few scheduling things working out. Otherwise, the weekend (and drinking beer and watching horror movies) approaches! This is also normally where we'd have the next <em>Volgarr the Viking </em>stream, but the ol' scheduling issues means that we'll have to revisit that again later in October.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

The <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">official PSN Service Status page</a> confirms that “all services are up and running” now, after previously warning users that they “might have difficulty launching games, apps, or network features.” </p><p>“This problem has now been resolved,” <a href="https://x.com/askps_jp/status/1841052465619443992?s=61">said a message</a> posted by the Japanese Ask PlayStation customer support account. “We apologize to our customers for any inconvenience caused.”</p><p>The outage lasted for around eight hours, and impacted effectively every PlayStation system across “Other, PS Vita, PS3, PS4, PS5, Web.” While the problem seems largely resolved, some gamers on X are still reportedly experiencing issues with communications and connectivity features, so the fix may take some time to roll out to all users. </p><p>During the outage, players couldn’t sign in, play multiplayer games, or play single-player games that needed to connect and sign-in online first. Offline games were seemingly unaffected. On my end, attempting to launch a game previously brought up “PS5 error Code WS-116522-7,” and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/error-codes/ps5/ws-116522-7/">the associated webpage from Sony</a> tells me that “The system software is the update failed.”</p><div><p><cite>Screenshot: PSN Service Status</cite></p></div><p>Sony hasn’t announced the cause of the outage, and barely acknowledged it was even happening across its social accounts — with the only statements coming from a <a href="https://x.com/AskPS_JP/status/1840930118379970616">Japanese PlayStation support page on X</a> — leaving users and <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1840921472472399962">game developers</a> across other regions to notify each other about the servers being offline. The issue doesn’t seem like it was related to whatever bug <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258693/ps5-update-news-posts-ads-backgrounds-bug">was also messing with the home screen artwork for PS5 games</a>, which has also since been fixed.</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 1st: </strong>The outage that impacted Sony’s Playstation Network is now largely resolved.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, at the end of the path, you have to make a choice and pick between four Effigies to honor the house.</p><p>Below, you can see which Effigies to select and if they even make a difference in Starfield.</p><h2>How to walk the Serpent's Path in Starfield</h2><p>Before you can reach the Effigy selection in Starfield, you need to successfully walk the entirety of the Serpent's Path.

They go over a brief history of House Va'ruun and how its founder came to know the house's god, the Great Serpent. Along the path you stop at various checkpoints where you're offered a choice to prove your dedication to the Great Serpent.</p><p>The first checkpoint is a candle-lit memorial that details how the first followers of House Va'ruun came to be. Here, you can blow out a candle and continue on with the path. Blowing out the candle, and every subsequent choice, is optional.</p><p>The second checkpoint allows you to unburden yourself by tossing one of your possessions into a lit brazier next to another memorial. You can easily toss in a junk item to the brazier or simply leave it without unburdening yourself at all.</p><p>The third checkpoint allows you to take a leap of faith across a gap with a waterfall. The leap of faith is the easiest checkpoint to pass, as all you need to do is jump one time. However, if you truly don't want to make the leap, turn right from the memorial and take the metal stairs around the gap.</p><p>Finally, the fourth and fifth checkpoints are right next to each other. The fourth checkpoint offers you the chance to step into poisoned water right beneath a memorial, which doesn't harm you too badly and the poison status effect goes away shortly. Then, the fifth checkpoint is the most brutal, as you have to choose between sacrificing a Groat, a small rodent-like creature, or letting it live. If you sacrifice the Groat, you'll further prove your loyalty to House Va'ruun. However, you can let it live if you want by simply advancing past the Groat's area.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376365-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-13.09.28.78.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376365" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376365-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-13.09.28.78.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376365"></a><figcaption>Choosing to sacrifice the Groat in the Serpent's Path</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376365-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-13.09.28.78.png"></figure><h2>What Effigy should you pick in Starfield?</h2><p>At long last, you'll eventually arrive at the spot where you can select an Effigy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>To many, it comes as no surprise that Star Wars Outlaws has only sold 1 million copies since it launched. This game was set to be Ubisoft's biggest game, as this is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-funnels-more-money-into-star-wars-outlaws-marketing-than-any-other-game/">the game that they funneled the most time and money into</a>, but it has been a huge detriment to Ubisoft and has led to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">Ubisoft's share prices dropping to a stark low</a>. While some gamers have enjoyed this game, it has received a bunch of low scores and, as a result, has only sold a million in the month of its release. As a result of the failure of Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft has taken this as an opportunity to turn it into a learning curve for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>Considering the amount of money Ubisoft funneled into this game; they were shocked at how poorly the general audience received it. Before the game was even released, Ubisoft revealed details of their<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-season-pass/"> Season Pass roadmap</a> for Star Wars Outlaws, which, as a whole, is quite a predatory move, as only those who own it would get access to new quests and a story to complete. Upon release, the Director of Star Wars Outlaws also expressed his surprise about <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">the Metacritic score</a>, despite the score at that point not being bad and received a 76, giving it the Generally Favorable status.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has commented that the game's performance proved 'softer than expected,' and it's possible that this is why Assassin's Creed Shadows has been delayed. Since the announcement of Assassin's Creed Shadows, the game has been nothing but controversial. Some were outraged by the inaccuracy of the story in the game, as well as people from Japan urged Ubisoft to either cancel the game or reshape it due to the problematic merchandise they revealed. The merchandise was of the protagonist of the game standing on a one-legged Torii gate, of which there is only one in the entirety of Japan. This particular Torii gate is a huge piece of Japan's history, as it is a reminder of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Before the Tokyo Game Show started,<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-pulls-out-of-tokyo-game-show-cancels-press-previews-of-assassins-creed-shadows/"> Ubisoft quickly announced its self-removal</a> from the exhibition and the cancelation of the live stream. They then announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, with the game's release date being moved to February 14, 2025. The company has claimed that the delay comes after "the learning from the Star Wars Outlaws release," as developers continued to push for a delay, but was consistently ignored by those at the top.</p>
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sources have claimed</a> that the team has taken the criticism on board and is now working to address the historical and cultural concerns, which started during external playtests as well as mass feedback after the initial reveal. Yasuke's story is now being tweaked, as well as his portrayal in the game and architectural fixes. According to sources, historical experts were hired very late into the development process of Assassin's Creed Shadows, and this led to a lot of miscommunication between teams.</p>
<p>Although the game is causing uproar among fans of the franchise, the number of pre-orders is said to be solid and will continue to rise now that it has been announced to be available on Steam from the start.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/ironmouse-twitch-subscriber-record-kai-cenat-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/despite-anger-from-people-who-don%E2%80%99t-seem-to-know-what-a-vtuber-is-vtuber-ironmouse-claims-record-for-most-twitch-subscriptions-ever.996927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ironmouse-twitch-subscriber-record-kai-cenat-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every couple of years, somebody breaks Twitch’s all-time paid subscriber record. Ludwig Ahgren, now mostly on YouTube, showed the world how it's done <a href="https://kotaku.com/ludwigs-never-ending-twitch-stream-has-ended-1846682912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2021</a>, running a subathon – short for subscription marathon – in which additional subscriptions added time to a clock. He remained live for 31 days and racked up over 280,000 subscriptions. Kai Cenat, Twitch’s biggest mainstream success story of the past few years, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64811710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employed a similar formula last year</a> and moved the needle just a hair past 306,000. Today they both got beat by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/04/20/twitch-ironmouse-vtuber-subathon-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pink-haired anime girl</a>.</p><p>After 30 days of continuous streaming, one of the most popular vtubers in the world, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ironmouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ironmouse</a>, just broke Cenat’s record, with her sub count sitting at 313,000 as of this publishing. After a certain point, these numbers become immaterial – Twitch’s subscription system is extremely game-able and does not paint a <em>complete </em>picture of popularity, money-making potential, or anything, really –&nbsp; but the circumstances surrounding this one are what make it interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>First, there’s Ironmouse herself. She’s a superstar these days, but her rise to prominence was far from probable. The person behind the bubbly-looking anime avatar suffers from a chronic illness called common variable immune deficiency, or CVID, which leaves her highly susceptible to infection, as well as a lung condition. She can barely go outside and, to this day, only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVhxUX5ffE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“attends” IRL events</a> by way of a remote-controlled robot with a screen and a camera attached. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/04/20/twitch-ironmouse-vtuber-subathon-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Her first subathon</a>, which took place in 2022, helped put her on the map in part because there was no guarantee that she could last a full month, or even more than a handful of days. Against all odds, she pulled it off. It’s not an understatement to say that becoming a vtuber changed Ironmouse’s life; once isolated and bedridden, she now has community and the necessary funds to seek sufficient care for her own health.&nbsp;</p><p>If the story ended there, it would be yet another example of Western media trying to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56910392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make a heartwarming story out of tragic systemic failure</a>, but Ironmouse is at least attempting to do something with her star power: half the money raised during the current subathon will be donated to the IDF – no, no, not the bad one! In this case, that regrettable acronym stands for <a href="https://primaryimmune.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Immune Deficiency Foundation</a>, an organization for which Ironmouse and other streamers who support her have raised a staggering amount of money over the years.</p><p>So it’s for a good cause, but why here and now? This is where the game-ability of Twitch’s subscription system enters the equation. Every September, Twitch hosts an event called Subtember, in which it discounts the price of subscriptions to all streamers. This year, that actually meant basically bringing subscription prices back down to what used to be standard price after a platform-wide <a href="https://gamerant.com/twitch-price-increase-tier-1-subscription-35-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase earlier this year</a>, but a deal’s a deal. Even the human mind’s sturdiest defenses wither in the face of “25 percent off.”&nbsp;</p><p>This year, however, there’s a twist: For the final five days of Subtember, Twitch is also offering bonus gift subscriptions, meaning that if a viewer uses Twitch’s gift subscription functionality to purchase five subscriptions for other viewers in chat, Twitch will sweeten the pot with a bonus subscription. But the reality of the situation contradicts <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/subtember-2024-faq?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch’s own FAQ on the matter</a>. What seems to actually happen is that Twitch throws in <em>at least </em>one additional subscription per five – sometimes <a href="https://x.com/SailorPeachh/status/1839401008101048555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many more</a>. </p><p>Viewers have likened it to a gacha game; you put in a few subs, and you – or rather, everyone else in chat – might hit the jackpot. At this point, Twitch has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1fryn4u/comment/lpja4j4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contributed thousands</a> to Ironmouse’s total number. In line with <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other elements of the current Twitch regime</a>, it’s at least savvy marketing. A company otherwise so strapped for cash that it’s been forced to lay off <a href="https://aftermath.site/latest-twitch-layoffs-spread-teams-even-thinner-no-idea-how-folks-are-going-to-make-it-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 1,000 employees</a> is nonetheless helping a beloved streamer donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to a good cause.</p><p>While, again, the number means less than what Ironmouse is planning to do with it, that hasn’t stopped some around the Twitch community from taking issue with how she came by it. Fans of Cenat, the previous record holder, have voiced bewilderment at the idea that so many people are “<a href="https://x.com/yoxics/status/1838420025931432135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subbing to a fictional character on a screen</a>,” neglecting to understand that there is a real person behind the fictional character and, indeed, that real person’s story is an enormous part of Ironmouse’s appeal. As a result, recent discourse around Ironmouse’s record has focused on a perceived battle between fan factions – between weebs and normies, two groups not nearly so well represented on Twitch until the titans that are Ironmouse and Cenat came along.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on an admittedly cursory survey of the damage, it seems like perhaps there’s been more conversation about people objecting to Ironmouse’s big moment than actual people objecting, but these sorts of divisions are not unprecedented. During Ironmouse’s first subathon in 2022, a landmark moment for vtubers, some of the more toxic elements of Twitch’s community suggested that vtubers were playing on easy mode, that not using their real appearances somehow gave them an unfair advantage over regular streamers. However, as Ironmouse and a growing army of vtubers large and small have shown us, vtubing is extremely fertile soil for high-effort innovation. Unshackled from the bonds of physical reality, they can <a href="https://aftermath.site/shindigs-vtuber-twitch-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create games within games and blur the lines between the real and digital worlds</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Other big-name streamers, including Ahgren, have thrown their support behind Ironmouse.&nbsp;</p><p>“She's a great streamer, has one of the best stories on Twitch, and is also donating half the money raised to charity,” he <a href="https://x.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1840813338122732018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “GO IRONMOUSE!!!!”</p><p>Cenat, ever the showman, has taken to playing up more of a rivalry angle, <a href="https://x.com/KaiCenat/status/1840836631479402767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledging that the record was broken</a> but <a href="https://x.com/KaiCenat/status/1840836709228978252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggesting</a> that he’s gonna break it again.</p><p>In reality, both Ironmouse and Cenat are intensely creative; it would be hard to argue that either deserves to hold the record more than the other. Cenat does Big And Loud better than anybody, turning marathon runs through popular games into bonafide events. Even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xQbW_aJ1XY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the trailer for his <em>Elden Ring</em> playthrough</a> oozed ambition. Bringing in <a href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-kai-cenat-therapist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a “therapist” to counsel him through the expansion</a> was meta icing atop an already solid sundae. Ironmouse, meanwhile, has a backstory and lore, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdfW1wk8S4o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serious singing chops</a>. She’s also much wackier than you might initially assume. Thanks to her digital avatar, she can be whatever she wants on stream, including a worm. Now, to honor a promise she made to her community in exchange for breaking Twitch’s subscriber record, she’ll be <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1840826441132368280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attending the Streamer Awards later this year as a worm</a>, insofar as she is able.</p><p>Specifically, this worm:</p><p>If you’re angry at that worm, I don’t know what to tell you. At least find a less likable worm to be angry at.</p><p>Ironmouse is, of course, over the moon, which she and her community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ironmouse/comments/1frvin1/why_is_chat_saying_fuck_the_moon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intend to fuck</a>.</p><p>"Words cannot express how I am feeling nor can they express my gratitude," she <a href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1840838608187695267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. "Thank you all so much for the incredible support and thank you for changing my life. Thank you for being the best community in the universe. WE DREAMED BIG AND WE DID IT BROS! I LOVE YOU ALL!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With Amazon's live-action TV adaptation of Like A Dragon/Yakuza fast approaching, the streaming service has shared a first proper trailer for those wanting to get a better look at its exuberant chaos ahead of its 24th October arrival on Prime Video.
</p>
<p>
Like A Dragon: Yakuza, as the series is known, spans two different time periods - 1995 and 2005, to be exact - as it charts the life of protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, a "fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity".
</p>
<p>
"In 1995, eager to escape their restrictive lives, Kiryu and his friends, Nishiki, Yumi, and Miho plan a heist at a local arcade," explains Amazon. "However, the arcade is under the control of the Dojima Family, a powerful yakuza organisation that rules Kamurocho... Meanwhile, in 2005, Kiryu is set to be released from prison. He learns from Detective Date that his friends are in danger and decides to return to Kamurocho to protect them. However, their friendship has deteriorated, as tensions between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance are at a boiling point."

<p>
Kiryu's tale is interwoven with "dramatic stories [the games] have not been able to explore", all focusing on the "dark underworld of the yakuza" and the "universal theme of family not only through bloodline but also through ties between yakuza bosses and their underlings, orphans and their caretakers, as well as mentors and students".
</p>
<p>
For this particular live-action adaptation (a Takashi Miike-directed movie released back in 2007), Kazuma Kiryu is portrayed by actor and model Ryoma Takeuchi, with Masaharu Take on directorial duties. You can get a glimpse of what's to come in the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4tmmzh2PfA">90-second trailer</a> above.
</p>
<p>
Amazon will be hoping Like A Dragon: Yakuza sees at least some of the success enjoyed by its live-action adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> earlier this year, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">watched by 65m people</a> in its first two weeks. Like a Dragon might not be quite as immediately recognisable as the Fallout brand, but it's hardly an unknown quantity, having sold over 21.3m units worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Sega recently announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced-with-swashbuckling-trailer">next game in the long-running series</a>, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, which is exactly as delightfully bonkers as it sounds.

			<p>The<a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> first major patch</a> for FFXIV: Dawntrail is set to be released in mid-November and is titled "Crossroads." This major patch sees the introduction of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ffxvi-fix-mod-adds-ultrawide-support-fov-slider-and-unlocked-frame-rate-in-cutscenes/">Final Fantasy XI</a> crossover Alliance Raid, "Echoes of Vana'diel," which was showcased in a broadcast at the Tokyo Game Show. In this broadcast, Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida highlighted a number of features that will be released in the Patch 7.1, which also includes the continuation of the MSQ (Main Scenario Quest), as well as the first part of the long-awaited Final Fantasy XI crossover, which includes the Alliance Raid series, new Allied Society quests and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="ファイナルファンタジーXIV 『第83回FFXIVプロデューサーレターLIVE』" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hf79RkD_bG8?start=594&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Patch 7.1 of FFXIV: Dawntrail will include the 24-player Alliance Raid Echoes of Vana'Diel, which begins the Alliance Raid series that transports players to a new world named Vana'Diel. The Patch 7.1 also adds a lot of different difficult content, such as the first-ever high-difficulty Alliance Raid to be added to the game, where players will be able to take on The Cloud of Darkness on Chaotic difficulty.</p>
<p>In addition to the Chaotic Alliance Raid, new quests will also be added in the MSQ and the new Dungeon titled Yuweyawata Field Station. Players will also get to experience the new Trial named The Minstrel's Ballad: Sphene's Burden, as well as the new Unreal Trial, named The Jade Stoa, where players will be able to face off against Byakko, who is one of the Four Lords.</p>
<p>This is a huge patch for FFXIV: Dawntrail, as there is also the new Ultimate Raid named Futures Rewritten, as well as the addition of new Allied Society quests where players will be able to assist the Pelupelu, with the quests being focused on battle classes and jobs. In the same vein, there is a new Custom Delivery client named Nitowikwe, as well as an additional role quest story becoming available once all Dawntrail role quests are complete. Once that is done, players will gain access to the Wachumeqimeqi story. Finally, out of the new content, there is now even more Hildibrand content for players to get stuck into.</p>
<p>As well as the ton of new content being added to the game, there is now New Game+ support for Patch 7.0, allowing players to replay the MSQ, job quests and role quests. FFXIV has more than 30 million total registered players, and the game continues to be updated regularly, adding new content and making the game more accessible for newcomers who choose to play solo or with friends.</p>

The images they saw featured promotions for long-expired discounts and ads for new games. </p><p>People lamented the change in forums and on social media, saying the game art that previously showed up when they highlighted a game was gone. Instead, the image that would ordinarily show up as a news post in a separate section of the PS5 UI was splashed across the screen behind games like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/lpnejzv/"><em>Miles Morales</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/lpn5zxk/"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/lpnom6m/"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a>.</p><p>In a since-deleted post, Daniel Hiatt, product lead for Game Hub and Activity Suggestions with PlayStation, wrote Monday afternoon that the change was a “(new) bug with an existing feature.” Then, by 6PM ET, those game pages are back to normal, as we confirmed on our own PS5s. The @AskPlayStation account on X <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1840874460099784888">confirmed the fix</a>, saying:</p><div><blockquote><p>A tech error with the Official News feature on the PS5 console has since been resolved. There have been no changes to the way game news is displayed on PS5.</p></blockquote></div><div><figcaption><em>Hiatt’s now-deleted post.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: X</cite></p></div><p>One <em>Verge</em> staffer shared some screenshots of the temporary new look while it was active, like the one below highlighting a launch discount for <em>Animal Well </em>that ended&nbsp;months ago (the game came out in May. We <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">reviewed it</a>!). </p><div><figcaption><em>An example of the bug from a </em>Verge<em> staffer’s PS5.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: PlayStation 5 dashboard</cite></p></div><p>There are whole threads devoted to the change on both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1frfzd3/ads_in_the_home_menu/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/newest-ps5-update-replaces-game-backgrounds-audio-in-the-dashboard-with-ads-no-way-to-disable-it-up-its-a-bug-see-threadmarks.995922/">Resetera</a>, but now that it’s reverted, people will have to go back to debating the PS5 Pro, review scores, and why <em>Concord </em>failed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the quick explanation is that earlier this month a zoo in  Si Racha, Thailand posted some images of Moo Deng on Facebook and she quickly became a viral sensation. The zoo has had to implement time limits on viewing and installed cameras to watch out for fans harassing the tiny hippo. And now it seems a lot of people want their very own digital Moo Deng in <em>FF14</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/you-cant-keep-moo-deng-for-yourself-so-final-fantasy-14-players-are-swarming-the-mmos-hippo-calf-minion-instead-and-even-square-enix-has-caught-the-fever/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/you-cant-keep-moo-deng-for-yourself-so-final-fantasy-14-players-are-swarming-the-mmos-hippo-calf-minion-instead-and-even-square-enix-has-caught-the-fever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As first reported by <em>GamesRadar</em></a></span>, in-game prices for <em>FF14</em>'s Hippo Calf minion have increased dramatically since Moo Deng became an internet star. On September 24, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/cerulean_ffxiv/status/1838471276706566477/photo/2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/cerulean_ffxiv/status/1838471276706566477/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone posted the prices of Moo Deng on one server in <em>FF14</em></a></span>. Before Moo Deng went viral, you could grab a Hippo Calf for around 30,000 Gil. Not too expensive. Now, you’ll have to pay nearly 300,000 Gil for a calf. </p><p>One thing that likely contributed to the calf’s rising prices was a tweet from the official<em> Final Fantasy 14 </em>Twitter account. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1837552460325687399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1837552460325687399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On September 21</a></span>, the official game account tweeted an image of the calf with the caption: “Unbothered. Moisturized. Happy. In My Lane. Focused. Flourishing.” The tweet also contained a short clip of the Hippo Calf opening its mouth and being splashed with water, which is classic Moo Deng behavior. So it was obviously a nod to the famous hippo and likely led to even more players hopping into <em>FF14 </em>to buy the minion. </p><p>Of course, if you check your server’s prices, you might not see such high price tags as they can vary from server to server.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/the-moo-deng-frenzy-has-officially-reached-final-fantasy-14-seemingly-causing-the-price-of-its-adorable-hippo-minion-to-skyrocket/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/the-moo-deng-frenzy-has-officially-reached-final-fantasy-14-seemingly-causing-the-price-of-its-adorable-hippo-minion-to-skyrocket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Still, as <em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a></span>, in general, the price of the hippo in <em>FF14 </em>is up compared to other minions. </p><p>If you don’t want to buy a Hippo Calf pet, you can grind the level 84 <em>Endwalker</em> expansion dungeon Vanaspati. However, keep in mind it’s a random drop so you might have to run it a few times. Good luck. And if you do find one, you might be better off selling it for a few hundred thousand Gil while the internet is still obsessed with Moo Deng.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
