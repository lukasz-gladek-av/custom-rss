<figure data-uuid="27deebf30322b"><a title="Persona 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27deebf30322b/persona-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/persona_5">Persona 5</a> originally released in Japan in September 2016, which means it's been nearly a <em>decade</em> since the latest mainline entry first hit shelves. Fans are exceptionally eager to see what <strong>'Persona 6'</strong> might look like, and according to a brief tease from the franchise's <a href="https://asia.sega.com/p30th/en/">30th anniversary website</a>, we might not be waiting too much longer to get our first glimpse.</p>
<p>As covered by our pals over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/persona-anniversary-site-mentions-next-chapter-for-the-series">Push Square</a>, the Google link to the 30th Anniversary website includes a short snippet of information that reads: "Come celebrate the journey as we usher in the next chapter for the series."</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that this could be referring to the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a> which, at the time of writing, has not yet been confirmed for the Switch 2. That seems a little odd though, right? To us, "the next chapter" is more likely a reference to the inevitable brand-new game which, unless something drastic happens, is likely to be called Persona 6.</p>
<p>But still, we're not going to get <em>too</em> excited for the time being. It's a really small piece of information and we think it would be a remarkable coincidence if a Google description was our first official indication of Persona 6.</p>
<p>Atlus will no doubt have much more to say as we work our way through 2026, so we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

It's got 2,050 pieces and some fun details, like electrical energy between Pikachu and the Poke Ball, as well as a "25" on its base to signify the iconic mouse's Pokedex number.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Icarus </em>creator Dean Hall has revealed that his game, which was released four years ago, received a huge sales boost from the recent Steam Winter Sale, and for that matter, so did its DLC.</p><p>Speaking on social media platform <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">X</a>, Hall revealed earlier today that <em>Icarus </em>clocked up just shy of a million base game sales during the Steam sale, and that RocketWerkz also managed to sell just under a quarter of a million "DLC units".</p><p>As a quick reminder, <em>Icarus </em>was on offer at a pretty hefty discount during the sale; while the game would usually set you back $35 (as, indeed, it would if you picked it up now), buying it during the Steam winter sale would have cost you just $3.50.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Icarus </em>racked up a pretty healthy sales total during the Steam winter sale.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are several DLC packs available for <em>Icarus</em>, including three major expansions and a number of smaller additions to the game. Hall doesn't break down which of the packs were most popular during the sale, unfortunately.</p><p>Still, given the fact that <em>Icarus </em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-release-date-takes-flight-this-december" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f3f90dad-acfd-4ecf-81f3-78c72b65f1bb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">entering its fifth year</a>, getting a million-sale boost, however deep the discount may be, is a pretty impressive feat. There's clearly still an appetite for Hall's particular brand of session-based survival.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Icarus</em>, it's a survival game that shares some of its DNA with extraction shooters. You can either choose to take on timed missions to complete objectives under pressure or simply explore <em>Icarus</em>' hostile terraformed environment at your own pace.</p><p><em>Icarus</em>' popularity has almost certainly been aided by the pedigree of its creator; Dean Hall is also one of the people responsible for perennially popular zombie survival game <em>DayZ</em>, so his name lends gravitas and credence to this title as well.</p>
<p>Right now, <em>Icarus </em>is only available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>, but it's coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this year as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>A poster advertising a definitive edition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">Tom Clancy’s The Division</a> appears to have been spotted by folks attending a Ubisoft-run eSports event in Japan. At least, that's assuming this isn't some elaborate ruse designed to draw in spies from other game studios, while only Jack Ryan can see what's truly going on.</p>

<p>Snaps of the poster from attendees of <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/esports/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5JKjM9XlbV6Lyd2xNYzkIf/apac-cup-at-fps-day-details">FPS Day</a> - an event in Tokyo currently hosting grand final of Rainbow Six 6 Siege's APAC cup - began to pop up over the weekend.

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-poster-for-the-division-definitive-edition-has-reportedly-appeared-at-a-ubisoft-event-in-japan/">VGC</a>, the event's set to host 10th anniversary panel for The Division today. I've reached out to Ubisoft in case the company fancy providing definitive proof of this definitive edition prior to any definitive announcements they might have planned.</p>
<p>Since The Division's release in 2016, it's been followed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-2-review">a sequel</a>, with The Division 3 having been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">announced back in 2023</a> but had gone pretty quiet until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-gearing-up-to-be-a-monster-says-series-executive-producer/1100-6537293/">fairly recently</a>.</p>
<p>Brendy (RPS in peace) expressed an appreciation for The Division in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-pc-review">near decade old review</a>, despite the shooter having plenty of hangups and annoyances which could get on your wick:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reading this, you might think I have mixed feelings. Really, I have mostly-good feelings. I have all the same problems with The Division as I had with its closest bedmate, Destiny. The transparency of its bit-by-bit progression system, the gating of areas by level, the sponginess of its enemies, its reliance on scrubbing the map clean of icons, all designed to make you grind first and think later. And yet I enjoy it a lot more than the latter.</p>
<p>I think this is all down to the setting and the fine detail of the streets. In Destiny, you get Peter Dinklage nattering on about "the light" and "the darkness" and any other fantasy sci-fi cliché you can pull out of your cryo tube. In The Division you get enemies with motives, a world with a reason for being the way it is, and bosses with some semblance of character. I'm not saying there are no clichés (a virus has run amok). It's just that they are of a much higher quality.</p></blockquote>
<p>We'll have to see if this a case of loose lips sinking the secretness of a Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine-level repackaging of a near ten year old shooter, or some sort of goof.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/boses-latest-anc-wireless-headphones-hits-record-low-new-quietcomfort-ultra-bluetooth-headphones-2nd-gen-is-now-cheaper-than-airpods-max-2000658788</link>
            <guid>1403398</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A quick word-association exercise will usually produce the word “Bose” when the question is “luxury headphones.” In terms of performance and especially active noise cancellation, that’s absolutely true. But in terms of price, even Bose’s newest models are more accessible than you might think, and never more accessible than right now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">thanks to this $50-off Amazon deal on the QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones</a>.</p>
<p data-start="690" data-end="1017">The QC Ultra 2s dropped just this past October at $450, but lately Amazon and other retailers have quietly slashed the price deep into deal hunter territory. That means this $400 Amazon deal represents savings on months-old Bose headphones that would make even the most hardened tech shopper blink and the most devoted audiophile reach for their wallet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="690" data-end="1017">Serious Sound, Serious Deal</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Here’s the wild part: Despite its premium positioning and outstanding , this deal pushes the QC Ultra 2s <em data-start="1101" data-end="1108">below</em> the cost of some older Bose QuietComfort models (yeah, the ones that aren’t even “Ultra”). So if you were on the fence about spending bigger on flagship-level noise cancellation, this Amazon deal makes the argument a whole lot easier.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose took their stellar original QuietComfort Ultra headphones and made several significant upgrades to create the QuietComfort Ultra 2s. This latest model delivers Bose’s very best adaptive noise cancellation performance, with AI-based background noise suppression and Wind Block tech for listening in windy conditions. Bose added two new sound modes – Immersion and Cinema — along with support for wired lossless listening via audio or USB-C cables. The Cinema mode is a high-performing spatial setting which balances the overall audio in favor of dialogue, ideal for streaming and podcasts.</p>


<h2 data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Truly Premium</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Even the physical look of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2 headphones is a step up from the originals, with more premium materials, polished metal yokes, and an overall sleeker and more modern look. The over-ear comfort level of the Ultra 2s is a step up from the already-pleasing original Ultras, and the battery life has been upgraded from 24 hours to 30. But it’s the active noise cancellation that Bose really leans into, and if you’re still recovering from holiday travel that involved overcrowded planes or trains stuffed with noisy commuters, you know the real value of a pair of world-class noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones pair easily with any Bluetooth device — Apple, Google, Android, and any properly equipped smart TV, for starters — and the Bluetooth Core 5.4 connection is strong and steady. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">This somewhat unexpected Amazon sale bringing the QC Ultra 2 headphones down to $400 so soon after their release is the best way for you to experience true Bose sound without breaking the bank.</a></p>

              <p>Game pricing is more all over the place than it’s ever been as developers explore the top and low ends of the spectrum, as well as everywhere in-between. And that’s before seasonal sales, subscription services, and monthly giveaways. Indie games in particular used to have to fight to prove they were worth the price of admission in the eyes of gamers used to big blockbuster spectacles produced on AAA budgets. But the psychology underlying those perceptions isn’t as clearcut as some might think, according to one of the developers of 2025’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">top-selling “friendslop” climbing sim <em>Peak</em></a>.</p> <p>The game <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">launched last June</a> at a discounted sale price of $5. That was $3 below what would be it’s “normal” price of $8. Co-creator Nick Kaman recently explained the logic behind the maneuver <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/peak-interview">to <em>Game File</em></a>. “We had this joke of, like, how much is a game really?” he said. “In a player’s mind, what does it mean to spend five bucks? Well, that’s five bucks. But six bucks? Well, that’s still five bucks. Four bucks is also kind of five bucks.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “Three bucks is two bucks. And two bucks is basically free. So we’ve got these tiers: You know, twelve bucks… that’s ten bucks. But thirteen bucks is fifteen bucks. And we found that eight bucks is still five bucks. It doesn’t become ten bucks. Seven ninety nine, that’s five bucks, right? So, eight bucks going to five bucks is the biggest differential we could find in pricing, so we found it very optimal.”</p>   <p>The developers of<em> Peak</em> didn’t randomly pick $8 out of a hat. That was the <a href="https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637">price of <em>Content Warning</em></a>, another hit in the multiplayer virality sim genre. But the overall logic lines up with something game designer and Suspicious Developments studio founder Tom Francis recently wrote about indie game pricing. His take was <a href="https://www.pentadact.com/2026-01-08-15-years-of-indie-dev-in-4-bits-of-advice/#price">part of a four-point advice guide</a> for new developers based on his 15 years of experience making games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/heat-signature-is-a-thrilling-game-about-spaceship-heis-1818625899"><em>Heat Signature</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a>.</p>

 <h2>Steam indie game pricing is a “solved problem”</h2> <p>According to Francis, game sales are a function of three things: 1) how many people come to the Steam Page, 2) how much the Steam page makes them want to buy it, and 3) how much it costs. “We just ask people how much they think the game should cost, and every time we’ve gone with the price most people chose, and every time they’ve sold great and reviewed great,” he explained.</p>

 <p>He pushed back against the older conventional wisdom that meeting player expectations rather than setting them would lead indie game prices in a race to the bottom. “Among the many genres and models that didn’t exist back then is the occasional janky/silly/ugly game charging $5 to encourage a kind of ‘fuck it, why not’ good will, and blowing up if it lands right with streamers,” he wrote. “That might bring the median price down, but it’s not a sign that people will no longer pay $20 for an indie game.”</p>

 <p>You can see this philosophy in action with the recent release of <em>Rising Front</em>, a pretty ugly-looking, very rudimentary WWI and Revolutionary War battle sim FPS (complimentary). Its 1.0 launch on Steam on January 9 was accompanied by an influx of fairly positive reviews. It’s normally priced at $15 but is currently on sale for just $12. According to Kaman, that’s actually $10. Maybe after reading the <em>Peak</em> developer’s comments, <em>Rising Front</em>‘s creators will lower it to $8.</p>

<p>Hytale’s pre-purchases have helped Hypixel Studios secure development costs for the next 2 years. </p>



<p>Hypixel Studios’ highly anticipated title, Hytale, is all set to release in early access tomorrow, January 13, 2026, and it seems that it could be a massive launch as the founder of the studios is expecting over one million players. The founder may not be wrong, as the pre-purchases alone have helped them secure capital to keep supporting the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-hypixel-founder-reaffirms-his-commitment-to-support-hytale-for-10-years">Hypixel Founder Reaffirms His Commitment to Support Hytale for 10 Years</h2>



<p>Through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Hypixel’s founder revealed that they have “officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases.” That, along with his personal commitment to support the game for the next 10 years, will make the fans happy that the game’s future is in good hands. In the same thread, the founder also revealed that the development team now consists of over 50 developers. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Hytale has had a turbulent history to reach where it is now. Riot Games had closed down the game for good; however, Hypixel Studios decided to reacquire the rights of the title and breathe new life into it. The popularity of the title is now higher than ever, and the early access launch will decide what lies in the future for this sandbox game blended with RPG action and adventure. </p>

And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yes, I feel anger.

Reacquiring a game from a AAA studio and preparing an early access launch within weeks is rare, and players will be able to watch the progress as it happens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you don’t feel comfortable pre-ordering, please don’t. This is true early access, meaning it’s still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006090043665088900" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> published at the end of 2025, expressed his "anger" at what had happened to Hytale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features. That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite now allows creator-made games to sell in-game items — and immediately, the platform's most popular experience Steal the Brainrot has added $45 premium item bundles and a chance-based roulette wheel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steal the Brainrot is Fortnite's biggest third-party game, and over the weekend saw a concurrent peak of more than 1 million users. These players were among the first to witness Steal the Brainrot's new paid-for in-game offerings — such as a 4,900 V-Buck "Present Rot" bundle of two randomized items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games enabled third-party microtransactions last Friday, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-a-turbulent-time-for-fortnite-battle-royale-epic-games-doubles-down-on-rivalling-roblox-letting-creators-sell-their-own-items-for-the-first-time">previously announcing a U-turn on the policy</a> that had set it apart from rival gaming platform Roblox — where Steal a Brainrot originated. Now, third-party games can offer premium in-game items and effects, with developers pocketing 37% of the proceeds — temporarily doubled to 74% for 12 months — while Epic Games itself takes the remaining cut. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Particular criticism for Steal the Brainrot has been levied against a new roulette-style wheel which lets you pay 100 V-Bucks (around a dollar) for random in-game effects or dollops of cash. The spinner's chance-based outcomes include a 2% chance at a Secret Lucky Rot, or a 0.5% chance at a a Secret Grande Rot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fortnite killed the entire reason why they were better than Roblox with this one update," one fan <a href="https://x.com/cdn724/status/2010106699567276307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media in response. "Can't even implement custom weapons in two years but they can put in tools to create predatory practices with!!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We returned to loot boxes on Fortnite, [in] the most popular mode depending on the day, just years after Epic Games was fined for having them on the original Fortnite (Save the World)," <a href="https://x.com/cdn724/status/2010106699567276307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> another.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I was optimistic about In-Island Translations, but after seeing this gambling style wheel In Steal The Brainrot I think I'm all set... <a href="https://t.co/gMXjIOg1g4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gMXjIOg1g4</a></p>— TheCoolDoggo (@thecooldoggo) <a href="https://twitter.com/thecooldoggo/status/2010179198338416965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Steal the Brainrot's 4,900 V-Buck "Present Rot" bundle has also come under fire — not only for its price, but for it being advertised as a limited-time discount on its usual 5,400 V-Buck cost. One of the constraints Epic Games has placed on third-party microtransactions is a 5,000 V-Buck upper limit for any individual item — meaning this item's saving is discounted from a price that couldn't actually be sold</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Super disappointed in the Brain Rot guys, not only very ethically questionable to do a 'discount' while the feature is not even 24h out but the real prize is not even possible according to the rules," Fortnite third-party developer <a href="https://x.com/Richytoons/status/2010042859735662624" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richytoons</a> noted. "You make us all look bad with this kind of stuff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Implementation by other developers seems less egregious, with the popular Murder Mystery game simply allowing players to buy cosmetic items that don't impact gameplay, while Tilted Zone Wars allows users to pay 50 V-Bucks (less than a dollar) to flood the game's map for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly how developers will implement Epic Games' rules on monetization in the long-term remains to be seen. Oddly, Steal the Brainrot suddenly disappeared offline overnight last night for several hours, leading to fan speculation that the game had been pulled by Epic Games over its monetization usage. But a developer update has said a now-fixed bug was the cause, and at the time of writing the game is now back available, reportedly with no discernible changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite fans first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-fans-say-the-game-is-opening-the-door-to-loot-boxes-by-allowing-creator-made-modes-to-sell-paid-random-items-though-their-sale-is-restricted-in-certain-countries-and-sellers-are-required-to-disclose-odds">voiced concerns last year that Epic Games' plans risked opening the door to loot box mechanics and predatory monetization</a> within the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair has made the surprise announcement of an official Palworld Trading Card Game, due out this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair has partnered with Japanese TCG specialist Bushiroad for Palworld Official Trading Card Game, which has a July 30, 2026 release date. The teaser trailer is below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>This game is a 2-player competitive card game where you can enjoy strategic and tactical battles through deploying various unique Pals. Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory. These adorable and dependable Pals will utilize their own unique traits to lead you to victory. Team up with your trusty Pals and experience the thrill of overcoming formidable enemies through this exciting trading card game.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, the announcement has sparked further comparisons between Palworld and Pokémon, which has a hugely popular trading card game of its own. “They really are going the Pokémon route and merchandising everything,” said one fan. “Palworld anime when?” added another. “Nintendo: heavy breathing,” said one YouTube commenter. “NOW THEY JUST TROLLING!!!!” laughed one fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Pocketpair announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld-palfarm">Palworld: Palfarm</a>, a farming and crafting spinoff that was revealed just a week after Nintendo revealed cozy farming sim <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia"><u>Pokémon Pokopia</u></a>. Pocketpair ended up issuing a response after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-tinfoil-hats-are-out-in-force-pocketpair-dev-responds-after-pokmon-fans-question-timing-of-palworld-palfarm-announcement-just-a-week-after-pokmon-pokopia-nintendo-direct-reveal">some Pokémon fans questioned the timing of the Palworld: Palfarm announcement</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair has certainly moved quickly to capitalize on Palworld’s explosive success. (In March 2024, Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe said the company couldn’t handle the massive profits the game had generated.) While working on its 1.0 release, the Japanese studio is developing Palfarm, working on this new Palworld TCG, running a publishing studio of its own, and it has its other game, Craftopia to update.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair is of course embroiled in a high-profile patent battle with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company over Palworld, which is expected to progress this year. The Nintendo-Palworld lawsuit, which has been ongoing in Japan since its announcement in September 2024, involves three patents, two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. For more details, check out IGN’s coverage of the lawsuit, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>why Nintendo re-wrote patents mid-case</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit"><u>Nintendo’s recent move to discount mods as "prior art."</u></a> All the while, Nintendo has been busy obtaining patents — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-should-never-have-received-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-ip-lawyers-say"><u>some of which IP lawyers said should never have been granted</u></a> — as it develops its case against Pocketpair, which has vowed to defend itself in court.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Microsoft's Forza Horizon 5 continues to be a huge hit on PlayStation, it seems. Research from Alinea Analytics claims that the game just recently passed 5 million copies sold on PS5.</p><p>This works out to more than $300 million in revenue on PS5 alone for the 2021 game. Alinea's Rhys Elliott <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2009665364477850020?s=20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> this data proves why Microsoft is keen to release more of its own games on a rival platform like Sony's PS5. "Xbox's move to third-party is no mystery, especially given Microsoft's lofty profitability mandates," Elliott said.</p><p>As Microsoft does not keep 100% of the revenue, as Sony gets a cut for its platform fee. The industry standard revenue share is 70/30.</p><p>Forza Horizon 5 has been <a href="https://google.com/search?q=xbox+games+top+playstation+charts+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=xbox+games+top+playstation+charts+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABgKGBYYHjIKCAIQABgKGBYYHjIKCAMQABgKGBYYHjIKCAQQABiABBiiBDIHCAUQABjvBTIKCAYQABiABBiiBNIBCDU3NDRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">putting up strong sales numbers on PlayStation</a> for a while already, so to hear it's crossed 5 million sales on PS5 is not a big surprise.

Both Forza Horizon 6 and the new Fable are in development at Playground Games.</p><p>The "lofty profitability mandates" Elliott is referring to are likely the 30% profit-margin mandates that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood reportedly put upon the Xbox division.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new official Palworld card game has been announced, scheduled to release on July 30, 2026. </p>



<p>The game that was dubbed Pokémon with Guns, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued by Pokémon and Nintendo</a>, still seems to be following the same path, with a new Palworld TCG announced. It is being developed by Bushiroad, known for card games such as Cardfight!! Vanguard, Weiß Schwarz, and many more. </p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-tcg-arrives-july-2026">Palworld TCG Arrives July 2026</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://en.palworld-official-cardgame.com/news/post-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> reveals that Bushiroad has announced a brand-new trading card game (TCG) based on Pocketpair’s highly popular title, Palworld. The card game will be released on July 20, 2026, allowing players to take part in 2-player competitive battles, using different strategies and tactics to deploy their favourite Pals. Players will be able to gather resources and build bases as they leverage their Pals’ unique traits to secure victory. </p>



<p>Palworld has faced Pokémon rip-off allegations since its announcement, with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company suing the developers for patent infringement. Announcing a new TCG based around Palworld, knowing full well that Pokémon is a dominating name in that space, is not going to help it beat those allegations. However, TCG is not a realm meant solely for creature-based games; in recent years, we have also seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-tcg-announced-by-cdpr-and-wierdco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games like Cyberpunk 2077</a> enter this realm.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s patent in the Palworld dispute was being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-patent-in-palworld-dispute-is-being-reexamined-by-uspto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reexamined</a> by the USPTO. Additionally, the developers have addressed the possibility of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-dev-addresses-story-based-future-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing a story-based game</a> in the future. What are your thoughts on Palworld TCG? Do you think the Pokémon rip-off allegations will grow even more?

            <p>Call of Duty is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. That we know for sure. Key Xbox and Activision figures have underlined how important Nintendo's hardware is for the brand moving forward, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/">their last comments on the matter</a> happening last year following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a>'s reveal.</p>
<p>The more important question, now, is <em>when</em> that's actually happening. We've heard all sorts of rumblings over the last few months, with insiders and other industry figures pointing to a big release coming at some point in 2026. Now, a datamine (via Reality <a href="https://x.com/realityuk">on X/Twitter</a>) could point to it happening sooner rather than later.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>

<p>The account has a history of looking through Call of Duty files and the latest updates, and shared this new finding on 11th January. Several lines added with a recent Call of Duty HQ (the dreadful multi-game launcher the series has been using for years now) reference the Nintendo "platform family" and "account type" along consoles and PC platforms that have access to the games already.</p><p>Though the news isn't a shock, it's still good to see work on whatever Call of Duty game is coming first to Nintendo Switch 2 (and maybe the original Switch, too) hasn't stalled. Other live-service hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> have enjoyed a great deal of success there, and with a handful of recent Switch 2 ports raising the bar for ambitious third-party efforts, it's not hard to see Call of Duty finding gold on Nintendo's hybrid console(s), too.</p>
<p>That said, we'd recommend proceeding with caution for now, as the shared datamine also references the Ubisoft Connect platform, which (at least right now) isn't selling the Call of Duty games. Activision's devs could be including those references and tags in the files for whatever reason, and the same could apply to the Nintendo lines. We know that CoD is taking aim at Nintendo straight from the horse's mouth though, so we're just sitting here waiting for the Direct stream that finally confirms what's been in the works for a very long time. Watch this space.</p>

<p>But current memory prices are not an immediate concern</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8e1e52e2c736d"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8e1e52e2c736d/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has been the subject of much debate since its launch last year, with many speculating that the current economy might necessitate a price increase for Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a>, Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa has remained coy on any potential product price increases, simply stating "I cannot comment on hypotheticals". Seems like a pretty understandable statement to make; Furukawa won't want to cause any panic by insinuating that prices may indeed go up.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Kyoto Shinbun article is locked behind a paid subscription model, so the kind folks at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:w2yyporceaqxdbzfupn5lcbt/post/3mc5ut4rnmk2f">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> have highlighted some of the key points from the interview. In addition to Furukawa's comment on price rises, he also noted that the current memory prices – which are on the rise thanks to the huge requirement needed for AI chips – will have "no immediate impact on [Nintendo's] financial performance", but he will nevertheless monitor the situation closely.</p>
<p>In slightly lighter news, Furukawa confirmed that Nintendo is working on both established franchises and completely new content, which probably won't come a a massive surprise. He also reaffirms Nintendo's desire to expand its work in the movie space, while noting that a potential venture into anime isn't completely ruled out.</p>
<p>We're not surprised to see such vague answers from Furukawa, since getting any sort of comment from Nintendo is like getting blood from a stone. Regardless, it's nice to get at least a <em>bit</em> of context as we head into the new year.</p>

			<p>It is about time some fresh 3D platformers to turn up, bringing with them fresh ideas and new ways to enjoy the genre. Big Hops is a game that comes with some big and fun new ideas, like using a frog tongue as a grapple to latch onto points and to grab items from the environment, and using different plants for fun ways to get around the world. But as it’s leaping from platform to plant, jumping through the world, can it stick the landing?</p>
<p><iframe title="BIG HOPS - Announce Trailer | A new kind of 3D platformer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bd7WIf1peRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Big Hops follows the story of a young frog called Hop who lives his simple, quiet life in the forest with his sister and mum. However, he soon hears a voice calling to him away from his usual stomping grounds to a shrine where he is asked to bring some things to fix the altar. Unfortunately, the voice belongs to the being known as Diss who whisks Hop away to different worlds where he must find Dark Drips to assist Diss, as well as Airship Parts to get back home. The lesson here is that you shouldn’t listen to disembodied voices promising a good time – embodied voices can also be pretty problematic.</p>


<p>Hop visits three very different worlds from his home, including a desert inhabited by rabbit people, an island chain inhabited by otters, and a mountain inhabited by bats. Diss brings Hop to each of these places because there is conflict at each one which draws in the Dark Drips. In the desert, the regular townsfolk are in conflict with a gang, in the islands it is a between one person and the oil company DrillCo, and in the mountains it is punks railing against authority. Three very different conflicts and each one is presented decently, with a wide cast of characters that are brought to life by good voice performances. Each of the locations also look great, filled with vibrant colour and well mapped environments that show where you need to go, but letting you test different ways of getting to points of interest.</p>


<p>Big Hops gameplay has the classic hallmarks of 3D platformers providing open spaces to explore to find collectables, solve puzzles, and assist people in their endeavours. Where Big Hops differs is through its traversal and puzzle solving. As Hop is a frog he has a long and powerful tongue that can latch onto surfaces allowing him to swing across gaps, pull levers from a distance, pick locks, and even engage in a bit of light graffiti.</p>
<p>As if his tongue wasn’t enough, Hops can also make use of a number of plants and vegetables, each of which has its own properties and affect the way you can navigate the world. Mushrooms can be used as bounce pad, a cacti plant can create rope crossings, and the flux plant creates zones of low gravity. These are just three of a wider number of plants that can be used to solve puzzles and find different ways of getting around, though some are exclusive to each area. Hop does get a backpack to store these items in, but space is limited so you won’t be able to carry every plant with you.</p>

<p>In each area, Hop has to try to resolve the local conflict to find the airship parts he needs and to move on to the next world. Much of the gameplay consists of solving big puzzles, usually three, to unlock the path to move forward. There are also secondary tasks available to tackle, but they are not required to move on. Your focus is looking for Dark Drips and solving the issues of the region.</p>
<p>Dark Drips are needed to unlock additional bonuses for Hop, be it additional stamina for climbing, more health, or compasses to locate more Drips in the world. Every time you find a Dark Drip you can take it back to Diss and choose between two bonuses. I wouldn’t agonise too much over the choice as you will eventually get all of them. The worlds also contain hidden challenge rooms where you have to use what you have learned in that world to navigate treacherous paths to grab a Dark Drip.</p>

<p>I initially really enjoyed my time with Big Hops and there are some really fun moments, but through the review period we did run into a number of issues on PS5. One area had stuttering performance, there was some clipping through the environment, skipping music, and more significantly some game crashes and progression-blocking issues. Patches arrived before launch to address most of these, allowing me to finish the game, though I wasn’t able to return to previous areas and did still run into a glitch that locked me into a first person view – this resolved itself when I failed the level. Hopefully remaining issues at launch are patched quickly, because they did detract from my experience of an otherwise charming game.</p>

			<p>A few weeks after <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">RAM prices</strong> started spiking due to increased demand from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI data centers</strong> which will take some time to normalize, the critical situation for consumers (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">who apparently have gotten the narrative wrong</a></strong>) has now become evident, as prices for some devices have already been increased, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/"><strong>more are set to follow.</strong></a></p>



<p>Obviously, video game consoles will also be impacted by the current RAM prices and shortages, and another price increase will make the current console generation even more unusual, as it is the first one to date where console prices increased instead of dropping in the years following their launch. For the time being, however, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> may not be impacted by the current unprecedented situation.</p>

<p>However, given the magnitude of the situation, no one can rest easy. <em>"We must monitor the situation closely,"</em> said <strong>Furukawa-san</strong> before refusing to <em>"comment on hypotheticals"</em> regarding a possible price increase for the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Although high RAM prices make any new hardware launch challenging, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo</strong> could be planning a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 Lite</strong> model.

<p>With no slowdown in sight for the AI boom, purchasing a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> in the near future seems to be the safest choice for those still looking to get the system.

            <p>Happy Mawday all! This week, I'm thinking about how we can expand our bestiary of Maw manifestations. When describing the beast, we often resort to stock Lovecraftian imagery of a kaleidoscopic kerfuffle of teeth and tentacles, but the Maw’s appearances aren’t always so pulpy and cinematic. Sometimes, it just looks like a blinking cursor, or an expectant child, or a feeling of guilt about not returning a text message from an old friend. Sometimes, it looks like an audience of people who want to read about new PC games. 
</p>
<p>Come, depress yourself with me as we tot up possible indicators of Maw activity. Alternatively, read about some of those aforesaid new PC games. Thanks very much to Editor King Julian for suggesting the majority of titles on this list, which he has been doing with disturbing efficiency of late. 
</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 12th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221480/Big_Hops/">Big Hops</a> is a 3D platformer featuring a frog who is given to both the titular big hops and also, tongue-based gymnastics. I guess Big Tongue would have sent the wrong signals as a title.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2797960/Confidential_Killings__A_Detective_Game/">Confidential Killings - A Detective Game</a> is definitely a game that could have done with a better title. You might as well call Mass Effect “Space Shootings &amp; Shaggings – An RPG”. Oh no, I think I’ve just talked myself into this.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quarantine-zone-the-last-check">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</a> is a game about playing a border guard during a zombie apocalypse that has the strong potential to be either a Papers, Please-style moral experiment or a crass and gaudy fantasy about brutalising migrants, and is perhaps worth us writing about in either case.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 13th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Out this week in early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is the previously Riot Games-published sandbox building RPG, now in the hands of the Minecraft Hypixel server founders at Hypixel Studios. This could be Big, though I’m not sure the world needs another cousin of Minecraft with Robloxy game creation platform aspirations.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937880/Hank_Drowning_On_Dry_Land/">Hank: Drowning on Dry Land</a> (pictured) is a caped debacle in which you play drunk, time-travelling pseudo-Batman trying to escape from a comicbook world. Julian picked this one out in our morning meeting for being a budget experimental immersive sim, akin to Blendo’s recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 14th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fez fans ahoy! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cassette-boy">Cassette Boy</a> is an action RPG puzzler in which you can spin the world to reveal things or remove them from existence. I like the old school Nintendo handheld visuals and the guiding meditation on object permanence.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707870/Streetdog_BMX/">Streetdog BMX</a> is six colourful 3D maps' worth of kids doing frightfully Tony Hawkish things on bicycles. Seriously, how do any of these mad children still have groins.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 15th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316940/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_beyond_the_Horizon/">The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> is the thirteenth instalment in an apparently brilliant RPG series I am resigned to never being able to play before the sun implodes.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3538860/Tabulo/">Tabulo</a> is the latest Balatro-like, which is to say, the latest snazzy application of roguelite mechanics to a concept that was getting on quite well enough without - in this case, chess</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110/Craftlings/">Craftlings</a> is… Lemmings, the ancient Psygnosis game in which you try stop critters walking off clifftops, but it’s also a colony building sim, with mines and airships and monsters? This is a truly terrifying piece of retro alchemy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 16th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3459150/The_Fortress/">The Fortress</a> is a first-person turn-based dungeon-crawling RPG in the tradition of Eye of the Beholder and Legend of Grimrock. You’ve been locked up by the Sorceror King. Please attempt to get out.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3973060/NEUROXUS/">NEUROXUS</a> is a dizzy third-person mech shooter that looks like Armored Core 6 but more neon.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525060/Moving_Simulator/">Moving Simulator</a> is, as you may deduce, a moving house simulator, though I guess that could also be “moving” as in emotive. Perhaps it’s both? Moving house tends to be pretty moving.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2547090/Lunar_Ascendant/">Lunar Ascendant</a> is about playing politics as the very first mayor of the Moon. You will monitor social media, bandy words with representatives of various factions, and figure out your relationship to an Earth now run by super-advanced AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things afoot this week: James and Julian have some preview events to attend. Mark and Ollie are gunning for a bit of that Hytale launch excitement, among other things, and I’m trying to turn around a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> review, after only getting code on Friday.</p><p>The Maw’s manifestations may diversify and fracture into ubiquity but we Leech Wizards of games journalism will always be here to intercept its dreadful advance and woo the creature with some absolute gibberish about, I don’t know, overpowered shoes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> or something. Let the cry ring forth once again from the battlements: FEED THE MAW!</p>

            <guid>1403293</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="547">As the calendar flips to a brand-new year and the rush of holiday shopping fades into the background, many people find themselves holding onto gift cards or leftover holiday cash, wondering what worthwhile purchase to make next. If you’re looking to invest in something practical, versatile, and genuinely useful year-round, a portable power station is an excellent place to start. One standout option right now is the Jackery Explorer 300, a compact yet capable power solution that is now part of a limited-time Amazon discount.</p>
<p data-start="549" data-end="829"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/">Normally priced at $259, the Jackery Explorer 300 is currently available for just $179, marking a 31% price drop and a solid $80 in savings</a>. For anyone who’s been on the fence about adding a portable power station to their gear collection, this deal might just push you onto the buying side.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="831" data-end="1327">A portable power station is one of those items you might not realize you need until you really need it. Whether you’re planning outdoor adventures or simply want peace of mind at home, something like the the Jackery Explorer 300 is a must in both scenarios. It’s ideal for camping trips, road travel, tailgating, or even backyard gatherings where access to outlets is limited. At the same time, it’s a smart emergency backup to keep in your car or garage for unexpected power outages or roadside situations.</p>

<p data-start="1329" data-end="1670">Weighing just 7.1 pounds, the Explorer 300 is super lightweight for the power it delivers. The integrated top handle makes it easy to grab and go, whether you’re heading into the wilderness or pulling it out during a blackout. Despite its compact size, it packs enough energy to keep essential devices running when you need them most.</p>
<h2 data-start="1329" data-end="1670">Universal Connectivity</h2>
<p data-start="1672" data-end="2128">The Jackery Explorer 300 can power up to six devices at once, making it a great option for families or group trips. It includes two AC outlets for larger electronics, a 60W Power Delivery USB-C port for fast-charging modern laptops and phones, a USB 3.0 fast-charge port, a standard USB-A port, and a DC car port. This variety ensures that nearly any device you own can be powered or recharged without hassle.</p>


<p data-start="2130" data-end="2530">In terms of performance, the Explorer 300 delivers reliable results. On a full charge, it can run a mini cooler or a television for approximately 4.5 hours. It can recharge smaller devices multiple times over, including about 31 phone charges, four laptop charges, 15 camera recharges, or around five and a half drone recharges.</p>
<p data-start="2532" data-end="2871">Recharging the power station itself is quick and convenient. Using a standard wall outlet or the USB-C Power Delivery port with an AC adapter, it can reach 80% capacity in just two hours. For those who prefer renewable energy or off-grid use, it’s also compatible with solar charging when paired with panels like the Jackery SolarSaga 100 (sold separately).</p>
<p data-start="2873" data-end="3054">Safety and reliability is important. The Jackery Explorer 300 uses pure sine wave technology, ensuring a stable and clean power supply that protects sensitive electronics.</p>
<p data-start="3056" data-end="3327" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5851/">At $179 for a limited time, the Jackery Explorer 300 is a pretty sweet deal.</a> Whether for outdoor adventures, emergency preparedness, or everyday convenience, it’s a smart way to start the new year with a purchase you’ll actually use.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass continues to add new games to expand your gaming library, but keeping track of which games are on the service can be tricky, but Insider Gaming is here to help with the details on Quarantine Zone: The Last Check’s Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Launching January 12, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check puts players in control of a crucial checkpoint separating the zombie horde from survivors, tasking you with deciding who gains entry and who is denied, and the choices you make can have serious consequences.</p>



<p>Here’s all the important information on whether Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is on Xbox Game Pass.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-pc-game-pass">Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check on PC Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Key step. Image via Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Quarantine: The Last Check is available on PC Game Pass through subscription from day one of the launch on January 12, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Quarantine: The Last Check was a late addition to the Game Pass service for January, having not been listed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-wave-xbox-game-pass-games-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11 games revealed</a> to be coming to the service this month, despite the release window aligning with the announcements.</p>



<p>Instead, the official Xbox social media account teased the <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2009788572078137696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal of a new game</a> launching onto PC Game Pass imminently, then later revealed that the game in question is Quarantine: The Last Check, meaning PC players have a new game to enjoy as part of their subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-xbox-game-pass-for-consoles">Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check on Xbox Game Pass For Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Quarantine: The Last Check will not be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S. Instead, only those with PC Game Pass will be able to play.</strong></p>



<p>Quarantine: The Last Check launches as a PC exclusive and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-playstation-xbox-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not available on other </a>platforms, such as PlayStation and the Xbox family of consoles. Therefore, you need a PC to play the game.</p>



<p>The good news is that Microsoft’s many tiers of Game Pass subscriptions include a host of PC games, though you will, of course, require a platform to play them on, and, at the time of writing, it has not been confirmed which level of Game Pass is required to access Quarantine: The Last Check on PC.</p>



<p>It’s likely an Ultimate subscription will be required, however, as this is the tier that features day one releases across both platforms, whereas the Premium subscription brings new Xbox-published games to the service within 12 months of launch.</p>

While many games typically see a spike in sales and players during these periods, one multiplayer game saw a particularly huge surge in sales following an enormous discount.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/icarus/" data-ref-id="5000-513911">Icarus</a>, a PvE survival game from New Zealand studio RocketWerkz that was first released in December 2021, was reduced from its usual $35 price to a mere $3.50 during the Steam Winter Sale - an enormous 90% saving.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Icarus First Cohort Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Now, RocketWerkz founder Dean Hall has revealed just how many copies of Icarus were sold during the sale. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>, Hall shared that that an enormous 984,000 copies were during this sales period. On top of that, the game's DLC, which includes two expansions and a "pets" bundle, moved a further 243,000 units.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997?s=46" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Over the steam winter sale, ICARUS sold just under a million new base game units during the sale (984k). We also did quarter of a million DLC units (243k).</p>  — Dean Hall (@rocket2guns) <a href="https://twitter.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>These sales also led to a huge increase in the game's active player base. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1149460/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game enjoyed a massive spike in players during December 2025, with a peak concurrent player count of 44,120 (compared to 9076 in November). This is the highest concurrent player count the game has had since its launch month, December 2021.</p><p>Dean Hall is no stranger to hugely popular online games - he was the developer of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a>, a 2012 zombie survival game that tasked players with surviving in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-filled world where other players were just as dangerous as the undead. The game started life as a mod for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arma-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-38942">Arma 2</a> before eventually receiving a standalone release.</p><p>Steam has already announced dates for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-the-next-steam-sale-date/1100-6532422/" data-ref-id="1100-6532422">next few rounds of sales</a>, through to May 2026. Coming up in January are the Detective Fest from January 12 -19 and the Board Game Fest from January 26 - February 2.</p>
