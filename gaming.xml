                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released just a couple days after Microsoft surprise-released Oblivion Remastered, prompting some to wonder why two Game Pass games heavily promoted by Xbox might release so close to each other. Some wondered and worried if Expedition 33 might have struggled as a result. But the game shipped more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">1

"We felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game," he said.</p><p>To sum up, Handrahan said, "Proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p><p>Research firm Ampere Analysis said 35% of Expedition 33 players overall also played Oblivion Remastered, with 55% of Expedition 33 players on Xbox also spending time with Oblivion Remastered. The crossover was more limited on Steam (22%) and PS5 (16%).</p><p>Xbox was also the most popular platform overall for Expedition 33, Ampere found, saying 45% of all players came from Xbox, with 47% of Oblivion Remastered players on Xbox. PS5 was No. 2 for Expedition 33, making up 30% of players, with Steam following as the third-biggest platform (25%).</p><p>For Oblivion Remastered, Ampere's data said Steam was No. 2 (34%) followed by PlayStation (19%). The preference for Xbox for both titles was attributable in part to both games being included with Game Pass, the report said.</p><p>While Xbox was the top platform for both Expedition 33 and Oblivion Remastered, it wasn't the biggest platform for either title based on playtime. Ampere said the average playtime for Expedition 33 on Xbox was 2.2 hours, compared to 4.4 hours on PlayStation and Steam. For Oblivion Remastered, PlayStation users played an average of 3.8 hours, compared to 3.6 hours on Steam, and 2.2 hours on Xbox.</p><p>All of the figures here from Ampere cover data from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Europe, from each game's launch through Sunday, April 27. Oblivion Remastered, of course, came out two days before Expedition 33, which no doubt had an effect on Ampere's findings.</p>

			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday coincides with the beginning of a new month, so NVIDIA provided users of the popular cloud gaming platform with an outlook on which PC games will be available throughout May. Once again, most of the big titles will be supported, starting with id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages. That's not surprising, as all Bethesda (and Microsoft) games are supported. Moreover, DOOM: The Dark Ages will support path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS, and those with a GeForce NOW premium subscription will be able to take advantage of those technologies.</p>
<p>On that note, id Software posted a little tease of how path tracing can improve the visuals of DOOM: The Dark Ages. You can check out a teaser screenshot below; unfortunately, NVIDIA also said that path tracing won't be available at launch but will be added with an update 'shortly after launch'.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horror-at-highrook-review-haunting-narrative-indie.1178961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/horror-at-highrook-review-haunting-narrative-indie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Horror at Highrook</em> is the first title from indie developer Nullpointer Games. A narrative-focused horror game, it combines board game mechanics with card-crafting gameplay. The story is woven through each part of the gameplay, and the dialogue segments really highlight the important aspects of the plot. A strong opening for Nullpointer Games,&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;offers a completely new gaming experience that will stay with you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Horror at Highrook</em> Card-Based Gameplay</h2>

<p>You’re in control of four investigators as they explore Highrook, an abandoned estate on the coast. The noble Ackeron family has disappeared amid rumors of occult activity. Tasked with finding the missing residents, strange occurrences happen soon after their arrival.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horror-at-highrook-gameplay.jpg?itok=CWJOS3pT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horror-at-highrook-gameplay.jpg?itok=lAtQg0uV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The gameplay revolves around using cards to have the investigators execute different actions. Drag actions to the corresponding room, then drag someone who’s skilled in that area to start working. Open packages in the Machine Room, create potions in the Laboratory, or cook meals in the Kitchen. Some actions keep your investigators alive and sane, while others turn up usable items and boosts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you progress through the game, you'll be aided by Mr. Tubbs, the cat, and Stokes the Raven. Mr. Tubbs moves where he wills, but offers a boost for certain rooms. Interacting with him lowers Madness, just like petting a cat in real life can soothe a worried heart. Stokes, on the other hand, can be moved around the board, but only offers assistance in the Chapel and Courtyard. Using them wisely can really make a difference in your gameplay, especially when you've run out of Moonshine to keep your investigators sane.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>An Atmosphere of Intrigue in <em>The Horror at Highrook</em></h2>

<p>I really enjoyed the story of The Horror at Highrook. It’s easy to digest, yet pulls at the heartstrings. It’s presented through journal entries, notes you find in locked rooms, and dialogue moments between the characters.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-horror-at-highrook-key.jpg?itok=huY5wpuU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-horror-at-highrook-key.jpg?itok=wW65bg1J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You discover that the father and son are in this other realm, with other residents pulled into the madness as it spreads through the estate. By the middle of the game, I wanted to know what happened to this family, especially Simon. This is a world I became invested in. Each dialogue built a web of intrigue that lasted throughout the story.</p>

<p>The art and the music perfectly complement the narrative that’s established. Eerie music begins as the occult occurrences ramp up. Eldritch horrors with no faces and extra teeth appear at the end of rituals. I tensed up as soon as the music started, and those creatures will haunt my nightmares.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You work through eight chapters of eldritch narrative and card creation to reach the culmination of the title. Pausing to read everything during my first playthrough meant it took me nine hours to finish. My second playthrough, so I could see all the ending summaries (and hit 100%), only lasted four hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once fully complete, there’s no real incentive to play the title again. The ending summaries don’t change, and the steps to finish the side quests stay the same. The story is static. No matter how good the narrative is, there are so many ways you can play it.&nbsp;This is great for those with restricted time for gaming. A single weekend will give you the complete experience.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reality-tear-horror-at-highrook.jpg?itok=kOLm5u7G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reality-tear-horror-at-highrook.jpg?itok=P_21d5GE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I normally enjoy longer games, but the story in&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;is gripping. It's stayed with me well past the last time I played, living rent-free in my head. There is much more about this world I'd like to learn about beyond what's presented. Nullpointer Games developed interesting game mechanics along with an invigorating world that can be the setting for future titles. I know I'd buy another game set around Highrook just to experience more of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the length of the title can be seen as a negative, the only real issue I take with the game is the abundance of spelling and grammatical errors found throughout. This could be due to being a writer or a former English major in college. However, some of the mistakes can cause slight confusion when read. Aside from that, I encountered no bugs or glitches, my game never crashed, and the audio always played correctly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Horror at Highrook</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;was an experience I really enjoyed. Figuring out how to craft the boost I needed or trying to complete side quests while the investigators went insane solidified the indie game as one of my favorites of the year. The lack of bugs paired with a well-written story that sticks with you and unique card mechanics makes it stand out among other horror games releasing. If you're interested in Eldritch horror stories,&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;is a game you need to check out.&nbsp;</p>

I really quite like how simple a title <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratopia">Ratopia</a> has. It's a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategic</a> survival city builder, where you have to build a nice place for rats to live. Ratopia! It gets straight to the heart of it, and it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2244130/view/538852710067208196?l=english">just received its 1.0 release today</a> after an early access period of 18 months. The game has had a lengthy development time too, starting way back in 2020, and in a Steam post discussing the 1.0 release, developers Cassel Games left a nice and lengthy list covering everything that's been added across its early access release.
</p>

<p>
That includes things like a diplomacy system, character customisation, even a disease system, which does make me sad, but rats are generally known for being carriers of all sorts. In terms of gameplay, there's definitely a bit of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> vibe to it given that your rats walk around 2D landscapes, digging at squares to build settlements. All the rats apparently have their "own wealth and unique characteristics", though, I have to say, developing capitalism but for rats doesn't seem very utopic.

<p>
This 1.0 update also adds in a new leader perk system, which offers, you guessed it, perks for your leader rat. That can be for things like recovering health at certain times of day, or to help you cultivate plants. Those that like to tweak their challenge to suit them have some new options to tweak things like choosing which kinds of enemies invade, changing the season order, or just outright turning crime off. There's the utopia I'm looking for!
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more than that too, and Cassel Games did say that they plan to release more updates in the future too, as well as Steam Deck improvements. It's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244130/Ratopia/">currently 20% off</a>, which technically is just keeping it at it's early access price more or less, so you've got until May 14th to get it slightly cheaper than you will pass that point. Oh, and there's a demo too! Lots of options for you.

We all have favorite playstyles, after all. But if you’re brand new, as in you never played the original, surely there’s a single class that encompasses the best of what <em>Oblivion </em>offers, right? There is! Here’s the best <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> class for a beginner, as declared by me.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196903,196646" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#spell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#spell">Spellsword</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#custom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#custom">Custom class</a></span></p><h2 id="h355408"><a id="spell"></a>I recommend Spellsword for new players</h2><figure id="" data-id="2b789ac67cf3d08d23476b67ea8168d3" data-recommend-id="image://2b789ac67cf3d08d23476b67ea8168d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The class selection screen for the Spellsword in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The class selection screen for the Spellsword in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b789ac67cf3d08d23476b67ea8168d3" data-recommend-id="image://2b789ac67cf3d08d23476b67ea8168d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The class selection screen for the Spellsword in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Why not a Warrior or Mage—a straight-up generic playstyle that highlights the best of the game’s first-person combat or spell-slinging? It’s easy; Spellsword is the best of both worlds. While you may not specialize in one or the other outright, the class allows you to mix and match, combining a sword and shield with an appropriate Restoration or Destruction spell that makes quick work of enemies or allows you to keep on kicking. </p><p>With a focus on Heavy Armor, Destruction, Restoration, and Blade, and attributes revolving around Endurance and Willpower, the Spellsword is a versatile class that’s quick-footed yet durable. </p><figure id="" data-id="e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-recommend-id="image://e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lightning touch spell in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A lightning touch spell in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-recommend-id="image://e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lightning touch spell in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sure, a Mage is cool, and often quite powerful in the late game. But have you seen their robes?

Here, you can mix and match skills to craft a one-of-a-kind playstyle that feels unique without changing the game overwhelmingly. It might feel a little intimidating to roll your own class as a beginner, but the freedom here might just be what you need to tweak the experience to how you want to play.</p><p>Your options include:</p><p><strong>Specializations</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Combat</strong>: Armorer, Athletics, Blade, Block, Blunt, Hand to Hand, and Heavy Armor.</li><li><strong>Magic</strong>: Alchemy, Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, Mysticism, and Restoration</li><li><strong>Stealth</strong>: Acrobatics, Light Armor, Marksman, Mercantile, Security, Sneak, and Speechcraft</li></ul><p><strong>Attributes</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Strength</strong>: Affects maximum Fatigue, Encumbrance, and damage dealt by melee and hand-to-hand weapons.</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: Affects maximum Magicka.</li><li><strong>Willpower</strong>: Affects maximum Fatigue and Magicka regeneration.</li><li><strong>Agility</strong>: Affects maximum Fatigue, reduces the risk of staggering, and increases damage dealt by ranged weapons.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>: Affects movement speed and jump length.</li><li><strong>Endurance</strong>: Affects maximum Fatigue, Health, and Health increases per level.</li><li><strong>Personality</strong>: Affects Disposition.</li><li><strong>Luck</strong>: Affects Acrobatics, Athletics, and Speechcraft</li></ul><p>Lastly, the Custom Class allows you to select seven Major Skills, providing a +20 increase to each chosen one. If you want a fighter-type class, opt for Blade. If you’re a mage-type, I recommend Destruction.

Rather than offering full-scale, action-packed battles across the universe, Trinket Studios' next game instead boils things down to a sleek, card-based battle system, which focuses on resource management and strategy rather than brute force action--all while adding dozens of interesting characters with fully voiced dialogue on top of it.</p><p dir="ltr">After playing an hour-long demo, it's immediately clear that Trinket is on to something with this unique approach, but it's too early to tell if the experiment will stick the landing. Battle Suit Aces is trying something different, and so far, the results are worthy of your attention.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battle Suit Aces - Official Reveal Trailer | Future of Play 2024</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Aces high</h2><p dir="ltr">Battle Suite Aces follows a simple premise: A group of spacefarers called the Patchworks travel the universe in a massive spaceship called the USS Zephyr, as they explore planets looking for ancient tech. In their travels, they have found and commandeered a Gundam-adjacent mech suit, and eventually they meet other characters with mech suits of their own.</p><p dir="ltr">The crew fights against the Frenzied, mysterious monsters that can attack without notice and devastate everything in their path. The Zephyr and its crew meet the Frenzied multiple times throughout the demo, an excellent introduction to Battle Suit Aces' novel battle system.</p><p dir="ltr">Fights take place via a card-battling system, where each character you've recruited is represented by a card featuring their mech. There are also secondary cards--in the demo, for example, these are all attack drones--which can attack for you as needed. The USS Zephyr, meanwhile, is the "player" of these cards, but it has a set life total--if enemies attack enemy spaces on your side of the board, the Zephyr will take damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485595"></a><figcaption>Battle Suit Aces uses cards to depict space battles between mechs, ships, and drones.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the board, the battlefield is a single row containing five slots, and only one card can fit in a slot at a time. As you fill slots in the row with cards, you accrue energy in whichever color is represented on the card--the deck in the demo contains blue and red energy (the full game may have more), so you'll accrue one energy of a certain color for each card in your row. After energy is accrued, you can choose how to spend it on attacks and other abilities, and you can also move cards to different slots once per turn in order to maximize the turn's potential.</p><p dir="ltr">This is where the full strategic prowess of the Battle Suit Aces fighting system comes into play. Each battle is won by reducing the HP of the main enemy to zero, and you damage that enemy the same way they can damage the Zephyr--by firing a card's weapon into a slot not occupied by an enemy card. If the opponent places a card in an empty slot, damage will be taken by that card before the main enemy will, meaning that each card is "protecting" its leader when placed.</p><p dir="ltr">Every battle in the demo offered multiple different paths to victory, creating an engaging and sometimes stressful experience. Early battles are easy, as they're normally won by moving a powerful mech to empty slots as needed. Later on, the demo throws a couple of curveballs into the battle mechanics; one battle creates more enemy cards whenever one of their own is killed, while another places shields in each slot which need to be broken before the main enemy can be damaged.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485596" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485596"></a><figcaption>Between missions, you can customize your deck of cards.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After a battle, you can visit different rooms on the USS Zephyr and make changes to your mechs, drones, and more in different rooms of the ship. This adds an air of customization to the experience, as it lets you throw your ideal curveballs at an enemy ship depending on your chosen loadout. I really like the way Trinket Studios has already shown it can tweak the battle system on the fly, and I'm excited to see what sort of mad scientist experiments later battles in the game will present.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The heart of the cards</h2><p dir="ltr">Battling in Battle Suit Aces is fun, but the real joy comes from listening to the characters interact with one another. Each character is fully voiced, and unique personalities burst from each of those voices. Heathcliff is the leader of the crew and an adept engineer in his own right. Daciana is a fiery mechanic with a seedy backstory. Jules is a researcher obsessed with analyzing every last inch of ancient tech--and he drinks a <em>lot</em> of coffee. The dozen or so characters I met in this demo all burst with personality, and their back-and-forth banter elicited more than a few laughs. There were a few references to potential plot points in the main game too.</p><p dir="ltr">These characters are the emotional heart that brings the rest of Battle Suit Aces to life, and listening to their stories unfold is very cool. However, this demo is heavily unbalanced in terms of "dialogue time" versus "gaming time." There is a hefty amount of dialogue that you have to skip through, and while it's all important and worthy of your attention, it does mean it will take a while to get from one card battle to the next.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485597" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485597"></a><figcaption>Like Battle Chef Brigade, Battle Suit Aces' biggest strengths are its gorgeous art and intriguing characters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you do decide to listen, there's also a ton of information being thrown at you all at once, and it may leave you wondering what the heck is happening in this game. Some of the terms are easy enough to pick up--Blue Crest is the name of the ancient mech, the Pholians are the ancient race who developed the tech, etc.--but there are some sentences that sound like complete rubbish out of context. If you're the type that likes to have all of the information all at once, you may experience an overload of that info before long, especially in the time constraints of an hour-long demo.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle Suit Aces smashes a bunch of different elements together--mech suits, spaceships, card battles, upgrade systems, dialogue trees, and more--into an interesting package. Card battles are fun and engaging, especially when extra wrinkles are thrown in to challenge you in new ways. The crew of the Zephyr are shaping up to be the emotional weight of the story, with a few interesting details already spilling out in this short demo playthrough.</p><p dir="ltr">This demo only offered a limited amount of time with Trinket Studios' latest, but despite the brevity, I'm hopeful that the full experience will come up aces.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo for Battle Suit Aces is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870530/Battle_Suit_Aces/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

It's been discovered that the patch has made a key change to how the eShop charts work, with the apparent aim of de-prioritizing so-called "shovelware."</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-has-changed-its-eshop-charts-in-an-apparent-move-to-hide-shovelware/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reported that the update changes the eShop charts such that it now ranks games based on revenue from sales in the past 72 hours. Previously, the ranking was based on total sales volume over the past 48 hours.</p><p>The eShop--and Xbox, PlayStation, and PC digital storefronts--are filled with shovelware-type games that are known to be misleading, low-quality, and inexpensive. One popular theory is that the publishers of these types of games sell their titles at low prices to help them rank higher in the charts. Under the new eShop ranking system, this might not be as effective.</p><p>VGC and others have pointed out how this new system could negatively impact higher-quality lower-priced games. But it remains to be seen how it'll all shake out in the end. Also unknown is how the eShop might work on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, which launches in June.</p><p>The Switch's ver. 20.0.0 update arrived earlier this week, introducing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-will-let-you-share-digital-games/1100-6530424/" data-ref-id="1100-6530424">Virtual Game Cards</a> feature announced during the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/" data-ref-id="2900-6377">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, along with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-game-sharing-for-all-switch-consoles/1100-6530545/" data-ref-id="1100-6530545">GameShare</a> support and other compatibility with the upcoming Switch 2 system.</p><p>After installing the update, digital titles and DLC you've purchased will now be converted to Virtual Game Cards. These function similarly to physical game cards. You can load and share your digital games between two Switch systems, making it easier to manage your digital library. You can also loan out digital games temporarily to other users within your family group.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-system-update-now-live-adds-virtual-game-cards-switch-2-compatibility-and-more/1100-6531216/" data-ref-id="1100-6531216">full rundown of the 20.0.0 Switch update.</a></p>

Multiple staff members have confirmed they've lost their jobs on social media.</p><p>Former editor-in-chief Chris Plante referenced a sale on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, writing in part "I won't be talking more about the sale because I wasn't involved." Valnet confirmed the sale in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250501630767/en/Valnet-Acquires-Premium-Gaming-Publication-Polygon-from-Vox-Media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, writing that "The acquisition, an asset deal, closed today." Valnet writes that "Polygon will now integrate Valnet’s Gaming Portfolio."</p><p>In a statement in the press release by Jim Bankoff, CEO of Polygon's former owner Vox, Bankoff says, "This transaction will enable us to focus our energies and investment resources in other priority areas of growth across our portfolio of iconic digital publications and audio/video programming, while enabling Valnet to grow their leadership and authority in the gaming information category.” </p><p>Numerous staff members have lost their jobs due to the sale. A former employee tells us they believe at least 25 people have been let go. They note that many of those let go were union members; the Vox Media Union, under the Writers Guild of America East, is currently in contract bargaining.</p><p>Workers from Polygon tell us a small number of staff have received offers to stay on. One tells us that eight editors have received this offer, though they don't know how those people were selected over others who lost their jobs. They said, "I am incandescently angry that Vox Media did this to us. I personally believe that, in the immediate, Vox should be the target of blame for this decision."</p><p>Valnet owns multiple gaming sites, including GameRant, Dualshockers, The Gamer, and review score site Open Critic.

The site has been at the forefront of labor and culture reporting, as well as innovative guides content.

			<p>Today, Respawn Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1917959352243098073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Apex Legends: Prodigy season will begin on Tuesday, May 6, delivering a new playable hero called Sparrow.</p>
<p>His real name is Enea Davide Guarino. According to the lore prepared by the developers, he was born into the most respected bounty hunter clan in the Outlands, renowned for their unparalleled archery skills and dogmatic moral code. Guarino, a young and irreverent rogue, quickly became the black sheep of his clan. After a particularly reckless decision, it became clear they would never see eye to eye, and his family shunned Enea.</p>
<p>Despite this, Sparrow is determined to figure out how to have it all—a life on his own terms and his family's acceptance. The child prodigy hopes to regain his family's respect by participating in the Apex Games. For the first two weeks of the Apex Legends: Prodigy season, Sparrow will be temporarily unlocked for all players. Players will have the opportunity to add Sparrow to their permanent pantheon of Legends by completing challenges that will test their skills with Legends, weapons, and damage.</p>
<p>Sparrow's passive is Double Jump. Players can jump twice as high by pressing the button a second time while in the air. Moreover, when climbing a wall and hitting a double jump, they'll launch right up to the top of that wall. His tactical ability is a Tracker Dart that reveals all enemies passing through the area. Lastly, his Ultimate is Stinger Bolt. This ability lets Sparrow wreak havoc on multiple targets simultaneously with a large arrow that creates a damaging energy field. Anyone caught in the open and within line of sight is affected. More information about Sparrow will be released in a dedicated blog scheduled to go live tomorrow.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: Prodigy Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hg0_PBw1OMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Apex Legends: Prodigy also sees the return of the Bocek Compound Bow, which can be loaded with Frag Grenades and energized to create Explosive Arrows. Arena matches also return, albeit with some differences. Firstly, they are shorter, as the first team to win three rounds will be crowned champion. Throughout the season, weapons in the store will be banned for some time after being selected by a player, and a discount will kick off in certain rounds to tempt players away from their preferred weapons. Finally, Health items will be available at the beginning of the round. Later in the season, a new 1v1 Arena variant called Duels will make its debut.</p>
<p>Ranked mode is getting tweaked, too. The player's starting Rank Tier and Division will now be based on their (hidden) skill value from past seasons, and the Bronze reset rule for those who missed a season has been removed. The season also introduces Ranked Challenges and Ranked Ladders, giving players more stuff to chase. More details will be shared in the patch notes.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi teams at Respawn Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were just hit by significant layoffs</a>. This also caused the cancellation of two early projects at the incubation stage, one of which would have been a Titanfall extraction shooter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced it will be "pausing" development on future rally racing games, including the <em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series, which has been running in one form or another since the early 2000s.</p>

<p>In a development <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on its website, EA says that "every great journey eventually finds its finish line", and that it's "reached the end of the road working on <em>WRC</em>". As such, the 2024 season of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports WRC</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-wrc-announced-promising-most-authentic-awe-inspiring-off-road-experience" rel="nofollow">released back in 2023</a>, will be both the game's last expansion and the last&nbsp;<em>WRC</em>-related thing you'll see from EA, at least for a while.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "pausing development plans on future rally titles", so it sounds like it's not just&nbsp;<em>WRC</em>, but also games like the&nbsp;<em>Dirt&nbsp;</em>series that won't be getting any future installments for the time being.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-rally-games-ending-development-car.jpg?itok=0HBHh69H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-rally-games-ending-development-car.jpg?itok=BZ9KAiW0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA is pausing development on its rally games.</figcaption></figure><p>EA says its time with&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>was a "culmination of sorts for [its] Codemasters journey", and that it's "provided a home for every rally enthusiast" over the course of its&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dirt&nbsp;</em>franchises.</p>

<p>News of EA pausing its rally games comes a year or so after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/layoffs-codemasters-tinybuild-new-world-interactive" rel="nofollow">layoffs at Codemasters</a>, the studio responsible for the aforementioned franchises (as well as the&nbsp;<em>GRID&nbsp;</em>series and the official&nbsp;<em>F1&nbsp;</em>tie-in games, neither of which appear to be affected by this announcement).</p>

<p>The news also follows yesterday's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">report that EA will lay off around 300 to 400 of its employees</a>, around 100 of whom work on games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>for EA subsidiary Respawn. Both franchises remain active, however.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the official Codemasters <a href="https://x.com/Codemasters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X account</a> appears to have been scrubbed of all of its posts, suggesting that there may be a less-than-heroic end for the studio waiting in the wings following this announcement.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>

Some <em>Polygon</em> staffers will continue with the publication under its new owner, while others have been laid off, according to posts online and an internal message sent to Vox Media employees.</p><p>Valnet owns more than 27 different brands that cover areas like entertainment, gaming, sports, and travel. A recent report <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">from <em>TheWrap</em></a> includes one former contributor to a site under Valnet’s purview describing conditions as “almost sweatshop-level.”</p><p>“Perfectly aligned with Valnet’s long-term growth strategy, <em>Polygon</em> will now integrate Valnet’s Gaming Portfolio, which includes industry-leading publications such as <em>Game Rant</em>, <em>TheGamer</em>, <em>Fextralife</em>, <em>OpenCritic</em>, <em>DualShockers</em>, and <em>HardcoreGamer</em>,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250501630767/en/Valnet-Acquires-Premium-Gaming-Publication-Polygon-from-Vox-Media">the company said in a press release</a>. “This addition follows Valnet’s recent acquisition of <em>FextraLife</em> earlier this year, further strengthening its position in the gaming media landscape. With Valnet’s proven operational excellence, <em>Polygon</em> is poised to reach new editorial heights through focused investment and innovation.”</p><p>Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff said in a statement that “this transaction will enable us to focus our energies and investment resources in other priority areas of growth across our portfolio of iconic digital publications and audio / video programming, while enabling Valnet to grow their leadership and authority in the gaming information category.” In his message to staff, Bankoff also cited the current “uncertain economic outlook” and broader changes in the gaming industry as contributing reasons to the sale.</p><p>“I’m no longer with Polygon,” says former <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26">editor-in-chief Chris Plante</a>. “If you’re hiring, please consider the many talented writers and editors now on the market.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> has fallen from grace a touch, it seems. The dress-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> arrived on Steam last week, almost five months since it launched on the Epic Games Store, but it did so with quite a few caveats. For starters, the game's latest update 1.5 arrived around the same time, leading to a plethora of issues with the game, quite notably frequent crashes. Then there's also been a large number of Chinese players expressing their frustration with some of the changes on the game's Steam forusm, namely the increase in cost of banners. This has led to the game hitting a Mixed rating on Steam, so the game's dev has come out with a big ole apology literally asking for "one more chance."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The apology was shared over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikkiofficial/comments/1karmi3/apology_letter_regarding_version_15_gaming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">official Infinity Nikki subreddit</a>, where the devs admitted to falling "short of expectations. Following the version update, we received a lot of feedback regarding game experience issues, primarily concerning the DIY Workshop, co-op feature, and overall game performance, including issues such as login failures, crashes, and resolution problems."
</p>
<p>
However, on that point of the cost of banners, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/papergames">Papergames</a> didn't seem quite so willing to make a change. You see, some new five-star outfits now cost 11 pieces, where they'd either been nine or ten before, making the odds to pull them a lot harder. 
</p>
<p>
Papergames tried to justify this by saying they "introduced highly dynamic special effects for the pieces and special aurora effects for the hair" with these new banners, apologising for the "lack of prior communication regarding this adjustment," and promising that the number of pieces in five-star outfits is guaranteed not to exceed 11. A noticeable lack of saying "yeah we're not going to make them cost that much anymore" for my liking.
</p>
<p>
It's clear Papergames have been a touch shaken by this response given that they also asked everyone to "Please give us one more chance - to let Nikki's starlight continue to shine for us all, and to keep the warmth in our hearts forever burning bright." At least they're keeping their copy consistent.

Come this holiday season, first-party Xbox games will cost $80. </p><p>Much of this is likely due to President Trump’s rollercoaster tariffs against nearly every nation on the planet, something Nintendo confirmed was a factor and which Microsoft has implied in the act of increasing U.S. prices  far more than it’s raising UK prices. And while Sony is holding out for now on $80 games, the company has already raised prices on its PlayStation consoles multiple times this generation even before Trump’s tariffs, so I expect it to increase prices on games and devices sooner than later as well. </p><p>All of this works out pretty well for Take-Two and Rockstar Games, as both companies were likely planning to slap (at least) an $80 price tag  on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6. </em></p><p>Previously, before all this news, I could imagine Rockstar being a bit nervous to be the first major company to pull the trigger on selling a game for $80. (To note: As of May 1, Rockstar has yet to officially announce a price. This is all speculation.) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/70-dollar-games-60-ubisoft-ea-gotham-knights-ps5-xbox-1849593604?_gl=1*1pc8x2x*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjExMTE2OC42MS4wLjE3NDYxMTExNzAuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/70-dollar-games-60-ubisoft-ea-gotham-knights-ps5-xbox-1849593604?_gl=1*1pc8x2x*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjExMTE2OC42MS4wLjE3NDYxMTExNzAuNTguMC4w">They may have anticipated a lot of backlash</a></span> to such a move. A lot of negative headlines. It would have been painful, even if in the end millions would still have forked over $80 for what is likely to be one of the biggest video games ever made. </p><p>But now, well, damn, things are working out pretty well for Rockstar Games. When they eventually announce a release date and reveal<em> GTA 6</em> will cost $80, the world will have already gone through the sticker shock and Rockstar won’t have to deal with nearly as much backlash. </p><p>And yes, I’m pretty dang sure Rockstar is going to charge $80 for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. You can argue all day that, well, Take-Two and Rockstar might want to go with a lower price to saturate the market or build up an audience that will pump money into <em>GTA 6</em>'s online mode. But this is <em>GTA 6</em>. Rockstar could charge $300 a copy and still sell a few million on launch day. The hype and demand for this game is unreal. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-gtavi-grand-theft-auto-price-70-take-two-ceo-t2-1851489239?_gl=1*zezcff*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjEwOTY2OC4zNDMuMS4xNzQ2MTExNzU0LjE0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-gtavi-grand-theft-auto-price-70-take-two-ceo-t2-1851489239?_gl=1*zezcff*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjEwOTY2OC4zNDMuMS4xNzQ2MTExNzU0LjE0LjAuMA..">There was no way this thing, which has been in development for a long time and has a huge budget, was going to cost just $60.</a></span> </p><p>I mean, look at it this way: Do you really think Rockstar and Take-Two are going to be let Nintendo get away with charging $80 for the next<em> Mario Kart </em>game, while not doing the same for the next <em>Grant Theft Auto</em> sequel? No way. The real question now is whether Rockstar and Take-Two think they can charge $90 or even $100 for the game. Before everyone began slapping $80 price tags on video games this month, I’d probably have said that’s too much. However, these days, it’s looking more and more plausible. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Oblivion Remastered</a> is hiding an NPC voiced by Bethesda Game Studios head and creative director Todd Howard, just like in the original Oblivion.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its new Unreal Engine 5 coat of paint and a few other tweaks, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">surprise release of Oblivion Remastered</a> is largely the same Oblivion from almost 20 years ago. That means it still has many of the fun quirks that give the 2006 version so much of its personality, ranging from humorous bugs to an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-makes-the-originals-most-infamous-dialogue-blooper-even-better/1100-6531066/" data-ref-id="1100-6531066">infamous voice line</a> mix-up.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wZwGpgcHH0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7wZwGpgcHH0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That also means it includes a secret house where players can talk to, piss off, and persuade Howard. As broken down by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/oblivion-remastered-todd-howard-easter-egg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> and shown in videos like this one from user Uzis on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wZwGpgcHH0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, he's not in the game proper--players won't bump into him just casually walking the streets of the Imperial City. Instead, players need to use a console command to teleport to a hidden test house by bringing up the in-game console commands on PC and typing "coc toddtest" and pressing Enter.</p><p dir="ltr">Inside the house, players will find an NPC named Alban Corinis wearing Elven armor. Talking to him at first reveals he doesn't initially have Howard's voice, instead reciting a bit of quest dialogue by a different NPC. Afterwards, however, players can choose between a number of different conversation topics like Angry, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.</p><p dir="ltr">Clicking these emotion-based topics will see the NPC react accordingly in Howard's voice. The dialogue choices are actually bypassing Oblivion's confusing persuasion minigame to change the NPC's disposition, and players can see the results by once again setting the Howard-voiced NPC to Neutral.</p><p dir="ltr">Howard will reply in all kinds of ways, ranging from saying "You are indeed a bastard" when he's angry to being madly in love when he says "I can't recall ever loving moments, like this moment, with you."</p><p dir="ltr">Since Howard is far from a professional voice actor and was just recording these lines as a test, it all comes across as a bit strange when he's acting surprised and exclaiming, "Oh no! What do we do? I'm so scared!" or confessing his love.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, all part of Oblivion's charm. As noted in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">Oblivion Remastered review</a>, the game's rough edges, strange-looking characters, and sometimes-confusing mechanics are part of what give it its character. Retaining all that weirdness for Oblivion Remastered, including this strange Howard test NPC, is just another example of why the original game is beloved by so many.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release date remains a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xbox-stop-trying-to-make-silksong-happen-its-not-going-to-happen">shitpost</a>, beyond that it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-release-date-confirmed-for-2025">fall in 2025</a>, but we do at least now know that you'll be able to play it in September, as long as you go to one particular museum in Melbourne, Australia. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The museum in question is the National Museum of Screen Culture, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum">IGN</a>. A playable version of Team Cherry's long-awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> will apparently be on display there from September 18th, together with materials from the game's development. Will the exhibited version be the finished version, and if so, can we assume that Silksong will be on sale before then? Reader, your guess is as good as mine. Team Cherry do love to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed-because-its-gotten-quite-big">lead their fans a merry dance</a>. There are gods and oceans more knowable than Team Cherry. There are fairy queens less fey. Mind you, it doesn't help that people keep coming up with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">conspiracy theories about cake</a>.
</p>
<p>
Silksong will form part of an exhibition called Game Worlds, which features levels from 30 games including World Of Warcraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neopets">Neopets</a>. Co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell have this to say: "From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet's different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game's most challenging boss fights - and of course, having the game playable in-gallery - our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We're so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"

<p>
They've also shared the above sheet of the aforesaid hundreds of sprite animations. I'm pretty sure my body isn't capable of that many sprites. I risk putting my hip out if I go over 30. Anyway, I wonder how many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> players are even now booking airline tickets. Perhaps the secret agenda here is to get more gamers into museums?

The company is run by Hassan Youssef, who got his start in digital media with online porn websites. “The addition of Polygon not only strengthens our editorial muscle but also amplifies our ability to deliver unmatched value to both audiences and advertisers,” Youssef said in a press release today.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a report earlier this year by<em> TheWrap</em></a></span>, many former contributors accused Valnet’s current media holdings of being exploitative content mills. “In journalism, there are really bad jobs.
