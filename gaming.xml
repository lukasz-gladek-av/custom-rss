            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-online-summer-update-info<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has released new information about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>summer update, which will let you engage in your very own brand of vigilante justice.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/1774797o5ka358/coming-this-summer-a-new-brand-of-vigilante-justice" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new blog post</a>, Rockstar says the update, which doesn't have a release date yet, will allow you to start up and run "your very own bail enforcement and bounty hunting business" in order to "clean up the roving reprobates of Southern San Andreas".</p>

<p>Even if you're not interested in dispensing the San Andreas version of frontier justice, though, there's still plenty for you to look forward to in this summer's&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-cars.jpg?itok=jVKMj2HE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-cars.jpg?itok=xt2Gf_Wz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new goodies are coming your way in this summer's&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll get the chance to help Vincent with a "range of off-the-books enforcement activities", for instance, and if you're into racing, you can also look forward to new cars to collect.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of using&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>'s Creator feature, then you'll be pleased to know that this summer's update is bringing the opportunity to create custom Drag and Drift Race circuits. More units will be added across all tracks too, including crowd animations and "bouncing lowriders". Nice.</p>

<p>Testing races should also be easier, since you'll be able to test your races from any checkpoint you choose. In short, if you like creating&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>races, you should be looking forward to this update.</p>

<p>A number of smaller updates and tweaks are on the way too, including a boosted Sell Mission timer, buffs to the Sparrow and Bombushka aircraft, and more. We'll likely get more info as we get closer to the release date, whenever that happens to be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-new-car.jpg?itok=Pm2hsOvw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-new-car.jpg?itok=ZplG5ra5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Seriously, the new&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update really hopes you love cars.</figcaption></figure><p>More info is coming soon, so make sure to keep an eye out on Rockstar's socials and other channels if you want to learn more about this summer's&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update.</p>

<p><em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>may still be going strong, but its days in the sun may be numbered, at least in its current form. Rockstar is currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a>, the next mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>series, and it's not clear how that new game will affect&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>yet.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more news on all things&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>, as well as all things Rockstar in general.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/enshrouded-releases-melodies-of-the-mire-update-adding-musical-instruments-for-fireside-jamming-sessions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The team at Keen Games has released its second update for Enshrouded, known as Melodies of the Mire.</p>
<p>As you may have surmised from the name, this rather chunky update introduces musical instruments into the game, including lutes, harps, drums, and flutes. Players will be able to learn how to craft instruments from a new NPC, Valory of the Silverstrings. More instruments will be added further down the line.</p>
<p>In addition to this musical side of things, Melodies of the Mire also introduces a new area to Enshrouded: The Blackmire. This can be found in the north of the Revelwoods, with the developer stating things here are "a little bit bigger". This area holds a number of new quests, enemies, items and so forth for players to discover, as well as new floral pads which can be used as a kind of natural trampoline. You can take a little peek at The Blackmire in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Enshrouded players will also be able to get their hands on the game's first dual-wield weapon. These daggers, Keen said, are ideal for the Ranger class, adding it has also made improvements to the game's combat more generally.</p>
<p>"We can also confirm that the <em>number one most requested feature</em> on Feature Upvote currently will be included: player progression and world progression," Keen Games added. "Now, players can complete quests already finished by admins of other servers on their own time."</p>

<p>Eurogamer contributor Emma Kent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-a-survival-game-enshrouded-feels-too-safe">took a look at Enshrouded</a> earlier this year, calling it an "ambitious project in terms of scope, made all the more impressive by the fact it's still only in early access". While at the time she felt there was room for improvement, this is something today's update will perhaps address.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorry-were-closed">Sorry We're Closed</a>, an axe-murdering entrepreneur called Jenny is described in newspaper clippings as both a serial embezzler and as the city's "wealthiest bachelorette". Aside from being a dry reflection of tabloid reporting on women who commit crimes (bad woman! sexy, bad woman!) this is also the kind of incidental character-building you can expect in this perky, retro-styled survival horror. It plays like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a> charged with the hot pink body horror of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/porpentine">Porpentine</a> interactive fiction. And judging by my hour of unsettled strolling through the decrepit tube station of the game's demo, it's a powerful combo.</p>

<p>You play a moping break-up victim called Michelle in her "final days" as she becomes cursed with a third eye. Soon enough she is stumbling through grotty corridors and taking panicked potshots at twisted monsters that simply will not die. It's all given that late-90s Resident Evil look with cameras both fixed and following. By the time you encounter Jenny, she has already killed a man, ripped the paper money from his pockets, and shoved them into her mouth, yelling "MAXIMISE PROFITS!" She's a real catch.</p>

<p>I'm not the first of us to crawl through the demo, of course. "Its layers of London are like Silent Hill by way of Persona and Paradise Killer," said Alice O (RPS in peace) when she added it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">our 75 most anticipated games of 2024</a> list. She was not wrong. </p>
<p>It gets the feel of those old games spot on. What's more, it's adept at survival horror's old habit of understatement (aka. the <a href="https://i.redd.it/lze4f0atwue21.jpg">"doghouse"</a> effect). In one room, a portrait of a terrifying woman looms over you, her white eyes and noseless face staring into your soul. "She is well-dressed," says the game. In another room, you find the twisted corpses of some otherworldly creatures hanging from the walls, perhaps they are even humans, mutilated beyond recognition. "This display has a strong smell," it says.</p>
<p>I love this. The detached narrator voice that accompanies environmental moments in old horror games, aside from being incredibly comical, suggests a kind of mental shutdown. As if part of the game itself remains in denial. As if the puppet masters of this world, perhaps even the player themselves, are detached and unmoved by the terror that assails Heather Mason or Jill Valentine. You never find a pile of severed heads and bloodied torsos. You find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwkr8x1fir5g41.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D1e29729b831d1808d4c1b0e53c2f234f85b5e6c9">"nothing unusual here"</a>.</p>
<p>But I've focused on perhaps the wrong thing. When you play, you'll be too busy using our hero's third eye to change the environment immediately around your character. This is partly cosmetic; viscera-coated cages turn into simple vending machines as you pass by. A huge rusty safe, under the lamplight of your third eye, becomes a pile of ordinary luggage. </p>

<p>It also has a practical effect. Thorny obstructions in the grimey world are reduced to spindly stalks you can pass through freely. Bathroom sinks that dispense filthy water in the disgust-dimension will spurt out clean water under the influence of the third eye's aura, restoring your health. Enemies meanwhile, will be briefly stunned when you click your fingers to activate the eye, and a weak point gets revealed when they step into the aura. Prime shootin'. So long as you remember that anything outside the aura cannot be struck.</p>
<p>There was a period in which old games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> were obsessed with the idea of two parallel dimensions existing within the same space. But the technical solutions applied to that idea always meant it felt like you were merely stepping from one space into another. Sorry We're Closed chases the same dimension-hopping dream as those old designers but applies the modern approach that allows you to see the difference between realms in real time. </p>
<p>This may not seem significant to many players in the post-Portal, post-Titanfall 2 world we live in today, but if the creators at Team Silent in 2003 could be shown the third eye effects of Sorry We're Closed (and, come to think of it, Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a>), their noughties eyeballs probably would have popped out of their sockets and rolled into a fetid drain. As a developer that must be worth some pride, to know that you've got a tool in your rusty toolbox that the horror heroes of yesteryear would have loved to use, if only they'd had the chance.</p>

</ul>
</section>
<p>In the beginning, it was about respect.</p>
<p>The video games industry in the 1990s didn't get any. Tom Kalinskie, who led Sega America during this time, recounts two stories that sums up the world's attitude towards gaming.</p>
<p>The first came about during the famous 1993 – 1994 US senate hearings around violent video games. Kalinskie had been called in by his own senators to talk about the issue, and he explained how games are not just for kids.</p>
<p>"They scoffed," he recalled. "They couldn't believe it. "Are you kidding me? Everyone knows video games are just children's products. You shouldn't be doing these aggressive things'. And they basically tossed me out of their offices in DC."</p>
<p>Later on, Kalinskie visited Jack Valenti, the head of the Motion Pictures Association, to ask if video games could use the same age ratings system as the film industry, especially as everyone was so familiar with it. Valenti refused. He didn't understand why the huge movie industry would lend the tiny games industry its rating system.</p>
<p>US Government scrutiny over violent video games is what ultimately led to the formation of the Interactive Digital Software Association (today called the Entertainment Software Association), a dedicated trade body set up by the games industry, initially,  to create a ratings system for games (and thus avoiding any Government legislation). The games industry had finally unified, and it was through this new organization that it would start to push back. Part of that, it became apparent, was having its own event to showcase the medium.</p>
<p>Back in 1994, the games industry would descend upon the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to showcase its games and consoles to retailers and media.</p>
<blockquote><p>"CES didn't care a jot about video games"</p><cite>Tom Kalinskie, former Sega US boss</cite></blockquote>
<p>"CES didn't care a jot about video games," recalls Kalinskie.</p>
<p>"It was bad enough they used to put us at the back of the big hall, but one year they put us out the back door under a large tent. You had to walk past all the porn sections to get to us. It rained that year in Las Vegas, and there was a leak over the Sega area and water dripped on my Sega Genesis consoles. And I said: 'That's it, we're never doing this again, we will do our own show.'"</p>
<p>The games industry tried to negotiate with CES to improve how video games were being represented, but to no avail. So the IDEA partnered with the International Data Group, an organisation that ran the GamePro magazine and the Macworld conventions, to build out a dedicated video games trade show. CES made a last ditch effort to counter the event, but the damage was done. E3 was born.</p>
<p>"Gary Shapiro [head of the Consumer Technology Association, which ran CES] called it Black Thursday, because everyone was faxing in their CES cancellations every half an hour," remembers Mary Dolaher, who effectively ran E3 from its inception until its final physical show in 2019.</p>
<p>Peter Moore, who exhibited at E3 from 1999 with Sega, Microsoft and then EA, adds: "We were craving attention and relevance. We were much maligned as a medium by Hollywood, by TV, by music. I testified in front of the senate on behalf of video games in 2000, and games were seen as the root of all evil. I always remember 'Call of Duty killer' headlines in the UK. Video games were an easy target. I was involved, working with the ESA and the industry, in building out this tentpole moment to say 'Look at us. Look at what we're doing for entertainment'."</p>
<p>The first E3 in 1995 may not have been as excessive as the years that followed, but it was a dramatic and competitive event. Nintendo, Sony and Sega were all there demonstrating their new consoles: The Ultra 64, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Nintendo's console was still a year away, so all eyes were on Sony and Sega and their CD-based machines.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Bar brief trips to Atlanta and Santa Monica, E3's home was the Los Angeles Convention Center</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sega was hugely popular in the US at the time, but there were concerns around the Saturn's technical capabilities, and there was significant buzz around Sony's machine. So Sega made the decision to surprise launch the Saturn during E3 – four months earlier than planned – and get ahead of its new rival.</p>
<p>"I was not in love with the Saturn architecture, and my head of R&amp;D, Joe Miller, wasn't either," Kalinskie tells us. "We felt it needed to be a bigger step-up than it was. And then I was forced to introduce it at that E3, and I really didn't want to. I had three titles, maybe, I didn't have enough hardware. But Japan forced me to do it."</p>
<p>Sony countered with a surprise of its own. PlayStation's US boss Steve Race took to the stage and simply said '299'. It was a killer punch. Sony's console would be $100 cheaper than Sega's.</p>
<p>"Ah, the shortest speech in E3 history," laughs Race. "Right up until that morning we were still debating the price. We were wrestling with the Japanese to get to that magic $299 price point. I have no idea what I'd have said if they'd insisted on $399. As you could tell, I didn't have a speech prepared for that situation."</p>
<h2 id="section-1">The console war battleground</h2>
<p>From that moment on, E3 became synonymous with platform battles, as the major hardware manufacturers  battled it out in Downtown LA.</p>
<p>"E3 was the battleground for the console war," recalls Moore.</p>
<p>"The question of 'Who won E3?' was always what people wanted to know. Who had the best press conferences? Who had the most engaging content? Who had the biggest crowds? It was fighting and scrapping for the leadership position in an industry that was growing exponentially. E3 was both the battleground as well as the canvas on which we painted our industry."</p>
<blockquote><p>"In the old days it was Wild West, it was what you could get away with and still get gamers to believe you were showing them real games."</p><cite>Peter Moore, former Sega, Xbox and EA exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>Moore's first taste of the console war was when the Sega Dreamcast went toe-to-toe with PlayStation 2, and it was a bruising encounter.</p>
<p>"My fight with PlayStation goes back to the Sega days, when Sony just FUDed us… putting 'fear, uncertainty and doubt' in the minds of the gamer," Moore explains.</p>
<p>"Go look at Kessen and The Bouncer. Those were PS2 games that went up against us. They were cinematics. They certainly weren't gameplay, and probably weren't even in-engine. Even 24 years later, I still remember those games. I was a layman at the time. I was just some shoe guy from Reebok who had been dropped into the video game industry. And I was thinking: 'There is no way these games will look like that'. In those days you could get away with that because there was less scrutiny from media and regulators. Now, the FTC has got involved to tell people to be honest with what they're showing. But in the old days it was Wild West, it was what you could get away with and still get gamers to believe you were showing them real games."</p>

<figcaption>Peter Moore announcing GTA IV on Xbox 360, which was a major coup for the console</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Moore got a second crack at PlayStation when he switched to Microsoft and launched the Xbox 360, and this time he was ready.</p>
<p>"They tried to FUD us with PS3, but that just didn't work. The pricing was wrong… we had our challenges, like the Red Ring of Death, but we got out ahead of them.</p>
<p>"It was a real battle. If you go back and see me with a Halo 2 tattoo, or later a GTA 4 tattoo… I was just sticking it to PlayStation with a bit of Scouse in-your-face aggression. PlayStation came up with a trailer for Killzone that was just total bullshit, and we knew it. They knew they needed to counter-punch, because we were ahead of them in terms of the Xbox 360 launch. So they created a movie and alluded that it was how the game would look, which of course it didn't."</p>
<p>The PS3 era was a low point in Sony's storied history with E3. Shawn Layden, who held numerous leadership roles at PlayStation, recalls the calamitous E3 press event in 2006 where PS3 was revealed.</p>
<p>"We were setting up the stage, and then all of a sudden everything crashed. We had engineers there, we were rebooting, we were updating code in real time to make sure these things were running. We ended up making people wait for over two hours outside in the Southern Californian heat for the PlayStation 3 press conference, because we couldn't stabilise the code on stage.</p>
<p>"And then later on when we announced that PlayStation 3 was going to be available for the low, low price of $599 for the 60GB version. And the massive groan that went around the room. I have a lot of hard memories around the PS3 years at E3."</p>
<p>Nintendo has largely separated itself from the console war these days, but it certainly enjoyed getting one over its rivals at E3. And whereas 2006 may have been an event to forget for Sony, it was quite the opposite for Nintendo.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I remembered a sea of people running through Sony's booth to get into line to try the Wii"</p><cite>Rob Matthews, former Nintendo and Xbox exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>"We were launching Wii and didn't know how it was going to go," recalls Rob Matthews, who was Nintendo’s head of consumer marketing at the time.</p>
<p>"The main way you came into the E3 hall meant that people had to walk around Sony's booth to get to ours. I was there on the upper deck as the doors opened, and I remembered a sea of people running through Sony's booth to get into line to try the Wii for the first time. I was like 'Wow. We've got something special here'."</p>
<p>"That was true," agrees Perrin Kaplan, who was Nintendo's VP of marketing and corporate affairs and now co-runs PR agency Zebra Partners. Our booths were next to each other, and people just cut through. We had a line that was wrapped twice around what was a very large booth. [Wii] was absolutely industry-shifting and it was neat to be part of that."</p>
<p>E3 was a competitive show. Rivals openly ridiculed each other (who could forget<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA"> Sony's video mocking Xbox One's game sharing options</a> in 2013?), and there were even stories of sabotage (Kalinskie claims Sony deflated his giant Sonic balloon in 1995). And that competitiveness played out in the halls of E3, where Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox could be found side-by-side.</p>
<p>"It was cool when all the big three were in the same hall together," says Matthews, who later left Nintendo to join Xbox and was responsible for the firm’s E3 efforts.</p>
<p>"It kept us all on our toes. Xbox was inevitably always right next to Sony. I remember our big green glowing wall next to their big blue glowing wall. And there is that famous picture of right down the hall with the two logos facing off.</p>
<p>"We were frenemies for that whole endeavour. We were doing something for the bigger cause of video games around the world. If you look at the smaller brands, and the accessory brands and the companies who wouldn't normally be able to make a dent in their marketing if it wasn't for the big three or four putting them on stage... We would compete vigorously with each other all throughout the year, but we also realised that we were all in the same small industry and doing something special."</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Making E3 PG-13</h2>
<p>After E3's debut year, the event went into overdrive. Companies were fighting over space in the halls, the parties got bigger and the costs just kept on going up and up.</p>
<p>"The excesses were always excessive," Layden remembers of the early E3s.</p>
<p>"The two years at Atlanta, Georgia were crazy years [E3 temporarily left the Los Angeles Convention Center in 1997 and 1998 due to building work]. The industry was making a lot of money. Back then, Tomb Raider was the biggest thing in the world and there was this huge party, which was as crazy and debauched as you might imagine. But that was the industry. We were becoming really successful. It was an industry coming out of mum's basement."</p>
<p>This level of success attracted unwanted attention. The E3 organisers had to adopt increasingly more stringent vetting processes to prevent undesirable companies getting in. Businesses would claim to have a game only to turn out to be something else entirely (such as a talent agency promoting models).</p>
<p>E3 also reflected the young, male-dominated nature of the industry at the time. Female models wearing revealing outfits were commonplace.  In 2003, Nokia even announced the price of its N-Gage games phone by having a model remove her top to reveal the price on her stomach. And things would go even further on the E3 show floor.</p>
<p>"Each year the exhibitors would push the envelope a bit further in trying to get attention," Dolaher says. "One particular company had booked a small 10x10 booth, and they had a woman who would strip down to basically nothing. We had ESA members come to us and say 'If this is what companies need to do to sell their game, then maybe they shouldn't be on the show floor'."</p>
<p>The offending company refused to leave the show when asked, so Dolaher shut off the booth's power. In protest, the company tried to auction the model's underwear online, prompting the E3 organiser to go even further.</p>
<p>"I shrink wrapped them," she laughs. "We got huge rolls of plastic wrap and we covered the entire booth. We left the top open because he refused to leave. I said 'Okay, I'll leave you some air'. It was hysterical."</p>
<blockquote><p>"One particular company had booked a small booth, and they had a woman who would strip down to basically nothing"</p><cite>Mary Dolaher, E3 organiser</cite></blockquote>
<p>The incident prompted a change in the rules over what was acceptable attire at E3.</p>
<p>"We worked with all the member companies and asked them what they thought was appropriate and how they wanted us to write the rules. I called everyone in the event industry that I knew. Most didn't have it as bad as us. It was over-the-top. We decided that everyone had to show us their uniforms and costumes in advance for approval</p>
<p>"Then we would do the searches on the show floor. It was very labour-intensive, but it was worth it. We just made the event PG-13. Dresses had to be X amount of inches, and shorts couldn't be worn, and no thongs and things like that. It seemed crazy at the time… but I tell you, the death threats I was getting were awful.</p>
<p>"People were saying I was an old ugly b*** who probably drives a minivan. And I was like 'Hey, I draw a line at minivan'."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">The Santa Monica experiment</h2>
<p>E3’s goal of attracting mainstream attention was succeeding. Politicians and celebrities would make appearances at the event, and this brought in all sorts of media to the show.</p>
<p>"In the mid-2000s, it was the mainstream, popular, TV channels, the likes of CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC… they would send film crews and correspondents to the show floor of E3," Moore says. "And that gave us that sense of relevance and deserved acclaim in what we were doing."</p>
<p>However, as E3 got bigger, noisier and more expensive, ESA members started to become dissatisfied. With 60,000 people descending upon the LA Convention Center, it was proving harder to get actual business done, and the industry insisted things had to change. This led to the creation of the E3 Media &amp; Business Summit. Between 2007 and 2008, E3 was capped to just 5,000 people in a hangar in Santa Monica, with various press events held in hotels around the area. It was a logistical nightmare (there were very few places to park trucks), and despite the smaller size, remained expensive to produce.</p>

</figure>
<p>"It was a disaster," recalls Moore.</p>
<p>Dolaher adds: "There was no pizazz, none of that big stuff you did with the media. And the industry felt it."</p>
<p>Despite it being a clear low point in E3's story, Dolaher credits the Santa Monica experiment as effectively saving the show.</p>
<p>"This happened during a time of transition in ESA leadership, and luckily, we were able to convince the Board to downsize the show instead of discontinuing it altogether. It was a huge challenge logistically, but in the end it kept E3 alive long enough for it to come back later at full force. In 2009 we reinvented the show back in Downtown LA and launched with 41,000 attendees."</p>
<h2 id="section-4">The famous faces of E3</h2>
<p>The excess soon returned. E3 was the games industry’s Hollywood event. In fact, part of the reason the event was held in LA was to attract the attention of the wider entertainment world, and it worked, with actors, athletes and musicians making regular appearances.</p>
<p>Most people we spoke to had a celebrity story of some description. Leon Winkler, who ran Ubisoft's E3 showing from 2014 onwards, recalls the surreal moment he pitched E3 to It's Always Sunny star Rob McElhenney (to promote his Ubisoft-backed sitcom Mythic Quest), and the time he shared a cigarette with Elijah Wood.</p>
<p>"We talked about his work and his time in Amsterdam when he did Amsterdam things. It's these human moments that create the memories," Winkler says.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Peter Moore with Steven Spielberg at E3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Moore was frequently paired on stage with sports stars, or tasked with guiding Steven Spielberg around his booth.</p>
<p>"One of my favourite memories was being with Mohammed Ali backstage," Moore begins.</p>
<p>"That was during my Xbox days. EA Sports was coming hard on the platform. And because of games like Fight Night and Knockout Kings, we managed to get Mohammed to come with us. He was, unfortunately, well into his Parkinsons then. My job for a few minutes was to look after him, if you will, just off stage. There was this screen with what we were showing, and Halo was on it. And in it there was Master Chief taking down a Brute. The Brute then goes down with a crash. Mohammed couldn't speak other than a slight whisper, and his way of communicating was via little magic tricks, which were wonderful. But at that moment he leaned over to me and he goes: "Down. Goes. Fraiser". Which is a very famous boxing call from Howard Cosell that I knew very well. That was a moment I'll never forget. Then we walked out on stage."</p>
<p>Many legends and famous faces have walked the stages of E3 down the years, from Pele to The Beatles. And Keanu Reeves’s 'You're breathtaking' line at E3 2019 may go down as the show's last truly iconic moment.</p>
<p>However, arguably the biggest star of E3 remains one of our own.</p>
<p>"We had so many celebrities on our stage," says Matthews. "We had Usher. We had The Beatles. But out of all the celebrity meetings you can have, the one most impactful for me was meeting Shigeru Miyamoto."</p>
<p>Perrin Kaplan laughs: "Our biggest challenge every year was getting Mr Miyamoto from the front door of the Convention Center to the booth without being late. We loved people saying hi, or doing autographs, but getting him through that daily was really tough.</p>
<p>"Really early on, he would still wonder why all these people wanted to talk to him. I had to tell him, 'Your games inspired them. You're an original, man'."</p>
<blockquote><p>"Our biggest challenge every year was getting Mr Miyamoto from the front door of the Convention Center to the booth"</p><cite>Perrin Kaplan, former Nintendo exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>Miyamoto had a few iconic E3 moments. Probably the most famous was in 2004, when he appeared on stage with a sword and shield after the debut of the trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and was greeted by weeping fans and thunderous applause.</p>
<p>Ubisoft created a similar moment in 2017 during its reveal of Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle, where Miyamoto and Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stood back-to-back wielding replicas of the game's guns.</p>
<p>"When I first pitched that idea with Nintendo, they were not sure and thought it should be more serious," Winkler says. "And the idea of having that smoke machine when Miyamoto walked into the auditorium, with the lights in the background… they were like 'I dunno'. But we said, 'Just try it out, we'll do it on site, if he gets enthusiastic about it, we'll do it'. And on the day he was like 'Yeah, this is cool'.</p>
<p>"Now we have two legends on stage, Miyamoto and Yves, and they have guns. So let's create the picture of E3 with them back-to-back. That picture was everywhere when people were talking about E3 that year."</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption>Ubisoft's iconic E3 image with Miyamoto and Guillemot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yet for all the famous faces, Winkler says it was the human moments that made E3 special. That iconic Mario + Rabbids pose may have been the picture of the show, but it was the footage of the game's creative director, Davide Soliani, in tears that resonated the most.</p>
<p>"That's the cool thing about events; you can show the human side of the work that we do. I could see in rehearsals that Davide was getting emotional, and I thought 'Maybe we should get a camera moment ready for that'. Because it is important. It humanises us as an industry. It's Davide, who has been a Nintendo fan since he was a kid, and now his idol is on stage giving him props… I would cry, too."</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Giant booths, 87-piece orchestras, and Cirque du Soleil</h2>
<p>Beyond the celebrities there were the production values. E3 booths were frequently extravagant. Personal favourites of mine include Capcom's recreation of the Resident Evil 7 house, Bethesda's Fallout 76 vault experience, and the absolutely huge Mafia 3 booth, which brought New Orleans to the show floor.</p>
<p>"Game companies have always been extremely competitive, so this manifested itself in the extravagance of the booths," Dolaher says. "With that said, I didn't anticipate having to facilitate things like having Marines rappel down the outside of South and West Halls of LACC, building a full-scale boxing ring in one of the halls, constructing a castle on the show floor, and so much more."</p>
<p>Nintendo's booth was almost always a destination. It was routinely more like something you'd expect to see at Disneyland than a trade show, with its thick plush carpet and impressive set designs. During the Switch era alone, we had recreations of Hyrule, New Donk City (from Super Mario Odyssey) and even Luigi's Mansion.</p>
<p>"It was hard work and expensive, and the person who led it [Don James], led it from the very first show to the last," Kaplan shares. "He's still at Nintendo. I couldn't imagine a more passionate person leading that. For Nintendo, it was just a great creative endeavour. What do we want it to feel like? What's the theme? And we really wanted to build that out so the experience could be extremely satisfying."</p>

<figcaption>Nintendo's booths were always a sight at E3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The extravagance and expense wasn’t just confined to the E3 show floor. Layden recalls Sony's theatrical E3 2016 press conference, complete with live orchestra.</p>
<p>"They'd torn down the sports arena where we had been doing E3 for ten years, so we went to the Shrine Auditorium," he says.  "So many people go there and try to turn it into a modern event hall, but it can't be. It was built in 1927. So we said 'Let's embrace it'. We had the full maroon, velvet scrim that dropped behind the stage. We had an orchestra pit. So we went old school. I had Bear McCreary conducting an orchestra right in front of me. I hit my mark, I make my pivot, Bear pulls his arms up, I nod my head and Bear suspends the orchestra. There is no feeling in the world like walking out on stage to an 87-piece orchestra. There's nothing like that. It was fucking amazing.</p>
<p>"That will be my lasting memory of E3. That, and getting pushed out of the food line by Macy Gray at the PlayStation party. I was standing too long in front of the mash potato, and Macy needed her potatoes."</p>
<figure>

 </a>

<p>If that sounds expensive, consider Microsoft's E3 2010 showcase for Kinect.</p>
<p>"In one of the planning meetings, I kept on saying that we needed to do something different and more unique than just a press conference," remembers Matthews. "I said 'It's about movement and motion. We need to do something like Cirque Du Soleil would do'. And I remember walking out of that meeting, stopping and looking at my head of events and saying 'Heck, we're Xbox, why don't we just call Cirque Du Soleil?'</p>
<p>"We gave them a call the next day. We flew out to see them the next week. We were up in Montreal. We told them the story of Kinect and the vision, and they flew down two weeks later. We were in a conference room at Microsoft, and the creative director of Cirque Du Soleil comes in with several of his staff. He hits play on a sound system, and this crazy surreal music starts to play. They turn down the lights, they light these twinkling lights around the room, and then he starts with 'It's beyond the beginning of time', and he throws a bucket of sand onto the conference table 'And the people of the world are primitive'.</p>
<p>"And that was our show. I stood in that arena after we did it live, and I called my wife and said: 'This is one of those moments in your career that you never thought would happen, but I am always going to remember'."</p>
<p>The 'live' element of E3 was often a terrifying experience. During the Cirque Du Soleil rehearsal, Matthews remembered how the rotating stage wasn't moving at the right time, the screens were out-of-sync, the scoreboards in the arena randomly turned on at one point… but that was the only rehearsal. The next time it was performed, it was live (and thankfully, it went 'flawlessly').</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Xboxcirque.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Outside of performances, the other challenge was making sure the game demos didn't break.</p>
<p>"Shit goes wrong all the time," Moore says. "We would always ghost ride behind a game… so you'd have another console running the demo in parallel. I remember Gears of War crashed… but it was almost unknown to the audience because we clicked the input and the ghost rider took over. A few people might have gone 'What just happened?', but not many. We were a pretty well-oiled machine in all my three iterations of Sega, Xbox and EA."</p>
<p>Matthews adds: "I can't tell you how many back-ups upon back-up systems that we would run to make those shows go."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no amount of back-up systems could prepare for human error.</p>
<p>"One time, I played Rock Band live with Harmonix, and I accidentally paused the game, and I think a million people laughed at me," Moore recalls fondly. "In rehearsal it was fine, but when we went live I realised there was a slight lag from where I was looking at the screen and bizarrely I… I think of that and I smile, but also feel a bit of horror."</p>
<h2 id="section-6">EA, Sony, and Microsoft leave the LACC</h2>
<p>E3 was expensive and a huge amount of work. The whole industry was geared around it. Companies held back announcements for that week, developers would build dedicated game demos, and there were teams working on it all year long.</p>
<p>"We basically produced the equivalent of the Grammys every year with the main press conference and show," Matthews says. "There was a big part of my team where that was what they did for the best part of a year."</p>
<p>Layden adds: "The planning was immense, which is why taking E3 out of the schedule has opened up thousands of man hours across the industry. Quite often when you build demo code for E3, it's not game code, it's a discrete piece of work that you create just for that show. And then you throw it away and you go back to working on the main game.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We basically produced the equivalent of the Grammys every year with the main press conference and show"</p><cite>Rob Matthews, former Nintendo and Xbox exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>"The people who organise our E3 show are the people who organise shows for Disney and the networks… TV producer people, basically. It's a high-wire act, and it can be incredibly frightening."</p>
<p>And the financial cost was enormous. "It was in the tens of millions of dollars," Moore says. "Whether that's building out the booth or attending… in those days we were taking 300, 400, 500 people to E3.</p>
<p>"But also you had to look at the productivity cost of taking people away from their day jobs for months to work on booth development, marketing tools, digital assets… everything."</p>
<p>The cost of E3, whether we're talking time or money, was proving harder to justify. E3 was a media and retail event, but the role of retail was becoming smaller in the face of digital distribution. Plus, as the industry evolved, June was often too late to be selling to retailers anyway.</p>
<p>"You had to sell Christmas business in February," Layden explains. "You couldn't wait until June. So by the time E3 came around, you're not selling anything anymore."</p>
<p>Then there was the role of the media. Although still important, publishers were increasingly going direct to consumers with their messaging. Nintendo stopped doing its press conference in 2013 in favour of a pre-recorded video aimed at fans.</p>
<p>"Direct-to-consumer became a bit of the downfall of E3," explains Moore. "Folks in the media became a little less important."</p>
<p>Layden agrees: "For the big companies, it just became a peacocking event. It also wasn't so much about press anymore, because everyone was breaking embargoes anyway, and the press was publishing 24 hours a day… by 2015, E3 had really lost its meaning as a trade show because no trade was really happening."</p>
<p>EA was the first major company to leave E3 in 2016. The publisher was eager to involve fans in its event and after failing to convince the ESA to allow that to happen, it held its own event – EA Play – in the same city just before E3 opened its door.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-06-05-134446.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>EA ran its own event during the E3 period called EA Play since 2016</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"We decided to just do our own," Moore says. "You rent a hotel, and a big space, and then you see how it goes. Once we pulled out, the belief was that the other guys would, too. Maybe it would be a death by 1,000 cuts. I lived through this in my previous life. I watched Nike, Adidas and Reebok pull out of the Super Show in Atlanta, and the thing collapsed completely. It took a little longer with E3, but ultimately, as the industry changed, the need for E3 waned. And from the perspective of spending that kind of money, and not speaking to gamers directly… it seemed kind of reductive to us."</p>
<p>E3 was strict with its exhibitors. If a company dropped out one year, it risked losing its preferred spot on the show floor. That's why one year Capcom took an entire booth primarily to promote its DuckTales remaster, and why Take-Two built a whole booth for invite-only meetings. They wanted to hold their space for the following year.</p>
<p>There was very little flexibility with E3 rules. If you wanted to do something differently, such as what EA wanted to do, then tough.</p>
<p>"You have to apply the rules evenly across the board with everyone, everything down to every last detail in the contracts," Dolaher says. "You'll get someone come up and say 'We are not going to sign it this year, we don't like this clause'. And then we'll say 'Sorry, then you're out. We want you in the show, but we can't be arbitrary and capricious on all of the rules'. It's hard to say no when they're the ones signing your cheque, but it has to be a level playing field for everyone."</p>
<p>The industry was at odds with what they wanted E3 to be. Some publishers wanted a pure B2B show, while others wanted to allow the fans in.</p>
<p>The attempted solution in 2016 was to add something called E3 Live at the neighbouring LA Live complex. But the free event was announced late and the results were poor.</p>
<p>"I have a lot of grey hairs from that," says Dolaher.</p>
<p>"We only had six weeks, because the ESA didn't like the logo and kept holding things up. If we had a full year, we could have populated the whole of LA Live, so the whole campus would have felt like 'Okay, this is where E3 is, but the B2B bit is in the building'. There were so many ways to do it, and we tried a lot of them, but you have to have that industry consensus, because that's where it starts to fall apart."</p>
<p>In the end, the organisers started selling consumer tickets to the main E3 show, with 15,000 going on sale in 2017. But E3 simply wasn't built for gamers, and the next major exit from the show was Sony in 2019.</p>
<p>"E3 couldn't adapt," Layden says.  "It was like 'Well, we'll sell 15,000 consumer tickets.' And I remember fighting with the ESA Board about that. I said 'Pick a lane, you're a consumer show or a trade show, you can't be both.' The physical design of a consumer show is different to a trade show. A trade show you're trying to make it like Ikea, where people can never get out. But with a consumer show, you design it for throughput.</p>
<p>"When E3 started inviting consumers in, and they're waiting for four hours to play Breath of the Wild… that's not a good experience."</p>
<p>Sony, which had been a key part of E3 since its inception, couldn't justify the show anymore.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We promised the ESA that we wouldn't set up a competitive event. They could have their week"</p><cite>Shawn Layden, former PlayStation US CEO</cite></blockquote>
<p>"The press already has your stories, so trying to hold something back for a surprise announcement was getting harder and harder," Layden says. "And then you looked at the cost. The press conference was a tonne of money, then there was the booth on the show floor, and then you're paying drinks, hotels, flights and martinis for 400 people.</p>
<p>"Going into 2019, we looked at it and felt that June was an arbitrary date, we don't have anything in development to go into that window and tell a good story, and if you're doing E3… from January 1 until E3 is over, your dev teams are locked in making demos, and your marketing department is locked in getting the hype machine running. By not doing E3, it gave us three months back into the calendar.</p>
<p>"We promised the ESA that we wouldn't set up a competitive event. We won't do any pressers, or state of the nation addresses… they could have their week."</p>
<p>Another blow was Microsoft's decision to move its booth off the E3 show floor and into the theatre next door, which the company owned at the time.</p>
<p>"Letting Microsoft go there… that is something in the earlier days we would never have done," Dolaher says. "We wouldn't have given them free space, but we would have done what we had to to keep them on the show floor. They own the theater, so what are you going to do? Letting them go over there, letting EA leave and go across town… that was a slow painful death."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Microsoft held its 2019 press conference and expo in collaboration with E3 but in a separate venue</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yet Matthews has a different perspective on the E3 exodus. Microsoft was still eager to support E3. Indeed, tickets to the E3 show floor also got you into Microsoft's event, too. Companies wanted different things from the show, and agreement was hard to come by, but ultimately they were all – PlayStation aside – still doing events during that same period.</p>
<p>"It was an example of the industry's commitment to E3, and commitment to that period in time to still come together as an industry," Matthews says.</p>
<p>"We didn't need to do [our event] that week. We could have done it in the Microsoft Theater at any time during the year. But we committed to doing it. Yeah, we were going to do it a little differently. It was evolution, but a commitment to showing up together and doing something bigger than ourselves."</p>
<h2 id="section-7">The death of E3</h2>
<p>By 2019, E3 was in trouble. The ESA parted company with Dolaher that year to take the event in-house, but then the pandemic hit. E3 2020 was cancelled. There was a 2021 digital event, but it proved costly and it wasn't repeated in 2022.</p>
<p>"COVID was the big proof point," Layden says. "COVID shut down E3 and the video games industry grew revenue. It didn't have the biggest video game show, but it still got bigger as a business. Ask any CFO at any big games company if they want to drop $10 – $15 million that they've not had to spend for three years on E3… and they'll say 'Are you crazy? Look at all that money we saved, and we still grew'."</p>
<blockquote><p>"The industry is in a far better place now because of E3."</p><cite>Peter Moore, former Sega, Xbox and EA exec</cite></blockquote>
<p>The ESA decided a new direction was needed, and turned to ReedPop – organisers of New York Comic-Con and the PAX video game shows (and, at the time, owners of <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>) – to help find it. It was going to be a tight turnaround. By the time ReedPop was brought in, there was less than a year to build a team, speak to the industry and put together a show.</p>
<p>"When Reedpop got involved the whole attitude was not just how do we bring it back, but also how do we evolve it to what's needed," says Guy Blomberg, who was brought in to work on the event. "That was exciting to almost everyone I spoke to."</p>
<p>However, the team encountered an industry divided. "Some wanted a pure consumer show, others just wanted B2B," Blomberg says. "Some only cared about digital, others on the fan experience. Some folks only wanted a repeat of what was before, others wanted to blow it all up and start over.  Everyone wanted something different, it was incredibly difficult to navigate, and there was an equal amount of passion and anger toward the brand – it was honestly exhausting."</p>
<p>ReedPop developed a new format, but not everyone was convinced, and some of those who were interested simply didn't have the line-up to justify an E3 booth. In the end, the 2023 event never happened and ReedPop parted ways with the ESA.</p>
<p>Six months later, E3 was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>The industry reaction online was one of sadness. Winkler described working on E3 as "a dream come true", and for many, simply going to the show was aspirational.</p>
<p>"What kills me… we did a lot of work with Make-A-Wish kids, and we would fly them in, we once had up to 30," Dolaher says. "And we would get them chaperones in the booths, and Microsoft would give them a brand new console… Parents still write to me and say thank you, and it's just soul crushing. It's all those kids wanted. There was no other show like it."</p>
<p>Matthews opines: "E3 was special. You never knew what was going to happen. There was always something that came out of nowhere, and that made it fun and interesting and nerve-wracking. That is the part I am sad about the most, because it is more traditional now. It's like every other industry. We all get our news out the same way. E3 was uniquely video games."</p>
<p>For Layden, he believes there is still a need for something in the old E3 window. But it would need to be for fans, and not take place in Downtown LA.</p>
<p>"I have had outreaches to me from larger concerns to try and figure out what it would take to resuscitate E3," Layden reveals.</p>
<p>"If you could make it a full-on consumer event… And Downtown LA is a terrible place for the show. There's not enough affordable hotels. The venue needs to move, but still needs to stay in California somewhere.</p>
<p>"Gamescom in Europe, Tokyo Games Show in Asia… we have PAX East and West in the US, but they're still minor league shows. You could do a full-on consumer show if you have the right leadership and the right amount of money to do it."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>A major consumer version of E3 in June could work, Layden believes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Indeed, Winkler points to the fact that there are still things happening during the old 'E3 week' as proof that there's still a demand for a physical event in LA. This week, Xbox, Ubisoft and IGN are holding physical events, while Summer Games Fest's Play Days event features titles from EA, PlayStation, Netflix, Amazon, Tencent, Bandai Namco, Capcom and numerous other major companies. It isn't E3. It isn't the big noisy show that echoed around the world. But it is something.</p>
<p>"Most publishers are going to be at Summer Games Fest in one shape or form," Winker observes. "So although they might not be spending the big cash, they still see the value in these in-person face-to-face moments where they can interact with peers and the community. As an events guy… that gives me hope."</p>
<p>Whatever happens next, it's worth considering E3's legacy and what it achieved.</p>
<p>To return to where we started, it was about respect. In 1995, the games industry was being ignored by the media, treated with disdain by politicians and dismissed by Hollywood. Now, video games is the biggest entertainment medium on earth, politicians are supporting it with tax breaks, mainstream publications cover games regularly and Hollywood is awash with games IP. 30 years ago, Sega was practically thrown out of the office of the Motion Pictures Association, whereas today Sonic is a blockbuster movie franchise.</p>
<p>In 1995, the games industry was desperate for attention and respect. In 2024, it now has it, and E3 was part of how that was achieved.</p>
<p>"E3 certainly served its purpose in terms of relevancy and respect," Moore concludes. "There was a time when we were just being ripped for being a waste of time, all the social ills were being blamed on gaming, and it was seen as triviality and a phase that primarily young boys went through until they got serious about life. That's not the case anymore.</p>

Then it struck me. What if I could EAT video game characters? What would they taste like? How would I cook them? Would they pair well with a nice wine?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After a conducting a series of morally dubious but scientifically accurate thought experiments I believe I have some answers.

Don't be fooled by the name. Pac-Man isn't even remotely humanoid. What we actually have here is the thinking person's camembert. A sentient cheesewheel infused with a fragrant profile that can only come from feasting on the souls of ghouls and miscellaneous fruit. If you can coax him out of that maze you'll have a show-stopping centrepiece sure to get your dinner party guests talking.

That might sound like a strange, potentially career-ending admission, but hear me out. During my extensive Bulborb research, I discovered that not only do these alien oddities swallow Pikmin and live nocturnally, they're also very likely amphibious and unfathomably diverse. Much like the humble frogs and toads that have made our world their home, I posit that bulborbs must produce potent toxins capable of delivering a transcendental high or painful death.

Bulbapedia is unsure whether Farfetch'd is lugging around a leek or spring onion, but that doesn't matter. The best chefs are adaptable, and we're at the top of our game.

<p data-characters="214" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sethos-ascension-and-talent-materials-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sethos</a> is a unique 4-star Electro DPS character in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-teases-clorinde-sigewinne-sethos-banners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Genshin Impact</em> </a>with multiple playstyles. Luckily, no matter how you play him, Sethos can be built the same way. Here are the best weapons and artifacts for Sethos!</p> <h2 id="h-sethos-best-weapons-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Sethos’ best weapons in Genshin Impact</h2> <h3 id="h-hunter-s-path-best-5-star-weapon-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Hunter’s Path: best 5-star weapon for Sethos</h3> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Sethos’ best weapon is the 5-star Hunter’s Path. Despite being Tighnari’s signature Bow, Hunter’s Path has a great passive for Sethos, increasing his Charged Attack damage based on his Elemental Mastery. If you happen to have Hunter’s Path in your inventory, Sethos makes for a great user. I wouldn’t recommend pulling Hunter’s Path specifically for Sethos, though.</p> <h3 id="h-slingshot-most-accessible-weapon-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Slingshot: most accessible weapon for Sethos</h3> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="772" data-injectable="true">Oddly enough, the 3-star Slingshot is one of Sethos’ best weapons. It has a low base ATK, but it provides a good amount of CRIT Rate as well as a DMG buff to Normal and Charged Attacks. As long as you’re not too far from your enemy, Slingshot is able to buff Sethos by a significant amount. Slingshot is easily obtained through wishes, and you should aim for Refinement Rank 5 if possible.</p>
 <h3 id="h-cloudforged-decent-4-star-weapon-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Cloudforged: decent 4-star weapon for Sethos</h3> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">If you don’t have an R5 Slingshot in your inventory, you can opt for Cloudforged instead. Its passive works for Sethos whether he’s using his Normal Attacks or Charged Attacks. Still, I recommend using Slingshot if possible. </p> <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Despite being featured in promotional material, Scion of the Blazing Sun is not worth buying for Sethos, especially since it requires spending real-life money on the Battle Pass.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-artifact-sets-for-sethos-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Artifact sets for Sethos in Genshin Impact</h2> <h3 id="h-4pc-wanderer-s-troupe" data-injectable="false">4pc Wanderer’s Troupe</h3> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">4pc Wanderer’s Troupe is Sethos’ best artifact set. It provides both Elemental Mastery and an unconditional Charged Attack buff. Wanderer’s Troupe artifacts can be farmed using artifact strongboxes, though you can get additional pieces while defeating world bosses.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4pc-gilded-dreams" data-injectable="false">4pc Gilded Dreams</h3> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">4pc Gilded Dreams provides Sethos with a large amount of Elemental Mastery depending on his teammates’ elements. Gilded Dreams artifacts are easier to farm than Wanderer’s Troupe, but Wanderer’s Troupe provides more consistent buffs. Still, the two are similar enough where you can use whichever you feel more comfortable with.</p> <h2 id="h-artifact-stats-to-prioritize-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Artifact stats to prioritize for Sethos</h2> <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sands</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Goblet</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Circlet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Elemental Mastery</td><td data-align="center">Electro DMG</td><td data-align="center">CRIT Rate/DMG</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Sethos should have about 120% Energy Recharge for comfortable rotations. Just make sure he triggers a reaction with his Skill, which shouldn’t be an issue as long as you have other elements in your team. If paired with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a>, Sethos can forgo building Energy Recharge entirely.</p> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="false">Prioritize Sethos’ offensive stats, which are primarily <strong>CRIT</strong> and <strong>Elemental Mastery.</strong> ATK doesn’t hurt either, but most of Sethos’ damage scaling comes from Elemental Mastery rather than ATK.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-and-friends-will-join-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-as-dlc.890229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that upcoming spherical platformer&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>will be getting DLC themed around everyone's favorite blue spiny critter Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as three of his buddies.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, Sega reveals that Sonic, as well as Tails, Amy, and Knuckles, will be available to purchase as separate DLC for&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble</em>, and they'll also be included in the game's Sega Pass.</p>

<p>It's pretty fitting that Sonic and his friends will be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>given the game's adoption of the Spin Dash move; I guess Sonic might have considered suing AiAi and company if he hadn't been handed this opportunity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc-characters.jpg?itok=Hf14_j-T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc-characters.jpg?itok=wZXyqJC7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Four&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>characters will join&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>as DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the four&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters outlined above, the Sega Pass for&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>will also net you access to two more "Sega all-stars", and they've all got their own unique stats as well.</p>

<p>You'll also get some new customization items to trick out your monkeys, although we're not sure what those customization items might be yet. Hopefully, they include a nightmarish&nbsp;Sonic wig of some description.</p>

<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball&nbsp;</em>series, which I suppose is best described as a platforming franchise, although it's complicated. Amusingly enough, it's being developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, best-known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-has-sold-1-million-copies-fastest-selling-game-in-series">the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the games, they're essentially&nbsp;<em>Marble Madness</em>-style romps in which you must guide a monkey in a ball around a series of increasingly treacherous courses.</p>

<p>The difficulty can, in my experience, get pretty controller-breakingly frustrating, although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-monkey-ball-banana-blitz-hd-review">not every game subscribes to that philosophy</a>.</p>




<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is set to launch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-switch/">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a> on June 25th. No other platforms have been announced for the game yet.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>-themed portion of the Sega Pass arrives sometime this year, so look out for it if you're a fan of the Blue Blur.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix is continuously adding to its diverse portfolio of games, announcing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171306/on-a-multi-national-tv-and-movie-streaming-service-there-lived-a-hobbit">a new slate of titles set to launch on the platform this summer and beyond</a>. And while the “serious gamer” might be enticed by the pending arrival of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433741/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc"><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></a><em> </em>or <em>Don’t Starve Together</em> — games that have enjoyed success on other platforms — it’s interactive fiction games that are the most exciting both for Netflix and its gaming community.</p><p>“Expanding the worlds of beloved Netflix series and films is our greatest opportunity in games,” <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-reality-universe-expands-with-new-games">wrote Leanne Loombe</a>, head of external games at Netflix, in a recent blog post.</p><p>Everybody’s getting into gaming right now. <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, LinkedIn, YouTube, and now possibly even Uber are offering games as a part of their services in order to drive subscriptions and user engagement. For some, <a href="https://digiday.com/media/the-next-level-for-us-the-new-york-times-eyes-longer-play-sessions-for-games-in-subscription-drive/">it’s working</a>. For others, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378713/google-stadia-shutting-down-game-streaming-january-2023">not</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/13/23959224/amazon-gaming-layoffs-crown-content-channel">so</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23328568/facebook-gaming-mobile-app-shutting-down-october-2022">much</a>. A lot of these gaming initiatives feel like they’re just being tacked on to whatever service, like how your favorite Chinese takeout restaurant also has fries and chicken wings. Even though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">LinkedIn’s new games are entertaining</a>, it’s hard to imagine folks spending more time on the site where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/business/ceo-crying-linkedin-layoffs.html#:~:text=When%20he%20started%20bawling%2C%20moments,a%20teary%20selfie%20for%20LinkedIn.&amp;text=Braden%20Wallake%2C%20the%20chief%20executive,after%20laying%20off%20two%20employees.">CEOs announce layoffs like YouTube apology videos</a> just to play them.</p><p>But Netflix is unique in that, even though it’s not a gaming company, its products do lend themselves to a specific kind of highly popular but underserved gaming experience. “We’ve seen a lot of success with interactive fiction games like <em>Selling Sunset</em>, <em>Perfect Match</em>, and <em>The Ultimatum</em>,” Loombe said in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Reality television shows are still one of the most popular kinds of entertainment. They’re relatively cheap to produce and are uniquely positioned to create the kinds of high-drama moments that go viral on social media. And with popular shows, its audience is naturally incentivized to seek out related content. After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">the wild success of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> TV show</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131018/fallout-games-steam-player-count-bethesda-tv-show">the games exploded in popularity</a>, appearing on bestseller lists and at the top of Steam player charts.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix’s gaming offerings are poised to take advantage of that same phenomenon. Because where a <em>Fallout</em> fan has to go outside Amazon to play the games (or, as Amazon vainly hopes, use its cloud gaming service Luna) Netflix’s games channel the enthusiasm of a show’s community right back into the app, creating what Loombe calls a seamless “connective tissue between the TV show and the game.” In this new economy of attention, where companies are competing to have as many eyeballs on their apps or services as possible, that Netflix fans don’t have to leave the app to continue their fandom experiences is potentially a huge advantage.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>MCU, meet the NRU — the Netflix Reality Universe.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Netflix</cite></p></div><p>Another advantage is the games themselves. Adapting games can be tough, with the results often failing to engage an audience with the same level of success as its original. <em>Uncharted</em> was a critically acclaimed adventure game series; the movie — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/17/22937238/uncharted-movie-review">less so</a>. That quality gap is closing with shows like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>. And Netflix is strategic in how it picks which of its shows to adapt into a game to ensure an experience that faithfully recreates the essence of the show.</p><p>“Unscripted reality shows are really great because it has that fantasy element,” Loombe said. “Players are able to pretend to be one of those characters and play that fantasy out like a choose your own adventure and a romance novel combined.” </p><p>It’s a fantasy players take with them and share elsewhere. <em>Too Hot to Handle</em>, for instance,  has a dedicated community on Reddit with traditions like “Main Character Monday” in which players post pictures of their in-game avatars.&nbsp;“We have a really deep customization system in <em>Too Hot To Handle</em>,” Loombe explained. “So you can choose, from a variety of different items, to prosthetics, to different hairstyles, different hair colors, and body types. It really is quite deep.”</p><p>Netflix’s gaming library <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices">started with titles like<em> Shooting Hoops</em>, <em>Teeter (Up)</em>, and <em>Card Blast</em></a>. Three years later, it’s grown into one that includes big-name commercial powerhouses and indie-developed critical darlings. We only know what Netflix shares about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far">exactly how popular its games are</a>, and as a proportion of its overall user base, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-less-than-1-of-netflixs-total-subscribers-play-games-daily#:~:text=As%20reported%20by%20CBNC%2C%20this,downloaded%2070.5%20million%20times%20worldwide.">Netflix’s gaming audience is quite small</a>. And while Netflix’s interactive fiction games don’t generate the same kind of attention the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> trilogy or <em>Hades</em> might, they are quietly one of the platform’s biggest success stories.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first game, released in 2018, began life as a Switch exclusive, before gradually finding its way to PC in 2019, then Xbox One in 2021. But a PlayStation version never appeared. Come 2023, <em>Octopath Traveler II</em> was simultaneously released on Switch, PC and...PlayStation. Huh?</p><p>Both Sony and Microsoft love a good exclusive. Sometimes  each company will get publishers and developers to agree to at least a timed period where a game can only be played on their own console. The theory being, if you’re trying to choose between an Xbox or a PlayStation, you’ll pick the one that plays the most games you’re interested in. But while this theoretically benefits the consoles, it’s only a short-term win for the developers, who need to be sure the financial incentives will match the potential loss of half of all possible console sales.</p><p>But the real losers are us, the players, the people who own the “wrong” console. And that has been especially the case when it comes to those who own either am Xbox or a PS4/5 who want to enjoy the <em>Octopath</em> franchise. It seems that this silliness could well be coming to an end, given that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamerating.org.tw/Search/GameList&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamerating.org.tw/Search/GameList" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taiwan’s ratings board</a></span> has listings for both games on their previously missing platform.</p><p>The original <em>Octopath Traveler</em> has listings for both PS4 and PS5, although with no release date yet attached.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zotac-zone-another-handheld-gaming-device-has-appeared.890220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zotac-zone-another-handheld/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>That’s right – there’s another one. In a series of images that have surfaced from Computex 2024, another handheld gaming device has been showcased – the ZOTAC ZONE. From ZOTAC Gaming, the ZONE is another Windows-powered device with substantial specifications packed under a 120 Hz OLED screen, but this is just the latest in an increasingly long line of devices targeting the growing handheld gaming market.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one">Another One</h2>



<p>During Computex 2024, the ZOTAC ZONE was shown off, but the device just doesn’t look ‘nice enough’ to compete with the likes of the MSI Claw – which is undergoing a mid-gen refresh – or the ASUS ROG Ally, which has an upgraded model hitting the market very soon.</p>



<p>The specifications can’t be discredited, though. The ZOTAC ZONE features a 7-inch AMOLED display pulling 800 nits, and that sits atop a Ryzen 7 8840U processor with integrated Radeon 780M graphics. It’s not terrible, but it only has 16 GB of LPDDR5X memory, which means that it’s already beaten by the ROG Ally X. It also features ‘at least’ 512 GB of storage, while the upgraded ASUS ROG handheld boasts a 1 TB capacity.</p>



<p><strong>Furthermore</strong>, the ZOTAC ZONE’s 48.5 Wh battery isn’t anywhere near as powerful as the new one found in the ASUS ROG Ally X, which was boosted to a whopping 80 Wh to account for a shortfall in the original model. It has been claimed that the ZOTAC ZONE will retail at around $799 when it’s released in September 2024, but it’s joining a saturated market and it’s not even as good as the closest competitors, so only time will tell how it performs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/05/dead-by-daylight-developer-behaviour-interactive-is-laying-off-up-to-95-employees<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> developer Behaviour Interactive is laying off roughly 95 employees, the company has announced. The majority of those that will be affected – 70 of the 95 – work at the studio's Montreal, Canada, office, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/behaviour-to-lay-off-up-to-95-employees"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for why, the company cites restructuring as it pursues a clarified vision around "multiple strategic changes." Behaviour says these layoffs will not affect its service business or its development on Dead by Daylight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To pursue this clarified vision [lead in horror, lead in service, and explore the possibilities of location-based entertainment], Behaviour will implement multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure, improving the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources," a <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth">press release</a> reads. "As a result of these changes, the company will reduce its team by up to 95 employees, 70 of whom are based in Montreal. Each of these individuals offered valuable contributions to Behaviour, and will be fully supported by the organization in pursuing the next step in their careers."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outside of Dead by Daylight development, Behaviour is helping The Quarry developer Supermassive Games develop <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/the-casting-of-frank-stone-is-supermassives-single-player-horror">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, a single-player horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These layoffs arrive a few months after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/18/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-interactive-has-reportedly-laid-off-45-people">the studio laid off roughly 45 people at the same Montreal office back in January</a>&nbsp;and join an ever-growing list of disheartening layoffs and studio closures in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="274" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cities-skylines-ii-garbage-performance-roadblock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> ended up falling flat on its face </a>on day one, but that’s not to say the game won’t be fixed in due time, thankfully. Following a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/colossal-order-patches-cities-skylines-2-to-fix-garbage-problem-maybe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of prior fixes</a>, the Colossal Order has now outlined the upcoming Economy 2.0 rework, and it’s a hoot.</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Or, at least, it <em>should</em> be a hoot if it all pans out properly. As per <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/economy-2-0-dev-diary-1.1682626/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colossal Order’s latest developer blog</a>, the Economy 2.0 system rework is supposed to be a complete and comprehensive rebalance of how the game handles its monetary progression. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">“Our goal with Economy 2.0 was to make the systems more straightforward and responsive, so you can make more meaningful choices and have more control over the various gameplay aspects,” read the Colossal Order blog. “This means fewer safeguards and automated systems that work invisibly under the surface and an increased level of challenge.” </p>
 <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="48" data-injectable="false">Good stuff so far, but what are the <em>specifics</em>?<br></p> <figure data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Colossal Order</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-economy-2-0-update-for-cities-skylines-2-is-coming-soon" data-injectable="false">Economy 2.0 update for Cities: Skylines 2 is coming soon</h2> <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">Generally speaking, <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>‘s Economy 2.0 is supposed to do all of the following (and then some):</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>Outright remove all Government Subsidies</li> <li>Make the ‘Importing City Services’ feature fully optional, with a fee when toggled on.</li> <li>Meaningfully increase the upkeep costs of all city services.</li> <li>Improve the demand calculations of your cities and communities.</li> <li>Introduce new rent and household spending calculations, allowing citizens to live in Low Density Residential areas.</li> <li>Rebalance the production chain to make taxed income more reasonable, in the grand scheme of things.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true">It’s curious, perhaps, that Colossal Order aims to simply take Government Subsidies out of the game. The feature is, in fact, a <em>thing</em> in the real world, so taking it out of the equation instead of attempting to retrofit it into something that makes sense is a tad strange. Yet, it should be better than the Economy 1.0 version, where Subsidies could easily remove the need to worry about money entirely. </p>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">A potential red flag, if you wish to take it that way, is that Colossal Order also noted that “[they] still aim for the game to be playable without paying too much attention to where and how money and resources flow in the city so new players have a chance to succeed, while still leaving room for experienced players to benefit from optimizing their city.” There’s a multitude of ways we could understand this statement, but for the time being, I do recommend keeping a pinch of salt at hand.</p>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="false">Economy 2.0 won’t fix <em>all</em> of <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>‘s problems, of course, but it should serve as a solid baseline for Colossal Order to build upon (har har, I know) in the future. It’s obviously less than ideal, given the launch-day state of the game, but I’m personally just thrilled that the game isn’t going to suffer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-workers-will-reportedly-be-out-of-work-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the same fate as <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em></a> did. It’s the little things.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/big-news-outlets-keep-forgetting-they-hate-video-games.890199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/variety-gaming-coverage<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago, Nathan and I wrote about how <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone was getting back into games journalism</a>, after previously shuttering a games vertical in 2017. Now, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/variety-gaming-jennifer-maas-1236023968/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>–which also had and then <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/games/variety-to-shut-down-their-entire-gaming-section-effective-just-after-e3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory-holed</a> dedicated games coverage–is taking a page from the same playbook.</p><p>It’s not an entire vertical; rather, the outlet is promoting writer Jennifer Maas, who’s <a href="https://variety.com/author/jennifer-maas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already been covering games</a>, to “lead the entertainment news brand’s <strong>heightened coverage</strong> of the video game industry.” (Emphasis mine.) Maas will focus in particular on the growing overlap between games and television, alongside another writer, Kaare Eriksen, who writes about games for Variety's <a href="https://variety.com/vip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid subscription</a> service.</p><p>Cynthia Littleton, <em>Variety</em>’s co-editor-in-chief, is quoted in the announcement as saying, “Gaming of all kinds has grown into a worldwide force and we’re eager to<strong> expand our coverage</strong> of this important market.” (Emphasis mine again.) It’s likely games have re-attracted Variety’s attention through the popularity of shows like HBO’s<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-druckmann-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and Amazon’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/fallout-tv-show-impressions-aftermath-hours-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout</em></a>, as big game publishers embrace these medium crossovers and look at everything through the lens of IP. As stalwarts like the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/marvel-slowing-down-output-to-a-couple-of-films-and-series-a-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MCU slow</a>, and as box office sales <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/cinema-box-office-decline-2024-1235963134/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falter</a>, games probably feel like an untapped frontier to editors and media execs who haven’t been paying attention to them lately, even if none of this is remotely new.</p><p>I want to be really, <em>really</em> clear that I have no axes to grind against Maas or Eriksen, whose work I am not familiar with and whom I wish all the best; any journalist having good news about their job or their beat these days is worth celebrating. Rather, it’s the <em>situation</em> that made me scream when I saw this announcement–quotes about heightening and expanding coverage of an area Variety decided wasn’t worth it anymore in 2019, but has suddenly decided matters again, enough to ask new journalists to commit to a beat these outlets have already shown they can’t commit to.</p><p>That outlets like Rolling Stone, Variety, and <a href="https://game.substack.com/p/why-the-new-york-times-returned-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> are wandering back into the games game at a time when dedicated games journalism outlets are being <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-jason-schreier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decimated</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right</a> <em>should</em>, in some ways, feel like a win. They could spell more opportunities for freelancers or even staffers. Big outlets with big resources can produce high-quality work that’s held to high standards, work that serves readers and tells important stories, the kind of work that dedicated games outlets can struggle to do in the face of dwindling resources, the loss of experienced writers and editors, and hostile ownership. I want so badly to feel <em>happy</em> that this is happening, even if these new/old forays are rising from the ashes of thousands of laid-off games journalists and degraded or shuttered outlets.&nbsp;</p><p>To detour into another part of journalism for a moment: On Sunday night, The Washington Post announced a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2024/06/02/sally-buzbee-steps-down-executive-editor-washington-post-matt-murray-rob-winnett-take-editorial-leadership-roles-new-newsroom-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise editorial shakeup</a> with the departure of executive editor Sally Buzbee and the reveal of a new “third newsroom” that intends to give readers “who feel traditional news is not for them… compelling, exciting and accurate news where they are and in the style that they want…. [moving] away from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach.” Semafor’s Max Tani <a href="https://x.com/maxwelltani/status/1797667088804560929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter </a>that Post CEO Will Lewis told staff ‘You haven't done it’... when asked about reaching new audiences through the current newsroom structure.” According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/washington-post-shakeup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, Lewis told staff, “It’s the most important thing: untapped audiences.” Lewis also reportedly said that he'll be "sourcing talent externally" for this new newsroom, just months after The Post undertook <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2023/10/10/washington-post-staff-buyouts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of buyouts.</a></p><p>If you read this site, you’re aware that Aftermath co-founders Nathan Grayson and I both worked for The Post’s games vertical Launcher, which was <a href="https://kotaku.com/washington-post-launcher-layoffs-giant-bomb-games-media-1850025471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shuttered</a> in January 2023, a few months after I was hired to run it. We were, to my understanding, succeeding in our goals and reaching the new, young readers The Post wanted to attract. After Launcher closed, I moved to an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2021/08/04/washington-post-launch-next-generation-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entire department</a> dedicated to reaching those new audiences. The head of that department, a brilliant thinker and exceptional boss who was far kinder to me than I deserved, now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2024/02/20/phoebe-connelly-named-senior-editor-ai-strategy-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heads up</a> The Post’s forays into AI; the February announcement of this move refers to our department in the past tense.</p><p>So I look out over the last few weeks of journalism news, at these Rolling Stone and Variety announcements, at The Post’s pivot into buzzword chaos, and I feel like I’m yelling at a character in a horror movie as they walk into a basement. These companies asked journalists to do our jobs, and we did them, and then everything we did got wiped away. And then, months or years later, these same bosses decide to reinvent the things we already did, just without us, and dress it up like some bold new idea. </p><p>I don’t think it’s cynical to predict where this leads: in a few months, or in a year or two, they’ll get bored of the people who replaced us, or the line won’t go up fast enough, and they’ll nuke the whole thing all over again. They’ll blame a lack of reader interest, or advertising shifts, or–as Lewis <a href="https://x.com/BenMullin/status/1797681312394080709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seems</a> to do–the writers and their work, but they’ll never take the blame themselves. And then they’ll move on to their next half-baked idea, and we’ll all pay the price.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24171470/dungeon-meshi-apothecary-diaries-gremlin-girls<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="In1WDZ">Between<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24146605/delicious-in-dungeon-video-game-inspirations"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a>’s feral cat girl Izutsumi and<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24074811/best-anime-2024"><em>The Apothecary Diaries</em></a>’ weirdo poison taster Mao Mao, I’m absolutely thriving with current-wave chaotic little anime gremlin girls. </p>
<p id="B9PAb5">It’s very common for shonen anime to feature heavily sexualized female characters. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/17/22278866/jujutsu-kaisen-women">Yes, there are exceptions</a>, but it’s such a regular occurrence that boob close-ups and panty shots almost become background noise. So, seeing characters who could otherwise fit in those tropes do a total 180 to be completely nonsexual — and, in fact, repulsive — is so damn satisfying. </p>
<p id="tqeuuI">Izutsumi and Mao Mao aren’t the only characters to ever fit this bill, but watching the two shows in succession really scratched a good itch for me, kicking off the summer anime season with a growl. They join the canon of freaky gremlin gals with <em>Skip and Loafer</em>’s Mitsumi, an ambitious but totally awkward and kinda cringe high school student; the trio of budding animators at the center of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/16/21138309/keep-your-hands-off-eizouken-anime-studios-working-conditions"><em>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</em></a>; and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/20/20812920/best-anime-studio-bones-carole-and-tuesday-my-hero-academia-fullmetal-alchemist"><em>Ouran High School Host Club</em></a>’s Haruhi, the tired scholarship student who puts up with all the host club’s extravagant bullshit. </p>

<p id="iuYzQA">None of these characters are designed in a traditionally “sexy” way; in fact, they’re aggressively unsexy. They get to be little weirdos, delighting in their interests and ambitions, without thinking about being appealing or pandering to their crushes (and in the case of Mitsumi and Haruhi, that’s exactly what gets their love interests’ attention!). It’s vindication for weird girls everywhere! </p>
<p id="lWGMH2">Izutsumi and Mao Mao take the trope from the slice-of-life genre to fantasy and historical settings, where female characters typically suffer from hypersexualization. </p>
<p id="P8DkXU">In the fantasy world of <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, none of the female characters are really sexualized at all. But Izutsumi stands out — because in any other show, she <em>would</em> be turned into a sexpot. Izutsumi is a cat girl, but not in the traditional <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyCatPerson">sexy feline person way</a>. She’s not purring up against other characters or seductively twitching her tail. And she doesn’t have any logic-defying cleavage. Even when she strips down in front of the group as they all enjoy an impromptu sauna, her body is remarkably nonsexualized. Instead, she <em>acts</em> like a feral cat: She’s distrustful, angry, and <em>will</em> claw your eyes out if you get too close. She’s slowly learning to trust the group, but like with a stray cat you leave food out for in your backyard, it will be on her terms. </p>

<p id="DZJeY1">The courtesans and concubines living in <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em>’<em> </em>Imperial China are women who are very specifically using their sexuality to make a living in some way, shape, or form. Mao Mao, however, is an apothecary who <em>loves </em>to try out new medications and poisons. She tests them on herself, which means her arms are bandaged up with the results of her experiments. Nothing makes her happier than rare medicinal herbs and ingredients (except maybe poisons). When she’s not absolutely feral, she’s cold and calculating, an analytical mastermind who must switch gears from medical mysteries to political machinations. Either way, she’s not concerned about being sexy or likable, even when handsome head eunuch Jinshi flirts with her. </p>
<p id="zEyEVB">Izutsumi, Mao Mao, and the rest of these grubby anime girls are just the refreshing dunk of water I needed. <em>Delicious in Dungeon </em>wraps up this week, and <em>The Apothecary Diaries </em>ended in March, but I’m going to be bringing this freaky little chaos demon energy into the summer with me. No need to look hot in a bikini if my beach plans involve running up and down the shoreline, pretending to be a sandpiper. Mao Mao would be proud. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-will-need-a-psn-account-on-steam-and-epic.890181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-will-need-a-psn-account-on-steam-and-epic/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Weeks ago, players were left stewing in their disappointment when a Sony-backed update to Helldivers 2 made it mandatory to link a PSN account to a Steam profile to play the game online. It was met with rampant resistance from the global gaming community, and within a matter of hours, a quarter of a million negative reviews for Helldivers 2 had surfaced on Steam.</p>



<p>The decision was ultimately reversed, but that wasn’t – and isn’t – the end of the story. Recently, it was found that Concord, an upcoming team-based first-person shooter, will also require a PSN account to be linked on Steam and the Epic Games Store before users can jump in online. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-what-s-the-big-deal">But What’s The Big Deal?</h2>



<p>A report <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mauvaise-nouvelle-pour-cette-prochaine-sortie-multijoueur-de-playstation-sur-pc-52313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Dealabs’ billbil-kun</a> confirmed through an investigation that <strong>Concord will need a PSN account</strong> to be played online – even if you’re playing it on Steam or through the Epic Games Store. This is a big deal because the PlayStation Network isn’t available in a whopping 177 countries worldwide, thus wiping out a huge portion of the global gaming market. </p>



<p>It’s shooting Concord in the foot before it has been released, and the immediate response to the newly revealed game wasn’t that strong in the first place.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Concord - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jqQJhjf_3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>From the moment Concord was revealed at the recent State of Play showcase, the community started labelling it a ‘poor man’s Overwatch’. It certainly smacks of Blizzard’s hero-based FPS, and there are elements of Guardians of the Galaxy mixed in there too. It’s the debut title from Firewalk Studios and it has been in development for quite some time, but the reveal wasn’t what users expected.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1798006904150458559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Remedy teased something for June 7, 2024, related to the anticipated Alan Wake 2 Night Springs DLC.</p>



<p>The post invites fans to “join the percolation on June 7th…in Night Springs.” Is also playfully reassures that Dark Triangle Coffee is “just coffee, nothing else.”</p>



<p> Last March, organizers confirmed that Summer Game Fest will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">premiere on June 7</a> this year, starting at 5 pm EST / 10 pm GMT. This directly coincides with the date in Remedy’s new post. </p>



<p>This strongly implies that Remedy has big news for Night Springs during Summer Game Fest. That may include both a new trailer and a release window or date. However, Remedy did not confirm exactly what reveals are coming.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Remedy previously appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-remedy-games-teasing-alan-wake-2-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tease the Night Springs DLC</a> after updating its various social accounts last week. </p>



<p>The studio updated its Twitter/X and YouTube accounts to Poison Pill Entertainment with the tease “Since 1995 Night Springs City.”</p>



<p>Fans got an early look at some of the potential content coming to Alan Wake 2’s Night Springs DLC after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datamined leaks surfaced</a>. The leaks also appeared to reveal details about the second expansion, The Lake House, and alternate endings.</p>



<p>Alan Wake 2 was an enormous success, and Remedy even confirmed it was their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-fastest-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling game ever</a>. </p>

This second update arrives less than three weeks after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2s-first-early-access-patch-makes-sprinting-faster-and-gathering-easier">Patch 1</a> but features dozens of changes, improvements, and bug fixes.</p><p>Balance changes take up a large part of the spoiler heavy patch notes, available below, but Supergiant has also made larger gameplay changes including the ability to encounter up to one additional Olympain each night, increased the invulnerability duration after Death Defiance, and the option to press and hold to continuously harvest Crescent Pick outcroppings.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Hades 2 Early Access Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Hades 2's menus and UI were also updated to include several new icons, the Chaos Trials have been reduced in difficulty, and some resources are now easier to come across in certain areas.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bryan-furys-infamous-laugh-kicked-off-dialogue-in-the-tekken-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Katsuhiro Harada, chief developer of the Tekken series, has offered a fascinating insight into the making of the fighting game franchise’s characters, specifically their dialogue — and in the process revealed why one Tekken character in particular became popular despite saying nothing at all.</p><p>Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1798164766806155521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> in response to one user who asked about a line of dialogue spoken by the character Reina in the recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, but the answer went on to describe the process of adding dialogue to Tekken characters, kicking off with Bryan and Yoshimitsu in 1997’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3">Tekken 3</a>. Before that game, Tekken characters did not speak, but it was felt that with the demise of the arcade scene in the West and a shift toward consoles, there was a need to strengthen characterization.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This is when Bryan’s famous “Muwahaha!” laugh comes in, but only when the camera was not pointed at the character's face as much as possible due to hardware limitations.</p><p>“So I decided to include dialogue such as laughter or yes!! in the throwing scene where Bryan turns his back to the camera's gaze and in the scene where Bryan is down (and Nina stomps),” Harada said. “I also wanted to express Bryan's character as both a sadist and a masochist.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I also wanted to express Bryan's character as both a sadist and a masochist.</p></div><p>Subsequent Tekken games released on more powerful hardware added more characterization, although, as Harada points out, there’s an irony in Bryan becoming a character known for not speaking much at all. Another Tekken character who does not speak is Dragunov, and Harada offered an insight into how that came to be — and revealed his surprise at the character’s popularity despite his silence.</p><p>In short, Dragunov was designed as the “negative” to Lili’s “positive”, with the expectation that Dragunov would not be a popular character, whereas Lili would be. Indeed, Harada asked the developers to “keep his personality down, keep him plain, and he doesn’t need to be so popular.”</p><p>And so, Dragunov does not speak in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-5-dark-resurrection">Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection</a>, the 2005 update to Tekken 5 in which he was introduced. This also helped lighten the load on the development team, as Dragunov had few facial animations, very little lip-sync, and no more dialogue to localize.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Harada said he was nervous about Dragunov because he had become “soooo plain and brooding.” But then something unexpected happened: “the sober Dragunov, who did not speak at all, on the contrary, became popular among Tekken players because he was unique.”</p><p>The conclusion: times have changes, Harada suggested.</p><p>“In the 90s, if you didn't have characters speaking dialogue as soon as possible, ‘they wouldn't have any characterization!’ I thought.</p><p>“But I see, in a world where it is normal for game characters to speak after a generational change, I learned the opposite, that not speaking is also a matter of individuality.</p><p>“And even today, it is rare to find a fighting game character who does not say a word at all while fighting, at the start of a round, or throughout the entire win-pose (even Kuma and Panda communicate). Is there any other fighting game character that doesn't talk as much as Dragunov?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is not "iisou" but "iizo" (like “iizoou!” a little stronger than "iizo!"). The nuance is NOT JUST "That's good," but includes a "Good! Go ahead, I dare you!”.</p><p>Originally, this specification was developed by me during the development of TEKKEN3, when Nina made a specific… <a href="https://t.co/lQqTCbuOfh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/lQqTCbuOfh</a></p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1798164766806155521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>So there you have it! Harada just dropped Tekken deep lore, delighting veteran fans of the series. But this isn’t the only hot topic Harada has discussed on social media recently. This week, months after he was made painfully aware of fans’ grassroots movement to get an official Waffle House stage in the long-running fighting game series, and having received tons of information about the American Southern diner chain via memes, viral videos, and earnest replies from fans, Harada said he was still baffled at the “culture” of Waffle House.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-player-tries-to-educate-others-on-extraction-etiquette-with-helpful-how-to-video/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=helldivers-2-player-tries-to-educate-others-on-extraction-etiquette-with-helpful-how-to-video<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Almost every mission in <em>Helldivers 2</em> is fun as long as you’re with a squad that plays the objective and doesn’t actively try to kill you. However, that fun can dissipate quickly when it comes to extraction, the simplest part of any mission that often causes the most issues. </p> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Extraction from a mission in <em>Helldivers 2</em> shouldn’t be difficult, but it is more often than not. You might end up missing the Pelican by one second because you were halfway across the map when the timer started, another player could accidentally kill you with a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-10-best-stratagems-in-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stratagem</a>, or you might run out of ammo while defending the extraction point. Thankfully, one player has put together an instruction video on extraction etiquette that should make all of these pain points a thing of the past. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true">Reddit user pinglyadya <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d7uad4/oc_a_little_video_i_made_on_extraction_etiquette/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently posted</a> a fantastic video on extraction etiquette rules for <em>Helldivers 2</em> on the game’s subreddit. It details everything you need to know, from when to trigger extraction to the types of Stratagems you should avoid once the Pelican has been called. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">I’d like to point out the most helpful rules for good extraction etiquette in <em>Helldivers 2</em> because they’ve killed me more than once: When to call the extraction, when to enter the Pelican, and how to communicate that you’re ready to leave. </p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">First, you should always ask before calling in the extraction. I know this isn’t always possible, but there are things you can do to mitigate Helldiver losses. For example, ping the extraction point on the map to let others know you’re about to call it in. If you’re on the opposite side of the map, this is a helpful indicator to get a move on if you don’t want to be left behind. </p>
 <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">New players really do need this video to tell them when to enter the Pelican. I struggle not to shout and throw my controller every time a player enters the Pelican while I’m knee-deep in Automaton spare parts, distracting the enemy so I can be left behind by those in the relative safety of the Pelican’s hold. You should only enter when you can see others are ready, though I don’t think it matters if you go for a stylish dive. Just don’t call in an Air Strike before you do.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via pinglyadya on Reddit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">I didn’t realize this was part of extraction etiquette until watching this video, but crouching to show you’re ready to extract is a genius move. It allows every player to show when they’re good to go or if they <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-player-recreates-naked-gun-meme-with-in-game-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still need to run off and collect a few samples</a>. It’s also a much more polite way of hinting that everyone should stop blowing Terminid brains out because you need to get back to your Super Destroyer in time for afternoon tea.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">As a bonus, I also think that calling in a Resupply Stratagem after triggering the extraction is massively underrated. It is essential to have that spare ammo available for anyone running in with a horde of enemies behind them. </p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="false">While the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community remains fairly positive <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-backpedals-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-plans-after-3-days-of-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unless Sony tries to make them do something</a>, these extraction etiquette rules will only improve missions. Just because you’re fighting insurmountable numbers of alien scum on the most hostile planets known to humanity doesn’t mean you have to be rude. </p>

        <p>"I wish they had been more careful."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Pokeverse - a Pokémon convention partnered with the Make-a-Wish foundation and that featured the original voice of Ash Ketchum from the Pokémon TV series - has been labelled as a disaster on a scale with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-someones-made-the-glasgow-willy-wonka-experience-in-fortnite">Glasgow's infamous Willy Wonka rip-off experience</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer today, attendee BintuRina - whose social media posts describing her experience have since gone viral - said the event lacked proper planning and care for its young attendees.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the convention, held in Mandaluyong, Manila last weekend, Pokeverse had been described by organisers as "the premier Pokémon-themed expo in the Philippines made by fans for fans!" It was advertised to feature "trainer quests", "stellar headliners" and "live musical performances", alongside cosplay contests and game tournaments.

<p>
Pokeverse's main attraction was the oppurtunity to meet Veronica Taylor, Ash's voice for the first eight seasons of the franchise's anime, and Jason Paige, the singer of Pokémon's iconic original theme song. 
</p>
<p>
But even before the expo began there were concerns over its seemingly unlicensed nature, and its partnership with Dubai NFT firm Kaloscope. (Responding to concerns, Taylor has <a href="https://x.com/TheVeronicaT/status/1788614907258384513">stated</a> she was not compensated for her attendance.)
</p>
<p>
At the convention itself, the event's attractions look to have been drastically downsized based on floorplans previously posted by Pokeverse to social media. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Let's talk about POKEVERSE PH<br>THE POKÉMON THEMED WONKA-DASHCON-FYRE FESTIVAL of the PHILIPPINES</p><p>Let me take you on a day by day journey through the PREMIER POKÉMON EXPO!</p><p>‼️A MEGA THREAD‼️ <a href="https://t.co/H38b4pLL6T">pic.twitter.com/H38b4pLL6T</a></p></div>— Rita WAS @ POKEVERSE (@BintuRita) <a href="https://twitter.com/BintuRita/status/1797928992659628260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Entering the event space, attendees were reportedly greeted by a large booth from another sponsor, Frigga, which sold Chinese lucky charms. An inflatable soft play area featured a row of circus side-show style activities, completely unrelated to Pokémon.
</p>
<p>
More serious questions were raised about a Make-a-Wish panel where terminally-ill children were reportedly brought on stage for a filming oppurtunity, wearing surgical masks but in front of a large crowd. 
</p>
<p>
Another criticism was the event's filming of attendees, including minors and cosplayers changing their outfits, in a lounge area. Some of this footage was then reportedly posted online.
</p>
<p>
"Let's talk about Pokeverse, the Pokémon-themed Wonka-Dashcon-Fyre Festival of the Philippines," BintuRita wrote on social media platform X. "Let me take you on a day-by-day journey through the Premier Pokémon Expo!
</p>
<p>
"The convention center was basically barren... with standees, designs or decorations filling all the empty spaces. The place was littered with empty tables and the promised floor plans on their Facebook page were suddenly changed."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>There was also an art gallery that was selling pokemon paintings but for some reason their table was like, 5 meters away from art gallery</p><p>The prices of the paintings weren't even on the paintings, they were at the table so you had to walk the stretch to even check <a href="https://t.co/VjICUToSwg">pic.twitter.com/VjICUToSwg</a></p></div>— Rita WAS @ POKEVERSE (@BintuRita) <a href="https://twitter.com/BintuRita/status/1797935027516559734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>The event's 'quests' amounted to a paper checklist asking visitors to post about certain parts of the convention on social media. And in another bizarre moment, a person covered in ravioli apparently unsettled some guests:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Eventually RAVIOLI MAN was escorted out but only after he took a sponge and started rubbing it on one of the sponsors booths.</p><p>Though later in the EXPO, security still let him back in.</p><p>I thought ticket rates were going into Crowd control and security?</p></div>— Rita WAS @ POKEVERSE (@BintuRita) <a href="https://twitter.com/BintuRita/status/1797932706048995668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer, BintuRita said she wished "the convention had more time to be planned". 
</p>
<p>
"I wish it was more Pokémon centered. I wish the production team had more emphasis on consent. And I wish they had been more careful with the children in the convention space."
</p>
<p>
Still, Rita said she had enjoyed meeting Veronica Taylor and an oppurtunity to sing with Jason Paige - despite the shambolic nature of various elements' organisation. 
</p>
<p>
"Overall, my experience does not reflect everyone's Pokeverse experience. Some people went to the con and despite the hiccups, had a wonderful time. That wasn't my experience," she concluded.
</p>
<p>
Pokeverse organisers have responded to some of the concerns raised above already, in a <a href="https://x.com/BintuRita/status/1797972103473553689">reply</a> to BintuRita's posts. 
</p>
<p>
"We apologise for the oversight, we are investigating matters with the production team," a Pokeverse spokesperson said. "It's our first event with very little time to prepare but we do agree that a lot of things need to be improved.
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate your participation and will continue [to] take your feedback to do better next time."
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon Company itself is yet to comment on the event. Eurogamer has contacted it and Pokeverse's organisers for more.

			<p>Supergiant Games has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4191241567727414432" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the second update following the early access of Hades II. It is a sizable patch that tweaks several core combat mechanics, and most of the changes came directly from community feedback.</p>
<p><em><strong>General Gameplay</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>You now can encounter up to one additional Olympian each night (as in the previous game)</em></li>
<li><em>You now are likely to find one more Boon or other major reward while in Erebus</em></li>
<li><em>Increased invulnerability duration after your Death Defiance effects activate</em></li>
<li><em>Improved rewards of Ash and Psyche can now be found in [spoiler] and the [spoiler]</em></li>
<li><em>You now can press-and-hold to harvest repeatedly from Crescent Pick Outcroppings</em></li>
<li><em>Toula should now stay closer to you in Encounters, especially in the [spoiler]</em></li>
<li><em>[spoiler] no longer offers Death Defiance items if you do not need to refill the effect</em></li>
<li><em>Reduced Gold cost of Selene's Boon and Path of Stars in Charon's Shop</em></li>
<li><em>Minor adjustments to the order in which Olympians may first appear early on</em></li>
<li><em>Normalized chances of finding Fishing Points in various regions</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Nocturnal Arms &amp; Abilities</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Witch's Staff: Special knocks foes away but is slightly slower; Omega Special is faster</em></li>
<li><em>Sister Blades: Special staggers standard foes longer; Attack visual FX better match the hitbox</em></li>
<li><em>Umbral Flames: Attacks are stronger and faster; Omega Attack channels faster and uses less magick; Special gives a speed boost but has reduced damage; Omega Special can be channeled while moving</em></li>
<li><em>Moonstone Axe: reworked Special provides a lingering barrier; Omega Attack channels slightly faster; Omega Special channels faster</em></li>
<li><em>Argent Skull: Omega Attack channels faster and hits a larger area</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Aspects of the Nocturnal Arms</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Witch's Staff (Circe): adjusted activation and duration of Serenity effect; Serenity now adds Omega bonus damage that scales with this Aspect's rank</em></li>
<li><em>Witch's Staff (Momus): reworked; each of your Omega Moves automatically fires several times in succession from where you use them</em></li>
<li><em>Sister Blades (Artemis): you will Block again if the effect recharges while you are channeling; Block now takes priority over Dodge and similar effects</em></li>
<li><em>Umbral Flames (Eos): reworked; Omega Attack now fires a slow shot that occasionally creates damage blasts and also copies your Specials</em></li>
<li><em>Moonstone Axe (Melinoë): reworked; now adds Power and Max Life</em></li>
<li><em>Moonstone Axe (Thanatos): reworked; faster Attack adds Critical chance to Omega moves</em></li>
<li><em>Argent Skull (Medea): improved hit detection on foes near impassable obstacles</em></li>
<li><em>Argent Skull (Persephone): you now earn Glory much faster, but only by using your Omega Cast; improved control responsiveness during Omega Special</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Hades II was suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on early access last month. The game has already attracted around a million players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to SteamDB</a>, despite the full release being around a year away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24170422/foundry-virtual-tabletop-interview-explainer-immersive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2nPUmb">I first got into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23851111/baldurs-gate-3-dungeons-dragons-dnd-ttrpg-spell-slots">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which naturally meant that my <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23156407/tabletop-gaming-online-tools-suggestions-maps-systems">group started online</a>. This was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/21294556/dnd-how-to-play-dungeons-dragons-5e-guide-spells-dice-character-sheets-dm">particularly helpful</a> since most of my group members are spread across the world. Every few weeks, we gather on a Discord call instead of around a physical table to roll dice and tell stories. And usually, we do this via a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23352511/digital-tabletop-games-coming-soon">virtual tabletop</a>, a platform that allows us to move character tokens across a map, roll virtual dice, and (maybe most importantly to some of my group members) do basic math. </p>
<p id="KuaAGV">A couple of months ago, my Dungeon Master announced that we’d be trying something a little new for our next arc. Instead of logging in to our regular virtual tabletop, he sent over a strange-looking link and told us that our passwords were simply our first names. </p>
<p id="3y9Yb5">It took a second for us to figure out how to move our character icons and scroll around the screen, but once we did, we started to explore. We quickly realized that depending on where our character icons were on the map, we as players saw different parts of the map unfold. A few characters scouted ahead, while others lingered behind on the docks. A marketplace unfolded for those looking ahead, and the rest of us immediately scrambled to follow.</p>
<p id="7X3sCX">When we eventually entered our first battle on this new platform, and rolled our first attacks, we gleefully realized that there were animations to go along with them. My eldritch blast came out in a dazzling purple, shooting right at the sentient mushroom I was trying to hit. (And then we had a quick detour where we just spammed attacks to see how they came out, because it was all <em>so</em> cool). </p>
<p id="NRTuzp">We were all dazzled by Foundry Virtual Tabletop, as we learned it was called. And our DM seemed pretty jazzed to make the game more interactive. He’s always been passionate about pulling in voice modifiers and queueing up music, but with Foundry VTT, everything leveled up <em>just</em> that much more. </p>

<p id="of5LT2">Intrigued by the new possibilities on display, I chatted with Foundry VTT creator Andrew Clayton about the up-and-coming <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23156407/tabletop-gaming-online-tools-suggestions-maps-systems">virtual tabletop system</a>, which celebrated its fourth anniversary this month. Like many tabletop players, Clayton took his games online when in-person scheduling became difficult. The virtual tabletop options out there worked decently enough, but he couldn’t help but spot some lost potential. </p>
<p id="gVp9qK">“I found them to be sort of limiting in ways that I personally found frustrating,” explains Clayton. “And so since I was in a position of being between hobbies [and] between little hobby projects at the time, I kind of had the, I guess, hubris, you might say, to sort of ask the question of, like, <em>Well, what if I try to make something?</em>” </p>
<p id="wSU4iD">He never really intended to make Foundry VTT; but after experimenting, Clayton realized that there was something of value in there and he decided to pursue it further. One of his biggest goals was to push the immersivity of the virtual experience as far as possible. The possibilities with Foundry are much much higher than other VTT spaces.</p>
<p id="k5fhCC">On the game master’s side, Foundry VTT<em> </em>is a one-time purchase for DMs that lets them download the software and host a server for an unlimited number of players, who access it via a link. There is only one purchase tier, which includes all existing Foundry VTT<em> </em>features, all future updates, and no subscription fees. And unlike other virtual tabletop experiences, Foundry VTT doesn’t require players to sign up for anything. </p>
<p id="9w8IMH">Foundry VTT has all the basics you need for a virtual tabletop: character sheets, dice rolling (which does all the math for you), maps, and tokens to move around said maps. But the software also offers a chance for DMs to get <em>really </em>immersive, with dynamic lightning, visual and audio effects, and other features that make an adventure come to life. </p>

<p id="FkBElp">It’s all pretty invisible to the players. Now that our group is all in on Foundry VTT, we mostly move around our own icons, exploring the map and uncovering new elements as we go. Battles take on an extra level of cool when attacks bring up animations targeted to the enemies we click on. The basic elements of a virtual tabletop are all there, but just augmented and given more options for immersion.</p>
<p id="D8EvKR">In one particularly climactic moment, for instance, my group watched a snow effect fall across the landscape as a queen made a big announcement. And then, as she spoke, the snow turned gold — indicating a war on the horizon. We all gasped and howled (especially since we, uh, may’ve accidentally caused the war in the first place — whoops!). All of this was done via a particle effect already integrated within<em> </em>Foundry VTT (with the help of a few mods, adds my DM).</p>
<p id="rjwVjX">Mods are a key part of the Foundry experience. Clayton decided very early on that he wanted Foundry VTT to be super developer-focused, so that members of the community could create different mods for the existing software to help integrate their favorite game systems. As a mod developer himself, this was very important to Clayton. And opening the doors for mod developers to use Foundry as a springboard ended up fostering a particularly creative and passionate community — which ended up paving the way for the company’s first big partnership with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23658946/imperium-maledictum-warhammer-40k-tabletop-rpg-cubicle-7-setting">Cubicle 7</a> for <a href="https://cubicle7games.com/our-games/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay"><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>’s fourth edition</a>.</p>

<p id="ex981F">“Huge IP, huge franchise, huge game system, huge publisher,” says Clayton. “By all rights that should not have been one of our first gets. [...] But part of the reason it did was the community developers who were making the Warhammer Fantasy system for Foundry had just done such a superlative job of making it an absolutely stunning visual game system that really authentically channeled the feeling of Warhammer. It was just such a strong sales pitch that got them excited and got them on board.”</p>
<p id="UXXiex">That first big win, built atop user-generated content, opened the door to other partnerships with publishers, including most recently D&amp;D publisher Wizards of the Coast. It’s a relationship that Clayton wasn’t sure would ever happen. </p>
<p id="iX0jZJ">“I’d actually kind of reached a point where I was comfortable with the fact that it might never happen,” Clayton says. “I guess that [resignation] was what it took for [the partnership] to happen.”</p>

<p id="HVezYy">I didn’t even realize how integral the official D&amp;D integration was until I thought back on how, when I add new spells to my sheet, all I need to do is search for them and click “add.” The information from the sourcebooks my DM owns is already integrated into the server. Since my campaign is mostly homebrew, with a setting concocted by my DM, we don’t heavily use existing reference materials, but Clayton showed me how easy it is to pull up source guides for specific games, campaigns, and settings. He also demonstrated how seamless it is to jump between different written material. It’s also very useful in showing information to just one person at a time (or a handful, depending on who gets to know), which makes the experience all the more immersive.  </p>

<p id="Oo54J5">Foundry VTT<em> </em>has a bit of a learning curve to it, something that Clayton readily admits. Even on the player side, there’s a <em>lot</em> going on with the UI, which makes it a little tricky to get used to.  But Clayton likens it to Photoshop or Canva. Foundry is a tool that ultimately has more freedom and flexibility once you get past the initial hurdle of figuring it out. </p>
<p id="DAnGQk">“I’m very aware of what Foundry can do,” he says. “What surprises me and really blows me away is when a community developer actually leans into that, and really takes advantage of it and pushes the boundary of what’s possible in a really exciting way.”</p>
<p id="ards2S">For instance, Foundry VTT is primarily meant to showcase 2D maps and spaces. But there are some people out there who’ve managed to use it to convey 3D environments. There are also developers who’ve managed to put together complex scripted sequences — way more than just turning some snow a different color — that fully utilizes the software’s audio and visual capabilities. </p>

<p id="QiQPJX">“We know that that [kind of custom work] can be done,” Clayton says. “But knowing it can be done, and then seeing someone actually take the time to make it and have it work that way is really, really inspiring.” </p>
<p id="q4Q9HI">So should your weekly in-person gaming group consider making the switch online? Clayton believes that there’s some aspects of virtual tabletops that actually eclipse in-person play. Maybe there’s a big encounter on the horizon and your DM wants to try and do something special. But even scheduling games between players can be made much easier, especially at a distance, when you’re doing everything online. (“That’s top of the list [of bullet points],” Clayton quips.) </p>
<p id="TXNdgS">But there’s also just the simple fact that mechanically dense games are easier to parse when the material can be readily accessible without having to crack open a sourcebook or pull up a bunch of FAQs and databases on the web. </p>
<p id="SkB7r7">Personally, as a player, what’s really stood out to me over the last several months is just how much Foundry VTT<em> </em>embraces its digital roots, enabling GMs to virtually build out their setting and make it as dynamic as possible. The online space isn’t a limitation; it’s a jumping-off point. </p>
<p id="55dRwQ">“The ceiling [for creative people] is much, much higher,” says Clayton. “I think people probably think of some of the spectacular sets that they have on a show like <em>Critical Role</em>, where it’s this amazing terrain and [custom] miniatures for every creature. [...] The amount of work and production effort that went into that happening is totally impossible for really anyone who’s not a professional company staging that production. But I think having something that’s approaching that level of immersion in a digital environment is much much easier [using a VTT].”</p>
<p id="BQ0Srv">For what the software can do, it’s not terribly demanding on a computer. As a player, it’s all integrated within a browser, so all I have to do is click a link. Of course, it does depend on how complex the GM wants to make the experience, but Clayton absolutely wants to make sure that Foundry VTT’s capabilities balance with its performance, without sacrificing one for the other. </p>
<p id="O2hGnM">“That’s something that I want us to double down on and continue investing in,” says Clayton. “So that that remains an area where we are the superior choice for a group that wants to tell a very visually rich, very immersive, very high-production-value sort of game.” </p>

<p dir="ltr">Escort mode also received a fix that previously caused an inaccurate timer to display when a player joined a match in progress.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes include adjustments for two killstreaks. The Cluster Mine streak should now properly contribute towards a player's killstreak earn progress, and the DNA Bomb is earnable by players using scorestreaks when they reach the streak's requirement of a 25 killstreak.</p><p dir="ltr">A small Zombies update addressed an exploit that previously allowed players to bypass the mode's stash size limits, and the DNA samples for the Critical Countdown Event can now be collected in Dark Aether Rifts.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Warzone side, the popular DG-58 LSW light machine gun was drastically nerfed, with the weapon's minimum damage decreased from 27 to 22, and the maximum damage range dropped from 29.21 to 17.78 meters.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this adjustment was made because the DG-58 LSW was "a bit too dominant at range," so a gradual damage falloff was added to keep the gun competitive at close-mid encounters, but it falls off slightly in long-range fights.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also changes the Season 4 Warzone Rewards challenge for Plunder. The challenge was previously requiring players to collect a specific amount of cash and not tracking progress, but the challenge has been changed to require players to complete 20 Plunder games instead. Hopefully, this new requirement is tracking properly.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-reveal-trailer-get-a-first-look-at-2024s-call-of-duty-game/1100-6523744/">Black Ops 6 has been officially announced</a>, and game details will arrive on June 9 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-described-as-dark-new-chapter/1100-6523660/">during the Xbox games showcase</a>.</p><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h3>COD HQ</h3><ul><li>Prompt to restart the game after changing your Activision ID now functions as expected.</li></ul><h3>MW3 MULTIPLAYER</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Bug Fixes  <ul><li>While the Looping Killstreaks modifier is active (Season 4.0), the earn progress HUD widget will now reappear after earning the highest Killstreak.</li><li>Corrected placeholder images in the Killstreaks and Equipment tabs of the Armory Unlocks menu.</li><li>Addressed an exploit allowing Custom Mods to be saved with multiple Attachments equipped to a single category.</li><li>Weekly Challenges menu now displays the correct Season 3 Camo name.</li><li>Tokyo map now displays the correct name in the Combat Record.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul><li>Critical Countdown DNA samples will no longer appear in Private Matches.</li></ul><h3>MODES</h3><ul><li>Escort  <ul><li>Joining a match in progress will no longer display an inaccurate timer.</li></ul></li><li>Infected  <ul><li>Identity Theft Finishing Move now works as expected on Infected team members.</li><li>Inaccurate Scores are no longer displayed when a match ends with few players.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing matches to disconnect with a Connection Timed Out error.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Infected has returned to the Quick Play filter and Private Matches.</p><ul><li>One in the Chamber  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing poor performance during the Final Killcam.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>WEAPONS &amp; ATTACHMENTS</h3><p>Submachine Guns</p><ul><li>Superi 46  <ul><li>Terminal V and Atoll-Z4 Suppressed Barrel Attachments now hide operator position from the minimap as intended.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Launchers</p><ul><li>RGL-80  <ul><li>Decreased camera shake dealt to victims upon explosive damage by 60%.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>KILLSTREAKS</h3><ul><li>Cluster Mine  <ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing kills from contributing to Killstreak earn progress while the Streaks Earn Streaks modifier is active (Season 4.0).</li></ul></li><li>DNA Bomb  <ul><li>Players using Scorestreaks now earn the DNA Bomb at 25 Kills, as expected.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing Strike Team Operator customization after recruitment.</li></ul><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><ul><li>Sergeant's Beret companion will no longer shoot the Server during a Ground Station contract.</li><li>DNA samples for the Critical Countdown Event can now be collected in Dark Aether Rifts.</li><li>Addressed an exploit bypassing Stash size limits involving Elder Sigils.</li></ul><h2>WARZONE GENERAL</h2><ul><li><b>Warzone Rewards</b><ul><li>Under the Mode challenges, the Plunder challenge has been changed to “Complete 20 Plunder Games.”</li></ul></li></ul><h2>GAMEPLAY</h2><ul><li><b>Medical Cabinets</b><ul><li>Perk Packs can now drop from medical cabinets.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Precision Airstrikes</b><ul><li>Precision Airstrikes have been reverted back to their previous functionality prior to Season 4.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>WEAPONS</h2><h4>LIGHT MACHINE GUNS</h4><p>WEAPONADJUSTMENTS</p><h3>DG-58 LSW</h3><ul><li>Min Damage decreased to 22, down from 27.</li><li>Max Damage Range decreased to 17.78 meters, down from 29.21.</li><li><b>New Damage Ranges Added</b><ul><li>Near-Mid Damage set to 27</li><li>Near-Mid Damage Range set to 30.48 meters.</li><li>Mid Damage set to 25</li><li>Mid Damage Range set to 45.72 meters.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The DG-58 LSW was a bit too dominant at range, so we have introduced a gradual damage falloff which keeps it competitive at those close-mid encounters, but now falls off slightly as you approach those long range fights.</p><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue causing the Bomb Drone UI to remain on the players screen.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing controller players from opening the “Manage Party” function when their squad is full.</li></ul>
