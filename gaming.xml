That was impressive enough for Game Science, a studio founded by ex-Tencent staff who in the past had primarily worked on mobile games. But <em>Black Myth</em> has also topped every other Steam online sensation of the last few years, including <em>Lost Ark</em> and <em>Palworld</em>, as well as Valve’s own multiplayer hits <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> and <em>Dota 2</em>.</p><p>That overwhelming day-one audience appears to be mostly overseas so far, with Simon Carless of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Discover</em> newsletter</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimating</a></span> almost 90 percent of <em>Black Myth</em>’s current players on Steam are from China, followed by 3 percent from the U.S. and 1 percent from Japan. “Probably, China accounts for 80+% of players where with a large game with localization in the region will account for maybe 25-40%m” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1825880703596429525&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1825880703596429525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> Michael Douise, head of publishing at <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>maker Larian Studios. “It’s a testament what the region can do to shatter numbers when properly mobilized both regionally and internationally in one big launch.”</p><h2 id="h14972"><a id=""></a>Is <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> coming to Game Pass?</h2><p>We also still don’t know the breakdown of player numbers on PlayStation 5, where <em>Black Myth</em> is a temporary console exclusive after the Xbox version was delayed. The Microsoft miss echoes last year’s giant <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> launch where a version wasn’t ready for the Game Pass platform until December. Why the wait this time? “We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X/S version to meet our quality standards, so it won’t release simultaneously with the other platforms,” Game Science <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-ditches-xbox-series-x-and-s-version&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-ditches-xbox-series-x-and-s-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote earlier this year</a></span>. “We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards.”</p><p>Some players speculated that was due to a surprise exclusivity deal with Sony, but it seems like the Xbox version, which has to have feature parity on both Xbox Series X and the weaker S, just wasn’t ready. “We’re excited for the launch of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” a Microsoft spokesperson told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Windows Central</em></a></span> in June. “We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.”</p><p>Given the blockbuster launch thus far, it seems unlikely <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> will be a surprise Game Pass release once it finally hits Xbox unless Microsoft is willing to shell out some series money. Usually those deals get locked in to help developers and publishers hedge risk prior to release, or to get extra revenue on during the longtail once a game has already been out for a while.<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> hasn’t come to Game Pass yet either, and studio head <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-game-pass-pc-1851102488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-game-pass-pc-1851102488">Swen Vincke previously said it probably never would</a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/20/sonic-x-shadow-generations-interview-shadow-the-hedgehogs-new-doom-powers-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, PlayStation shared an interview revealing fresh details on Shadow’s Doom Powers coming to Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>



<p>During the interview, Sonic Team Creative Officer Takashi Iizuka said “the Doom Powers play an essential role in Shadow’s journey and development.” They emphasized its flexibility, giving Shadow “new ways to attack enemies and traverse the world” with platforming and more. </p>



<p>Iizuka also mentioned that “the Doom Powers draw energy from Black Doom, so that was taken into consideration in the design of all the Doom Powers.” Earlier this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-new-images-tease-black-doom-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some new images</a> revealed the modern render of the iconic villain Black Doom. </p>



<p>The blog accompanied a new trailer today, which showcases Shadow’s anticipated Doom Powers in action.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The trailer breaks down key abilities including Doom Spears and Doom Blast, which offer new ways for players to attack with Shadow. </p>



<p>Doom Morph, Doom Wing, and Doom Surf are all traversal techniques, allowing shadow to interact with environments, fly, and cross water with ease.</p>



<p>In July 2024, Takashi Iizuka also mentioned a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rpg-sega-takashi-iizuka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential Sonic RPG</a>. Though he said such a project is “just a dream right now,” they appeared to express serious interest.</p>



<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations launches on October 25, 2024. It will be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and current or last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is taking the world by storm on launch day, beating out records left and right to become one of the most-played games on Steam on day one. It’s honestly impressive, and after playing the game for hours, I fully understand why. It’s phenomenal but certainly more challenging than many were led to believe. Here’s what you need to know before starting Black Myth: Wukong!</p>



<h2 id="h-tips-before-starting-black-myth-wukong">Tips Before Starting Black Myth: Wukong</h2>



<p>We’ve compiled a handful of tips, and it’s sure to grow as I dive into the game more today, that should help you gain a foothold in Black Myth: Wukong. Here’s how to get the best start and beat your opponents as The Destined One!</p>



<h2 id="h-harvest-everything">Harvest Everything!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s start with one of the most essential tips I can offer new players: harvest everything you see. As you explore each zone, you’ll stumble upon countless harvestable resources. These vary in type. You’ll acquire Aged Ginseng, Purple Lingzhi, Gentian, Jade Lotus, and many others. They’re all necessary to craft medicine, which can heal you, remove various effects, such as poison or fire damage, boost your damage output, and even increase your damage resistance.</p>



<p>Trust me when I tell you that you’ll want a few medicinal items on hand to defeat the game’s many bosses!</p>



<h2 id="h-explore-the-world-around-you">Explore the World Around You</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong isn’t an open-world game but is still relatively large. Every zone I’ve explored so far includes numerous pathways, multiple optional bosses, and countless weak and powerful enemies that provide you with Will upon besting them in combat. </p>



<p>Like in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-elden-ring-steam-deck-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>, there’s no shame in farming regular mobs before tackling a boss. You can quickly gain a level or two before each boss fight by clearing the entire zone. If you want to farm, let the last enemy kill you and repeat the process. </p>



<p>But more importantly, you’ll find secret routes, treasure chests, harvestable resources, and optional secret bosses that reward you with items and Will necessary to push further into the story.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-fear-dying">Don’t Fear Dying</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>While it certainly borrows from the Soulslike genre, Black Myth: Wukong isn’t technically a Soulslike. It’s still challenging, and there are still many bosses to challenge; there’s no penalty for dying. Should you perish in combat, you’ll respawn at the last Shrine you visited and then go about your day. </p>



<p>That’s right; when you die in Black Myth: Wukong, you don’t drop your Will. You keep everything in your inventory, and the only downside is now you must traverse the zone once more and clear its enemies out of your way. You lose time and nothing else.</p>



<h2 id="h-visit-shrines-often">Visit Shrines Often</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Every Shrine you encounter is a checkpoint. Should you die in combat, you’ll respawn at the last Shrine. But there’s more to these offering points than meets the eye. Every Shrine allows you to:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rest</strong>: Replenish your resources, including health and stamina, but all regular enemies respawn (not bosses!).</li>



<li><strong>Travel</strong>: You can travel fast from one Shrine to another, which makes farming Will easier.</li>



<li><strong>Self</strong>–<strong>Advance</strong>: You can choose which spells you’ll wield and respec your skill points.</li>



<li><strong>Craft</strong>: Create weapons and armor using materials you’ve gathered in the world.</li>



<li><strong>Brew</strong>: Craft drinks to aid you in combat.</li>



<li><strong>Store</strong>: Purchase and sell items.</li>



<li><strong>Make Medicines</strong>: Create consumable medicinal items to aid you in combat.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, don’t be afraid to buy items from the Store. It’s a helpful way to gain aid items that allow you to deal additional damage or take more damage from enemies. But also, the Store will periodically refresh with new items, so check back frequently!</p>







<h2 id="h-defeat-bosses-to-gain-spirits">Defeat Bosses to Gain Spirits</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you stumble upon bosses in Black Myth: Wukong, you have a choice. Unless they’re a story boss, you can walk away and find a different path to your objective or fight. It’s up to you. But I recommend you fight every boss you can, as they’ll reward you with Will, occasionally valuable items, and Spirits. You want to acquire as many Spirits in Black Myth: Wukong as possible.</p>



<p>As you unlock Spirits, you’ll unlock that boss’ attack. It expands your arsenal of combat moves, allowing you to mix up playstyles and deal additional damage to enemies. But more importantly, Spirits grant you passive buffs that alter crucial elements of combat. For instance, some Spirits work like a Bloodied build in Fallout 76, allowing you to deal more damage when at low health.</p>



<p>But if you find that you cannot defeat a boss, you can use the game’s fast travel system to return to an area at any point in the game to challenge them once you’re stronger!</p>



<h2 id="h-consider-your-armor-wisely">Consider Your Armor Wisely</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>To aid you in combat, you will inevitably unlock the ability to craft armor. When you visit a Shrine, you’ll see the new choice in the menu, and by now, you should have the necessary resources to craft most of the first armor set: Pilgrim’s.</p>



<p>This is one of the key reasons why you should harvest everything! Every armor set in the game offers a unique buff to your stats and abilities. Take the Pilgrim’s set, for example. When you equip two pieces, your Sprint speed moderately increases. With four pieces equipped, as you Sprint, you gain a damage buff that stacks up to 10 times. It’s incredibly potent when used appropriately.</p>



<p>But as you progress through the game, you will unlock additional armor sets that buff damage, increase defense, and other boons that affect your play style. Find the right set for you, and the rest of the game becomes relatively easier!</p>

<p>Up until the 1896 update dropped on 15th August, the extraction shooter's simultaneous player record - set back in October 2023 - sat at a modest 42,000ish players.</p>

<p>The new update, however, has ushered in a rush of new and returning players, upping its concurrent peak to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/594650/charts/?__cf_chl_tk=FZ5GXDFLVTgu85Z4FUkRu4.ml_HRXNG1m_bHXKsmOf0-1724142110-0.0.1.1-8020">60,124 players</a>.</p>
<p>You'd think this would be good news for the player base, but that aforementioned UI update has actually seen the game's hitherto "mostly positive" Steam review score tumble to "mostly negative".</p>
<p>"Hunt 1896 is an unbearable garbage. All the bugs in game make in-game experience completely unsatisfying," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080789007/recommended/594650/">said</a> one unhappy player who has clocked up over 500 playing it.</p>
<p>"Also the new UI... whoever made it should be deprived from ever developing video games. I've played 500+ hours and enjoyed this game, but after such a spit into players' faces, Crytek deserves only bad reviews."</p>
<p>"Y'all chill out about the UI," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023192091/recommended/594650/">suggested</a> one less aggravated player. "New players are coming to the game [right now], and the first thing they're seeing is 'Mostly Negative' reviews. The dev's gon' fix it."</p>
<p>"The bad steam reviews are coming from people who don't realise the UI was always a slog since 2019," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/marcosvolta/recommended/594650/">added</a> another.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unannounced-hunt-showdown-1896-pops-up-on-the-esrb-website">Hunt: Showdown 1896 popped up on the ESRB website last month</a>, although, at the time, we weren't sure if this was a full sequel or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-ditching-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-in-august-as-part-of-significant-relaunch">eagerly-anticipated update</a> big enough to necessitate a new rating. Turns out it was the latter.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown got its full launch back in 2021 after a few years in early access. Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell liked it a lot on release, calling it a "stealth survival game like few others" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-review">his review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The brand-new aerobatic open-world survival RPG is available to try out for those who are at Gamescom. However, if you aren't, don't fret. Fera: The Sundered Tribes just got an official early access date. This title is made by Massive Damage, the studio that made games like Halcyon 6 and Star Renegades. Their highly anticipated title, Fera: The Sundered Tribes, now officially has an Early Access date.</p>
<p>This title was first announced last year during IGN's post-show for <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-company-to-return-to-gamescom-2023-company-registrations-up-10-compared-to-last-year/">Gamescom's Opening Night Live</a>. Fera: The Sundered Tribes will be available in Early Access for PC on Steam as of September 17, 2024.</p>
<p>The game has a high social media following, with plenty of people expressing their excitement for the gameplay. Players will soar through the skies, searching for behemoth beasts in vibrant, lush landscapes. The game includes elements of hunting and harvesting, aerial combat, and the capability to participate in co-op gameplay. In addition to these, people can also build their village and work to lead their own tribe.</p>
<p>Combining these elements results in a stunning post-apocalyptic fantasy world as players grapple and soar through stunning vistas to fight colossal creatures to protect and provide for your growing colony and the inhabitants.</p>
<p>"While it's daunting for us as an indie studio to take on a game genre inhabited by behemoth studios with massive budgets, we're thrilled to see our Tiktok videos going viral and flooded by players excited by the concept of 'monster hunting with wingsuits' and eager to get their hands on Fera," says Ken Soto, CEO and co-founder of Massive Damage, Inc.</p>
<p>With the Early Access of Fera: The Sundered Tribes, there is a huge open world for players to explore, with up to four players able to join the game.&nbsp; There are over ten monster species for you to hunt in-game and four distinct weapon classes to give you the opportunity for variety and playing how you want.</p>
<p>This game was featured at the Summer Games Fest Play Days and was designated as one of the GDC "Best in Play" winners. For those who want to purchase the Early Access of Fera: The Sundered Tribes, you can purchase it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2469200/Fera_The_Sundered_Tribes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam for $29.99</a>, with the game being fully released sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>When it is fully released, the game will be available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, with more platforms to follow after the release.</p>

The QuadCast 2 and QuadCast 2 S now include a streamlined multifunction control dial and welcome upgrades to their recording quality.</p><p>The <a href="https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-quadcast-s-usb-microphone?variant=41031692058781">original versions</a> of the HyperX QuadCast mics delivered a lot of functionality at a sub-$200 price point, including multiple pickup patterns and programmable LED lighting. But recording quality maxed out at 16-bit/48kHz. The new QuadCast 2 boosts recording quality up to 24-bit/96 kHz, while the QuadCast 2 S goes even higher, maxing out at 32-bit/192kHz.</p><p>The new versions are still priced under $200, although each has received a price bump. The QuadCast 2 is now $149.99 instead of $139.99, while the QuadCast 2 S is $199.99, up from $159.99.</p><div><figcaption><em>The QuadCast 2 is still limited to just red LEDs that turn off when the mic is muted.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: HyperX</cite></p></div><p>Both mics now feature USB-C ports (the original QuadCast was microUSB), and while the previous versions featured separate knobs for changing pickup patterns and adjusting gain, the QuadCast 2 and QuadCast 2 S have a single multifunction dial on the front that handles “gain adjustment, volume control, mic monitoring, and polar pattern selection.”</p><p>HyperX has also redesigned the shock mounts on the new models, making the microphones easier to remove without having to unscrew or disassemble anything.</p><p>The new mics carry over the LED lighting of their predecessors. The QuadCast 2 is still limited to red LEDs that turn off when the mic is muted, while the QuadCast 2 S features 100 multicolor addressable LEDs that can be controlled using HyperX’s Ngenuity desktop software to match a gaming room’s aesthetic.</p><p>The QuadCast S is due to become available today, but the more capable QuadCast S 2 is expected to be released sometime in November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Placing points in these will be vital to your success in the game, as they provide very helpful boons. And while the order in which you level them should ultimately be dependent on your playstyle, we’ve compiled a list of skills we think most players will want to invest in early, if you’re looking to get the most out of the early hours of the game.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h175"><a id=""></a><strong>Robust Constitution</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Survival</strong></p><p>Robust Constitution increases your maximum health by a moderate amount for every point you invest in it. We’d recommend pumping at least three of your early Spark Points into this skill. Some of the early fights can be challenging as you’re getting to grips with the game’s mechanics, and having that extra health can make a huge difference to your survivability when you miss a dodge.</p><h2 id="h176"><a id=""></a><strong>Swift Engage</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Martial Arts</strong></p><p>Swift Engage is an incredible skill to invest in right away, because it increases the engaging distance of your light attack, which is most often the manner in which you’ll begin attacking a foe. Without this skill, your light attack will essentially keep you locked in place, requiring you to manually move to an enemy to make contact. With two Spark Points invested, however, you’ll be able to automatically close pretty significant gaps between you and the enemy by just tapping your light attack button.</p><figure id="" data-id="fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-recommend-id="image://fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a beastie in Black Myth Wukong." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fighting a beastie in Black Myth Wukong." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-recommend-id="image://fed19bbc09c17e975d426228a6eb2d69" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a beastie in Black Myth Wukong." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h177"><a id=""></a><strong>Simian Agility</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Stamina</strong></p><p>Each point in Simian Agility reduces the stamina cost of dodging by a bit, letting you more efficiently move around a battlefield. During the early part of the game, you’ll still be learning how much stamina you need to perform certain actions, so having a bit more to work with is never a bad thing. More importantly, though, investment in this skill opens up some extremely helpful additional skills in the Stamina tree.</p><h2 id="h178"><a id=""></a><strong>Deft Evasion</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Stamina</strong></p><p>After purchasing Simian Agility, you’ll have access to Deft Evasion. This is one of the best skills you can pick up early on, as it will increase the distance of your initial dodge. This makes a massive difference when enemies (bosses, especially) have large, sweeping attacks that require you to give a wide berth.</p><h2 id="h179"><a id=""></a><strong>Composure</strong></h2><p><strong>Tree: Stamina</strong></p><p>If you’ve purchased Simian Agility and Deft Evasion, you’re half of the way to Composure. You’ll just need to invest one point each in Endurance and Everlasting Vigor to access it.</p><p>We’d recommend you go that route, as this skill will allow you to keep a combo going even after you dodge. Since combos are a vital part of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s combat, this will vastly improve your efficiency when facing off against foes. Simply dodge out of the way of your enemy’s attack, then immediately continue wailing away with the combo you started.</p><p>With these skills purchased, you’ll be ready to begin spending points in your Stances trees and beyond to really hone in on your personal playstyle. We’re wishing you the best of luck out there!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/16f2c846-9920-48c4-9e09-06913ee254c5/starbreeze-interim-report-q2-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly interim report</a>, Starbreeze offered up more details on its upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons title, including the current state of development. </p>



<p>Starbreeze <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-appoints-mats-juhl-as-new-interim-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed Mats Juhl</a> as its new interim CEO in May 2024. Today, Juhl issued new comments about the D&amp;D game currently titled Project Baxter. </p>



<p>Juhl said that Project Baxter is now in full production, and that it is “growing as planned” and “continues at full speed.” </p>



<p>They also confirmed plans to consider new partnerships on the game. Juhl stated that although Starbreeze will publish the game “our ambition is to enter into partnerships where this is beneficial for the game and Starbreeze.” </p>



<p>Juhl clarified these partnerships could reinforce “marketing, physical distribution or other purposes that increase both the quality and potential of the project, whilst balancing the risk for Starbreeze.”</p>



<ol start="2026"></ol>



<figure></figure>







<p>The new report also elaborated on the timing for potential partnerships. Juhl says “Project Baxter will enter a phase in the fall where we will be more proactive in searching for and holding discussions with suitable partners.” </p>



<p>In today’s quarterly report, Juhl also reiterated Project Baxter’s 2026 release window. Starbreeze confirmed that when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-developer-is-making-a-dungeons-and-dragons-live-service-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> the title in December 2023. </p>



<p>According to the official site, Project Baxter is an Unreal Engine game featuring “co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-model, [and] community engagement.”</p>

                <p dir="ltr">From 1999 to 2015, Backyard Sports was a beloved kid-friendly sports game franchise with colorful graphics, easy gameplay, and one of the most dominant athletes in video game history in Pablo Sanchez. Today, Playground Productions has announced that Backyard Sports is coming back, and it's doing so as more than just video games.</p><p dir="ltr">Backyard Sports will be returning "across multiple verticals, including video games, merchandise, film, television and more" according to a press release. The first of these projects will launch "in the coming months," but nothing specific--including whether or not it's a video game or what platforms it will arrive on--was announced.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EleREfyN428" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EleREfyN428" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A brief teaser trailer was released alongside the announcement, which shows multiple kids in the signature Backyard Sports art style preparing for a baseball game. We see a treehouse with league standings and tournament brackets, the playground itself, and then as the pitcher takes the mound, Pablo Sanchez steps up to bat.</p><p dir="ltr">Playground Productions was founded in 2022 by Lindsay Barrett, a former second-grade teacher with "over a decade of experience in the Chicago public school system." The <a href="https://www.playground-productions.com/" rel="nofollow ">company's website</a> says that by "leveraging the best technology, talent, and character IP, Playground creates content that celebrates the spirit of play, meets children where they are developmentally, and allows kids to be kids."</p><p dir="ltr">Backyard Sports debuted on PC as Backyard Baseball in October 1997, with Backyard Soccer and Backyard Football following it in September 1998 and October 1999 respectively. The most-recent Backyard Sports games before this announcement were on mobile devices, as both Backyard Sports: Baseball 2015 and Backyard Sports: Basketball 2015 launched simultaneously in February 2015. A Backyard Sports movie was also announced in 2016, but the project never moved forward.</p>

Ever since Chow Yun Fat slid down that banister in Hard Boiled, game developers have tried over and over again to capture that particular mix of style and action—but in a medium that has all kinds of shooting genres (top-down, first-person, third-person, etc), it's a surprisingly tricky mechanic to get right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why? Well you only need look at the "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/shockwave-game-updates">Akimbo</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" system in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to find out. According to an email chat with a few developers from Respawn, implementing it required "monumental" technical work, a more grinding task than the "art" of developing Season 22's new map "E-District."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While developers like lead level designer Steve Young and map designer Garret Metcalfe got to experiment with building novel locales designed around the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/apex-legends-next-season-brings-mid-match-character-leveling">new character leveling system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, lead systems BR designer Eric Canavese and his colleagues had to crawl back over 5 years of content and code to bring basic pistols like the P2020 and Mozambique into a dual-wielding era.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Apex Legends"><span>Apex Legends</span>' akimbo system opens up new design possibilities</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Canavese, Respawn originally conceived of Akimbo weapons as being unique guns that players could pick up. That way all the animations, design, and code requirements could go through the process of being designed as any other new weapon.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/the-secret-to-apex-legends-gorgeous-first-person-animation-mouth-cameras" target="_self">The secret to Apex Legends' gorgeous first-person animation? Mouth cameras</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While "evaluating" that idea, Canavese said the team saw a window to build out an entire dual-wielding system—one that could jolt life into lower-tier weapons and make them attractive options throughout the whole game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even with a more open-ended system aimed at capturing that John Woo action fantasy, Respawn's solution highlights the constraints first-person developers find themselves in. Grabbing another gun increases the firing speed of the given weapon, enables automatic fire, and tightens the hipfire to a more narrow zone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Already you can see one missing piece of the fantasy: the player's weapons are locked in one direction, axing the possibility of pointing the weapons in different targets. This limited system also doesn't let players dual-wield different weapons like they can in the Halo and Wolfenstein series. Those aren't terrible tradeoffs—but then you encounter the hardcore development challenges the team ran into.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a five-year-old game, and though some core functions (like supply bins) have been updated over time, there's legacy code and design direction from five years ago that still has to be accounted for. Respawn's high-quality first-person animations are deeply embedded in weapon and character design, and holding a gun in each hand begins to rack up animation headaches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, adrenaline-fueled speedster Octane has custom animations that let players see him using his "stims" in many different states of motion. Players already push his animations to the limit when they activate his speed boost while reloading a weapon, taking actions that in theory would require a third hand to complete. If Octane was going to get in on the dual-wielding party, he'd need special animations that would juggle his stims and guns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All those animations grow more complicated on zip lines, where players ostensibly coast along with one hand—but need both hands to fire their guns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then came the balancing. Just giving players two pistols with equal statlines wasn't quite enough. Canavese said they had to be "completely reevaluated" in their base form to ensure when you doubled up on them, it felt like a big power spike (but not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>too</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> big).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going all-in on this overhaul had major payoff—it made two weapons that were "largely irrelevant" before season 22 into powerful options.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's something to be said about having weapons in a multiplayer game that never find their niche—but get their moment in the sun when a team has resources to build new systems dedicated to them. It doesn't just make that weapon more fun now—it affirms the decision to make it in the first place. Sometimes in a live service game, you need five years or so to make some good ideas stick.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/19/jackbox-naughty-packs-adult-only-party-drops-on-12th-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Jackbox Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jackbox-naughty-pack">Jackbox Naughty Pack</a>, their first adults-only collection of minigames, will launch across all major platforms on 12th September 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Naughty Pack | Official Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAYOPKYDuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Depending on your friends group, you might be confused that this is the first naughty pack, when you can pretty much make all of the games in the series a bit filthy, just from your own answers and creative endeavours, but Jackbox Games is leaning into that aspect with a trio of games.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fakin’ It All Night Long (Social Deduction): A returning sequel to Fakin’ It, this game will assign one Faker per round and it is up to the group to determine which player is lying when asked questions such as “Put a finger up for every public restroom you’ve used today”. This game introduces a brand-new “remote play” mode so that everyone can join even if they’re not in the same room. 3 – 8 players.</li>
<li>Dirty Drawful (Drawing, Guessing): Another returning sequel, this game challenges players to draw a picture based off of the dirty prompt they receive on their phones. Their mission is to convince everyone else that their prompt best fits the drawing, or if they’re the artist, to best match the correct prompt. 3 – 8 players.</li>
<li>Let Me Finish (Debate): This new presentation game examines life’s serious questions like, “Where is this mailbox’s butt?” or “How does this avocado get aroused?” Everyone gets a chance to speak their mind, but will others pick up what you’re putting down? 3 – 8 players.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jackbox Naughty Pack will be priced at $21.69 / €21.69, which isn’t that far off from a regular pack, which typically includes five games. That could be a disappointment for people, though as long as these are three absolute bangers, that wouldn’t be too bad.</p>

<p>The tenth entry in the long-running party game series arrived last year with Jason saying, “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/the-jackbox-party-pack-10-review/">Jackbox Party Pack 10</a> is one of the stronger entries in the Jackbox pantheon, and I’m a big fan of it as a whole. Each game has its own pacing, and while I do think everyone will find their favourites as always, the mix feels very good this time around, and even the trivia game is fun. This is a great party pack that’ll be a good addition to any game night. Apart from Dodo Re Mi – I hope those digital birds stay eaten.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-snap-tap-automation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-2-may-have-just-banned-your-keyboards-best-feature.957753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-snap-tap-automation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced that it's banning the ability to perform multiple actions from a single input in&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, and anyone who's picked up Razer's Huntsman V3 Pro keyboard might be getting pretty upset right now.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/6500469346429600836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam yesterday</a>, Valve said that while some forms of&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>scripting have "gained acceptance" due to allowing "plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible", "some hardware features" have recently begun to blur "the line between manual input and automation".</p>
<p>As a result, the developer says it's no longer allowing any kind of automation in&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, whether that's hardware-based or script-based. Valve says automation "circumvent[s]" the "core skills" that players must demonstrate when playing&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-automation-ban-crouching.jpg?itok=vQuUmeAf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-automation-ban-crouching.jpg?itok=3VgVQaWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>won't let you automate your actions anymore.</figcaption></figure><p>In its post, Valve makes specific reference to the jump-throw move, which allows players to bind both jumping and throwing to a single key in order to perform both actions in quick succession.</p>
<p>Other uses, however, include counter-strafing, an action by which players move and then quickly stop moving by tapping the opposite direction key, making their shots more accurate. As you can imagine, these actions are pretty hard to perform without automation.</p>
<p>This decision will be of particular interest to Razer Huntsman V3 Pro owners thanks to <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/introducing-snap-tap-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the keyboard's Snap Tap mode</a>, which "allows for instantaneous directional changes without lifting the initial key" you've pressed.</p>
<p>The feature has been endorsed by pro&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>players like XertioN and BeYN, but it sounds like Valve's new update may have completely invalidated what appears to be a pretty major selling point for Razer's new hardware.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/razer-huntsman-v3-pro-snap-tap-counter-strike-2.jpg?itok=FnoM_-XQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/razer-huntsman-v3-pro-snap-tap-counter-strike-2.jpg?itok=Z4YCONHl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Razer's Huntsman V3 Pro keyboards come with the Snap Tap feature built in.</figcaption></figure><p>Razer's Snap Tap feature has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1ew5xh6/snap_tap_usage_at_cologne/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proven pretty popular</a> at pro&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike&nbsp;</em>tournaments, and until Valve's latest announcement, it was perfectly fine to use said feature in pro play, although that's presumably no longer the case.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Razer for comment on this story and will update as soon as we hear anything back.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/20/xbox-game-pass-august-2024-wave-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a> today, Xbox announced the second wave of titles coming to Game Pass this August, including Atlas Fallen and more. It also confirms the first game joining in September 2024.</p>



<p>The following titles are coming to Xbox Game Pass in August 2024 and the first week of September:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlas Fallen – August 22</li>



<li>Core Keeper – August 27</li>



<li>Star Trucker – September 3</li>
</ul>



<p>This confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlas-fallen-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors from last month</a> that Atlas Fallen would join Xbox’s Game Pass, shortly following its major Reign of Sand update. Reign of Sand launched just a couple of weeks ago, adding new enemies, quests, New Game+, and more.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The new blog also teases the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 early access Open Beta starting August 30. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a> in July 2024, the anticipated early access will run through September 4. </p>



<p>Fans can begin downloading the beta on August 28, 2024. The full open beta will run from September 6 to September 9, 2024.</p>



<p>Today’s blog also confirmed some new titles will expand the Game Pass Core tier on August 21, 2024. Those include Cities: Skylines, Control: Ultimate Edition, and SnowRunner.</p>



<p>Cities: Skylines 2 had a rough launch, with Paradox even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-apologizes-again-after-even-more-cities-skylines-2-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apologizing for issues</a> early on in April 2024. Although the devs consistently worked on updates, and most recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-economy-rework-coming-june-24-devs-address-console-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked the economy</a> with another major update, fans still enjoy its predecessor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2024, NVIDIA announced the next wave of PC games featuring DLSS and RTX technologies, highlighted by BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Obsidian's Avowed.</p>
<p>Both fantasy RPGs will support NVIDIA DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation), NVIDIA Reflex, and ray tracing, though we don't know exactly which graphics effects will be enhanced. The most common ones are reflections, shadows, ambient occlusion, and global illumination.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is powered by DICE's Frostbite engine, which has supported NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing in various Battlefield games. BioWare has recently shared the official PC requirements, which are pretty low, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-quite-low-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Needless to say, playing at 4K and 60+ FPS with ray tracing enabled will likely require a far beefier rig than what's listed in the recommended requirements. The developers will likely share more information soon since Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now about two months and a half away from launching.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | RTX Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1k0lUq1pVY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It might take a while longer for Avowed since Obsidian has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> the game to February 18, 2025, officially in an attempt to avoid the cramped Fall game release schedule (but Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 just <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did</a> the same and placed itself just one week before Avowed).</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed | NVIDIA DLSS 3 &amp; Ray Tracing Premiere" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWeYmim3IFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 3, DLAA, and Reflex will also be available in the soon-to-be-released Final Fantasy XVI PC port. These are just the three most famous games announced today by NVIDIA. Here's the remaining seventeen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Black Slate (DLSS 3, Reflex, Ray Tracing)</li>
<li>Concord</li>
<li>Empire of Ants (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Eternal Strands (DLSS 3, Reflex, Ray Tracing)</li>
<li>Funko Fusion (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Fragpunk (DLSS 3, Reflex, Ray Tracing)</li>
<li>GreedFall II: The Dying World (NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution)</li>
<li>Killing Floor III (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Kingmakers (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Once Human (DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Retrieval (RTXDI)</li>
<li>Spine (DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Test Drive Unlimited (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Unawake (DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
<li>Wuthering Waves (NVIDIA DLSS 3, Reflex)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, NVIDIA said there are now over 600 PC games and apps that support RTX technologies. On a separate note, GeForce NOW already supports the newly <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-comes-to-pc-september-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Final Fantasy XVI demo. Moreover, a feature called Xbox Automatic Sign-On is coming this Thursday, allowing seamless access to PC Game Pass across all compatible GeForce NOW devices. A new GFN Ultimate data center is about to launch in Poland, too, expanding the service's reach in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Last but not least, today NVIDIA released a new Game Ready driver optimized for Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Star Wars: Outlaws, Concord, and Final Fantasy XVI. As usual, you can download it via the official <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> or via apps like GeForce Experience and the new NVIDIA app.</p>
<p>PC gamers interested in Star Wars: Outlaws can potentially take advantage of the newly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-star-wars-outlaws-bundle-free-available-rtx-40-desktop-gpus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>RTX 40 Series Bundle, which will provide them with a game code as long as they buy an RTX 40 Series GPU or desktop/laptop from participating retailers.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-7800-retro-console-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atari-7800-retro-console-faithfully-recreates-a-classic-this-winter.957705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-7800-retro-console-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari and Plaion have announced the Atari 7800+, a faithful recreation of the classic 1986 Atari 7800. It's set to launch around the world this winter and will be compatible with original 7800 cartridges as well.</p>
<p>Per a press release, the 7800+ is a "scaled-down, compact edition" of the original 7800, so it won't take up quite as much room in your setup. It's also got HDMI compatibility, so you can hook it up to modern displays with no problem.</p>
<p>The console will be compatible with both original 7800 cartridges and original 2600 carts, echoing the backwards compatibility of the original 7800. Just like its predecessor, it also won't be able to run 5200 cartridges, so you're out of luck if you've got a large 5200 library for some reason.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atari-7800-bentley-bears-crystal-quest.jpg?itok=aY1ImFlJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atari-7800-bentley-bears-crystal-quest.jpg?itok=2WK2hZ5K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A brand new game has been created specially for the Atari 7800+.</figcaption></figure><p>Atari and Plaion say they guarantee "near-perfect compatibility with original and third-party Atari games", though, so your 2600 and 7800 libraries should be safe on the new 7800+.</p>
<p>Each 7800+ will come pre-packaged with a wireless CX78+ controller, which recreates the two-button setup of the original 7800's peripheral. You'll also get a copy of&nbsp;<em>Bentley Bear's Crystal Quest</em>, a brand new sequel to the Atari classic&nbsp;<em>Crystal Castles</em>.</p>
<p>A number of other new games, some of them based on IPs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-buys-up-12-classic-arcade-franchises-including-berzerk-and-more">acquired by Atari last year</a>, will also be available for the system, and the lineup will include "Atari releases for popular homebrew games", along with three "multi-game 2600+ cartridges" (which will, as a reminder, be compatible with the 7800+).</p>

The company has teamed up with Plaion to announce the Atari 7800 Plus, which comes equipped with an HDMI port to connect to modern televisions, alongside support for both Atari 2600 and 7800 game cartridges — just like the original console.</p><p>The $129.99 Atari 7800 Plus is <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-7800">available to preorder now</a>, with a global release expected in “winter 2024,” according to Atari’s press release. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034344/atari-400-mini-release-date-price">other mini-console recreations</a> the company has released in recent years, the Atari 7800 Plus is visually identical to the original 1986 console (aside from being shrunken down). Players can also choose between running games in widescreen mode or 4:3 aspect ratio to preserve the feeling of playing on retro hardware.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Atari 7800 Plus comes bundled with the new CX78 Plus Wireless Gamepad (pictured).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atari</cite></p></div><p>There are two new wireless controllers launching alongside the Atari 7800 Plus. The CX78 Plus Wireless Gamepad — a recreation of the console’s original two-button controller — comes bundled with the Atari 7800 Plus but can also be purchased separately for $34.99. The gamepad also wirelessly connects to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">the Atari 2600 Plus recreation</a> released last year and can be connected to a PC via a USB-C adapter. There’s also the $34.99 CX40 Plus Wireless Joystick, which is sold separately and carries the same support.</p><div><figcaption><em>Like the CX78 gamepad, the CX40 Plus Wireless Joystick can also be used on PC or the Atari 2600 Plus mini-console.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atari</cite></p></div><p>Atari touts that the Atari 7800 Plus has “near-perfect compatibility” with original and third-party Atari games. Only one game is being shipped with the console itself — a specially designed cartridge for the <em>Crystal Castles</em> sequel, <em>Bentley Bear’s Crystal Quest </em>— but 10 additional titles will be available to purchase separately for $29.99. You can <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-7800">preorder the 7800 Plus right here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Starting on August 22nd, the new account linking feature will mean you only need to sign-in and link an Xbox profile once so that it’s stored for all future GeForce Now sessions.</p><p>“This new feature joins Xbox game library sync on GeForce Now, which allows members to sync their supported Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft Store games to their cloud streaming library,” explains Nvidia.</p><p>Nvidia first started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841163/microsoft-xbox-pc-game-pass-nvidia-geforce-now">rolling out access to PC Game Pass</a> and Microsoft Store titles on GeForce Now last year, before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23963718/nvidia-geforce-now-pc-game-pass-xbox-account-sync">adding account syncing</a> to bring games from Microsoft’s store to the GeForce Now library. Those features provided access, but without automatic sign-in, you had to manually authenticate each time you used the GeForce Now service. Now, it’s simply set it and forget it.</p><p>Nvidia’s improvements for Xbox games on GeForce Now come just weeks after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200819/microsoft-nvidia-geforce-now-integration-xbox-store-pages">Microsoft integrated GeForce Now</a> into its Xbox game pages on the web.

The opening hours of the game give you a lot to learn and think about, and getting to grips with how the game’s various mechanics work can take a little getting used to. As such, we’ve compiled a list of early game tips here that we hope will aid you in the opening hours of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h293"><a id=""></a><strong>There’s no penalty for respecs, so try new things</strong></h2><p>There is no penalty for respeccing your skills in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, so you should experiment with different builds and stances to see what best fits your gameplay style. When you want to respec, simply head over to any shrine and select “Reignite the Sparks” under the “Self-Advance” tab.</p><p>We highly recommend early investment in the skills that grant you extra health, stamina, and staff range, but feel free to skip these if you’re feeling confident!</p><h2 id="h294"><a id=""></a><strong>Pick up all of the materials you see</strong></h2><p>As you wander around the game’s open, explorable areas, you’ll see plenty of flowers and herbs scattered about. Pick all of these up! Even though you may not have a use for them in the first couple of hours, you’ll eventually be able to make helpful medicines to aid you in battle, and you’ll be happy you’ve been collecting materials for them.</p><figure id="" data-id="563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-recommend-id="image://563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1093" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, a delicious-looking and definitely not deadly giant toadstool." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yum, a delicious-looking and definitely not deadly giant toadstool." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-recommend-id="image://563a78d2a918b009e0d7ffff3cbc0068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1093" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yum, a delicious-looking and definitely not deadly giant toadstool." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h295"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t fret—dying doesn’t have any major consequences</strong></h2><p>Unlike traditional soulslike games, dying in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> doesn’t have any significant consequences besides sending you back to the closest shrine with all enemies respawned. This means you won’t have to worry about the common soulslike mechanic of dropping your experience on death. Instead, you’ll maintain all of your earned Will and be ready to give things another go.</p><h2 id="h296"><a id=""></a><strong>You can always fight the Wandering Wight later</strong></h2><p>The Wandering Wight is a boss found romping around the right side of the forest. If you’re patient and practice enough, you can maybe take him down when you first meet him. More likely, though, you’ll want to come back a little later when you’ve upgraded your staff and gear (maybe around the time you reach the Black Wind Cave). You’ll find defeating him much easier by then.</p><h2 id="h297"><a id=""></a><strong>Prepare yourself before facing Lingxuzi</strong></h2><p>Lingxuzi won’t be an overwhelmingly challenging boss for soulslike veterans, but he still hits like a truck and can make quick work of you if you haven’t fully wrapped your head around the game’s unique combat mechanics.</p><figure id="" data-id="9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-recommend-id="image://9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1102" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The crafting armor options menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The crafting armor options menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-recommend-id="image://9354fa42654ca7417aafbe84cd5eb9ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1102" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The crafting armor options menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With this in mind, aim to hit around level 9 or 10 before taking on Lingxuzi. When you have enough Sparks obtained, purchase at least the first three health upgrades in the Survival skill tree. Additionally, make sure to craft the Pilgrim’s Armor at a shrine for some added defense. With that extra health and defense, you’ll be in a much better position to tank a few hits while fighting Lingxuzi, so go give him hell.<br></p><p>If you need to collect some extra Will to purchase some skills or crafting materials, you can grind in the “Outside the Forest” area as needed.</p><h2 id="h298"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t miss a massive health boost after defeating Lingxuzi</strong></h2><p>After defeating Lingxuzi, you’ll be free to proceed into a temple in front of you. While you may be tempted to waltz through and head down to the nearby shrine to rest, make sure you stop inside the temple first.</p><p>On the left side of the inner temple is a Celestial Medicine you can pick up that will provide you with a significant health increase, further improving your survivability for the dangers ahead.</p><h2 id="h299"><a id=""></a><strong>Also don’t miss a massive mana boost in Black Wind Cave</strong></h2><p>After defeating a certain boss, you’ll enter an area called Black Wind Cave. As you work through the first part of this location, you’ll have a path to the left that leads out to a wooden deck with a meditation point. Right by the meditation point is another Celestial Medicine, and this one will vastly increase your mana reserves, allowing you to use your spells more often.</p><figure id="" data-id="4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-recommend-id="image://4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Crafting some celestial medicine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Crafting some celestial medicine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-recommend-id="image://4600ed31ab5dcbb2ee9aea0aab47818c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1120" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Crafting some celestial medicine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h300"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t overlook Spirit Skills</strong></h2><p>You’ll meet an NPC fairly early on that will upgrade your gourd to allow you to absorb the spirits of some bosses. Doing so will grant you their Spirit Skill, which lets you briefly transform into them in battle and perform an action when you’ve built up enough Qi. These can dish out some major damage, especially to bosses. But more importantly, they grant passive bonuses when equipped—such as the Wandering Wight’s increased defense.</p><p>You can even upgrade each of these Spirits at a shrine by selecting “Cultivate Spirits” under the “Self-Advance” tab. However, note that you’ll sometimes need special items found in your adventure to proceed with an upgrade tier.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-25-details-leak-ahead-of-official-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The release of NHL 25 is less than two months away and the first details of the game have been leaked ahead of the official reveal. And EA is to blame for the NHL 25 leaks.</p>



<p>The publisher had a reveal and trailer set for Thursday, August 22 at 11am. However, when EA Sports uploaded it to the game’s official account, they left it unlisted allowing it to be seen and grabbed by whomever. It wasn’t until it began making the rounds that it was finally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EDHgsy8w8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made private</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thanks to the early look at the NHL 25 reveal trailer, a few details have been confirmed about the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-nhl-25-leaks">What’s In The NHL 25 Leaks?</h2>



<p>First, NHL 25 will feature the Hughes brothers — Luke, Jack, and Quinn — on the covers of this year’s game. It’ll mark the first time that a set of brothers will appear on the cover of a major sports video game.</p>



<p>The game will  also see the return of James Cybulski as play-by-play as well as feature the official jerseys for Utah Hockey Club right at launch.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On to gameplay, NHL 25 features new game mechanics that run on “ICE-Q Intelligence”. The game also features revamped vision controls that EA Sports is calling “next-gen vision control” and the skating has been updated to include over 250 new animations. </p>



<p>There is also new foundational AI and reactive player actions that will allow the game to better mimic what players see in real life. How that works, though, won’t be noticeable until players can get their hands on the game themselves</p>



<p>Neither a release date nor official platforms were  confirmed in the leaks. What was confirmed, however, is that EA Sports is doing with NHL 25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what it did with EA FC 25</a>. If you pay $100 for the Deluxe Edition of the game, you get to play it at release. Those who pay the $70 standard will get access to the game a week later.</p>

The game has exceeded <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2358720/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2.2 million concurrent players</a>, surpassing the all-time peak concurrent records for titles like Dota 2 (1.2 million), Counter-Strike 2 (1.8 million), and more. It is Steam's most popular game today based on concurrent players.</p><p>On August 20, Black Myth: Wukong passed Palworld's all-time record (2.1 million concurrent players), but remains well short of the all-time record-holder, PUBG, which reached an astonishing 3.2 million concurrent players. Of note, titles like Dota 2, Counter-Strike 2, and PUBG are free, whereas Black Myth costs $60. The game is also the No. 1 title on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam's top-selling games chart.</a></p><p>A significant portion of Black Myth: Wukong's playerbase comes from China, according to a report. Another development is that Palworld developer Pocketpair has congratulated Black Myth: Wukong on surpassing Palword's concurrent player figure on Steam.</p><p>Black Myth: Wukong, which was created by Chinese developer Game Science, has been controversial in some circles. Game Science's guidelines for content creators ask them to avoid discussing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-guidelines-ask-content-creators-not-to-discuss-feminist-propaganda-covid-and-more/1100-6525951/" data-ref-id="1100-6525951">"feminist propaganda" and COVID.</a> A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from IGN in 2023</a> documented the alleged sexist and misogynist commentary from the development team.</p><p>If you're just getting started with Black Myth, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/black-myth-wukong-tips-beginners-guide/2900-5688/" data-ref-id="2900-5688">GameSpot's Black Myth: Wukong guide that runs through 20 things to know before you jump in.</a> We also have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-guides-hub/1100-6525898/" data-ref-id="1100-6525898">dedicated guides hub</a> where you can get all the key info you need.
