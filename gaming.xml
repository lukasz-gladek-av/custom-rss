<p>At least once per year, we have some new kid on the block who wants to vie for the throne. They intend to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take down the likes of Battlefield</a>, and most of those titles flop. This year, we have Delta Force by Team Jade, and it’s looking more likely than ever before. First and foremost, being a free-to-play first-person shooter, Delta Force has a much better chance to succeed. But will it? Only time will tell, but interested players don’t have to wait long. Here’s when you can play Delta Force!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-delta-force-release-date">What is the Delta Force Release Date?</h2>



<p>While <span>they technically call the upcoming release date an&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-open-beta-has-a-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open beta</a>, it’s officially launching on Steam</span>. Delta Force will be available on <strong>December 4</strong>, completely free to download and play for anyone who can meet the game’s system requirements. Don’t worry; they’re not tough to meet with your current hardware, so download the game and jump into a match free to test the waters!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-coming-to-playstation-5">Is Delta Force Coming to PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p>While the PC version of Delta Force launches in early December, the console version is currently planned for sometime in Q1 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-console-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to reports</a>. Once the console release date comes to light and we receive concrete information, we’ll update you here, but you should know that Delta Force is indeed coming to PlayStation 5.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-coming-to-xbox-series-x-s">Is Delta Force Coming to Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Delta Force will launch on Xbox Series X|S alongside the PC and PlayStation 5 versions. However, like with the PlayStation version of the free-to-play first-person shooter, there’s no current release date for the Xbox edition. It’ll happen sometime between January and March in Q1 2025, early next year. </p>



<p>Will you give Delta Force a shot on December 4? Do you think it can topple Battlefield? Let us know your thoughts on the FPS in the comments below, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a> to start a thread!</p>

<p>It's been just over two years now since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/john-carmack-leaves-meta-after-a-decade-fighting-to-make-vr-a-reality/">soon-to-depart</a> CTO John Carmack told a Meta Connect audience about his vision for a super low-end VR headset that came in at $250 and 250 grams. "We're not building that headset today, but I keep trying," Carmack <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/carmack-wants-a-250-vr-headset-to-counterpoint-the-1499-quest-pro/">said at the time</a> with some exasperation.</p>
<p>On the pricing half of the equation, the recently released Quest 3S headset is nearly on target for Carmack's hopes and dreams. Meta's new $299 headset is a significant drop from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">the $499 Quest 3</a>&nbsp;and the cheapest price point for a Meta VR headset since the company raised the price of the aging Quest 2 to $400 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/meta-quest-2-vr-headset-price-jumps-100-to-399-gets-zero-new-features/">back in the summer of 2022</a>. When you account for a few years of inflation in there, the Quest 3S is close to the $250 headset Carmack envisioned.</p>

            </figure>

<p>Unfortunately, Meta must still seriously tackle the "250 grams" part of Carmack's vision. The 514g Quest 3S feels at least as unwieldy on your face as the 515g Quest 3, and both are still quite far from the "super light comforts" Carmack envisioned. Add in all the compromises Meta made so the Quest 3S could hit that lower price point, and you have a cheap, half-measure headset that we can only really recommend to the most price-conscious of VR consumers.</p>
<h2>Meta Quest 2 Plus</h2>
<p>iFixit's <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/101990/metas-quest-3s-is-just-a-revamped-quest-2-and-its-the-better-for-it">recent teardown of the Quest 3S</a> shows that the new headset is more than just a spiritual successor to the cheap <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/what-happened-to-the-virtual-reality-gaming-revolution/">and popular</a> Quest 2. On the contrary, iFixit found the Quest 3S optical stack uses the exact same parts as the Quest 2, right down to the LCD panels and fresnel lenses.</p>


<p>In 2020, the 1832×1920 per-eye resolution offered by that visual stack represented a significant upgrade from what had come before, especially at such a low price point. Today, though, that dated display technology invites direct comparisons to the 2604×2208 per-eye display on last year's Quest 3. With the displays sitting just inches from your eyes, that difference represents a very noticeable 20 percent drop in apparent clarity, down from 25 pixels per degree to a mere 20.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Going back to the 3S after a year spent in the Quest 3 is a bit like walking around in glasses that suddenly have a thin layer of Vaseline smeared on them. Everything looks quite a bit fuzzier, especially near the borders of the display, and edges of objects look distinctly more jagged than on the Quest 3. The difference is especially noticeable when trying to read small text in VR or make out fine details in the real world through the headset's array of passthrough cameras.</p>
<p>It's not quite a retreat to the days of the infamous "screen door effect" that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2014/10/multi-hour-oculus-rift-sessions-are-doing-weird-things-to-my-eyes/">plagued early Oculus-era headsets</a>, but the distinct visual downgrade makes virtual reality experiences that much less convincing and engrossing on the 3S.</p>
<h2>It’s the little things</h2>
<p>The visual downgrades on the Quest 3S extend to the field of view, which narrows from 110 horizontal degrees on the Quest 3 to a mere 97 degrees on the 3S (the vertical field of view sees a smaller reduction from 97 degrees to 93 degrees). This difference isn't as apparent as the drop in resolution between the two headsets, but it does lead to a few more "tunnel vision" moments at the margins. In a game like <em>Beat Saber</em>, for instance, I noticed many of my swings were rendered effectively invisible by the larger black void taking up much of my peripheral vision.</p>

            </figure>

<p>Going back to the fresnel-lens-based Quest 2 visual stack also means doing without the thinner pancake lenses introduced on the Quest 3. The result is an eyebox on the 3S that extends about an inch farther from your face than on the Quest 3. That might not sound like much, but having the lens' center of gravity farther from your face makes the headset feel a bit heavier and the fit a bit less secure as you move your head around in VR.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Then there are the compromises when it comes to fine-tuning the distance between the Quest 3S' lenses. On the Quest 3, an adjustment wheel on the bottom of the headset lets you adjust this interpupillary distance (IPD) continuously, down to the millimeter precision. On the Quest 3S, you instead manually shift the lenses into three preset grooves that are a full 5 millimeters apart. If your face's actual IPD falls in the middle of those 5 mm windows, the result can be the kind of eye strain and trouble focusing that we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/review-we-do-not-recommend-the-299-oculus-quest-2-as-your-next-vr-system/">complained about in our original Quest 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>Meta has also done away with quite a few Quest 3 creature comforts in an apparent effort to keep the Quest 3S price down. The lack of an external depth sensor, for instance, can make things like pass-through video and hand tracking feel a bit more wonky than on the Quest 3. The Quest 3S is missing a standard headphone jack, too, for those still using wired headphones. And the new headset also lacks any automatic face detection, adding the small annoyance of physically tapping the power button to return from sleep mode when you put it back on.</p>

<h2>Spend the extra money</h2>

                From the front, the external cameras are the easiest way to tell the difference between the Quest 3S (left) and the Quest 3.

<p>I've been comparing the Quest 3S to the Quest 3 because that's the decision consumers considering a Meta headset will face today (if they can get over <a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/accounts/account-settings-and-management/meta-accounts-on-quest/">the need for a Meta account</a> to use the headset in the first place). But Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/metas-low-end-300-quest-3s-hits-stores-oct-15/">discontinuation of the aging Quest 2</a> means millions of current Quest 2 owners will soon be faced with the prospect of upgrading or abandoning Meta's VR ecosystem for good, just as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/meta-ends-support-for-original-quest-headset-after-less-than-4-years/">original Quest owners did last year</a>.</p>

<p>For those current Quest 2 owners, the Quest 3S represents the cheapest way to maintain continued access to Meta's library of VR games and apps. And that library continues to expand with everything from <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/thrasher/7693714067376780/">mind-bending indie games</a> to <a href="https://clawball.com/">quirky multiplayer arenas</a> to single-player adventures like <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/batman-arkham-shadow/"><em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em></a>, which now comes free with every Quest 3 or 3S headset.</p>
<p>But the move from a Quest 2 to a Quest 3S is relatively small, considering the four-year gap between the similarly priced headsets. Yes, you'll notice some significant improvements in the newer headset's full-color pass-through cameras and the headset's maximum frame rate (up from 90 Hz to 120 Hz). The 3S also offers a slightly more future-proofed Qualcomm XR Gen 2 processor (over the Quest 2's original XR processor) and slightly more precise&nbsp;Touch Plus controllers (which are missing the annoying tracking ring on the original Quest 2 controllers).</p>
<p>All told, though, the Quest 3S is far from the generational upgrade from the Quest 2 you might hope for. For that kind of apparent jump, you're much better off shelling out a bit more money for the full-fledged Quest 3. The improvements in form factor, field of view, IPD adjustment, and especially resolution make the higher-end set well worth the extra money. That's especially true if you can manage to track down the now-discontinued 128GB Quest 3, which is <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1776469-REG/meta_quest_899_00579_01_3_advanced_all_in_one_vr.html/">currently being closed out for just $430</a> (compared to $500 for the new 528GB version).</p>
<p>If you simply want the cheapest way to access Meta's library of virtual reality games, the Quest 3S certainly fills that hole in the market. If you want a more robust VR experience that's likely to suffice further into the future, though, the extra investment in a Quest 3 headset is probably worth it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-loot-world-order/1900-6418174/">tepid player response</a> to recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-is-reportedly-getting-barebones-support-as-rocksteady-moves-on-to-new-projects/1100-6523986/">big-budget live-service titles</a> has left many fans of the genre--this writer included--wondering which studio would be next to unveil a new live-service shooter in an era that is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-didnt-care-about-concord-until-i-played-it/1100-6524530/">already oversaturated with them</a>. After the striking failure of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/">Concord</a>, who would be brave enough to step onto the stage and attempt to sell players on their latest live-service creation?</p><p dir="ltr">Rather unexpectedly, the answer is 2K Games, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-games-unveils-new-hero-shooter-project-ethos-and-you-can-play-it-today/1100-6527220/">revealed its newest title last week</a>. Known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-ethos/">Project Ethos</a>, 2K's new free-to-play title was developed by 31st Union, which describes the game as a "third-person roguelike hero-shooter." If you're wondering what the hell that means, you're not alone, but after attending the game's hands-on preview event and getting a feel for Project Ethos, I'm pretty well-equipped to explain the game's (admittedly somewhat convoluted) premise.</p><p dir="ltr">31st Union is the first to admit that the game's concept is a little difficult to describe in a concise manner, declaring in a recent press release, "The best way to learn about Project Ethos is to play it."</p><p dir="ltr">Here's the general gist: Project Ethos is a third-person extraction hero-shooter with a hint of roguelike flavor sprinkled on top. Its "signature mode" is called Trials, which sees teams of three players select characters from the game's six-hero lineup before dropping into a 20-minute match. When joining, you can find yourself spawning in mid-match, meaning you can potentially get squashed by an enemy team with better loot shortly thereafter. Guns are exclusive to each character, so looting is focused on picking up health items, primary and secondary ammo, gadgets with useful abilities, and body shields.</p><p dir="ltr">Within the match are various timed PvE events very similar to those seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>. Completing these events rewards players with loot, including Trials Cores, which are the game's main currency. Naturally, players must keep an eye out for other enemy teams who may also arrive to take part in a timed PvE event, but it's generally pretty easy to sufficiently loot up before bumping into your first squad of enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, players continue completing events and battling other teams, both of which are a means of collecting Trials Cores. Similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a>, injured players are first downed and can be picked back up by their squadmates. If a revive doesn't happen fast enough (or the enemy is still spraying bullets), downed players will eventually bleed out, at which point their squad must locate and make use of a Respawn Beacon to bring back their fallen brethren.</p><p dir="ltr">At any point during the match, players can head for the extraction point. It's clearly marked on the map, and the earlier you show up, the more likely you are to successfully escape unscathed. As it turns out, all those Trials Cores you've collected over the course of the match have a little catch: If your squad dies before successfully extracting, you don't get to keep any of them. The longer you stay alive, the more Cores you can accumulate, but the longer you wait to hit the extraction point, the more likely you are to find it crowded with several enemy teams all duking it out. Accumulate enough Cores, and you'll soon find that a temporary bounty has been placed on your head, allowing other players to more easily hunt you down. (This is usually a good time to book it to the extraction point.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388319-evolutions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388319-evolutions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388319"></a><figcaption>Evolutions provide another layer of gameplay customization, and work wonderfully with specific Augments</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388319-evolutions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you've successfully extracted, you can visit vendor NPCs in the lobby to exchange Trials Cores for Augments. Augments are powerful, permanent perks that allow players to tailor the game's individual heroes to their own personal playstyle, and though I didn't get a chance to unlock many of them during my time with Project Ethos, I did find them interesting and unique. Augments can morph an up-close-and-personal skirmisher into a skirmisher who also excels at range, give a healer a more defensive edge, and much more.</p><p dir="ltr">The second mode 2K presented during Project Ethos previews is called Gauntlet Mode. Gauntlet is Project Ethos's competitive tournament mode, forcing multiple squads of players to face off with each other one by one. Heroes can be (temporarily) upgraded between each match, and the ultimate goal is to be the only squad standing at the end of each round. Players who bite the dust in this mode cannot be respawned by teammates, but will automatically respawn at the beginning of the next round. The first squad to snag three victories wins. There's no PvE to speak of, nor are there any Trials Cores to collect, but winners do get medals, and Gauntlet essentially functions as the game's ranked mode. We didn't get to see or hear as much about Gauntlet Mode as we did Trials Mode, so some of the details surrounding it remain unclear.</p><p>Each of the game's six heroes come with two weapons (one light, one heavy), two unique abilities, and a collection of character-exclusive Evolutions. Evolutions work a lot like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-all-legend-upgrades-and-shield-cores-explained/1100-6521025/">the Legend Upgrades seen in Apex</a>. As players take down enemies, pick up Evolution Nodes, and improve the strength of their armor, they're periodically prompted to pick one of three Evolutions (which appear to be randomly selected from the dozen or so Evolutions that are exclusive to each character). Unlike Augments, Evolutions only last for the duration of the match, but some of them are surprisingly powerful, and they seem to improve on Apex's Legend Upgrade formula quite a bit. The random selection of Evolutions to choose from keeps things fresh and prevents players from always leaning on a single specific Evolution, forcing them to try out new ability buffs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388321-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388321" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388321-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388321"></a><figcaption>Some of Project Ethos's heroes have bland designs, while others have a more unique look.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388321-prism.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The heroes themselves are both my favorite and least favorite part of Project Ethos. On one hand, these characters are undeniably fun to play once you get the hang of Project Ethos's gameplay loop. On the other hand, they look derivative, uninspired, and aren't especially eye-catching (though that could certainly change before the game launches). As someone who isn't a fan of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>-esque art styles, I found Project Ethos to be pretty underwhelming from a visual perspective. The game certainly has a few cool character designs--Prism is easily the most unusual-looking hero--but in their current state, Project Ethos's playable characters don't exactly inspire much interest or curiosity about who they are or why they're involved with Project Ethos.</p><p>Unfortunately, the heroes' abilities are not particularly unique, either. The first character to really grow on me was Breeze, a rocketeer with the ability to move quickly. But when playing her, it's impossible to ignore the similarities she shares--both physically and ability-wise--with some of Apex's titular Legends. The first issue is that Breeze is a dead-ringer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bangalore-guide-apex-legends/1100-6465107/">Apex's Bangalore</a>, to the point that they almost look like identical twins. The resemblance is so uncanny that multiple preview attendees remarked on how similar the two characters look. Even worse, Breeze's abilities are effectively Bangalore's Rolling Thunder and Smoke Bomb abilities combined with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valkyrie-guide-apex-legends/1100-6502749/">Valkyrie</a>'s Missile Swarm and VTOL Jets abilities. Breeze is the most egregious example, but she's far from the only character in the game to share striking similarities with the appearances and abilities of characters that already exist in Apex Legends, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/">Valorant</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388364-breezenbangs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388364" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388364-breezenbangs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388364"></a><figcaption>Breeze's resemblance to Apex Legends' Bangalore is hard to deny.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388364-breezenbangs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But regardless of their physical appearances and familiar-feeling abilities, Project Ethos's characters can be quite a lot of fun to play. The game's developers were clearly not afraid to make powerful heroes with powerful abilities that are fun to use. As long as you use your abilities (and your head), you can reliably gain the upper hand in conflicts with enemy teams, even if their aim is better than yours. Pushing players to think ahead and plan their moves instead of solely relying on good aim is definitely one of Project Ethos's biggest strengths.</p><p>Another of the game's major strengths is movement. Project Ethos shines when it comes to getting around the map. Sliding is actually useful, allowing players to build momentum, jump on ziplines, and hop into strange purple energy fields that will fling them into the air, similar to the Gravity Cannons of Apex Legends. Project Ethos' gunplay feels good as well. The game's weapons feel punchy and are satisfying to use, TTK feels balanced (players won't drop instantly, but you also won't find yourself wondering how the enemy is still alive after emptying three clips into them), hitboxes seem appropriately sized, maps are well-designed (if not exactly stunning), and characters have fun-to-use abilities (even though they feel a bit copy-pasted). Calling Project Ethos a roguelike might be a bit of a stretch, especially given how much <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/never-say-roguelike" rel="nofollow">the meaning of the term has changed</a> over the years, but it's certainly a fun time. <span>The bounty mechanic is especially challenging, and surviving the match despite the target on your back feels like a genuine achievement.</span></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388387-bounty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388387" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388387-bounty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388387"></a><figcaption>Bounties alert all players in a match to the location of the player who has collected the most Trials Cores.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388387-bounty.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Overall, Project Ethos feels like a combination of Apex's movement, Overwatch's character abilities, Destiny 2's mid-match events and NPC-filled lobby, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-without-building-is-permanent-as-epic-reveals-zero-build-mode/1100-6501976/">Fortnite's Zero Build mode</a> gameplay and art style. Is it enjoyable? Yes. Is it a roguelike? That's debatable. The use of "roguelike" in Project Ethos' marketing seems more like a buzzword than an apt description of the game, which feels nothing like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac/">The Binding of Isaac</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb/">Cult of the Lamb</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/">Hades</a>, or other titles one tends to think of when they hear the word "roguelike." Fans of Fortnite and Apex Legends, however, will likely have a good time, but in a genre this crowded and competitive, I'm not sure mere enjoyability will be enough to make Project Ethos a success.</p><p dir="ltr">31st Union hasn't yet announced a release date for Project Ethos, and it's clear the developers are extremely eager for player feedback, which I think is commendable. "Live service is a conversation," one developer said during previews, while other members of the dev team walked around asking players what their thoughts on the game were. It's very clear that 2K is attempting to carefully test the waters here rather than expecting everyone to instantly fall in love with Project Ethos, and their attention to player feedback is clear. During previews, I even noticed a dev taking notes as a player shared their critiques.</p><p dir="ltr">Project Ethos isn't a groundbreaking masterpiece at this moment in time, but it's also not a lazy, sloppily assembled mess. Its biggest flaws at the moment are its lack of a distinct identity and the absence of a unique gameplay hook. Project Ethos has an interesting plot (which players can read up on by unlocking various in-game lore text) that revolves around AI taking over the world, but its bland visuals and recycled hero abilities make it feel rather unremarkable, despite its genuinely enjoyable gameplay. After five years of development, 31st Union is clearly excited to share its creation with players. But thankfully, the studio wasn't overconfident enough to stroll into the graveyard that is live-service gaming in 2024--ignoring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/">Overwatch 2's pitchfork-riddled existence</a> and stepping over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/concord-is-shutting-down-after-two-weeks-but-is-that-unprecedented/2900-5747/">Concord's still-twitching corpse</a>--to proudly announce to the world that Project Ethos is officially the Next Big Thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, 31st Union's dev team is taking a much wiser approach: They're not bothering to implement monetization and microtransactions until the game is closer to launch, they're <em>asking</em> players what they want, and perhaps most importantly, they aren't expecting anyone to take a $40 trust-fall in order to try out the game.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth remembering that the biggest threat live-service games are facing right now is the fact that although people are playing more games every year, the <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-gamers#number-of-gamers" rel="nofollow">number of people who play video games isn't rising nearly as quickly</a>. Since live-service games tend to require a fairly significant time investment, most people can only play a few titles regularly. To succeed, 2K and 31st Union will have to overcome a massive challenge: not simply convincing players to try out Project Ethos, but wooing players enough to make them want to ditch one of their current favorite titles in favor of it. In its current state, I'm not sure that's something the game can pull off, but if given enough time and attention, it could certainly earn a positive response from players once it launches.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Project Ethos isn't visually gripping, nor does it really have a unique schtick to lean on (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate-2/">Splitgate 2</a>'s portals). What it does have is a team of developers who appear to genuinely care about what their players think, and a good deal of potential. Whether that potential blossoms or withers is entirely dependent upon what the game's creators are planning next. More playtests, a beta phase, and a few character redesigns would certainly do the game some good. If 2K plans to launch Project Ethos sometime in the very near future, my opinion of it likely won't change. But if it's given a bit more time in the oven, I think there's hope for the game's future--provided the developers spend that time figuring out who exactly this game is meant for.</p>

But I also worry that the involvement of so many people may lead to it feeling less like a cohesive movie and more like a jarring series of scenes that have been awkwardly stitched together. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Just days after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-stealthy-season-14-grapple-guns-toward-an-october-release-date">stealth-focused Season 14</a>, developer Rare has yanked nearly all its new features - including the ability to crouch and don disguises - acknowledging "significant issues" arising from their addition to the game.
</p>
<p>
Rare had already been forced to disable a number of flagship new features ahead of Seasons 14's launch last week - that is, the ability to lay traps and to hang from ledges - as a result of stability concerns and a "high player impact issue" discovered during a final round of testing. As such, its  decision to now remove crouching and disguises means only a tiny fraction of Season 14's announced features are currently available to players.
</p>
<p>
Speaking in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwUlQFtY-rw">video update</a> detailing the "drastic steps" earlier today, Sea of Thieves production director Drew Stevens explained the arrival of crouching had "introduced a number of knock-on effects to the wider experience". More specifically, it had lead to the return of a number of PvP exploits Rare has previously tried to stamp out, including the ability for players to switch weapons faster than intended and to control their air movements after blasting from a canon. Rare has also identified an invincibility exploit.

<p>
"We're really unhappy about the quality of Season 14's launch", Stevens acknowledged in his video update, adding that Rare is "taking this situation very seriously". He went on to explain the studio's first priority is "stabilising" the player experience, and it'll begin re-enabling features once it's "confident they meet our quality bar". 
</p><p>
Crouching and disguises were temporarily disabled during emergency maintenance earlier today and the hope is to bring them back as part of a hot fix targeting "high impact issues" scheduled for next week. Stevens said that rather than rushing its release and "compounding issues further", Rare wants to ensure next week's hot fix brings "meaningful" improvements and is given "the necessary time [in] internal quality assurance".
</p>
<p>
As for traps and ledge hanging, the studio hopes to re-enable them as part of its regularly scheduled monthly update in November, which also promises "further fixes, improvements, and balancing changes". This update will see Rare trialling a new process behind-the-scenes that's intended to provide "longer time and focus for our internal testing" and allow for "additional hardening" with Insiders. If everything goes to plan, all commendations, rewards, and achievements associated with the currently disabled features should also return.
</p>
<p>
"We all understand how frustrating this has been," Stevens continued. "I know I've spoken about it before, and I'm sure you're sick of hearing it, but we know we need to do better here, and Season 14 has suffered from a lack of quality control... We're going to be all hands on deck through the next releases to get back in control of game quality".
</p>
<p>
Following today's changes, the only key Season 14 additions still currently enabled are the grappling gun and new blowdart weapon. And as to what's next for Sea of Thieves - beyond the steady reintroduction of those currently missing features - Rare hasn't yet said. Season 14 marks the end of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-bumper-2024-bringing-windy-horns-grapple-guns-a-roaming-warship-and-loads-more">2024 release roadmap it shared back in March</a>, so it's unlikely the studio will be ready to share any major future plans until the year is through.

		<p>Undead Labs has released the 38th and final update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/state-of-decay-2">State of Decay 2</a>, as they look to put the full team’s efforts into the sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-gets-a-big-re-reveal-with-a-new-story-trailer/">State of Decay 3</a>.</p>
<p>State of Decay 2 Update 38 puts a bow on things with a focus on fixing some long-standing issues, making some quality of life improvements, making gated and seasonal content more freely available, and even adding a batch of new cosmetics as a parting thank you.</p>


<p>Originally releasing in 2018, State of Decay 2 has now had a solid six years of support from Undead Labs. It launched on Xbox One and PC <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/17/state-of-decay-2-review/">in a pretty rough state</a> – echoing the first game – but still with plenty of appeal and charm. With the Juggernaut Edition and Xbox Series X|S enhancements, and the steady stream of updates, the game is now in a very good place, looking at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2_Juggernaut_Edition/#app_reviews_hash">the Steam reviews</a>.</p>
<p>The sequel was announced back in 2020 during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/state-of-decay-3-xbox-series-x-pc-trailer/">Xbox Series X|S summer showcase</a>, but it took four long years before we would see the game reappear, a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-gets-a-big-re-reveal-with-a-new-story-trailer/">re-reveal coming at this year’s summer showcase</a>. The third game looks to lean even further into the community side of the game, jumping ahead in time some more and featuring a larger, truly shared world.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Quality of Life Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<p>Water will Slow Vehicles – Water resistance will now reduce vehicle speed while travelling through lakes and waterways. Be sure to choose the right vehicle type for the job as each handles differently. A 4×4, for example, will outperform a Sports Coupe in the water.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<p>Community Inventories – While over in the base, you can now access individual Survivors’ inventories from the Community screen, allowing you to quickly view or equip their items, transfer items between you, or store their gear (including rucksacks) into base storage. No more hunting around the base to find the Survivor you need!</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<p>Zombie spawning has been removed after certain noise events – Failed search crashes and door slams will no longer spawn new zombies. These noise events will now simply attract already existing zombies to the location.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>We’ve reduced the distance at which characters automatically attempt to climb down from ledges. Additionally, characters will no longer attempt to climb down unintentionally whilst the player is aiming, which could often lead to some frustrating moments.</li>
<li>Rucksacks can now be deposited at claimed Landmark Outposts.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The likelihood of the Blood Donor Enclave Arc appearing has been adjusted to match that of the other Arcs.</li>
<li>The Blood Donor Morale Bonus has been adjusted to +6 Community Morale, down from the previous value of +15, which was deemed too strong.</li>
<li>The following weapons can be obtained as rewards for defeating the Black Heart and killing a Jugg during the Gargantua Mutation Curveball: RTX Piranha, RTX Rampart, RTX Cyclone, RTX Cyclone Tactical, and MCX Osprey RT.</li>
<li>In response to community feedback that it was appearing too frequently, the delay and cooldown for the Bangernomics Curveball have been somewhat increased.</li>
<li>There is now a chance for new characters to receive the Blood Donor trait.</li>
<li>Prone Zombies set up to ambush now have an increased sight range from 1m to 6m, allowing them to react more quickly to approaching characters.</li>
<li>The health of the Gargantua Mutation Juggernauts has been increased for each level of Impact in the Curveball Settings.</li>
<li>The Haven Device has been rebalanced to improve it’s overall effectiveness. It will now have a noticeable presence over the course of multiple waves during a base siege.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Gameplay Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved the reliability of the automatic ladder interaction which would sometimes fail, causing the character to walk right over the ladder and fall from a height.</li>
<li>You can now build a staging area after claiming the Leeds Concrete Silos landmark. Additionally, the previous issue of the ‘Elimination of Daily Materials Cost’ stacking has been resolved.</li>
<li>Using heavy weapons now correctly grants Endurance XP as intended.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Zombie and Combat Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in which Zombies sometimes became unresponsive after getting stuck in their idle state.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which the finisher prompt appeared when a finishing move could not be executed due to lack of stamina.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which Zombies would sometimes attack and magnetically teleport towards survivors on upper levels.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a downed hostile human would remain incapacitated indefinitely.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where melee attacks missed when they should have hit.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Ferals could instantly destroy certain vehicles by attaching to and attacking specific points.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in which Blood Plague Bloaters were not appearing in Heartland Hordes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Curveball Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Radio Silence Curveball could not appear correctly in Drucker County, Cascade Falls, and Meagher Valley.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where Ignited Zombies during the Fuelling the Plague Curveball were not receiving any damage from weapons.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where Armored Zombies persisted after the Lost Platoon Curveball had expired.</li>
<li>Removed the unintended instances where the same Curveball could appear twice simultaneously.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug that caused Curveball objectives to be unpinned or removed from the Goals menu when their Optional Objective was completed.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where some Curveball effects did not update after changing Impact in the Curveball settings.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Vicious Rumours Curveball displayed incorrect values when adjusting the impact in the Curveball settings. Previously, the ‘Less Influence Received from Selling’ minor effect had major values, and vice versa, causing the curveball to reduce the influence gained from trading more than intended.</li>
<li>Resolved various issues where the Vicious Rumours Curveball did not increase the radio prices for the Independence Pack and the Locate Plague Heart radio command.</li>
<li>Adjusted Vicious Rumours to display the correct sell prices when the Curveball is active.</li>
<li>Adjusted the Curveball Stamina action effects in ‘Up and At Em’ and ‘Under the Weather’ to account for all stamina-cost actions.</li>
<li>Reimplemented the damage warning that triggers when entering the Toxic Miasma of a Black Heart.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which Curveballs appearing could cause a crash on multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mission Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resolved a crash issue that occurred when approaching the mission location for one of the ‘Mysterious Broadcast’.</li>
<li>Resolved the issue where Zombies from infestations were not spawning in taller buildings (such as the Factory Husk in Heartland), which prevented clearing the infestation and potentially blocking certain missions.</li>
<li>Resolved an exploit in Heartland where the CLEO Supply drop mission could be bypassed by leaving the site and returning to zero Zombies, which auto-completed the mission. Now, the mission will be abandoned and must be redone.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in ‘Living in a Materials World’ where the optional objective might be impossible to complete under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in ‘Builder Legacy: Useful Utilities’ where Energy Drinks now count towards completing the objective of building an item that requires power or water</li>
</ul>
<h4>UI and Settings Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reduced max curveball cards visible in the journal and introduced enhancements to the functionality, user interface, and reliability of the Curveball Journal Page, including correct presentation of different languages in the prompt bar.</li>
<li>Resolved the issue of community names being truncated on the community selection screen.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the FOV value reset after updating the Accessibility settings.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with luxury crates missing exclamation marks on certain items.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug where the vehicle UI indicated it was destroyed even after being repaired with a toolkit.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue with inconsistent appearance and function for the ‘Drop’ prompt on your character inventory when interacting with a vehicle trunk.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the Locker Icon disappeared at short distances, making it difficult to find.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the Curveballs have Awoken notification appeared every time a session was reloaded.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/noted-board-game-and-tabletop-names-form-gamers4harris-supporting-harris-campaign<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today a large number of influential names from the board game and tabletop space have announced their support and endorsement for Kamala Harris for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Gamers4Harris is a group of 700+ "creators of your favorite games" that want to support Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz.</p>
<p>In the statement release on the official <a href="https://gamers4harris.org/">Gamers4Harris website</a>&nbsp;the group explains that they see Harris as a winner. "She has&nbsp;presided over the best economy in the world. She’s an ardent defender of reproductive rights. She has battled crime, fought for the downtrodden, and supported American workers. She stands with our allies and stands up to our enemies abroad. She knows how things are done, and she gets them done."</p>
<p>The statement continues to explain that in Harris and Walz they see a mix of competitiveness as well as a spirit of cooperation. Key aspects of their campaign that the group highlights is Harris' ability to so quickly unify the party around her and building a solid campaign so quickly. Walz achievements have also been noted including how he has expanded "the safety net, lifted up his constituents, and done it with charm and grace. Plus, he loves his Sega Dreamcast. Our kind of guy."</p>
<p>On the topic of "the other guys" Gamers4Harris label them "Cheaters. They run on fear, rage, and denial of rights. [...]&nbsp;Project 2025 spells out a fascist agenda that will destroy the government and the rights of Americans. Trump is an insurrectionist grifter who’s been found liable for sexual assault, convicted of fraud, fined hundreds of millions of dollars, and is facing years in jail."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We make games because we like competition and cooperation. We’ve been given two candidates who express those qualities beautifully. If you like our games, do us and yourselves a solid. - Gamers4Harris</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gamers4harris.org/">On their website, there is the option to</a> join the cause if you are a member of the game and puzzle industry, links to Kamala Harris' donation page for those who wish to contribute monetarily, a link to Kamala Harris' volunteer page, as well as a link to how to vote.</p>

Pressing the prompt will stop the circle, with your job being to get it as close as possible to the center. Don’t feel bad if you miss-time it at first because it does shrink deceptively fast. <strong>This is an important step because whoever stops it closer to the center will win the Speed Impact.</strong></p><h3 id="h6192"><a id=""></a><strong>Stage 2</strong></h3><p>Coming after that is the Rapid Strike stage. No matter who won the first stage, the objective is to mash the shown button prompt as fast as you can. The winner will be doing this to increase the damage they inflict, and the loser will mash to mitigate it. The Speed Impact ends with the winner punching the loser hard enough to send them flying.</p><p>As with every Impact Action, you can also press the Boost Button (RT/R2) for some helpful bonuses. It can be used once during the Single Strike stage to make the timing more lenient. In the Rapid Strike stage, it can be used up to three times to enhance your attacks. This one has the most times available to boost, which also means it’s the easiest to overdo it. Each Boost takes up one gauge of ki, and using too much will put you in a Collapsed state. You’ll be forced to recover and will lose your chance to follow up.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1cf6c6aad711ec2b8a46fbc33296ccb" data-recommend-id="image://d1cf6c6aad711ec2b8a46fbc33296ccb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku and Vegeta push against each other during a Power Impact, with a spiral gauge between them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku and Vegeta push against each other during a Power Impact, with a spiral gauge between them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1cf6c6aad711ec2b8a46fbc33296ccb" data-recommend-id="image://d1cf6c6aad711ec2b8a46fbc33296ccb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku and Vegeta push against each other during a Power Impact, with a spiral gauge between them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Both players performing a Throw at close range will trigger a Power Impact. This won’t work against larger characters like Anilaza or Giant Form Lord Slug, so I don’t recommend trying. If it’s timed right, both characters will push against each other with their hands.<br></p><p>A spiral gauge will display in the middle of the screen, along with a button prompt. <strong>It’s best to imagine this minigame like a pressure meter.</strong> Holding the button down will fill it up, while releasing will let it fall. Allowing it to touch the yellow line in the center will cause it to fall and momentarily disable the button. The winner is decided by who has it filled the most.</p><p>It doesn’t last that long, so the trick here is to keep it as close to the maximum without overloading it. You might find it easier to hold it near the end and then resort to tapping to keep it close by. I highly suggest practicing this repeatedly in the training mode to get the timing down.</p><p>Using the Boost will extend the length of the gauge and allow you to fill it even more. Just be sure to not use all of your Ki to boost, since the winner will deliver a heavy finish attack at the end. Although that’s not very damaging, it does stagger the opponent to leave them open to combos.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ca566f4f5c85f699a5959a54ffd845c" data-recommend-id="image://7ca566f4f5c85f699a5959a54ffd845c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frieza kicks Vegeta away during a Crash Impact, with a button prompt between them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Frieza kicks Vegeta away during a Crash Impact, with a button prompt between them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ca566f4f5c85f699a5959a54ffd845c" data-recommend-id="image://7ca566f4f5c85f699a5959a54ffd845c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frieza kicks Vegeta away during a Crash Impact, with a button prompt between them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This can feel like one of Impacts you’ll see the least, since it’s not tied to any offensive actions.

One of two button prompts will show up in the middle of the screen. <strong>Whoever presses their prompt first will win an exchange.</strong> Up to three can take place, with the best of two winning the overall Crash Impact and punching the loser away.</p><p>Pressing the boost button is supposed to help with your timing. To be completely honest though, I’ve never noticed any difference. I’ve seen some claim that it helps with accuracy, but no aspect of the QTE seems to support that idea. The game itself simply says you need to press the prompts first. I’d only recommend using the boost if you’re constantly on the losing end with this minigame.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="63b1e9ea5f1aed088fc8556173391e22" data-recommend-id="image://63b1e9ea5f1aed088fc8556173391e22" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vegeta fires a Galick Gun into the colorful mess that is a Blast Impact." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vegeta fires a Galick Gun into the colorful mess that is a Blast Impact." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="63b1e9ea5f1aed088fc8556173391e22" data-recommend-id="image://63b1e9ea5f1aed088fc8556173391e22" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vegeta fires a Galick Gun into the colorful mess that is a Blast Impact." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Last, but certainly not least, is everyone’s favorite.

As long as there’s enough space for the attacks to collide and not hit their targets, you’ll be treated to a cool cutscene of the projectiles smashing into each other.<br></p><p>Read More: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-great-ape-vegeta-guide-1851669880&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-great-ape-vegeta-guide-1851669880">Struggling With <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Great Ape Vegeta?

You can also press the boost prompt to extend the length of the gauge, although this is pointless if you’re using the first method.</p><p>I’ll also point out that this minigame functions differently if you’re using Classic controls. Instead of pressing the button prompt to charge, you’ll need to quickly rotate the left or right sticks on your controller. It’s an awesome throwback to how these beam clashes were handled in previous <em>Dragon Ball</em> games, and I’ll never try it because controllers are expensive. But I respect the truly hardcore players who aren’t afraid and want to aim for maximum nostalgia.</p><hr><p>Even if most don’t end with any major damage, <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Impact Actions can allow for great follow-up combos. Mastering them is a great way to improve how you play, whether it’s online or during tough episode battles.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ten-years-later-guerrilla-admits-it%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98done%E2%80%99-with-killzone.1016622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/guerrilla-done-with-killzone-ten-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It could be argued that Killzone <strong>made </strong>Guerrilla. The intense, alt-universe first-person shooter debuted in 2004 on PlayStation 2, introducing a next-generation title with a phenomenal setting and story. It spawned four major follow-up titles and a couple of spin-offs, but since 2013, the franchise has stood abandoned by Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most-called-for games when the topic of revitalising a forgotten franchise comes to the table but in a recent interview, the team at Guerrilla confirmed it has long since been <strong>done </strong>with Killzone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-by-choice">‘It Was By Choice’</h2>



<p>In 2017, Guerrilla Games released Horizon Zero Dawn, a post-apocalyptic PlayStation 4 exclusive that turned heads with ease. It was vibrant and punchy, and it represented an entire world of opportunity and freedom. It was the team’s first game since 2013’s beleaguered Killzone Shadow Fall, which many considered the final nail in the coffin for the shooter series.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed in an interview that Horizon Zero Dawn spelt the ultimate end for Killzone, with Guerrilla fully pivoting away from their gritty FPS to focus on more colourful horizons – no pun intended.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were done with it as a team. As a studio, we needed to refresh the palette. It was, by choice, the opposite of Killzone. I think the themes that this story and the characters represent are relatable for all ages and people, like having a found family of friends and finding your place in the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was a quote taken from Roy Postma, a Guerrilla legend with more than two decades at the firm. He was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">talking to the Washington Post</a> about Lego Horizon Adventures, a cutesy version of Horizon set to launch in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>Hearing the words ‘done with it’ sent a shock through my soul. Killzone was one of the first games I fell in love with as a kid. I poured hundreds of hours into it, and it introduced me to the world of first-person shooters – and multiplayer FPS combat. I always knew that the return of the series would be a one-in-a-million chance, but now we’ve got it on paper and confirmed.</p>



<p>Do you rue the loss of Killzone? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine this: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is loaded up on your PC. You are about to jump into your first game of Team Deathmatch, but the game crashes. Turns out your PC can’t handle the game at its full graphics settings. Here are the best Black Ops 6 graphics settings for PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-best-graphics-settings-for-pc">Black Ops 6: Best Graphics Settings for PC</h2>



<p>Sure, if you are a millionaire you may be able to afford the right hardware to run a game like Black Ops 6 at its full graphics settings. Many people, however, will need to make some adjustments to make the game run more smoothly.</p>



<p>Here are the most optimal graphic settings for Black Ops 6 on PC:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bullet Impacts:</strong> Off</li>



<li><strong>Particle Resolution:</strong> Very low</li>



<li><strong>Depth of Field:</strong> Off</li>



<li><strong>Persistent Effects:</strong> Off</li>



<li><strong>Shader Quality:</strong> Medium</li>



<li><strong>Texture Resolution:</strong> Normal</li>



<li><strong>Detail Quality Level:</strong> Low</li>



<li><strong>Display Monitor:</strong> Primary monitor</li>



<li><strong>Variable Rate Shading:</strong> On</li>



<li><strong>Shadow Quality:</strong> Normal</li>



<li><strong>Static Reflection Quality:</strong> High</li>



<li><strong>Tessellation:</strong> Near</li>



<li><strong>VSync:</strong> Off</li>



<li><strong>Local Texture Streaming Quality:</strong> Normal</li>



<li><strong>Screen Space Reflections:</strong> Normal</li>



<li><strong>Screen Space Shadows:</strong> High</li>



<li><strong>Shader Quality:</strong> High</li>



<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1920×1080</li>
</ul>



<p>With the settings above, the game should run quite smoothly. Obviously, some of these settings may vary depending on the hardware you own. It is best to try out different settings yourself to see which works best for you.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-xbox-and-ps5-settings-for-black-ops-6">Best Xbox and PS5 Settings for Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you are playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on a console, you do not need to worry about adjusting settings. Luckily, the game comes automatically adjusted to whatever console you are playing on. </p>



<p>Obviously, a PC will grant you higher FPS, but with the newer hardware in Xbox Series X|S and PS5s, the game will still run smoothly at around 100 FPS. </p>



<p>So, will you be playing Black Ops 6 when it releases on October 25?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-how-alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-update-brings-ray-tracing-to-console.1016598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/heres-how-alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-update-brings-ray-tracing-to-console/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment has confirmed the specifics of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, with the studio taking advantage of the increased power of the console to add ray tracing, or increase the general fidelity and performance of other graphics options.</p>
<p>Built using Remedy’s Northlight engine, Alan Wake 2 on PC made good use of ray tracing hardware in Nvidia’s GPUs in particular, layering in a number of different effects to add to the strong lighting and visual style. Xbox Series X|S and PS5 just couldn’t handle them, though, and Remedy instead focussed on the core graphics and other techniques. Now with its own hardware upscaling solution on PS5 Pro – PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) – and the beefier AMD GPU, some of those ray tracing effects can also be brought to console.</p>


<p>As <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/alan-wake-2-on-playstation-5-pro---behind-the-scenes">detailed by Remedy,</a> the new PlayStation 5 Pro Quality mode will add ray traced reflections (both opaque and transparent), using an internal render resolution of 2176×1224 and PSSR to upscale that to a full 4K.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro Comparison Video ESRB" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkwWEbk66VI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>These specs and performance targets would seemingly put the PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/20/alan-wake-2-pc-requirements-minimum-specs-recommended-ray-tracing-gpu/">between the low and medium performance targets for ray tracing on PC</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro Comparison Video ESRB (Ballroom)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-VXtECHguk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you don’t need fancier reflections, then there’s an enhanced Performance mode for PS5 Pro instead. This roughly takes the image quality and render settings of the base PS5 Quality mode, and runs them at 60FPS.</p>
<p>This leans very heavily on the upscaling of PSSR with a render resolution of 1536×864, upscaling all the way to a 4K output, and running at 60FPS. By contrast, Base PS5 Quality mode outputs at an upscaled 1440p and 30FPS.</p>
<p>While the PS5 Pro update won’t matter for a couple weeks, today is a big day for Alan Wake 2 with the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/18/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-is-coming-next-week/">The Lake House DLC expansion</a>, and the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/the-anniversary-update-explained/">free Anniversary update</a>. This includes new quality of life and accessibility options. The game now has gyro aiming, inverted X axis options, improved haptics for all healing and throwables on DualSense, and not just guns, and a big suite of optional gameplay assists that contain toggles for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick turn</li>
<li>Auto complete QTE</li>
<li>Button tapping to single tap</li>
<li>Weapon charging with taps</li>
<li>Healing items with taps</li>
<li>Lightshifter with taps</li>
<li>Player invulnerability</li>
<li>Player immortality</li>
<li>One shot kill</li>
<li>Infinite ammo</li>
<li>Infinite flashlight batteries</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed.1016595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, The Sims team revealed a behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming Creator Kits made by Myshunosun and Trillyke, two iconic content creators for The Sims 4. The Creator Kits will be available for PC via the EA app, Mac via Origin, Epic Games Store, and Steam. Additionally, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One users will also get to enjoy this new content. When it comes to modding the game or adding custom content to The Sims, this option has only ever been available to players on PC and Mac. However, the Creator Kits come close to what custom content brings to the table.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the Creator Kits, the Sims team released an exclusive look at the Cozy Kitsch and Sweet Slumber Party Creator Kits, which offer players new mid-century modern designs as well as sleepwear and sleepover content for those who like to give their Sims a spruced up bedroom.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-creator-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> released by EA, they state that more details will be released about the Creator Kits as the release date draws closer, and they sat down to interview Myshunosun and Trillyke about the upcoming Creator Kits. This is the first time that The Sims team has collaborated with content creators to create a full collection of in-game assets, which is a huge achievement for those who have been picked to collaborate with The Sims team.</p>
<p>By creating this new form of content, Creators can pitch their ideas to The Sims team and work alongside them to curate a collection, similar to the Storybook Nursery Creator Kit released by Sixam. As stated previously, this is a groundbreaking creation, especially for those on console, as they will finally be able to experience and utilize items created by those who have been modding and creating custom content for years. While it isn't the same as being able to pick and choose your custom content, it's a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>With the new Creator Kits coming out, it's been confirmed by The Sims Team that there will be more of them released in 2025, and they are <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/">planning on expanding the program</a> in the future. The current Creator Kits cost $4.99 to purchase and include items for Create-A-Sim as well as the Build/Buy categories, allowing those who like to play with a theme to create a Kitsch dream of their choice or a sleepy world of their choosing.</p>

If it’s not <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poppy-playtime-chapter-2-released-chapter-1-free-forever" rel="noopener" target="_blank">super viral horror sensations being based around cuddly kids characters</a>, it’s a game based around a cute kids' adventure game set on an apple farm. <em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> is no stranger to that trend, with the original title taking the premise of an old <em>Dora the Explorer</em>-style show hosted by a possibly possessed little girl called Amanda. After the success of the first game, can the sequel continue the story and expand the gameplay?</p>

<p>If you’re into the theorizing aspect of these games, then you won’t be disappointed either. As you explore your surroundings and watch through the tapes, there are plenty of hints and snatches of information for you to decipher the meta-narrative that ties the whole thing together.

Even when starting the game, before anything expressly creepy has even happened, it’s a bit strange to wander around somewhere so quiet when you’re locked in alone at night. Even before Amanda and her low-poly animation starts menacing you on your first VHS tape.</p>
<p>Before you even get started with any of those analog horror shenanigans you have to wrestle with the real core of the game: logic puzzles.</p>
<p>Starting out, you can explore to find a VHS player, but no tapes lying out in the open. You’ll have to unlock the librarian’s cupboard with a 4-digit code to progress and to do that, you’ll have to actually explore and interact with the library to progress further.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Gameplay Loop for the Ages</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-piggy-bank-with-a-digital-display-on-it-near-a-lot-of-library-books-on-a-huge-shelf.jpg?itok=-n4P_W59 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-piggy-bank-with-a-digital-display-on-it-near-a-lot-of-library-books-on-a-huge-shelf.jpg?itok=5QEcOdb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never know how proud of myself I was to get the number to go up to 10.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways, the gameplay loop of <em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> is very similar to the first game. You have to solve a logic puzzle to either gain a new tape or further the progress on your current tape. Instead of having a few random items in your attic this time, there’s a whole library full of books and constantly changing equipment for you to puzzle your way through, and wow there were a lot of puzzles.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if the volume of puzzles is actually any higher than last time, but they were really satisfying here. Most of them derived from pretty logical starting points, making them enjoyable to solve, even when they were being tougher to piece together. Most of the time, you really just have to rely on good observation skills to gather the information you need to proceed, but there’s also the added bonus of the library’s copy machines acting as hint generators which helped to ease the mental burden at times.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spooky, Scary, Or Spoopy?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-tv-screen-with-a-dead-bird-in-the-mouth-of-a-cat-on-it.jpg?itok=Z6VJ_AQF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-a-tv-screen-with-a-dead-bird-in-the-mouth-of-a-cat-on-it.jpg?itok=KXY-QW-v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While it rarely strays into scary territory, the game can certainly be pretty unsettling.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>An important question with any horror game, analog or otherwise, is whether or not it counts as scary, and as always, that’s a tough question to answer. I have to admit that at no point during my playthrough did I feel particularly terrified or inclined to jump out of my skin, but there was plenty of tense atmosphere and creepiness to provide the right atmosphere for this sort of story and general theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, the monster you’re dealing with here isn’t particularly scary, mostly because it spends a lot of the time in this game just standing right out in the open in front of you for extended periods. That said, Amanda herself and some of the contents of the tapes that you end up watching can be downright unsettling, and the VHS effects combined with the old-school TV show animation gives it a little extra dose of immersion to have you on edge.</p>
<h2>Extras, Extras</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-two-character-on-a-tv-bending-over-a-picnic-table.jpg?itok=cD3Zpb3u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-2-screenshot-showing-two-character-on-a-tv-bending-over-a-picnic-table.jpg?itok=hJivT2Ye 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm not even sure who he's trying to convince anyomre.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As I said before, you’ll get out of <em>Amanda the Adventurer 2</em> as much as you put into it. There are a lot of fun puzzles and a tense and creepy atmosphere on offer, making this a perfect game for Halloween. More than that, there’s the tangential storyline about what happened to create Amanda, and what exactly the company Hamelin are and where they came from. You can even gain a lot of extra information about the story by finding all of the secrets and revisiting the game after you’re done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a lot of that extra detail is only going to be found if you go digging for it. There’s a fun game to play and if you only want to run through puzzles you can play it and then move on after a handful of hours. If you intend to dig deeper, you could be playing for a long time. Then again, if you’re anything like me, you’ll get stuck on the last puzzle and run up your playtime artificiality while you’re banging your head into a brick wall.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Amanda The Adventurer 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

The plot is bigger, the puzzles are a bit more varied and interesting, and the new setting gives you more room to move around in, literally. The meta-narrative surrounding the Amanda character and what brought her into existence is still interesting, and even those who only stick around for the puzzles will still have an interesting time. Just don’t expect to go to bed with bad dreams unless you get frightened really easily.</p>

For folks like me who haven’t seen the movies, the game doesn’t expect you to have seen past films or fully understand what’s going on in this world. The game explains just enough about what’s happening and provides enough context that I never felt lost.<br></p><p>In <em>The Road Ahead</em> you star as Alex, a young woman with asthma who, in the opening moments, loses her boyfriend to one of the alien monsters after discovering she’s pregnant with his child. This doesn’t help her relationship with her BF’s mom, who already blames her for the death of her husband and becomes disturbingly aggressive when she learns that Alex is carrying the last member of her family. So Alex and her older father escape their clutches, but in doing so get separated—that means an asthmatic, pregnant, and mourning Alex must make her way alone through the alien-infested world to reach some semblance of safety.<br></p><p>I really appreciate that<em> The Road Ahead </em>doesn’t rely solely on the alien monsters to add tension and intrigue to the game. Instead, they act more as an ever-present background threat—similar to how George A. Romero used zombies in his movies—as a small group of people fight for survival while trying to deal with a lot of trauma. But don’t be mistaken, the blind and nearly indestructible aliens are always around and ready to pounce on you if you get too loud or careless.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646">Similar to <em>Alien Isolation</em></a></span>, you aren’t really fighting the monsters in <em>Road Ahead</em>. Instead, 90% of the game is focused on avoiding them by being very quiet and careful. This is done by moving slowly, avoiding surfaces that make a lot of noise—like broken glass or water—using items as distractions and even pouring out sand to create safe paths to walk on, like in the movies. (I’ve seen the trailers!) </p><p>Most of my time was spent carefully tiptoeing around metal cans and piles of leaves. Even opening a door or turning a valve to solve a simple puzzle is nerve-wracking in a universe where one loud squeak or bang can get you killed. The game makes you slowly pull, push, and turn doors, vent openings, valves, dresser drawers, and more using your controller’s analog stick. Make a single mistake, like carelessly trying to run out of a warehouse or fling open a door to safety, and you’ll be attacked and killed in one hit. </p><p>Thankfully, when this happened to me, the game’s checkpoints were frequent enough that I never lost too much progress. Still, whenever I accidentally kicked a can, I froze in real life and hoped the creatures wouldn’t get me.<br></p><p>Alex’s asthma plays a big part in the game and takes the place of a traditional health bar. Because the monsters in<em> A Quiet Place</em> are incredibly lethal and kill you instantly for being too loud, the devs couldn’t use a traditional health meter like in<em> Resident Evil</em> or <em>Silent Hill</em>. Instead, you have to manage your stress and asthma. Running too much or carrying heavy objects for too long will start to strain your lungs, as will getting too close to the monsters, which causes Alex to stress out.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-recommend-id="image://51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-recommend-id="image://51e156ccdad025f7f5e1dc7ad380805f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If Alex pushes herself too far, she can suffer an asthmatic attack, which could get you killed depending on where you are and when it happens. So you need to manage your asthma with inhalers and pills found around the world. I don’t suffer from asthma, so I’m not sure how accurate <em>Road Ahead’</em>s depiction is, but it adds an interesting and tense wrinkle to the game’s most harrowing moments.<br></p><p><em>The Road Ahead </em>isn’t a very long game—most players will be able to finish it in about five to six hours, but that’s perfect. It tells a compelling story that keeps you moving forward and knows when to call it and not stick around too long and run the concept into the ground. Good scary games tend to work better as shorter experiences and the devs behind <em>Road Ahead</em> seem to get this. </p><p>While this new<em> Quiet Place </em>game isn’t the most innovative or scariest game I’ve played, it’s a very well-made and tense adventure that had me more terrified of metal cans and broken glass than any random zombie I’ve encountered in <em>Resident Evil</em>. Who knew trash could be so scary? <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Counter-Strike has always been a powerhouse of the esports betting market, but in recent months, it has become a bigger title than ever before in the space. In the Q3 2024 ‘Esports Betting Monitor’ report published by Abios, it was revealed that Counter-Strike 2’s esports betting ecosystem continued to grow, overshadowing every other esports game in the business.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-horizons">New Horizons</h2>



<p>In the report published by Abios and propagated by Cody Luongo’s Sharpr newsletter, it was revealed that Counter-Strike 2 accounted for a whopping 58% of the entire esports betting handle through Q3 2024. That’s an all-time high for 2024, and it’s representative of the growth of Counter-Strike in the world of esports gambling.</p>



<p>Looking at the stack of games, they’re ordered like this when it comes to betting popularity:</p>



<ol>
<li>Counter-Strike</li>



<li>League of Legends</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>



<li>Valorant</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>
</ol>



<p>In the last quarter, the most bet-on events included the ESL Pro League, BLAST Premier, and IEM – all Counter-Strike events. League of Legends tournaments weren’t too far behind, though – the LPL, LCK, and LEC all did strong numbers in terms of esports wagering.</p>



<p>It has been a stellar year for League of Legends in general. It was just days ago that <a href="https://escharts.com/news/worlds-series-one-billion-hours-watched" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports Charts reported</a> the League of Legends World Championship had hit <strong>one billion </strong>hours of watch time since records began.</p>



<p>Esports betting continues to be dramatically lucrative for the wider industry. It makes up more than half of the market’s revenue and it contributes to some of the most prolific partnerships and sponsorship deals irrespective of the game in question.</p>

It’s an action-RPG based on Chinese mythology and the story <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/knowing-this-lore-makes-black-myth-wukong-way-more-enjoyable">Journey to the West</a>.</p><p>In his 8/10 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc">Black Myth: Wukong review</a>, critic <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/Mitchell-IGN">Mitchel Saltzman</a> wrote:</p><p>“As GameScience’s debut action game, Black Myth: Wukong is mostly a great success, despite some major technical black marks and localization issues that are likely to cause some frustrations at launch. Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as Elden Ring ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style. Not only that, but there are a ton of exciting boss battles, a great variety of enemies, and the world they inhabit is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears. Its story has its moments but relies a bit too much on having prior knowledge of the events of Journey to the West, and it really could have used a map to make its rewarding exploration measure up to the strength of its combat. That said, its strengths more than carry it through, making Black Myth: Wukong a great action game that could be even greater if GameScience can squash the bugs.”</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukongs-physical-ps5-edition-is-up-for-preorder">Black Myth: Wukong (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-xbox-pc">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-xbox-series-x-s-pc">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-horizon-adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster">Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

The feat is a world's first.</p><p>Having just one hit point is an obvious threat, as it means any hit taken, even from the most insignificant enemy or fall, results in death, But having just one focus point, or FP, meant Ainrun couldn't use any magic or Ash of War skills that allow the myriad speedrunning and cheesing strategies deployable in normal runs.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">20+ hours, 900+ deaths on Radahn. World's first 1HP/1FP/1Stam run is finally over. <a href="https://t.co/GFoCFnParw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GFoCFnParw</a></p>— Ainrun (@Ainrun) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ainrun/status/1848393882960040165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But it was the one point of stamina that caused the most problems, they said. Elden Ring, like FromSoftware's previous games, uses stamina for everything. Every use of the shield to defend against attacks, every swing of the player's own weapon, and every dodge out of the way uses stamina. Having just one point of it meant none of those things could be used together.</p><p>"The one HP didn't matter much cause I'm used to no hit runs," Ainrun said in a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/Ainrun/status/1848394358933827842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. "The one stamina was the worst part. You cant chain actions like spam rolls or do combos, cause every action takes stamina and goes to the negative.</p><p>"You need to wait a whole second for your stamina to go back to the positive before you can do another action. The one FP meant I couldn't cheese bosses or use Ash of Wars or anything. Just pure movement and parries and self-hate."</p><p>The feat is made all the more impressive given just how hard many players found Shadow of the Erdtree normally. It featured bosses with which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-has-pushed-the-envelope-on-what-can-be-withstood-by-players-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">FromSoftware "really pushed the envelope" on what the player can withstand</a>, director Hidetaka Miyazaki said ahead of its release. In fact, getting into the expansion even poses a challenge as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-publisher-warns-fans-they-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-beat-mohg-so-they-can-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">players must defeat an optional boss</a>.</p><p>Those eager to explore every inch of the DLC once in can check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">IGN's extensive guide</a>, which covers <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">Shadow of the Erdtree's new weapons</a>, its various quest lines, and how to defeat those pesky new bosses.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">In our 10/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single player expansions," we said. "It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Things have come full circle now, as the Replacer isn't just content with being the new Pope or a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6s-replacer-is-even-replacing-nfl-mascots-now/1100-6527312/">beloved sports mascot</a>: He's now taking over for some of the biggest internet memes of all time--or at least the ones that have outlasted the 15 seconds of fame that most new memes have when they first go viral. You can see the <a href="https://giphy.com/callofduty" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full collection through this link</a>.</p><p>The official Call of Duty X (formerly Twitter) account revealed that the Replacer has replaced several of your favorite memes, including all-time classics Leonardo DiCaprio Pointing, The Great Gatsby toast, overly excited Jonah Hill, and even Homer Simpson backing into the bushes. While it's not listed in the original post, the Replacer has even replaced that one guy who looks suspiciously like him in the John Wick Chapter 2 meme about focus, commitment, and sheer willpower. How many can you recognize in the post below?</p><p>If you're wondering why the star of Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 and Constantine is seemingly everywhere these days, that's thanks to Activision reviving the Replacer for Black Ops 6. It's a role that Stormare has played in Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Black Ops 3, and Black Ops 4. So far, we've seen him replace French rapper JUL, <a href="https://youtu.be/tYM5x_2uYk8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">political analysts</a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/JZMK4sjfUPs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sky News sports host</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/0W6I-iTGutQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">your dad</a>.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC on October 25, and in related news, you can see just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-is-black-ops-6s-campaign/1100-6527287/" data-ref-id="1100-6527287">how long the Black Ops 6 campaign is</a>, how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-works-plus-tons-of-unlocks-and-rewards/1100-6527292/" data-ref-id="1100-6527292">the progression and prestige systems work</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-have-the-controversial-riot-shield-at-launch/1100-6527297/" data-ref-id="1100-6527297">why the controversial Riot Shield won't be available at launch</a>.</p>
