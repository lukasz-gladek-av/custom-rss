		<p>EA is looking at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> to be a major turning point for its football games, especially with the tagline ‘The Club is Yours.’ FC 26 is all about taking the feedback from the community of the past two FC games, as well as from the preceding FIFA games, and using that to address gameplay complaints that have persisted over the years. These are things like passing being too rigid, goalkeepers not being intelligent enough, animations not being reflective of reality, and player behaviours not meeting expectations.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GE8YCIQF2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A core change in FC 26 is splitting the gameplay into two distinct and different styles, Authentic and Competitive. Authentic has been designed to give a real match day feeling and experience, based on what you would expect to see if you are watching teams in real life, while Competitive could be considered the more arcade style of what you expect from a video game, and that reflects in where they are going to be used. Authentic has been created primarily for single-player modes whereas Competitive is for the online modes including Ultimate Team.</p>


<p>The preview build of FC 26 gave us access to the single player kick off mode featuring both the men’s and women’s UEFA Champions League – Bayern Munchen. Paris St Germain, Liverpool, and Real Madrid for the men, and OL Lyonnes, Bayern Munchen, Real Madrid, and Chelsea for the women. Given the gameplay split, I flipped back and forth between the modes using the Professional difficulty.</p>


<p>Immediately, FC 26’s Authentic setting feels heavy and slow, with player attributes, including size, having a much bigger influence here. Slow players will not sprint for long, while nimble players will have the ability to hop between defenders. But the bigger defenders can easily bully smaller players off the ball too. During my matches, you could absolutely feel when a bigger player was trying to shoulder off a smaller player, but on the flip side you learn how to avoid this situation by wrong-footing bigger players and putting space between them.</p>
<p>As this is supposed to mimic real world football, you shouldn’t expect players to be constantly going end to end. It is quite methodical in where you must place your passes and position your players, and while it is more fluid than previous FC experiences, there is still some of that rigidity. There is a slowness to it that will be appreciated by some, as you probe defences looking for that moment you can break through, or learning precisely when to go in for the tackle and when to bring your keeper out to stop a shot. Mistime these moments and the opposition will punish you.</p>
<p>In the Competitive setting, which will be used for online modes, the restrictions on players are a lot looser. Suddenly, someone like Harry Kane is a natural sprinter and can bully their way into the box, dealing with defenders with ease. This setting is much more fast paced, with the ball pinging from player to player, the action moving incredibly quickly. It will be familiar to most FC players, and it might not be what some were hoping for, because defensive play comes second to offence again.</p>

<p>There is a clear gulf between offence and defence in both modes, though the women’s game seemed better balanced than the men’s at this point. Here are the scores from the 10 matches I played:</p>
<p><strong>Authentic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real Madrid 9 – 0 Liverpool</li>
<li>Liverpool 6 – 0 Real Madrid</li>
<li>Bayern Munchen 4 – 2 Paris St-Germain</li>
<li>Chelsea 3 – 2 Bayern Munchen</li>
<li>OL Lyonnes 8 – 2 Real Madrid</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Competitive</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real Madrid 7 – 0 Liverpool</li>
<li>Liverpool 8 – 0 Real Madrid</li>
<li>Bayern Munchen 9 – 0 Paris St-Germain</li>
<li>Chelsea 10 – 2 Bayern Munchen</li>
<li>OL Lyonnes 6 – 4 Real Madrid</li>
</ul>
<p>EA has said it has reworked goalkeeping in FC 26 to be more responsive, but there still is still discrepancy between goalkeeper behaviour and attacker behaviour. While playing, I noticed that when a keeper performs well when their defensive players are near them, but fall apart in one on one situations. In one example, as Salah I cut in from the right-hand side of the box, and Courtois kind of slid past leaving the goal wide open. Goalkeepers do have some more animations compared to previous entries, and it can cause some interesting situations with this early build. In one match Allison punched the ball up into the air and did so a couple more times while still surrounded by players instead of trying to catch it. Quite an incredible flex, when you think about it. Real Allison should take notes!</p>

<p>There has been an increased focus on player individualism so each one is more distinctive, and plays more like their real life counterparts. PlayStyles make a return with players having up to six of these equipped to showcase their skills. Examples of PlayStyles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finesse Shot+ – Faster finesse shots with max curve and accuracy</li>
<li>Precision Header – Increased accuracy for headers, Precision Header animations</li>
<li>Acrobatic – Perform volleys with improved accuracy, acrobatic volley animations</li>
<li>Aerial Fortress – Higher jmpus and improved aerial defence presence</li>
<li>Trickster+ – More unique ground and flick Skill moves, quicker strafe dribbling</li>
<li>Whipped Pass – Accurate, faster crosses with more curve</li>
<li>Rapid – Higher sprint speed while dribbling, reduced error on knock ons</li>
<li>First Touch – Reduced trapping error, faster dribbling transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, these seem to able to shine better in Authentic gameplay compared to Competitive, as you notice the differences between each player. Of course, these play styles will come into play in both settings and impact the way matches unfold. Archetypes are new addition to further individualise the top players in the game, and there is a setting where these players will act and react like they would in real life too.</p>
<p>From the preview build. FC 26 does show a lot of improvements over <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">FC 25</a>. Gameplay is generally better, and the split between Authentic for single player modes and Competitive for online modes while give a new variety for players that switch between the two. However, there is still work to be done on the defensive side, as it is still really easy to get through the defence and beat keepers one on one.</p>

<p>Coming January 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>NIS America has revealed that the next entry in the expansive turn-based RPG franchise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, will launch on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>15th January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This announcement follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/trails-beyond-the-horizon-slips-to-early-2026-but-its-also-coming-to-switch-2">game's delay just last month</a> from its Fall 2025 date, where the Switch 2 version — which is a Game Key-Card — was also revealed.</p>
<p>Taking place across the continent of Zemuria, Trails Beyond the Horizon is the third game in the Calvard Arc, and the 13th game in the wider Trails series. You'll control three different protagonists throughout the adventure — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak">Daybreak</a>'s lead Van Arkride, the founder of Arkride Solutions and a Spriggan; Rean Schwarzer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_of_cold_steel_iii">Cold Steel</a>'s protagonist and the Ashen Chevalier; and Kevin Graham, a high-ranking member of the Septian Church who hasn't been seen since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_to_azure">Trails to Azure</a>.</p>
<p>The game features a robust blend of turn-based and real-time combat, which legendary Japanese developer Nihon Falcom has been steadily improving over the course of the series. The game will be playable at PAX West later this year, so if you're heading there, keep an eye out for the booth!</p>
<p>Let's get a better rundown of what to expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Arkride and the members of Arkride Solutions are back, and this time the future of the entire Zemurian continent is at stake! The people of Zemuria await the launch of humanity's first foray into space with bated breath. A sudden invitation from Marduk to cooperate in a high-tech training exercise sets Van, Ashen Chevalier Rean Schwarzer, and Father Kevin Graham on a collision course with the secrets at the very core of Zemuria.</p>
<p>Their paths may diverge, but the ultimate question remains the same: Just what lies beyond the edge of the horizon?</p>
<p>● All Trails Lead Here: Paths from across Zemuria intertwine with higher stakes than ever before as the Trails series enters its final chapter!<br>
● Gameplay, Evolved: New gameplay mechanics such as Shard Commands,<br>
Awakening, and the time-freezing Z.O.C. give you an unprecedented amount of options in both Field and Command Battles!<br>
● Dream Teams: Gather allies from all over Calvard and beyond and put a stop to Ouroboros' machinations in the Grim Garten, a dungeon that you can take on with your own custom party!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's looking pretty fantastic, and will be an excellent way to ring in 2026 for RPG fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Release Date Indirectly Confirmed by Official Website]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, renowned leaker billbill-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> details on the Battlefield 6 release date. According to the insider, the game would be released on October 10, priced at €69.99/79.99 for the Standard Edition and €99.99/109.99 for the Phantom Edition, with the PC version being €10 cheaper as with most games.</p>



<p>Today, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut trailer</a> and the news that the reveal event would take place on July 31, eagle-eyed spotter Wario64 has already <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1948404850288427225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> some fine print on the official Battlefield 6 website that practically confirms the aforementioned release date as correct.</p>



<p>On the legal disclaimers, it is confirmed that pre-order offers will expire on October 10, which makes perfect sense if that's the game's release date. Moreover, the codes can be redeemed for two years through October 10, 2027, as with most games. If rumors are to be believed, fans should get their hands on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta test</a> much earlier than that, though, possibly in early August.</p>



<p>As to the game itself, the developers did not reveal much today, except that the bad guys are the so-called Pax Armata, a private military corporation 'bankrolled by former NATO states' whose agenda threatens to plunge the world into global conflict. This sets the stage for what players can expect on the battlefield, in both multiplayer and the series's return to a single-player campaign, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being handled by Motive Studios</a>. </p>



<p>The press release also confirms a veritable return to the core tenets of the franchise in Battlefield 6: visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom. Players will be able to blow through walls, bring down entire buildings, and take to the skies in dogfights for a tactical advantage, but working together with your squad will still be the secret to victory.</p>



<p>Next week, all will be revealed through a series of live events taking place in Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London, with another scheduled in Singapore on August 2. We'll have Kai on the ground in LA to report his first impressions on the long-awaited next chapter in the Battlefield series. Stay tuned for his hands-on!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Officially Revealed, Release Date Seemingly Set for October]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-officially-revealed-release-date-seemingly-set-for-october.1252473/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, and it looks like the first-person shooter will be launching across PC and current-gen consoles in October.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>will revolve around the conflict between NATO and a fictional private military company known as Pax Armata, which translates to "armed peace" in Latin. How very appropriate.</p>

<p>The new game will bring "high-intensity infantry combat", along with aerial dogfighting, tank combat, and more. Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, you'll also have the ability to destroy the environment around you "for a strategic advantage", as EA says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-revealed-destruction.jpg?itok=3tx_G83C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-revealed-destruction.jpg?itok=jxhwnGSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has officially been revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the conflict in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>revolves around NATO and a PMC, it's safe to assume we're in for another modern setting akin to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 4</em>; basically, we're not going to get a period-piece historical warfare game along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield V&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1</em>.</p>

<p>If EA's legal disclaimers for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>are anything to go by, it looks like we can expect an October release for the game as well. As spotted by Wario64 on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3luptwxr5rh2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, pre-sell offers for the game expire on October 10th, so that's likely the release date, although it hasn't officially been announced yet.</p>

<p>That would also chime with the fact that EA has previously revealed the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game will launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">sometime before March next year</a>, as will the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't feature an offline mode</a>).</p>

<p>The debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>doesn't give away any gameplay, although it's fair to say we know roughly what to expect from this one if previous <i>Battlefield&nbsp;</i>games are any indication. Nevertheless, you can check out the trailer here.</p>




<p>EA has a lot to prove when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Following the player base's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/60000-battlefield-2042-players-want-their-money-back" rel="nofollow">hostile reception</a> to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted in 2022 that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-says-battlefield-needs-lot-of-work-restore-reputation" rel="nofollow">it would take "a lot of work"</a> to restore the franchise's reputation.</p>

<p>In April last year, when EA announced the end of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>seasons, the publisher also confirmed that the next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-seasons-ending" rel="nofollow">would be a co-development effort</a> between four studios: DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect.</p>

<p><i>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</i>is set to launch sometime in the future for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009568/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/battlefield-6/9p2ff14jzll3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. A multiplayer gameplay reveal is due to air next week, so stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>Despite the game's teaser trailer making a big deal of NATO being under attack, and featured various European cities, this trailer looked to be tapping more into the typical American jingoism both this series and its brother in big shootering Call of Duty have embraced at various points over the years. While the latter's now got Beavis and Butthead in it, this reveal was very much flying the flag for Battlefield 6 being back in its grimy, realistic modern-day military guise, at least as far as the singleplayer's concerned.</p>
<p>The game also really seems to hate helicopters, with the two-minute trailer featuring no less than four rotored birds having a bad time in various crashy and explodey ways, as things cut between cinematic action and a US president talking about an attack by the Pax Armata private military corporation. They're shaping up to be Battlefield 6's main baddies, further hinting in my eyes that it might be a bit of a 'Can you believe these mercenaries do war for money? You should do it for honour and nationalism like we do' sort of tale.</p>
<p>The trailer ended with the announcement that the game's multiplayer bit will be getting its own reveal on July 31st. That'll kick off at 7:30 PM BST / 2:30 PM ET / 11:30 AM PT / 8:30 PM CEST, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BRbvYxgOY">link's already live</a> if you want to sit in chat for the whole week gradually typing out the lyrics to every anti-war song ever written.</p>
<p>EA promise it'll showcase some maps, as well as new and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-over-a-week-on-from-the-last-one-theres-a-fresh-battlefield-6-leak-here-that-shows-the-return-of-rush">returning modes</a> you'll be able to battle your way through the fields of. That's the same EA, of course, who are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">reportedly hoping 100 million people</a> will join you in those killing fields. Given how the trailer went, I assume that means they'll have 100 million spare helicopters on standby.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> bundle is still live at Best Buy for $499.99, and it’s a smart pickup if you’re planning to get both anyway. You save $20 off the digital copy of the game, and with Switch 2 stock being all over the place, locking one in now isn’t a bad move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokemon TCG</a> side, both the Black Bolt and White Flare Elite Trainer Boxes have dipped below Amazon pricing on TCGPlayer, now sitting at $91.50 and $90.98, respectively. That’s some of the best pricing we’ve seen outside of limited restocks, and probably your best shot at avoiding inflated third-party listings (although it's still way over MSRP).</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in today’s deals, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is $799.99 at Best Buy, which is $500 off its usual price and a great buy for an unlocked flagship. ROG Ally is also down to $499.99 with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB storage, which makes it one of the better portable gaming options if you want full Windows access. Soundcore P20i earbuds are just $19.98, the Anker 332 Power Strip is $15.99, and the upgraded 100W Anker Nano Charging Station is $35.99. All three are practical, everyday gear at their lowest prices in weeks.</p><p id="switch-2-pokmon-legends-z-a-bund"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bund">Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225666"><div id="225666" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching the same time as Pokémon Legends: Z-A, this bundle knocks a cool $20 off the digital price tag of the game (digital code included). We're not at the custom limited edition console point of the Switch 2's life cycle yet, but this is a smart way to secure the system and save some money whilst doing it. Just preorder quickly - I'm amazed Best Buy still has it live.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 2)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225675"><div id="225675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This $69.99 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the Switch 1 game with the Switch 2 upgrade included. From what we've seen so far, we're talking 4K resolutions running at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second. Real-time battles, a fully explorable Lumiose City, and nighttime Z-A Royale events all benefit from the sharper visuals and faster load times. If you're already going in on a Switch 2, this is the version to get. It looks like the most technically ambitious Pokémon game yet, and Switch 2 seems to be the only way to experience it at its best.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225676"><div id="225676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not ready to upgrade to a Nintendo Switch 2 yet, the Switch 1 version still has an upgrade path so you have options down the line. Legends Z-A switches things up with real-time battles, an urban setting in Lumiose City, and the full return of Mega Evolutions, including 27 new forms like Mega Dragonite. The starter picks are a nice throwback, but what really caught my attention is the Z-A Royale system and Alpha Pokémon lurking across the city at night. Add in deep trainer customization and the Switch 2 upgrade option, and it’s clear the developers are trying to evolve more than just the Pokémon this time. If it plays as good as it sounds, this could be the next real shift for the series.</p></div><p id="black-bolt-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box">Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225517"><div id="225517" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The fluxuations on this Elite Trainer Box has been crazy this week, but TCG Player finally has listings cheaper than Amazon starting at $91.50, around $20 cheaper than the big box giant. This is likely the cheapest you'll find it outside of a flash sale and pot luck restocks.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-white-flare-elite-traine"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG White Flare Elite Traine">Pokemon TCG White Flare Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225580"><div id="225580" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG White Flare Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the same situation with the White Flare Elite Trainer Box, slightly cheaper than Black Bolt and around $13 worth of savings based on Amazon pricing. Again, it's a good time to buy.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Black Bolt White Flare Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're seeing some of the highest valued cards in the Scarlet and Violet era in Black Bolt White Flare. The major chase cards here are the Victini, Reshiram and Zekrom ex color rares, and there's two variants for Victini ex. Madness.</p><p id="destined-rivals-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box">Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225515"><div id="225515" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Down to $90.98, marking nearly $25 off its market value, this is <em>almost </em>the best price we've seen for the Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box (it pretty much is right now in all honesty). It's above MSRP, but good luck finding a better price during Pokémania 2025.</p></div><p id="prismatic-evolutions-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle">Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225654"><div id="225654" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is currently $10 cheaper than TCG Player with Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundles, but it's still way over MSRP.

To break this down, you're getting four Journey Together boosters, a 30-card deck and one of four stamped promos.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Stock Update</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is finally getting into the groove with Pokémon TCG Elite Trainer Box stock and pricing, and some are the closest to MSRP the big box retailer has been for weeks. Not only is the Black Bolt ETB vastly undercutting the secondary market, Paradox Rift ETB is even cheaper (and an overlooked set in my opinion, stock up now). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's other great deals on ex boxes too, which are also near MSRP and around the same or just under listings on TCG Player. The sealed market is becoming more competitive, so it's more important than ever to give eBay a quick check before hitting buy.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Nintendo Switch 2 Stock Updates</h2></p><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225579"><div id="225579" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 - Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shocking move, Target is selling both Nintendo Switch 2 SKUs without preorders, waiting lists or raffles, so snap them up quickly. As predicted, Nintendo Switch 2's launch window is seeing stock shortages in the US. If you didn't preorder at launch, you've probably been waiting for stock drops since launch.</p></div><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225578"><div id="225578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon currently has its invitation system in place for both the standard console SKU and the Mario Kart world bundle, so it's always worth getting on the waiting list whilst you wait.

You’re getting a 200 megapixel camera, a sharp 6.8 inch OLED display, and enough power to handle anything. It works with nearly every carrier and still includes a built-in stylus, which is rare and actually useful.</p></div><p id="rog-ally-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-512gb"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB">ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225763"><div id="225763" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $499.99, this is the lowest I’ve seen the ROG Ally go with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB of storage. It runs Windows, so I can launch anything I already own on Steam or Game Pass without workarounds. The 120Hz screen is sharp and responsive, and I like that I can dock it or plug in a mouse and keyboard without needing extra gear.</p></div><p id="soundcore-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Soundcore Wireless Earbuds">Soundcore Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225764"><div id="225764" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Soundcore Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $19.98, these are about as cheap as I’ve seen for wireless earbuds that aren’t complete junk. You get 10 hours on single a charge, decent sound with actual bass, and the app gives you EQ control if you want to tweak things. Call quality is fine with two mics, and they’re small enough to carry around without thinking about it. For under twenty bucks, they do what they’re supposed to without falling apart.</p></div><p id="anker-332-usb-c-power-strip-surge-pr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Pr">Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Protector</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225765"><div id="225765" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Protector</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For $15.99, this is cheaper than most basic surge protectors and does way more. You get six outlets, USB-C charging with 20W power delivery, and a compact design that actually fits in tighter spots. It’s not going to blow you away, but it’s soound for a desk or nightstand setup, and the surge protection is better than the usual bargain bin stuff. At this price, I’d grab one just to stop moving my charger between rooms.</p></div><p id="anker-nano-charging-station"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker Nano Charging Station">Anker Nano Charging Station</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225766"><div id="225766" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Nano Charging Station</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $35.99, this is one of the few charging stations that can handle a laptop and still have room for everything else. Two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and three AC outlets is more than enough for a desk setup, and the 100W output means it actually charges a MacBook Pro properly. It keeps cables out of the way and cuts down on the need for multiple bricks. It’s compact, works well, and replaces at least two chargers and a power strip in one go.</p></div><p id="portable-neck-fan-with-led-display"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Portable Neck Fan With LED Display">Portable Neck Fan With LED Display</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225669"><div id="225669" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Portable Neck Fan With LED Display</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $17.99, this neck fan is cheaper than a cumbersome handheld fan and way more useful. It's lightweight, quiet, and actually hands-free, which makes it easy to wear while working, traveling, or just trying to survive another summer heatwave. The LED display is a nice bonus since you don’t have to guess how much battery life is left, and the bladeless design means no hair tangles. Five speed settings and up to 15 hours of runtime for under twenty bucks? That’s a win.</p></div><p id="fourth-wing-wing-and-claw-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collectio">Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225670"><div id="225670" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're collecting The Empyrean series, this new edition of Fourth Wing is worth a look. It’s down to $23.09 right now, and the updated hardcover comes with stenciled edges to match Iron Flame and Onyx Storm, which should appeal to anyone trying to keep their shelf setup clean and consistent. This is a limited first print run for the U.S. and Canada, so it’s a good chance to own a unique version of your future favorite book series for a steal. </p></div><p id="iron-flame-standard-edition-the"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The "> Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The Empyrean, 2)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225672"><div id="225672" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The Empyrean, 2)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're already deep into Fourth Wing, grabbing Iron Flame for $13.92 is a no-brainer, especially with the list price pushing $30. The narration from Rebecca Soler adds a solid layer to the story, and this sequel dives straight into the brutality and politics of Basgiath without slowing down. Things are darker, the stakes are higher, and Violet’s got even more to lose.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here come the Fares followers, and this one could be mighty special.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Josef Fares-directed co-op games from Hazelight have been so good – and crucially, also so commercially successful – that it’s about time we started seeing some other developers trying to get in on that artistically beautiful, mandatory two-player action. And Out of Words, from poet Morten Søndergaard and co-developers WiredFly and Kong Orange, not only fits the mold cast by Fares, but has the potential to be as good as anything the former filmmaker has made so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s purely coincidental that Out of Words has so much in common with Hazelight’s games, but it’s an interesting coincidence nonetheless. Søndergaard, like Fares, is a European artist who came from outside of the games industry. And Out of Words promises an emotional two-player coming-of-age physics-based puzzle platforming journey for its pair of handcrafted protagonists, Kurt and Karla. Those parallels aside, though, Out of Words very clearly looks set to stand tall on its own two feet. First of all, it’s absolutely gorgeous, and completely handmade. Literally. Each character and set piece was made in real life and painstakingly animated frame by frame. In motion it looks – and sounds – absolutely gorgeous. I got to play it for a quick 20 minutes, but if the entire game is anything like my brief hands-on, then this could be up there with anything Hazelight has made so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Søndergaard jumped me around to a few different parts of the story, but I got to see a bit of the beginning, when Kurt and Karla find themselves transported to Vokabulantis just as they are each trying to find the words to say that they have feelings for each other. They awaken to find that they have no mouths – kinda like that part in The Matrix, but less disturbing – and must find new ways to communicate. This translates in game terms to co-op puzzles, usually physics-based. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They awaken to find that they have no mouths – kinda like that part in The Matrix, but less disturbing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, in one section I played, whichever one of you held Aleph, a pet creature that is a literal symbol of your friendship, would have their gravity reversed and float up to the ceiling, while the other stayed on the ground. Navigating through various vertically oriented sections required careful timing of both jumping and tossing Aleph to the other person, lest one of you fall into the abyss. In another area, Kurt and Karla came to an area under Vokabulantis, where books are stacked everywhere and the doubt about their feelings for each other is represented by literal darkness. And in yet another spot, you both become a ball of primordial clay with each of you controlling an arm that can jut out from the body of the clay ball to grab onto the environment. You must work together to successfully work your way through all of the obstacles in your path. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Out of Words - SGF 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I mentioned music earlier for good reason. During a serene early moment, as the two of you run across a puddle-strewn grassy field, a subtle-but-powerful musical note hits every time either of you jumps and lands back on the ground. Hopefully there are more moments like that throughout Out of Words’s run, as it added a poignant punch to what promises to be a very emotional game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, if all of this sounds…<em>weird</em>, I get it. It’s definitely weird. But when you and a friend sit down to play it, via cross-play online co-op or together on a couch in same-screen, it’ll all start to make sense. I can’t say I’ve played a game quite like Out of Words. Sure, it has a lot in common with Hazelight’s body of work, but it’s also very much its own unique expression of art and story. The art I can already definitively vouch for, and the story? Well, let’s see what kind of metaphors, morals, and moments the poet Søndergaard can deliver when Out of Words ships for PC (via Epic Games Store), PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026. I can’t wait.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

<section><p>The idea of a "forever game" is a myth, and game makers should be cognizant of the end of their products.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a July 2025 shareholders meeting, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot made a salient yet obvious point about online video games: "You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal." He added: "Support for all games cannot last forever."</p><p dir="ltr">This was in response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-addresses-the-stop-killing-games-movement/1100-6533318/">"Stop Killing Games," a consumer movement</a> that rallies against purported "planned obsolescence" of online video games from publishers. Sparked by the shutdown of Ubisoft's The Crew, the movement has gained traction in the past year through petitions directly to European governments.</p><p dir="ltr">From a certain point of view, Guillemot sounds dismissive--like an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/30/joni-ernst-town-hall-00376747" rel="nofollow ">elected official shrugging off constituent concerns</a> about healthcare coverage by citing the inevitability of mortality. But the limited lifespan of modern live-service games is a reality that publishers and studios never address, at least publicly--or until it's suddenly time to pull the plug. Rarely does an executive acknowledge that their online game will, one day, come to an end.</p><p dir="ltr">Whenever a company ships a video game, there's hope from all stakeholders involved that the title will make an impact. Newly shipped online games, in particular, would love to become the "forever game" for as many players as possible--the next Fortnite or Destiny 2. Nowadays, online games are in a relentless and never-ending pursuit of an unknown and unseen finish line. However, as we've seen with the likes of Concord, MultiVersus, XDefiant, and too many others to count, becoming the next Fortnite is an uphill, and perhaps in current market conditions, unfeasible goal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537414-xd_screenshot-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537414" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537414-xd_screenshot-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537414"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft's XDefiant, which shut down in June</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537414-xd_screenshot-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The failures of so many aspiring killers of Genshin Impact, Call of Duty, Destiny, etc., lead me to ponder the "forever games" that continue to thrive. Will we be playing Fortnite Chapter 30 Season 4 in our twilight years from the cloud through data centers on Mars?</p><p dir="ltr">If we all take the "nothing is eternal" comment to heart, Fortnite will not literally last forever. One day, perhaps in the absurdly far future, Epic Games will stop adding new content to Fortnite. Some number of years later, Fortnite will go offline, and the game as we knew it will be dead.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe companies can stop killing games, but that won't stop games from dying. And the folks who make online games should at least consider how they'll give their games a merciful death when it's time.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo--a company not renowned for its online titles--did something strange before releasing Splatoon 3: it gave the game an endpoint. The shooting game would only get two years of seasonal content, including new maps, weapons, and clothes--though the game would very much remain playable.</p><p dir="ltr">I recall going through all stages of grief while playing Splatoon 3. Having an expiration date for new content was conflicting. At first, playing it felt meaningless; I knew that, despite whatever level of success or popularity it reached, Nintendo was already planning to toss it aside, as it had with Super Mario Maker 2 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Yet, unlike those two other cases, Nintendo was very clear upfront about the level of support Splatoon 3 would receive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537413-splatoon3_grandfestival_idols_scrn_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537413" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5760" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537413-splatoon3_grandfestival_idols_scrn_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537413"></a><figcaption>The Grand Festival event for Splatoon 3, which came at the end of two years of content updates</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537413-splatoon3_grandfestival_idols_scrn_01.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">From my own experience, those two years with Splatoon 3 were immensely meaningful and special--knowing how long the game would remain fresh made me want to experience as much of that time as possible. And the fact that it got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splatoon-raiders-spin-off-game-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6532308/">Switch 2 update</a> with new weapons, beyond the two-year limit, served as a pleasant surprise.</p><p dir="ltr">But what about a case like Mortal Kombat 1? Upon its release, game director Ed Boon sometimes spoke of <a href="https://x.com/Murdoink/status/1922686641396764849" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"years of content"</a> for the fighting game. So, when the news broke about this "Definitive Edition," which would feature less than two years of content, including 12 new characters and a story expansion, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-devs-respond-to-calls-for-more-dlc/1100-6531826/">produced outrage from fans</a>. After all, that's about the same amount of new content--and just a few months short--of the amount of support the preceding game, Mortal Kombat 11, received.</p><p dir="ltr">To fans dissatisfied with the state of MK1, this perceived death of the game was premature. It's an example of how the "fairness" of a video game's end-of-life support is ultimately defined by the relationship between the developers' transparency and the consumers' expectations. Maybe NetherRealm Studios wasn't candid enough about the life of MK1, but players might have expected too much--how many more characters did that game need? Still, any imbalance on either side of that developer-player relationship can lead to a PR nightmare.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite video games having more than enough "video game" in it, today's business models have consumers constantly yearning for more. These games need to be constantly supported, improved, and iterated upon; otherwise, they're a "dead game." Yet we also hear cries that online games are becoming too bloated, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fomo-has-infected-many-modern-games-remedy-dev-says/1100-6531538/">rooted in FOMO</a>, and becoming second jobs.</p><p dir="ltr">To escape either of these pitfalls, developers of a live game could make it clear from the start that their service will only have, say, three years of new content. It may sting to hear at first, but I'd argue that it could make those three years impactful.</p><p dir="ltr">Developers can stay focused with a clear goal in mind and move on to the next project afterward. Players can have proper expectations, knowing they have something quantifiable and solid to look forward to without devoting an indefinite amount of time. It's an option that might not make investors happy, but it's not one that companies should count out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537415-2025_apollo_core_game_press_kit_solo_ops_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537415" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537415-2025_apollo_core_game_press_kit_solo_ops_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537415"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2, which launched its latest expansion in July</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4537415-2025_apollo_core_game_press_kit_solo_ops_compressed_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There lies the distinction, though, because at least Splatoon 3 and Mortal Kombat 1 are still playable online. Where the more challenging conversations lie is when those online services cease entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">With the total shutdown of a live-service game, especially one like The Crew, in which digital licenses are stripped away, there are legal and financial ramifications--and since the genesis of Stop Killing Games, there has been no shortage of internet debates surrounding them. But from a moral and philosophical standpoint, what does the complete shuttering of a game really mean?</p><p dir="ltr">As simple and true as Guillemot's point might be, it doesn't actually address one of the bigger points from Stop Killing Games, which is preservation and additional end-of-life options. When a video game is completely unplayable in any form, that is certain death.</p><p dir="ltr">The possible solutions for averting demise aren't revelatory: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasonal-updates-ending-with-offline-mode-coming-soon/1100-6528327/">offline modes like with Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> and private server support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knockout-citys-closure-is-part-of-a-painful-truth-of-the-games-industry-studio-says/1100-6511390/">like with Knockout City</a> are viable options. These solutions take time, labor, and devotion to implement, and as developers will tell us, they aren't easy to accomplish.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, the industry must rethink the path it is on where it has trained players into expecting endless content, and any gap or shortcoming spells death. We have to imagine a time when Fortnite concerts will be a thing of the past, and Destiny 2 actually has a final shape. This broader existential issue of end-of-life for video games and how to make it palatable for consumers is something that game makers must consider, and soon. "Forever" is running out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> developers at Riot Games have confirmed that the upcoming 2v2 fighting game will have a cool feature in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heads-up-arcane-fans-vi-has-been-revealed-as-2xkos-eighth-fighter-ahead-of-its-final-beta-landing-in-september">its closed beta</a> that should allow for a wave of competitive tournaments to flourish before its full release.
</p>
<p>This feature is offline play, confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/TheNitten/status/1948130703540891659">executive producer Tom Cannon</a> on the 2XKO Discord. Now that may not sound like a big deal, but there are a few quirks and considerations that make this a bigger deal than you may assume. For one, all characters are playable offline. 
</p>
<p>That means that from the closed beta launch until the foreseeable future, new characters won't have to be arduously unlocked or grinded out in-game to play with friends or at big tournaments. This is cool for everyone, but for tournament organisers who need dozens of set-ups with all characters unlocked, it's a lifesaver.

<p>On top of that, the lack of an online connection is a massive deal for these tournaments as it lowers costs. If you rent out a venue, you often have to pay for internet access. This can be expensive for larger events in convention centres or hotels. Plus, the internet in these venues isn't always stable. In a competitive environment, having a local match fall apart due to an internet connection would be a major problem.
</p>
<p>Riot Games is essentially making this decision to lend a head to the competitive space, which even today acts as a major foundation for the genre's popularity. Be it smaller events in your local cities, or annual super-events bringing in thousands of players, the in-person experience remains central to the overall enjoyment of fighting games. 
</p>
<p>2XKO has been present at the largest of these events - Evo - in the years prior to its release. The reason being a consistent source of feedback from players of all levels of skill and a way of telling genre diehards that this new company stepping into the space understands what the core audience values. So if you're excited for 2XKO, or just want an excuse to get out of the house in September when the closed beta launches, this is certainly good news for you.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-tournaments-could-start-earlier-than-you-think-due-to-this-closed-beta-feature]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky to Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b78769a3c506f/trails-in-the-sky-to-trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Falcom is one of the most influential and long-standing Japanese developers out there. Pioneering the action RPG space with the <strong>Ys</strong> series, it's recently become more well-known for its continent-spanning epic turn-based series, <strong>Trails</strong>.</p>
<p>On <strong>15th January 2026</strong>, the series' 13th entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, will be launching on Switch and Switch 2 in the West. And, as a huge fan of the franchise, it's probably the most excited I've been for a new game from Falcom in some time. Daybreak's more-thoughtful and modern threads have really connected with me, and Van has become one of my favourite RPG protagonists in recent memory.</p>
<p>But, with Beyond the Horizon, we have another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_of_cold_steel_iv">Cold Steel IV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_into_reverie">Trails into Reverie</a> situation on our hands — a huge gathering of characters across the franchise all impacted by one big event. It really feels like the culmination of this gigantic series, and with the end steadily approaching, I was eager to reflect and look back with Falcom President and series producer Toshihiro Kondo.</p>
<p>What starts off as a chat about the newest game turned into a peek behind 20 years of history, from technological advancements (both narratively and in the world), the influence of real-world politics, and the potential of the Switch 2 for the series going forward. It's a long one, so grab a cup of coffee and settle in!</p>
<p><em>Note: There are a few spoilers about Trails into Reverie here, so if you haven't played that game or don't know the identity of a certain character yet, you might want to wait before diving in!</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Alana Hagues): Let's start with something very simple - can you set the scene for Trails Beyond the Horizon? How does it tie in with Van’s story and what can fans expect on a general level?</strong></p>
<div><p><strong>Toshihiro Kondo</strong><strong>, President of Falcom:</strong> For Trails Beyond the Horizon, it's essentially a sequel to Trails through Daybreak II, and takes place directly after it. While Daybreak 1 and 2 dealt with issues that were occurring within the Republic of Calvard, this time the scope broadens to not only include what’s happening in Calvard, but also to the continent itself. So the series finally opens up into these mysteries that have been at the core of what the continent is and what this world is overall.</p><p>

One of our main characters is Van still. Van will continue his work as a Spriggan, handling the things that he's done. And what he's acting upon is due to a lot of the events and connections that he made throughout the course of Daybreak 1 and 2. Whether that be connections in the government or connections in the Ouroboros Society, all of these people Van met are now going to come into play here as he looks to see what's going on with this event that's going to be happening in the course of this game in Calvard.</p></div>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2b89a072e3a6/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This event is a space program, which has been built up as a national project, and pretty much all of the events of this game have to do with what's going on with this space project. Without spoiling anything, we've been adding some teasers in there, that's kind of what's going on with this game.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big focuses for the series is the technological advancements across the games —</strong> <strong>now seems like a good time to ask, why space travel now? What do you think the importance is in the canon at this point? It's such a big leap from where we were 20 years ago to now.</strong></p>
<p>That’s a great question! And the answer to that is precisely what Trails Beyond the Horizon is all about. Why has technology advanced so much?</p>
<p>As you mentioned, we're 20 years out from the release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/legend_of_heroes_trails_in_the_sky">Trails in the Sky</a> (in Japan, at least), but if you look at the actual in-game timeline from Sky and what's happening now in Calvard, that's less than 10 years. It's a very short span of time. And so that's a really good observation — how did we go from airships to space?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. We've been planning this all along (laughs).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another one of the big mysteries of this world is Orbment and the powers that Orbment bestows upon the inhabitants of the world and how the world operates itself. These are also things that you can expect to see touched upon and explored, and begun to be unraveled in Trails Beyond the Horizon. If you look even at Trails in the Sky into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_from_zero">Trails from Zero</a>, you'll notice that technology gets a pretty big bump from those two games. For one thing, you've got what amounts to the internet in Crossbell, as well as what we could consider smartphones.</p>
<p>I’m sure a lot of the fans were probably thinking when these games originally were released, ‘oh, well, you're just hopping on current trends. This is what's happening in modern society, so this is what you're using as topics within the game to colour your world.’ No. We've been planning this all along (laughs). There's a lot here that we've been thinking about.</p>
<p>It's been many years since those games originally came out, now we can finally show the fans this has been part of the plan all along, and all of this is a very detailed plan for why technology has progressed as fast as it has</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Now I'm scared. (laughs)</strong> <strong>So</strong>, <strong>you touched on something in that t</strong><strong>his is the first game that's really “global” – you’ve got Van from Calvard, Rean from Erebonia, and Kevin from the Septian Church</strong>, <strong>all characters from across Zemuria. Why is the story of the continent now important?</strong></p>
<p>This answer is more from a game development perspective than from the more story-based thrust of your question…</p>
<p><strong>That’s totally fair! (laughs)</strong></p>
<p>In terms of Kevin specifically, he's part of the church, and his going to Calvard and doing what he does in this game has been flagged ever since his first appearance, and particularly in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/pc/legend_of_heroes_trails_in_the_sky_the_3rd">Sky The 3rd</a>. There's a lot going on with [the church] and their relationship to the world itself. And so it makes sense that you would have someone there for that.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6be8454dbb032/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of Rean, if you look at the end of his story from Cold Steel IV, and then look at one of the ending events in Trails into Reverie, his story also touches upon the heart of what's going on in this world. Given that Rean's been confronted with various issues, he's not the type of person to just ignore things and stay home in Erebonia. He's going to get involved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They need to be able to have these different experiences and meet these different people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the story were to take place solely through Van's eyes and minutely carry out all of these things that the story is trying to tell, it would be a ridiculously long game. It would end up killing the realism because he'd have to go to so many different places and meet so many different people and meet so many different things.</p>
<p>Choosing the direction we did to be able to tell this story covers a lot of the complexities of the nation of Calvard but also the overarching world as well, it necessitated us to have different routes so we could show all of these things concurrently. And all the more so, it wouldn't make sense for all the three of the characters to be similar to Van or to be in a situation to do what Van does. They need to be able to have these different experiences and meet these different people and these reasons for doing and going on the routes that they go on.</p>
<p>That's why the system was chosen of having multiple main characters, to be able to cover as cleanly as possible all of the events in the story that need to be covered and to also offer fresh perspective on the events that are taking place as being seen through the eyes of each different main character as we go through their roots.</p>
<p><strong>Right, and with Kevin in particular,</strong> <strong>this is the first time he's been playable</strong> <strong>since Trails in the Sky the 3rd as you brought up — there are a lot of people who won't even know who he is, which I feel really bad about because he's my favourite character (laughs).</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, what is it like revisiting a character like that after so long and</strong> <strong>putting him in the spotlight in this way?</strong></p>
<p>Good question (laughs) A hint for your answer lies in something that you pointed out, which is that Kevin is a member of the Septian Church. You can't expect someone who is jumping into Beyond the Horizon (as their first game) to fully grasp this organisation and the world it exists in. But if you are someone who has been playing the series at least for a few entries, you have an understanding of what the Septian Church is, at least on a superficial level. By having at least a superficial level of knowledge, that automatically places Kevin at a certain position in the players mind and their expectations.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac4de25fc0fb7/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The thing about Kevin is that at first glance he seems like a happy-go-lucky priest out there to do good and change the world for the better, but he has this very dark side to him too. These are things which we as developers paid careful attention to to kind of introduce or reintroduce to people throughout the course of the game.</p>
<p>For example, the group that Kevin works with in his story path is with Rufus from Cold Steel (and Reverie). And even though Kevin is a very senior member of the church who has authority and dignity and all these other things, he kind of gets given the runaround a lot by the people that he's dealt with. It's a really interesting balance between this dignity that he should have as a high member of a priest and what these characters are saying to him or making him do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are things that we're paying attention to when reviving this character</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the flip side, a lot of the interactions are written in a way, whether it be with Kevin and these characters or Kevin with other characters, that shows characters who this man is. Even though he has this very happy light side to him, there's also times when certain scenes necessitate him to have more of that darkness that we know that he has, that really serious side that occasionally has to get into given his role. These are things that we're paying attention to when reviving this character after he's not really been present in the series for so long (since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_to_azure">Azure</a>).</p>
<p>So, to kind of re-encapsulate that into something simple is first,to have players understand who the character is because of his role within the organisation that has already been introduced. And then second, to show through the interactions that he has with the other characters that he deals with in the game, these two sides of him as a character.</p>
<p><strong>There are so many characters at this point — how do you keep track of all of those personality changes and</strong> <strong>balance all of that together?</strong> <strong>Some we haven't seen for a long time, others are very new so we're still getting used to them. What's it like threading all of that together?</strong></p>
<p>It kind of comes down to the characters we want to show and the characters we want to introduce players to. How that works from a process standpoint is you create a character, particularly a main character, and then you think about that character in contrast to who they're paired with in their story.</p>
<p>To use Rean as an example; you've got a young man of few words, he's got this dark past about him, but he's also very serious. And he very much wants to get this job done, whatever that might be. And so around him, what kind of characters would you expect to see? How can they play off him? Are they different from him? How can they show these aspects of him that we've discussed? When creating these characters, it’s about how they can play off one another and how they're different from one another, that they get formed and created.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5755e4f8586d4/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond that, you have a larger role of who these characters are in this world. So, taking the three countries that we're most familiar with being, Erebonia (Cold Steel), the Kingdom of Liberl (Sky), and then the Republic of Calvard (Daybreak), what kinds of people would exist within these countries. In Liberl, you've got this very kind queen who's like a motherly figure to her people. How would the people in this country act? You've got Erebonia, which is a very strict class system with nobility and commoners. What kind of people would this give rise to?</p>
<p>Looking at what we have here now in the Republic of Calvard, it's a country made up of immigrants, of people from many different places. and that's how you're able to get characters like Feri or Aaron who are not Calvardian necessarily in terms of their race or ethnicity, but they are in this place. They contribute to this story and then being characterized against someone like Van, who is from Calvard, but he does the dirty work, right? He's got these sides to him which are very different than those around him and what came before. All of these things together are what creates the characters and how maybe not necessarily they keep track of them, but that's how they end up where they end up in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the series as a whole, one of the goals and ideas was to portray these very human problems and societal experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, you do bring up a good point when you say there are a lot of characters (laughs). This is something we’ve talked about internally on how to keep it manageable and reasonable and how to tell the stories that we want to tell without having these gigantic ballooning casts. We will continue to think about these things going forward when it comes to cast selection and who appears in games.</p>
<p><strong>To bounce off your point about Calvard, Trails feels extremely progressive and it feels like it's very much rolling with</strong> <strong>modern times and how society and politics and events are taking place in the real world. Do political or any kind of real events ever influence the story at all?</strong></p>
<p>For the series as a whole, one of the goals and ideas was to portray these very human problems and societal experiences. The thing is because many of the settings of the games veered more towards fantasy or something that felt divorced from reality, it probably didn't hit as hard as you would expect.</p>
<p>Now, looking at Calvard, that allowed us to do something different because the setting is so close to what is happening or modern day, We knew from the beginning because it's introduced in Sky that Calvard is a country that has lots of immigrants, a melting pot and made up of all these different people. However, that's where we left it in our minds (laughs) and we didn't really think about the details of Calvard at that point in time.</p>
<p>What really caused us to think about what Calvard was and who it's comprised of and the issues that it has is when we started making Erebonia. Calvard stands in direct contrast to each other when it comes to the societies that Erebonia have and the worlds Erebonians inhabit. So a lot of the guiding principles that caused Erebonia to be developed with its ideas and goals and issues, all that is reflected in Calvard. And that just kind of necessarily made it more of a realistic thing.</p>
<p>To more directly answer your question, absolutely real life events are referenced throughout. I thought it would be interesting to cover these types of topics, because many the staff who created this series 20 years ago are still here, particularly the core writing team. Over the course of 20 years as we've gotten older, and as we've begun to look at the world differently, and we have different outlooks on things and different things to say about what's happening in our world. And that gets reflected within the work itself on purpose.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d8965f4f13276/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last but not least, particularly in regards to immigration and racism, as a country Japan is not really known for having a bunch of people who are not Japanese inhabiting it. However, due to some recent initiatives by the Japanese government, the country is becoming more open and welcoming to people who are not originally Japanese. And because more and more people are coming into Japan, that creates a new society for Japanese people as well, and new issues that we've never encountered before.</p>
<p>We thought this would be an interesting thing to also explore in the Calvard games, something that we as Japanese people ourselves might be facing in the not too distant future. So yeah, all of these things that you touched upon, the real world does absolutely impact the writing, and we do want to make specific commentary or at least explore what's happening in the world through the events of the game and the societies and the people and the things that are depicted there.</p>
<p><strong>So I guess going along with the core team evolving along with the games, how has it been continuing to watch the world that everyone wrote down and dreamt up and all these characters grow up over 20 years?</strong> <strong>How do you continue a 20-year process like that?</strong></p>
<p>That’s a good question – I wonder how we do continue! (laughs)</p>
<p>So the interesting thing about the genesis of this whole world to begin with is one of practicality. At the time, if you look at the previous <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> games (<strong>Dragon Slayer</strong>, the <strong>Gagharv</strong> trilogy) that were pixel art. All of them depict a world; there was one whole world per game.</p>

<p>When game development and graphic design shifted to 3D, that greatly limited what we could do asset-wise. We were no longer able to create an entire world for one specific game. So the idea became between me and my co-worker, <em>"what if we can't depict the whole world maybe we can depict a country instead"</em>. So why don't we have a story about a country and then why don't we find out how this country connects to another country that would be in the same world but wouldn't be depicted in one single game.</p>
<p>As I started planning this some of the older people in the company were like, <em>"you guys are getting way ahead of yourselves here"</em> (laughs) <em>"</em><em>Why don't you try making one game first before you develop all these grand plans for things".</em> So this became a challenge to see what you could with what you essentially call limited resources to be able to work within this framework of telling the story of not a world now but a country, continuing that story in the next game in a different country within the world</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally, this was only meant to be three parts, and by parts I mean games:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That has what's become our motivation these last 20 years, to finish what we started. All of these games do take place in one world and they're all connected to one another by virtue of this fact and by virtue of the fact there being an overarching story that does connect everything. That's the real motivation now. That's what keeps us going. And that's how you keep a series going, is just this desire to finish what you started.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever think you would make it this far?</strong></p>
<p>No, I’m surprised too! (laughs) Originally, this was only meant to be three parts, and by parts I mean games: Liberl, then Erebonia, and then Calvard. That was it.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of creating Trails in the Sky [after three years], the president came up to us and said, <em>“okay, you guys have been working on this game for quite a while now. How close to completion are you here?”</em> And we said, <em>“we're about halfway through.”</em> He responded, <em>“great, release what you have, I don't care.”</em> So that's why Sky is divided into two parts.</p>
<p>The plan had started to fall apart because what was supposed to be one game is now two games. So what we had to do afterwards is create a game in a quicker span of time for the company to get it out there, which is obviously what became Sky the 3rd.</p>
<p>Logically, our next move would have been to make Erebonia. But I thought, <em>“well, no, we can't really go into this big area of Erebonia first. We need to think of something else first to lead into this a little bit better."</em> So that’s where Crossbell (Zero/Azure) came from.</p>
<p>But the thing about Crossbell is that it was only supposed to be one game as this bridge, which of course ended up being two games. Then we reach Erebonia and we start working on it. Only supposed to be two games. We figured at this point, it was gonna take at least two games to finish this part of the story. Yet that eventually turned into four games. And now here we are in Calvard and the story continues.</p>
<p>But no, never in my wildest dreams would I have expected this to be continuing and I never expected for things to turn out as they have in terms of how each location which was originally supposed to be one game is now multiple game-spanning arcs.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, I'll ask a sillier question in terms of evolution next.</strong> <strong>When you see character designs over the years, do you ever look at the new one and go “oh wow, I wish they’d looked this cool earlier!”?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah! There’s definitely things that you look at and think “oh, this is really cool now”, but the truth is that whenever a game is released, we believe we’re releasing the best we can do at that time period. What you can see throughout the course of the history, not specifically for Trails but for all of our titles, is you can hopefully see us having improved and gotten better both in terms of art and then graphics as well. So things that were not able to have been done in the past have been able to do now</p>
<p>Within this also, you've got just visual trends, you know, what was cool 20 years ago is not necessarily cool or on trend for today. Sure there are things that you maybe think are cooler now compared to what you did before, but that doesn't change the idea that what's being released at the time is the best for that given time.</p>
<p>There's also some things as cool as a change might be, there's some lines that you can't cross, specifically when it comes to certain aspects of character design or what he would call like a silhouette. The character needs to have a specific look. Again, using Rean as an example, kind of a slim man who always has his katana at his side. You know who this character is. These are things which are visual clues and signs for the players to know who this character is.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3bbca1649e10a/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this together is just, it's essentially just evolution. I'm pretty proud of what we're releasing, whether it be in terms of character design itself or graphics as well.</p>
<p><strong>So another thing that has</strong> <strong>evolved is the combat. T</strong><strong>urn-based has always been like the core of Trails, and there's been a lot of discussion recently about turn-based combat and RPGs. Are you always conscious to keep turn-based combat in the series, and how have you looked to progress that, even outside of the real-time additions?</strong></p>
<p>The reason you have the turn-based combat battle system goes back to the very beginning, before the games even released in the West. This is a story-first series and these are story-first games. The general trend, at least in Japan at the time, was for story-based games to be turn-based. What that does is that essentially allows the players to take the game at their own pace and not have to feel pressure because of all this frantic action that they constantly have to worry about. Players can slowly go from place to place, enjoying the game and enjoying the world that's been created.</p>
<p>It also has to do with the DNA of the series itself, because the series itself does have a group of turn-based predecessors to it for the most part.</p>
<p>Also within Falcom's catalogue, you have the <strong>Ys</strong> series, which is in direct contrast as an action series. There's plenty of fans of the Ys series and plenty of fans of the Trails series, but people played what they wanted to play in terms of, "I like action," okay, you play Ys. "I like story focused," well, then you should play Trails. There was a little bit of overlap, but by and large, those groups were pretty separate from one another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we wondered how we could incorporate elements that made things move a little quicker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, over the course of developing the Trails series, we didn’t want things to become stale and as people became more used to the games, we wondered how we could incorporate elements that made things move a little quicker.</p>
<p>One of the issues that you encounter when it comes to command-based systems is that some think it's slow. You'll notice improvements come incrementally. In the two Crossbell games, you've got a little bit of field actions, where you can hit the enemy and then you'll start the battle. That kind of makes it a little bit more engaging, a little bit more active.</p>
<p>Moving into the Cold Steel series, that actually gets quite a bit more advanced in terms of positioning behind the enemies and what you can do on the field outside of the combat itself, but leading into the combat. So it finally culminates in Trails Through Daybreak, which is of course a hybrid battle system containing both the action RPG and the turn-based RPGs.</p>
<p>However, we were really careful because of this trend of players who still preferred the more methodical approach of turn-based combat. We wanted to make the action combat simple and unobtrusive so far as if someone didn't want to engage it, that they didn't have to. So you'll note that the combat system outside of the turn-based combat system is pretty simple for Daybreak 1. And even though there are some additions in Daybreak 2, it's kind of a refinement; just a little bit is added, and the player can still choose to engage with it if they want.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the forthcoming Trails Beyond the Horizon; feeling that probably people have at least played Daybreak 1 and 2, we thought we could add a little bit more and so we've made the action system even more robust. There's a system called Awakening — it makes the combat feel even more quick, even more responsive. You can now cast arts on the field like you could in Daybreak, but it's also been refined so it makes this whole action system a really big part of what the game is and slowly acclimates people who might not be so familiar with it.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dbb3747a2b284/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>By the same token, the turn-based element is always going to be there being part of the DNA, but that doesn't mean that because we wanted to have a more exciting action element that the turn-based side has been neglected. Rather, you'll see that the turn-based system has been iterated upon too, particularly in the forthcoming Horizon, there's many buffs that you can do, things that are unique and new that also further make the turn-based combat engaging and interesting as well. So it really is this nice balance of both of them.</p>
<p><strong>Trails Beyond the Horizon will be the first Trails game on the Nintendo Switch 2; at what point did you decide to release a Switch 2-specific version, and why was it important to release it on the new console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NIS America:</strong> We felt it was important to release the title on Nintendo Switch 2 as many fans have been following our releases on Nintendo Switch, and we believe that those who have bought a Nintendo Switch 2 will be eager to play this title on it.</p>
<p><strong>What new opportunities</strong> <strong>does the Switch 2 bring for the Trails series?</strong></p>
<p>Kondo: The biggest thing obviously is the specs; such a big element of [Horizon] is the action, the specs being as they were [on Switch 1] it was very difficult to, you know, provide a positive or really good experience with that. Working with NIS America to be able to create a Switch 2 version, you know, that gets ameliorated and that makes it better now for the players</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can expect to see the Trails series on the Switch 2 going forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, what this means for us going forward is that, yes, we do want to make sure that the games are on the Switch 2. And now, because we're more understanding of the specs and the capabilities that it has, we don't have to worry about that necessarily during development. And we can put it through its paces, as it were, to be able to release the types of games that we want that contain the elements that we want it to contain. You can expect to see the Trails series on the Switch 2 going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain the decision to release the game as a Game-Key Card on the Switch 2 and not a full physical release?</strong></p>
<p>NIS America: We decided to release this title as a Game-Key Card on the Nintendo Switch 2 as we believed it was the most beneficial option for our customers.</p>

It’s not the only device hoping to capitalize on N64 nostalgia this year, though. Analogue announced its own years ago and the Analogue 3D <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-ship-date-delay-tariff-1851786334&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-ship-date-delay-tariff-1851786334">is finally getting ready to ship beginning next month</a></span>, though it will cost $50 more than the M64. </p><p>That’s right, there will soon be at least two FGPA-based N64 tributes on the market. Nintendo now has the chance to do the funniest thing and finally release its own N64 classic fans have long requested. While diehard enthusiasts will still opt for more premium alternatives, it would save everyone else who just wants to recreate that old Christmas morning fun with a few rounds of Mario Kart a lot of money. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>EA has unveiled the first trailer for Battlefield 6. While the two-minute trailer was more cinematics than actual gameplay, it sets a grim tone for the next installment.</p><p>The trailer begins with the US president giving a conference discussing a “dark day” in the country’s history after suffering a mysterious, unprovoked attack. We then see cinematic, in-engine footage of locations like New York City embroiled in all-out war, suggesting the conflict will at least partially unfold on American soil.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>According to a press release, Battlefield 6’s single-player campaign centers on a private military corporation called Pax Armata. Funded by former NATO states, this force threatens to ignite a global conflict.</p><p>“In Battlefield 6, the series’ incredible blend of visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom returns,” reads the press release. "Blow through walls and bring down buildings for a tactical advantage or take to the skies in white-knuckle dogfights. Take part in a war filled with tanks, fighter jets, and sweeping combat at a grand scale but remember: the deadliest weapon is your squad.”</p><p>Today’s trailer ended with a teaser for the reveal of the game’s multiplayer content one week later on July 31. Billed as “The biggest moment in Battlefield history” in the press release, the designers at Battlefield Studios (which consists of developers from multiple studios such as DICE, Criterion Games, Motive Studios, and Ripple Effect) will discuss the suite of new and returning multiplayer modes, showcase the game’s maps, and broadcast the first multiplayer matches played by content creators.</p><p>Battlefield 6 does not yet have a release date or announced platforms.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/battlefield-6-gets-debut-trailer-multiplayer-reveal-set-for-july-31]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A book containing the video game scripts for both of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us games, including the first game's Left Behind DLC, is being released.</p>
<p>The tome itself has the very appropriate title The Last of Us: Part 1 and Part 2 Scripts, and is coming from the games' developer Naughty Dog in collaboration with Dark Horse Books. It will be released on 16th December, though pre-orders are open now via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506751326?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=sec2002-20">Amazon US</a> for $66.63. I have popped a message over to Sony to get clarification on UK availability and pricing.</p>
<p>"Relive every climactic moment in The Last of Us: Part 1 and Part 2 Scripts, from Joel and Ellie's time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie's joy while petting giraffes, to Joel's heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies' hospital in The Last of Us Part 1. Then, dive into The Last of Us Part 2's dual-perspective story, including Abby's shocking introduction, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby," reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Along with the scripts, this book will also include a forward from Troy Baker, who among other roles voices Joel in the Last of Us games, as well as an art gallery with work by principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, and a cover with new art and block printing along the pages edges which have been designed to evoke "the franchise's iconic Cordyceps fungus" (see below).</p>

<p>"At its beginning, The Last of Us was a series of philosophical themes - grief, unconditional love, the relentless pursuit of justice - waiting to be shaped into a story," the Last of Us' creator Neil Druckmann said, via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-last-of-us-book-scripts-video-game-1236468201/">Variety</a>. "These scripts, written during the games' development, were meant to guide our team as we brought that world to life. They were never intended for public view - until now. For the first time, we're sharing them with you - hoping this rare glimpse brings you even closer to the heart of Joel, Ellie, Abby, and the world they inhabit."</p>
<p>Halley Gross, who co-wrote The Last of Us Part 2 with Druckmann, added: "Neil and I had the honour of leading this story, but the truth is, it only exists because of the remarkable team at Naughty Dog. Every moment was built by people who bring their full hearts and talent to the table. This compilation is a tribute to the studio and a celebration of what's possible when we create together."</p>
<p>Naughty Dog is really getting quite a bit of mileage out of its The Last of Us games. Along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">TV adaptation</a>, the developer also in the last couple of years has debuted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">souped-up PlayStation 5 Part 2 Remastered release</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">PC version of The Last of Us Part 2</a> (which followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-last-of-us-part-1-on-pc-what-we-think-so-far">PC release</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-the-last-of-us-part-1-the-digital-foundry-tech-review">remastered release</a> of the first game in the series).</p>
<p>The team also recently issued an update for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-play-the-last-of-us-part-2-in-yet-another-way-as-naughty-dog-releases-chronological-mode">allows you to play through the game in chronological order</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-want-yet-another-way-to-experience-the-last-of-us-games-theres-a-new-script-book-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and the Battlefield Studios group has fully announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, the next game in the long-running first person shooter series, but they did so with a cinematic trailer while teasing a multiplayer reveal for next week.</p>
<p>The Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal will take place on 31st July, one week from now. At that point we might also get word of a release date for the game – something which has been leaked/rumoured in the last few days to be coming in October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From that, we can draw that everything within the announcement trailer was in-engine and more indicative of the single player campaign that is being developed by Criterion and Motive Studios. The trailer opens with an obscured President of the United States speaking from the White House podium about an unprovoked attack on Europe, the US and NATO by a private military group known as Pax Armata.</p>
<p>Here’s the trailer blurb:</p>

<p>Witness the vicious path of destruction carved by Pax Armata, the world’s leading private military company. PAX pursues the destruction of NATO and its allies, stopping at nothing to uphold their motto: “Our Protection, Your Peace.”</p>
<p>Lock &amp; load for the ultimate all-out warfare experience. Fight in high-intensity infantry combat. Rip through the skies in aerial dogfights. Demolish your environment for a strategic advantage. In a war of tanks, fighter jets, and massive combat arsenals, your squad is the deadliest weapon. This is Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Little is known about who Pax Armata is, but from pre-announcement teasers, they seem to be backed by a growing coalition of other nations. Careful not to step on certain countries’ toes, this isn’t being labelled as a particular nation at this time, and is instead the “Pax Armata Mercenaries”.</p>
<p>Following this we get a look at a broad spectrum of Battlefield-like scenarios. There’s cinematic moments with characters calling in military strikes, angrily slapping tables and more, but there’s also paratroopers jumping from planes, there’s beach landing craft coming out of carriers, there’s rocket artillery, there’s dams blowing up and more. It builds up until parts of New York are getting blown up.</p>
<p>The next Battlefield is in development under the collective brand Battlefield Studios, which encapsulates Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios. With the launch of Battlefield Labs playtesting earlier this year, we got a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s clearly an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG.</p>
<p>The thing that has been most controversial, though, is whether or not weapons will be locked to classes or not. I guess we’ll find out about that in 7 days…</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-acknowledges-performance-issues-patch-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-developer-%E2%80%9Cdeeply-regret-s-%E2%80%9D-and-acknowledges-performance-issues-a-patch-is-coming-as-soon-as-possible.1252347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched yesterday, at the time of this writing, and in what seems to be a required milestone in the launch of any major title, it has done so with a number of performance issues. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">a new statement</a> from developer Leenzee Games, the studio acknowledges the reports it has received from players regarding performance problems and a few other issues with "<em>abnormal pricing</em>" and pre-order errors.</p>



<p>After thanking players who have supported the game and were there to play it on launch, Leenzee Games wrote that it has "<em>received reports regarding issues such as the game’s optimization not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>These problems should never have occurred,</em>" it continued, "<em>and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games adds that it is "<em>confident in the game's performance</em>" so long as your PC is within the studio's recommended technical specifications, but it is working on optimizing the game for the variety of PC builds out there. It also confirms that a patch is being worked on, and that Leenzee will release it "<em>as soon as we can</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games also quickly touches on "<em>pricing anomalies</em>" in some regions where the game is being sold, and just says that it is trying to work with Steam to ensure that the correct price is listed in every region. </p>



<p>Lastly, Leenzee Games addresses reports of players not getting promised pre-order rewards, an issue it also says will be fixed in its next patch. And as a sign of appreciation for its players, everyone who purchased the game on Steam is getting a free copy of the game's soundtrack. If you bought the deluxe version of the game on Steam, then you'll also be getting a brand-new costume in a future update, as another token of the studio's appreciation for your support.</p>



<p>A free copy of the soundtrack and new in-game cosmetics is nice and all, but what players want is for the game they purchased to run smoothly. Of the 8,000+ player reviews for WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash">only 21% of them are positive</a>, with pretty much every negative review citing major performance problems. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">Francesco De Meo looked at WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers for his review</a>, he also cited performance issues as a key drawback of the game, and while it has a strong art style and some engaging combat elements, the performance problems aren't the only things players have to worry about in Fallen Feathers. </p>



<p>"<em>Uninspired level design, mediocre PC performance and a formula that relies a little too much on the genre's conventions hold the experience back a bit, making it worthwhile only for fans of the genre who haven't had enough of it, and are willing to look past some shortcomings.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/712627/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-vtuber-twitch-youtube</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-vtuber-world-is-in-crisis-over-%E2%80%98owed%E2%80%99-donations.1252344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>On July 21st, 6,669-year-old demon queen Ironmouse posted an 11-minute video, explaining that <a href="https://youtu.be/MwLbGcUMy6g?si=DmgFvaaqceo4XGaw">she is leaving her talent management agency, VShojo</a>. Ironmouse is a VTuber, or “virtual YouTuber,” which is a type of a streamer who doesn’t usually show their human face and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/vtuber-agencies-virtual-idols-global-streaming-superstars-1235387390/">creates elaborate digital personas to make content</a> instead.</p></div><p>“I recently found out that for the past couple of months, I have been misled by VShojo,” she said in her video. “I believe that I am owed a significant amount of funds, which I have not been paid.”</p><p>With her pink hair, purple eyes, and horns, Ironmouse is one of Twitch’s biggest streamers. She currently has more than 2.3 million followers on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ironmouse">Twitch</a> and 1.3 million subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IronMouseParty">YouTube</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/ironmouse-wins-content-creator-of-the-year-at-the-game-awards-2023/">she won a Game Award for content creator of the year</a>. A year later, she briefly overtook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/4/23820637/kai-cenat-ps5-giveaway-nyc-union-square">Kai Cenat</a> as the most subscribed to Twitch streamer, with more than 300,000 subs. Her VTuber colleagues at VShojo have follower counts in the hundreds of thousands across Twitch and YouTube. Now, in the aftermath of Ironmouse’s video, most of them have also quit the company, with some of them also alleging unpaid wages.</p><p>According to Ironmouse, her trouble with VShojo started with the conclusion of her 2024 subscription marathon on Twitch. During the event, Ironmouse raised more than $500,000 for the Immune Deficiency Foundation, a cause she explained was important to her as she — the real person behind the Ironmouse persona — suffers from common variable immunodeficiency, or CVID.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to VShojo, Ironmouse, and the Immune Deficiency Foundation for comment.</p><p>“Because the money came from my Twitch revenue … it required VShojo to make the donation on my behalf,” Ironmouse said in her video. She claims this has not been done and that’s why she’s decided to leave VShojo:</p><div><blockquote><p>“And most importantly, the thing that hurts me the most is that the Immune Deficiency Foundation, which is the most important charity to me and also the reason why I’m here today, is owed over half a million dollars from VShojo … I really want to tell you everything, but unfortunately right now I have been instructed by my attorney to wait for more of the legal procedure to unfold. So one day I will be able to tell you the full story. But for now, I just need to let you know that I will no longer be a part of VShojo.“</p></blockquote></div><p>“As of right now, I am an independent VTuber,” she said.</p><p>While a creator leaving a talent agency is nothing new, especially in the world of VTubers, the scope and scale of this departure has had a serious impact on both VShojo and the wider VTuber community. In the hours after Ironmouse released her video, 12 of the 13 VTubers listed on VShojo’s website have officially announced they are leaving the company.</p><div><p>On July 22nd, <a href="https://www.vshojo.com/talent/kson">Kson</a>, a yakuza-themed VTuber with 1.3 million followers on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cBxw80mZoWI?si=x7vX9CYX3FfbM7bs">did a livestream in which she announced that she, too, would be leaving the company</a>, also alleging unpaid funds.</p></div><p>“And the reason why is because VShojo hasn’t paid a significant amount of money to me,” Kson said.</p><p>Most of the other VShojo members, who said they were leaving on their livestreams and social media, did not give explicit reasons why, suggesting that they aren’t able to due to legal reasons. Nearly all of them expressed heartbreak related to their departure and shock at Ironmouse’s treatment.</p><p>“Yes, I’m leaving VShojo,” <a href="https://x.com/ProjektMelody/status/1947667567440761307">Projekt Melody posted on X</a>. “I put my everything into this comp[any]. But I’m beyond devastated at what happened. &amp; I never in a million years thought I’d be saying these words.”</p><p>When VShojo was founded in 2020, it positioned itself as ”talent first” as a way to differentiate itself from other companies that had reputations <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24065311/vtuber-selen-tatsuki-nijisanji-termination-dokibird">for treating talent poorly</a>. This attracted popular VTubers and huge numbers of fans.</p><p>VTubers operate similarly to Twitch streamers but can have extra expectations and constraints set upon them if they are corporately sponsored by talent agencies. To understand VTubers, it’s best to think of them as digital Japanese pop idols. Almost every aspect of a corporate VTuber — their sponsorships, social media accounts, finances, name, and more — is owned and controlled by their agency. In most circumstances, if a VTuber decides to go independent, then they have to leave every aspect of their persona behind, including all the channels attached to that persona, and start over from scratch. VShojo stood out as a company because its clients were not beholden to those terms.</p><p>“I’m actually shocked,” said Biggles, an artist and independent VTuber, who told <em>The Verge</em> that she’s been a fan of VShojo talent since the company’s beginning. “VShojo was a dream for many.”</p><p>Ironmouse’s dream for the Immune Deficiency Foundation lives on, however. After posting her announcement video as her usual persona, <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse">she initiated a donation drive to replace the allegedly unpaid funds</a>.

But the Twitch star is part of a far bigger industry that spans various countries, cultures, and languages. According to a May 2025 report from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streams Charts and VSTATS</a></span>, the international VTubing landscape continues to grow quarter-over-quarter. While Japanese VTubers dominate the industry’s upper echelons, English-language VTubing is a core niche in the contemporary market. Meaning, if you’re interested in VTubing, now is the perfect time to start streaming.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Just don’t end up sticker shocked. Ordering your very own custom-made Live2D VTuber, or a 2D VTuber rigged to match a performer’s movements and facial expressions, can cost thousands of dollars. Many 3D VTuber commissions start around $1,000, with some high-end models reaching similar prices as their 2D counterparts. Make no mistake: The artists, riggers, modelers, and animators who make VTubing shine deserve every penny for their hard work. They are the backbone of this industry. But for newcomers interested in VTubing, it’s ill-advised to drop a couple grand on your first model. Cutting your teeth on something relatively inexpensive is best.</p><p>Luckily, VTubing is more accessible now than ever before. Plenty of pre-made models exist at an affordable price, allowing newcomers to express themselves creatively without breaking the bank. Programs like VRoid Studio even offer free model creation. And when in doubt, you can always throw a few images together and get started as a PNGTuber. Read on to learn the best ways to become a VTuber today.

You’ll want an avatar base</h2><p>While 3D VTubing is popular in its own right, many new VTubers are drawn to the field because they want to stream as a 2D anime character. However, commissioning a bespoke Live2D model can be expensive. Luckily, there’s a relatively affordable way to get started as a 2D VTuber. You can purchase an avatar base and then customize it to your liking.</p><p>Avatar bases are special models created with a wide assortment of modifiable hair, face, eye, and clothing options.

Yes, this is literally a form of VTubing where you create content with image files. It’s incredibly simple to get started: Just draw a few images, hook them together with a PNGTuber program, and you’re done. I highly recommend this format for illustrators and digital artists unfamiliar with rigging or 3D modeling. Creating your own PNGTuber doubles as an advertisement for your artistic skills.</p><p>Using luna olmewe’s free program <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">veadotube mini</a></span>, you can create your very own PNGTuber with ease. Simply fire up the software, go to the right-hand side, and select different image files that depict your VTuber with their mouth opened, closed, or while blinking in either state. You can then customize how your character moves when standing still or speaking. Make sure the correct microphone is selected, and you’re done! When you speak, your new PNGTuber will open their mouth. You’re officially ready to plug your new VTuber into your broadcasting program of choice.</p><p>Anywhere from two to four images will suffice for your PNGTuber. And for those who aren’t artistically inclined, have no fear. Many artists offer PNGTuber commissions starting at approximately $50 – a perfect option if you’re looking for a more boutique experience without breaking the bank.

Even while it’s spun off into various licensed products, the series has continued to maintain this line and, unless you’re a superfan of one of the franchised versions available, these remain the best place to start.</p><p id="battle-of-legends-vol-1"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Battle of Legends Vol. 1">Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 1</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225691"><div id="225691" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 1</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It speaks to the strength of the series as a whole that <strong>the very first set that launched it all is still the best place to start for most players</strong>. You get four characters from a diverse range of global mythology: King Arthur, Sinbad, Medusa and Alice, of wonderland fame. Each has a unique playstyle which fits their background, with Alice able to turn from small to big for different bonuses, for example, while King Arthur can sacrifice his cards for super-powerful sword attacks.</p></div><p id="battle-of-legends-vol-2"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Battle of Legends Vol. 2">Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 2</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225695"><div id="225695" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time Volume 2 came out, Unmatched as a whole had diversified strongly, so the designers had to dig deep to find some new play angles for the four included characters. The results are great, but not necessarily the best place to start out as they’re a bit off-the-wall and require some extra rules to learn. Sun Wukong, the trickster Monkey King, can create clones of himself to harass other players while urban Legend Bloody Mary gets extra actions as long as she’s holding at least three cards. It is, however, a great addition to a burgeoning collection.</p></div><p id="cobble-fog"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Cobble &amp; Fog">Unmatched - Cobble &amp; Fog</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225696"><div id="225696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Cobble &amp; Fog</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>While this might not be the best place to begin your Unmatched collection, as some of the characters take a bit of experience to handle, Cobble &amp; Fog is probably the best box overall in the entire series</strong>. It features fighters from Victorian gothic fiction: Dracula, Dr Jekyll (and of course Mr Hyde), Sherlock Holmes and the Invisible Man. Not only is this an inspiring selection of very popular characters but they’re also well-balanced, with each bringing out their theme superbly during play, as we discussed during our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-cobble-and-fog-board-game-review"><u>review of Cobble &amp; Fog</u></a>.</p></div><p id="slings-and-arrows"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Slings and Arrows">Unmatched - Slings and Arrows</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225697"><div id="225697" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Slings and Arrows</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the newest sets in the series also has potentially the most surprising source, drawing as it does on the works of Shakespeare. It feels unlikely that the bard ever imagined what might happen if The Three Witches from Macbeth, Hamlet, Titania, and Shakespeare himself ever fought a pitched battle in his home base of the Globe Theatre, London, but now you can find out for yourself if you’ve a mind. It’s a really fun set but it’s also a bit too crazy for beginners, with the Witches throwing cards into brewing a potion and Shakespeare counting words on his cards to keep in iambic pentameter.</p></div><p id="unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze">Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225698"><div id="225698" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tales to Amaze is an outlier in the Unmatched world as it’s designed as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> experience, where players take a motley mix of fictional and real-world characters from a supercharged version of Nikolai Tesla to mythical flatboat captain Annie Christmas, and team up against either the Mothman or a Martian invasion. It works surprisingly well as a cooperative game thanks to tons of variety in enemy movement and minions and, as a bonus, you can also use the included characters in traditional competitive Unmatched too, although you’ll need a board from one of the other base sets to do so. It’s unusual enough that we gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze-board-game-review"><u>Tales to Amaze a full review rundown</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Witcher</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The series’ newest franchise is a biggie: the Witcher universe made famous by CD Projekt Red’s hugely popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-witcher">series of video games</a>. If you’re one of its legions of fans, these adaptations will do you proud and you can jump straight in. But since this edition contains three characters rather than the four in older sets, those previous boxes represent better value.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-steel-silver"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver">Unmatched - The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225699"><div id="225699" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the better of the two Witcher sets released so far, not least because it includes the titular Witcher, Geralt of Rivia himself, a powerful melee character who you can customize to some extent to suit your playstyle. He’s accompanied by Ciri, who can chain “source” cards to escalate effects, making for tough choices as to what order to play things in, and by The Ancient Leshen who has a terrifying card that transforms him into crows, allowing him to move anywhere on the board.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-realms-fall"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Witcher: Realms Fall">Unmatched - The Witcher: Realms Fall</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225700"><div id="225700" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - The Witcher: Realms Fall</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Without Geralt, this box has to fall back on the famous sorceresses of the series, Philippa Eilhart, Triss Merigold and Yennefer of Vengerburg, except the latter two are presented as one character in a kind of double act: you can choose which is the main character and which is the sidekick. All have a varied and powerful mix of cards, as befits sorcerers from the Witcher world. Rounding out the set is the head of the Wild Hunt Eredin, a brutal close-combat fighter with powerful attacks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As if just having the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">Marvel</a> franchise wasn’t enough, these sets also change the formula of basic Unmatched by including item tokens. These are placed randomly on the board and provide minor boosts to the player that picks them up. Vanilla boards were the only weak points in the series so this is a good change, but it’s perhaps less well-suited for newcomers, especially since, again, these sets all have three characters instead of four.</p></div><p id="marvel-redemption-row"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Redemption Row">Unmatched: Marvel - Redemption Row</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225701"><div id="225701" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Redemption Row</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The best of the Marvel boxes is Redemption Row</strong>. Of its three heroes, Ghost Rider has hellfire-powered movement while Luke Cage is well-nigh invulnerable without some smart cardplay to get around his booster defences and Moon Knight rotates through different powers as he responds to the changing lunar phases. They’re all fun characters, well balanced out of the box and fun to pit head to head.</p></div><p id="marvel-brains-and-brawn"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Brains and Brawn">Unmatched: Marvel - Brains and Brawn</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225702"><div id="225702" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Brains and Brawn</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Of all the Marvel sets this one probably has the most popular selection of characters</strong>. Spider-Man uses his spider-sense to force your opponent to show their played combat cards before you respond. She-Hulk has a mass of hit points and can discard cards to damage opponents and, last but certainly not least, Doctor Strange relies on a very fun and varied deck of spell effects to mess with his enemies. </p></div><p id="marvel-for-king-and-country"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - For King and Country">Unmatched: Marvel - For King and Country</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225703"><div id="225703" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - For King and Country</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Get the Avengers assembling with this box. Black Widow has a very unusual approach that sees her playing mission cards from among her hand, with requirements she can then fulfil for an extra bonus. Black Panther’s suit lets him steal cards from other players, and the Winter Soldier has enormously powerful card effects, many of which come with a downside as a result of his tortured psyche. </p></div><p id="marvel-hells-kitchen"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Hell's Kitchen">Unmatched: Marvel - Hell's Kitchen</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225704"><div id="225704" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Hell's Kitchen</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hell’s Kitchen features some of Marvel’s shadier characters. Bullseye is a ranged monster, able to strike from an extended distance and with cards that can have extra effects when you win combat. Daredevil has a fraught and exciting push your luck element but Elektra lets the side down a bit with her resurrect mechanic: she’s still fun to play but doesn’t feel as varied or as interesting as the other two inclusions.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Two-Figure Sets</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the bigger boxes, Unmatched also offers smaller sets that only have two fighters. In theory these should be a cheaper entry point into the system but in practice, stock shortages mean they can cost you as much as a full base game set. </p></div><p id="robin-hood-vs-big-foot"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Robin Hood vs. Big Foot">Unmatched - Robin Hood vs. Big Foot</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225705"><div id="225705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Robin Hood vs. Big Foot</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The cage match of the century that you never knew you wanted, both these characters are really interesting to play. Robin Hood has a unique hit and run style, supported by a band of merry men, while Bigfoot gets to draw extra cards if he’s alone in a zone at the end of the turn. This makes them good complimentary opponents but they also work well integrated into other sets.</p></div><p id="suns-origin"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Sun’s Origin">Unmatched - Sun’s Origin</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225706"><div id="225706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Sun’s Origin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This set offers two historical Japanese characters. Tomoe Gozen is a ranged and highly mobile character, who matches well against Oda Nobunaga’s ability to boost friendly melee characters. Both are hard to master so, together with the castle board and its interesting split-level setup, this is a better addition for seasoned Unmatched collectors than newcomers.</p></div><p id="houdini-vs-the-genie"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Houdini vs. The Genie">Unmatched: Houdini vs. The Genie</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225707"><div id="225707" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Houdini vs. The Genie</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A legendary magician faces off against a very famous fake magician in this pairing. Neither is especially inspiring: Houdini is presented as a melee fighter, for some reason, who can use boost cards to pop up around the board, while the Genie can discard cards to take extra actions for some super-powered turns.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 24, 2025 1:58 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-board-game-expansions-buying-guide]]></content:encoded>
