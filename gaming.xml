            <p>Each army in Warhammer 40,000 has its own codex containing rules, lore, and nice pictures, and The Leagues Of Votann's - the game's contemporary space dwarves - was out of date before a single model was available to buy. Advance copies went out, people noticed that the rules were horribly broken, more people noticed that the rules were actually massively, horribly, absurdly broken, and the company issued an apology, pulling out their <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2CjuqDSg/leagues-of-votann-balance-update-a-word-from-james-workshop/">cutesy 'James Workshop' moniker</a> in an attempt to aw shucks the fact they'd just sold everyone some very expensive hardback kindling. They later issued some rules errata, and they're supposedly in a more sensible spot now, even if doing anything interesting with them visually is confined, as per, <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Grendl-Grendlsen-Squat-Bounty-Hunter-2018">to Necromunda</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to bet money on it, I'd guess they won't be nearly as broken in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2</a> when they appear as potential allies or foes for both the Ad-mech and Necron playable factions. That's because difficulty balance was one of the major problems holding the original Mechanicus back from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> greatness (the game was later patched), so I imagine it being at the forefront of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a> Studio's mind this time. Decide for yourself by observing the trailer below. How many busted tokens do these dwarves have in their beards?</p>

<p>If you skipped the first Mechanicus, it was notable for a couple of things: an absurdly entertaining action economy that let your late game popebots sweep maps without stopping for breath (do Ad-mech breathe?) and a soundtrack that felt like a <a href="https://youtu.be/asr6_eNCuoU">pipe organ had gained sentience</a> and declared war on reality itself. It was, balance aside, a good time, and I'm interested to see what Bulwark have learned from their first outing.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing, the game's Steam page lists the release date as TBA, but the presser I received reckons it's out sometime this year. This may be old news by the time you're reading this, by which time hundreds of billions of cells in my body will have been replaced. A truly antiquated and wasteful biological system I wouldn't have to deal with if the machine god would simply bless my digusting, fallible flesh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Providing detailed pixel art and expressive animation. <a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> a fun world with lots of colorful characters. Come and disrupt their peace.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Late at night you enter their world. You will inhabit a girl named Abby and influence the world around her. Accompanied by her brother Michael you will traverse unfamiliar places, character conflicts, and story affecting decision making. You have the power to help the world or let it rot. Careful your presence has caught the attention of something sinister…</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Many indie <a title="Genres > RPG [17,266 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> claim to be a new quirky game, but <em>Away From Home</em> is a mix of many great RPGs. The characters are full of emotion and let you empathize with them. Don’t forget that this world needs you.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Imagine if a <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,645 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> and a Rhythm game had a love child. This game plays like Earthbound when it comes to walking and talking in it’s overworld, but when it comes to missions and battles it throws in <a title="Genres > Rhythm [178 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm games</a> related to the event. Characters also have real voices to help create mood and feeling to them. The big highlight of the gameplay is the huge amount of animations. The characters in this world are alive and through your gameplay you will begin to understand.</p><p>The amount of things to do in locations are never ending. Chocked full of lengthy side missions that unlock you new moves and items as well as random chance based events. The progression of side quests and random town events are based from entertaining games such as <em><a title="Series > Yakuza (Like a Dragon) [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/yakuza">Yakuza</a> 0</em>!</p><p>The world is large and will take you hours to complete everything, not to mention alternate routes that bring replayability. Some routes include game changing decisions as well as items and battles you wouldn’t be able to do had you made different choices.</p><p><strong>Battles</strong></p><p>The battles are in a third-person view with rhythm-based function. The UI has a fight button, special button, items button, and block button. Using arrow keys your <a title="Genres > Action [2,733 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will be in sync with the music. If you press a key on the beat, you gain action points for special attacks.</p><p>For the first time, skill and strategy are balanced out by the battle system. You will need to use skill to time your choices and hits in time. Mean while you will need to use strategy to counteract opponents special attacks. Such as if you have an opponent with poison, you will want to apply anti poison items in your arsenal. Both you planning and action will be put to the test.</p><p>Items are unlocked by completion of side quests and can be purchased at the stores, some items are very powerful and can only be received once. You must plan three items to bring into battle and have immediately available. As well as unlock special moves that pair well with your arsenal.</p><p>The battles are stocked full of special effects to keep the fight lively! Rather than being told what’s happening around you like in a traditional RPG, you will get to witness everything from falling confetti to flashes of lightning!</p><p>Enemies have special attacks as well. Enemy specials send you into a full on quick time event with high detailed pixel art. Where you must hit provided keys. Failure to hit them in time results in major damage taken.</p><p><strong>Art</strong></p><p>This game has may talented artists including yours truly. We bring life to the game in visually stunning ways. We focus on facial expression as well as detailed animation. Many people have poured their souls into this project. Some animations in the game took over 100 hours and I’m exited for you to see them.</p><p>We hope to convey emotion and expression in ways similar to games like Mother 3. With the high rendered detail in this game, every pixel counts. One pixel could change frown to a smile. So attention to detail goes a long way.</p><p><strong>Music</strong></p><p>This game has an outstanding soundtrack so far. Music determines so much in a game such as mood, atmosphere, and tension. The original soundtrack has many amazing artists including NickNuwe, Chaotrope, Zakku, and Nelward.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Altogether, over 200 for the ‘jukebox,’” Asahi <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-2/">said</a> when asked about the total number of musical pieces in Mario Kart World. “These are all brand-new arrangements, and we also did live recordings. We prepared pieces from quite a wide variety of musical genres. I believe those who are well-versed in video game music, as well as those who aren’t, will enjoy listening to them.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Asahi is asked about the challenge of crafting background music and integrating tracks into Mario Kart World’s open world design. Asahi explained music for the designated courses came first, then the open world parts of the game.</p><p>“First, we created music for the courses like we’ve always done before and then thought about what to do for the roads outside the courses,” Asahi said. “We decided to have two different kinds of music depending on how you’re playing. For the Knockout Tour mode, we started off by simply trying to connect the course themes. But that approach didn’t work well. It ended up sounding weird because the tracks have different tempos and beats. So, we decided to find a way to end each of the course themes, even though they’re connected by the route.</p><p>“Video game music often plays on a loop, and in this game, too, the same music keeps playing if you’re driving laps around a course. But for Knockout Tour, as you get closer to the next course, the music transitions to the outro, so the theme ends nicely. We also created a new intro for each course theme, which starts to play shortly before you reach the gate, building excitement. Then, as you actually pass through the gate, it changes to the theme of the course you’ve entered. By repeating this, it feels like a medley is playing along to you live, creating a sense of immersion.”</p>

<p>For other modes in Mario Kart World, like the open world Free Roam, Asahi said the team prepared lots of music in addition to the course tracks, and that the game automatically selects the right track depending on the situation. During development, the team referred to this carousel of music as the “jukebox,” and that’s how the jukebox feature made it into Mario Kart World.</p><p>Mario Kart World launches exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.</p><p>For more, read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/22/nintendo-considered-lowering-resolution-frame-rate-for-mario-kart-world-before-changing">Nintendo considered dropping the resolution and frame rate of Mario Kart World</a> before changing development to Switch 2.

			<p>Contrary to<a href="https://wccftech.com/insider-suggests-a-playstation-event-wont-happen-until-september-rumor/"> previous rumors</a>, Sony may not skip this year's "Not-E3" season, as a PlayStation State of Play is reportedly scheduled for June.</p>
<p>Speaking during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-BnQ9OIHOg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings</a>, the ever-reliable Jeff Grubb commented on the next PlayStation event, saying that, like Nate the Hate, he didn't hear anything about a May event, because there is one planned for June. The event, however, will probably not be a big one. The publisher has been going back and forth between showcase and PlayStation State of Play for a while, and has probably settled on a State of Play event for next month. Interestingly enough, Jeff Grubb highlighted how "abnormally difficult" it was to obtain this information, so there's definitely something going on behind the scenes at Sony.</p>
<p><iframe title="Game Mess Mornings 05/22/25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P-BnQ9OIHOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It has been a while since Sony hosted big PlayStation showcases, so there's a solid chance that Jeff Grubb provided once again correct information. As for which games will be showcased during the next PlayStation State of Play event, no information has been provided, although it would be a safe bet to expect to see <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/">Ghost of Yōtei </a>during the event. As the PlayStation 5 port of Starfield is supposedly getting revealed, and shortly after released, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">this year</a>, showing it during the event would make tons of sense, although this is mere speculation as the timing of the reveal is not yet known.</p>

        <p>Microsoft have "taken measures" to reduce "politically focused emails", says spokesperson</p>

            <p>Microsoft are reportedly blocking employee internal work emails that contain the words "Palestine" or "Gaza". The report in question comes from No Azure For Apartheid (NOAA), a group of Microsoft workers formed to protest the company's then-alleged supplying of AI tech to the Israeli military - something Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">have since confirmed</a>, while also stating that their own internal reviews found "no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“NOAA believes this is an attempt by Microsoft to silence worker free speech and is a censorship enacted by Microsoft leadership to discriminate against Palestinian workers and their allies," spokesperson and former Microsoft employee Hossam Nasr told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/672312/microsoft-block-palestine-gaza-email">The Verge</a> (paywalled) in a statement. Nasr added that "words like ‘Israel’ or ‘P4lestine’ do not trigger such a block".</p>
<p>When asked for comment by The Verge, Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw responded with the below:</p>
<p>“Emailing large numbers of employees about any topic not related to work is not appropriate. We have an established forum for employees who have opted in to political issues. Over the past couple of days, a number of politically focused emails have been sent to tens of thousands of employees across the company and we have taken measures to try and reduce those emails to those that have not opted in.”</p>
<p>As The Verge note, the reported email blocks follow a week of employee protests about the company's dealings with the Israeli military. There have also been protests during Microsoft's Build developer conference this week. On Monday, former employee Joe Lopez <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670812/microsoft-build-protest-keynote-jay-parikh-palestinian-tech-worker">interrupted</a> CEO Satya Nadella’s keynote by shouting “how about you show Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?”, before sending emails to "thousands" of colleagues. Microsoft fired Lopez on the same day.</p>
<p>The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">currently calling on the public to boycott Microsoft's wares</a>, including Xbox products like Game Pass. The BDS organisers include Nasr and Abdo Mohamed, another former Microsoft employee. They were both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired after organising a vigil for Palestinians</a> killed in Gaza outside the company’s Washington HQ.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this year, we saw the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-limited-edition-xbox-controller-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-gamestop/1100-6530902/" data-ref-id="1100-6530902">Doom: The Dark Ages Limited Edition Xbox Wireless Controller</a>. Featuring bloody graphics and a color pattern inspired by the Doom Slayer’s armor, it quickly sold out at most locations (though a few spots still have it in stock). We’ve also seen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-xbox-controller-and-headset-revealed-and-you-can-buy-them-now/1100-6515078/" data-ref-id="1100-6515078">Starfield Xbox Controller</a> and <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/controllers/xbox-wireless-controller-redfall-limited-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Redfall Xbox Controllers</a>--all of which sold out fast. If these new Witcher controllers follow the same pattern, expect them to disappear soon.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4499334-6d346ad1-ab72-4615-89d7-c98b8dc0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499334" data-ratio="0.56412825651303" data-width="998" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4499334-6d346ad1-ab72-4615-89d7-c98b8dc0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499334"></a><figcaption>Doom: The Dark Ages Limited Edition Xbox Wireless Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4499334-6d346ad1-ab72-4615-89d7-c98b8dc0.jpg"></figure><p>The fun doesn’t end with The Witcher controllers, as CD Projekt Red also revealed a new <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher/status/1925550975504285893" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox dynamic background</a>.

            <p>CD Projekt has teamed up with Microsoft to create some fancy new Witcher 3-themed Xbox controllers to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary - which I really can't quite believe because I personally haven't aged a day.

</p><p>The controllers - officially known as the 'Xbox Wireless Controller - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> 10th Anniversary Special Edition' and the 'Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 - Core The Witcher 3 10th Anniversary Special Edition' - are described as being "tempered and battle-ready", and promise "intricately crafted details".</p>
<p>They feature The Witcher 3's wolf medallion iconography, as well as Glagolitic script. I personally don't know what the script says, but apparently it can be translated and those symbols "are not random". If you work out what it means, please let me know.</p>

<p>Away from the cosmetic sides of things, these chaps also boast all the features you'd expect from an Xbox controller. So, rubberised back grips, remappable controller inputs, Bluetooth support and so on. You can check how they look in the video above.</p>
<p>
They've been created by CD Projekt's own designers, with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/22/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10th-anniversary-xbox-controllers/">Gabriela Pešková from CD Projekt and Mekias Bekalu from Xbox</a> calling this "such a special moment for both" teams.
</p>
<p>"We explored a lot of directions when creating this controller, but from the beginning we knew we wanted to tell a story," added CD Projekt design lead Joshua Flowers. "We wanted it to feel like something that has been with you on the path, something worn and personal. As we developed concepts, we began crafting the story of this controller - and how it might exist in The Witcher 3's world. This narrative is what we fell in love with. It had to feel like it belonged in The Witcher 3 universe - like it had lived through battles and carried stories of its own."</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the most impressive-looking open-world RPGs ever released, thanks to mods such as the DreamPunk mod which elevates the game's visuals to new levels of realism.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams">3.1.1 version</a> of the mod and the enhancements it brings to the game developed by CD Projekt Red are showcased in an 8K resolution video shared by the creator of the mod, NextGen Dreams, on YouTube. The new version of the mode redefines all the features seen in the previous versions at a small performance cost, introducing a new LUT designed to extend the lower dynamic range of the game, enhanced path tracing configuration, and more. The video also showcases the custom-made photo realistic camera shake shader, which looks great for gameplay showcases and free roaming.</p>

<p>With the development of Cyberpunk 2077 concluded, except for the development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>, which is launching next month together with the next-generation Nintendo system, CD Projekt Red is now entirely focused on the development of the second entry in the series, currently known as Project Orion. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/">Earlier this week</a>, the creator of the Cyberpunk universe revealed that the game will feature a second city to explore besides Night City, a city that was described as a sort of Chicago gone wrong, with a very different vibe than the city players have explored alongside V in the original game.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The game will launch on Nintendo Switch on June 5th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avalon-hill-reveals-major-expansions-for-talisman-and-betrayal.1196421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/avalon-hill-talisman-betrayal-expansions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Avalon Hill has announced major expansions for&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at House on the Hill&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Talisman</em>, and they're both on their way to retailers later this year.</p>

<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>is getting a new expansion by the name of&nbsp;<em>Talisman Nemesis: Call of the Hunt</em>. It'll bring new "one vs. many" gameplay, in which one player will take on the rest of the table across three new "unique and mysterious" campaigns that unlock "new evil creatures and game mechanics".</p>

<p><em>Talisman Nemesis: Call of the Hunt&nbsp;</em>follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-alliances-review-work-together-for-even-harder-challenge" rel="nofollow">November's&nbsp;<em>Talisman Alliances</em></a>, which feels pretty appropriate; where that expansion brought players together, this one creates a rift between them (although hopefully not in the real world).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-nemesis-call-of-the-hunt-avalon-hill.jpg?itok=sy_5ZeSK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-nemesis-call-of-the-hunt-avalon-hill.jpg?itok=zINAoSZs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Talisman Nemesis: Call of the Hunt&nbsp;</em>pits the table against one evil mastermind player.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to grab this new&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>expansion on November 1st, when it'll launch across Amazon and other retailers, including "your friendly local game store", according to Avalon Hill. It'll set you back $34.99, and pre-orders open on July 31st.</p>

<h2><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill&nbsp;</em>is also getting a new expansion</h2>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>getting in on the new expansion fun, either. Avalon Hill's popular&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>, arguably an inspiration for this year's indie video game hit&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em>, is also getting a terrifying new set.</p>

<p><em>Betrayal at the Neibolt House: The Evil of Pennywise&nbsp;</em>is an expansion that, as the title suggests, brings everyone's favorite murderous clown to the world of&nbsp;<em>Betrayal</em>. Inside, you'll find three new minis, new rooms, and new items and characters based on the movie&nbsp;<em>It: Chapter Two</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-pennywise-expansion.jpg?itok=gMar-vXR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-pennywise-expansion.jpg?itok=9ONPtxWh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill&nbsp;</em>is getting an&nbsp;<em>It</em>-themed expansion soon.</figcaption></figure><p>This one's arriving sooner than the&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>set; you can expect&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at the Neibolt House&nbsp;</em>to arrive on August 1st. You'll pay $24.99 for it, and like the previous set, it'll be available via Amazon or via local game stores.</p>

<p><em>Neibolt House&nbsp;</em>won't be&nbsp;<em>Betrayal</em>'s first crossover, either. The game has matched wits with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/betrayal-mystery-mansion-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Scooby-Doo</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/betrayal-at-baldurs-gate-tabletop-game-announced" rel="nofollow">Baldur's Gate</a>&nbsp;</em>in the past, so I'm sure Pennywise will feel right at home.</p>

This was revealed in a short story called “Bastet,” which focused on him and Ana, who were close comrades during the group’s heyday. In the story, Morrison reflects on his old flame, and it sounds like the two split because Soldier was so dedicated to the group’s cause that it put a strain on their relationship. But the game itself hasn’t really acknowledged Soldier’s long-lost love outside of a spray of the two giving each other the Christian Side Hug. That’s finally changed in <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s 16th season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197567" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Blizzard periodically adds new pre-match interactions between its heroes with the start of a new season and in the big mid-season patch, often spotlighting a handful of characters with each new wave, rather than adding something for all 40+ heroes at once.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There are very few games I've spent more time in over the past several years than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/" data-ref-id="5000-438508">Sea of Thieves</a>. Part of that is because there's still, quite surprisingly, no other game attempting the same style. There are other pirate games, but the piracy setting is really just a wrapper--a well-suited one, no doubt--but one could see a Sea of Thieves-style game existing in other frameworks, too. In fact, when Rare was first creating the game,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/on-sea-of-thieves-fifth-anniversary-rare-says-it-still-has-a-point-to-prove/1100-6512495/"> it had considered several other settings</a> before landing on an open-world pirate sandbox, no pun intended.</p><p dir="ltr">The first time I interviewed Rare for GameSpot, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-tools-not-rules-design-keeps-it-unique-four-years-later/1100-6506144/">I asked about the lack of copycat games</a>, and how interesting that is in an industry that loves to chase successful trends. Three years since then, it's still true. While a few games have received some Sea of Thieves comparisons as of late--namely Jump Ship, Wildgate, and Sand--none of these are really attempting to fill the same space as Rare's multiplayer adventure game. I caught up with Sea of Thieves' creative director Mike Chapman to once again pose this question, and this time drilled down more to the point: What the heck would make a game a "Sea of Thieves-like" anyway?</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObMDHcinZak" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ObMDHcinZak" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I actually think about that all the time, Chapman revealed. "I think if you'd asked me seven years ago, I'd have thought, 'Oh, if we're any kind of successful, there are going to be other games in this space, certainly a pirate game, or very close to it.' It feels like [games such as Jump Ship, Wildgate, and Sand]--which look great, by the way--they take one dynamic from Sea of Thieves and really focus in on it. I loved all the previews of Wildgate, for example, but it's kind of like this really tight competitive loop. It's like one aspect of Sea of Thieves, whereas I think what gives Sea of Thieves this incredible life and allows us to keep evolving it is that it's not any one thing. I think it's almost like the genre that we've created, that we're playing in, and that other people aren't playing in."</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Chapman which of the game's various parts are essential to making a "Sea of Thieves-like." It's not the pirate theme; you can apply that to all sorts genres. It's not the open world setting; there are hundreds, if not thousands, of those. It's not just the PvPvE multiplayer; that's very popular right now. So what is it?</p><p dir="ltr">"I think Sea of Thieves is a canvas for player storytelling and player imagination, and it is, at its heart, an adventure game where all of those gameplay possibilities are possible, but some sessions you don't interact with all of them. It is just this world to escape into where there are all these possibilities. But it's very much about your story, your gameplay, putting that on a pedestal with all of that choice in a shared world," he explained. "And I love the fact that choice, and a very small set of rules, are perfectly brought to life with the wrapper of pirates. It's like, we've got all of this freedom mechanically, but it's got this wrapper that's all about having this freedom, which is about being this pirate in this world where the Golden Age of Piracy never died."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4498847-sot_vota_wayfinder_quest_4kresize.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498847" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4498847-sot_vota_wayfinder_quest_4kresize.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498847"></a><figcaption>Sea of Thieves is like a pantry of ingredients that players pull from to make their own recipes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4498847-sot_vota_wayfinder_quest_4kresize.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Maybe, alongside all of those other features that collectively make a Sea of Thieves-like game, it's Rare's decision to commit to a flat progression system that has helped it define its unique space. I can't think of many other major multiplayer games that keep players on even footing from a gear and metagame perspective, and those that do, such as Halo Infinite or Marvel Rivals, are more like arena shooters. Normally, a sandbox game comes with all kinds of upgrade trees. But not Rare's, and that's partly why it works.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, some critics and players complained of the lack of things like XP, perks to unlock, and gear to upgrade, but it's clear those choices are integral to the experience, especially nearly a decade later where some diehard players wouldn't easily bring their friends in who have never played before if not for their equal footing. As a veteran Sea of Thieves player, you bring to the game your wealth of experience, not experience points. By not gatekeeping players out of the game years later just because they may be late to hop in, Rare stays true to the game's simple, underlying North Star: "Players creating stories together."</p><p dir="ltr">Chapman said the game, at its heart, has an "elegant simplicity" for players, but that achieving this simplicity isn't so easy for Rare or other studios looking to be inspired by it. "We set out with that vision to make a game that would evolve over time. This is a world to escape into, and it's almost impossible to create the full fruition of that world in one go. You have to take your time, maintain an audience, and have a thriving community, and just keep evolving it and adding new dynamics. And I think that's why you just can't put up barriers like, 'I can't play with you because I've not progressed to a certain point.' And it's kind of the lifeblood of the game; players bring all of that stuff to life, so they have to be able to play together."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">I think someone could come along and be really successful in this space, but I think they just need to look deeper than just trying to replace the ship with a horse or a spaceship or something else.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Could we one day see a closer Sea of Thieves-like in something like a western, or a zombie world, or, like one of Rare's original pitches, a world inhabited by dinosaurs? Maybe, says Chapman, provided they focus on the "heart" of the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a big investment. It's a specific way of designing experiences that add to this feeling that everything in that world is another ingredient, and these ingredients combine to create these different recipes. And certain sessions give you different experiences, but they don't always all come together. It's a very unconstrained experience. I just think it's a big commitment, tech- and creative-wise. So I'm kind of pleased there's nothing else like Sea of Thieves. [...] I think people really fixate on the vehicle, on the ship [...] being the focus and the catalyst for cooperative gameplay, whereas I think it's much deeper.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think it's the [way of] empowering players with tools that can combine in different ways that really showcase player storytelling. And I think you don't have to have the ship to have that. So I think someone could come along and be really successful in this space, but I think they just need to look deeper than just trying to replace the ship with a horse or a spaceship or something else. I think looking slightly deeper is probably the answer."</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Sea of Thieves Season 16 kicks off today for all platforms, alongside its launch on <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/sea-of-thieves?p=1915986" rel="nofollow">Battle.net</a>. This season focuses on the Reaper's Bones, typically one of the game's more antagonistic, PvP-centric trading companies, and seeks to build out more ways for players to interact. This season also introduces a new deployable cannon, skeleton NPCs who will help you fight and hunt for treasure, and a new Plunder Pass full of cosmetics and in-game currency.</p>

In this interview series, Yabuki is asked how many courses are in the game, to which he responds that there are more than 100.</p><p>Yabuki explained that because Mario Kart World is designed as an open world racing game with lots of terrain and more to explore en route and between designed race tracks, it’s tough to quantify the number of courses. However, if you add up all the possible variations, the number exceeds 100, according to Yabuki.</p>

<p>“In this game, you don’t just race on the courses,” he said in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-2/">interview</a>. “The areas between courses are also used for racing. So it’s as if there are courses spread out all over the world, and if you were to add up all the possible variations, it would easily exceed 100.”</p><p>The interviewer then joked that Yabuki said earlier that Mario Kart World’s design philosophy wasn’t about increasing the amount of content, despite the game doing just that. Yabuki added, “Since it’s now a single, interconnected world, it’s hard to do a direct comparison with the last game, but in the pursuit of approachability and fun in this new, vast world, the volume of content we had to create in terms of visual design, programming, and audio increased dramatically.</p><p>“And as a result, the gameplay is more varied than ever before.”</p><p>We’ll all discover how varied the gameplay is in two weeks when Mario Kart World launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting"><em>Game Informer’s</em> hands-on preview of Mario Kart World</a>, and then read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/22/nintendo-considered-lowering-resolution-frame-rate-for-mario-kart-world-before-changing">Nintendo considered dropping the resolution and frame rate</a> of Mario Kart World before changing development to the Switch 2.
