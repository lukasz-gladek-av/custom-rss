<p>Seriously, this one looks cool</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Devolver Digital has confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>8th December 2025</strong>, and the latest trailer is looking seriously cool.</p>
<p>Created by solo dev Sam Eng, Skate Story is a psychedelic adventure in which you take on the form of a demon made of "glass and pain". It's your job to hone your skills and skate through nine layers of the Underworld to become a serious hardened skater.</p>
<p>Gosh darn, that sounds good. It looks gorgeous too; certainly one of the most unique skating games we've seen, aesthetically. Only time will tell, however, if the gameplay itself can hold a candle to the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>.</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stylish Street Skating Adventure -</strong> Skate through nine layers of the Underworld. Journey through streets and surreal landscapes full of waxed ledges, unholy gaps and tortured demons.</p>
<p><strong>Succumb to the Beauty of the Board -</strong> Sell your soul for decks, wheels and trucks to keep your skating fresh. Over 70+ skate tricks to progress and improve. Complete skate trials to level up and get new gear.</p>
<p><strong>Hypnotic Beats for Demonic Streets -</strong> Cruise through the Underworld to a psychedelic soundtrack by enigmatic New York artist Blood Cultures, with additional tracks by John Fio.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-4-6-star-rated-soundcore-portable-bluetooth-speaker-selling-for-post-prime-pennies-2000633350</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-4-6-star-rated-soundcore-portable-bluetooth-speaker-selling-for-post-prime-pennies.1321159/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The memo that Prime Day is over hasn’t made its full rounds yet, because there are still some crazy tech deals floating around Amazon that are too good to miss. Here’s another one that could be a “like it now, love it later” buy, looking ahead to when the warm weather returns: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/">the Soundcore Motion 100 portable Bluetooth speaker, with IPX7 waterproofing to go along with its great sound, just had its price cut in half to just $40.</a></p>
<p>The Soundcore Motion 100’s waterproofing, compact size, and handy built-in loop for carrying or hanging make it a perfect shower speaker for when the pool and beach parties aren’t an option, and when the great outdoor are calling you back, it’s ideal for looping onto bike handlebars, hanging from a backpack or a canopy with a carabiner, or just carrying since it only weighs 1.3 pounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Little Speaker, Big Sound</h2>
<p>A speaker this small shouldn’t sound this big or this good, but that’s the Soundcore Motion 100’s calling card. It brings quality, detailed sound at up to 40kHz, with the option to hit the BassUp button to get that deep chest-thumping bass going. It’s app-controlled, with a detailed 9-band EQ control that gives you the power of in-depth customization.</p>
<p>That sound is driven by dual full-range drivers, with a bold 20W output with or without the extra bass. The total effect vastly outpunches the modest size of the speaker — barely over 7 inches long by 2.5 inches wide by 2 inches tall. As a shower speaker or compact yet powerful home speaker living on a shelf, it more than does the job. As a source of quality music on the go, it’s among the best.</p>



<h2>Why Stop at Just One?</h2>
<p>The Motion 100 can also be paired with another Motion 100 to create a surround-sound experience. When one Motion 100 is just $30, why stop there? A quality portable surround sound system for $60 is more than a little tempting. You won’t wear them out, either, since they have a robust 12-hour life on a single USB-C charge.</p>
<p>When a 4.6-star-rated portable Bluetooth speaker is available at Amazon for $60, and it’s IPX7 waterproof so it can be a shower speaker, poolside speaker, and everything in between, it’s worth serious consideration. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4669/">When that very same speaker gets an unexpected 50% price cut and becomes a $40 speaker, it becomes a truly great deal</a>. We’re still leaning toward buying two of the Soundcore Motion 100 portable Bluetooth speakers to get that surround sound going, but there is going to be at least one in our Amazon shopping cart imminently.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that it’s adding two classic Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games to the Xbox Game Pass library. </p>



<p>Starting today, October 9, both Heroes of Might and Magic II: Gold and Heroes of Might and Magic III: Complete are available for all members on the platform. The games will be available on PC for PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>“I can think of no better way to teach a new generation the meaning of key words like throng, necromancy, and logistics,” Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2kNoEMd70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Watters said</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to the games being added to the service, it was also revealed that Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era’s Early Access release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-early-access-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was being pushed to 2026</a>. To fill in the gap between now and the launch, however, developers Unfrozen have released a demo on PC via Steam.</p>

                <p>The new patch notes are in for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/news/">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-update-buffs-vault-hunters/1100-6535180/" data-ref-id="1100-6535180">and like several other updates</a>, this new round of tweaks to the game is focused on empowering players--specifically, their arsenal of weapons. Gearbox says that it's focusing on smaller gear adjustments, starting with several Legendary-class weapons. These hard-to-find weapons haven't felt as good to use in combat despite having unique perks, so their overall power is getting dialed up substantially.</p><p>One prime example here is the Hellwalker, a Jacobs fire-and-forget shotgun that was introduced in Borderlands 3 and is almost a carbon copy of the Super-Shotgun used by the Doom Slayer in Id's Doom games. This will now do 30% extra base damage, so if you have a Jakobs mod equipped and the right skills activated, it should shred through rank-and-file enemies with ease. Queen's Rest, a pistol manufactured by Torgue, will also start firing rounds faster, as this has been increased by 50%, while the chance for its unique perk to spawn a homing sticky projectile has been increased from 30% to 50%.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Other notable changes include damage and fire-rate increases to Ruby's Grasp, the drone deployed from Bully will do 50% more damage, and Convergence base damage has been increased by 25%. If you don't have one of these Legendary-class weapons yet, they can be farmed from bosses found throughout Kairos, or you might want to check Mauricie's Black Market vending machine to see if he has it in stock.</p><p>Maurice offers unique Legendary gear for any player who accesses his machine, so if RNG is on your side, you might be able to purchase one of these upgraded guns with a very desirable roll of stats. You can also take a chance with the Golden Treasure Chests, as these often hand out Legendaries when you open them. To stock up on Golden Keys, check our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/" data-ref-id="1100-6533833">Borderlands 4 Shift Code guide</a> for updates.</p><p>Gearbox has also made a few other changes, like ensuring that the legendary Tediore shotgun Anarchy properly rewards stacks of Mutualism after auto-reloading or killing enemies, and Vex's Bleed skill will now count as status effect damage. You can see the full patch notes below, and next week, Gearbox will upload a patch that focuses on fine-tuning Class Mods, Repkits, Shields, and Firmware. Borderlands 4 has also struggled with performance issues since launch, but Gearbox says next week's update will address these issues and add some highly requested quality-of-life changes.</p><h2>Borderlands 4 Update Notes</h2><h4>Weekly Activities</h4><ul><li><b>Weekly Big Encore Boss</b> switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those who take it on.</li><li>The<b> Weekly Wildcard Mission</b> changed. These missions feature a guaranteed Legendary drop you can earn repeatedly to get your ideal roll.</li><li><b>Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine</b> moved to another location and changed its offerings.</li></ul><h4>Gear Balance Adjustments</h4><ul><li>Ruby's Grasp damage increased by 50%</li><li>Ruby's Grasp fire rate increased by 25%</li><li>Bully drone damage increased by 50%</li><li>Bully base damage increased by 50%</li><li>Rangefinder base damage increased by 30%</li><li>Queen's Rest spawn chance increased from 30% to 50%</li><li>Queen's Rest fire rate increased by 50%</li><li>Seventh Sense orb damage increased by 250%</li><li>Hellwalker base damage increased 30%</li><li>Convergence base damage increased by 25%</li></ul><h4>Additional Changes</h4><ul><li>Legendary Tediore Shotgun <i>Anarchy </i>was adjusted to properly award Stacks of Mutualism when auto-reloading or killing enemies</li><li>All Pets from all classes (such as Trouble, Specters, Reapers, and Forgeweapons) now properly gain Critical Hit Chance from Passives and Gear</li><li>Adjustment made to Vex the Siren’s Bleed to count as Status Effect Damage</li></ul>

<hr>
<p>The hardware side of things is much as you might expect, though there's been a slight uptick in PS5 sales — hey, all those copies of Ghost of Yotei have to be played somewhere. The Switch 2 remains out front with 44,439 sales this week, followed by the standard PS5 and the Switch OLED.</p>
<p>Combining the three Switch 1 SKUs pulls in a total of 24,109 units sold this week, while the three PS5 models rack up 27,344. A win for Sony!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Discord Hack Sounds Really, Really Bad]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I got a strange <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-sdk-nitro-ads-ipo-profitable-splitgate-2-1851770484">email from Discord</a> last Friday at the very end of the work day informing me of “a recent security incident on September 20 involving your personal data.” It said personal info related to my account had been compromised, but not full credit card info or my personal address. The email made it seem like only a small number of people were impacted and simply told me to “stay alert” about any suspicious emails I might get. Suspicious? On the internet? In 2025? Good luck! Nearly a week late it’s becoming clear that this “limited access” hack of a “third-party customer service system used by Discord” is a much bigger deal than it originally seemed.</p> <p>“A small number of government‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport) from users who had appealed an age determination” were included in the leak, Discord informed users like me last week. According to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-discord-hack-is-every-users-worst-nightmare/">new report by <em>404 Media</em></a>, the hackers responsible gloated in a Telegram group that they actually had 1.5TB of users’ personal data. Discord admitted to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/797051/discord-government-ids-leaked-data-breach?ref=404media.co"><em>The Verge</em></a> last night that it actually believes up to 70,000 users may have had their government IDs breached. There’s already a <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/2397306/discord-sued-after-user-info-leaked-in-breach-of-vendor">class-action lawsuit</a> being filed in California.</p>

 <p>One of the big culprits in this entire mess is legislation like the UK’s controversial Online Safety Act which requires users to prove to platforms that they’re 18 years or older using selfies and government IDs. In the era of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals">a $1 trillion generative AI deal-industrial complex</a>, that feels like potentially putting your entire identity up for grabs on the internet. “Online ID checks may seem like a common-sense solution, but that facade hides a much darker truth: lawmakers are pressuring companies to implement surveillance and censorship tactics and it’s putting all of us in danger,” <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2025-03-06-new-letter-90-civil-rights-and-privacy-organizations-condemn-id-checking-bills-citing-effectiveness-censorship-and-privacy-concerns/">anti-surveillance campaigner</a> Sarah Philips told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in an email.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chat, we are cooked</p> <p>Discord is being extorted by the people who compromised their Zendesk instance</p> <p>They've got 1.5TB of age verification related photos. 2,185,151 photos</p> <p>tl;dr 2.1m Discord users drivers license and/or passport might be leaked.

The samples reportedly include screengrabs of thumbnails of users’ identification selfies as well as a help desk ticket that seemingly belongs to alleged <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">Charlie Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson</a>.</p>

 <p>How did the hackers get this data to begin with? A spokesperson for ZenDesk, the third-party customer service company supporting Discord, told 404 Media its systems were “not compromised.” Infosec account vx-underground <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1976238815665856646?ref=404media.co">was told</a> the breach came via an outsourced support agent.</p>

 <p>“All affected users globally have been contacted and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities, and external security experts,” Discord spokesperson Nu Wexler told <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week. “We’ve secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.”</p> <p>Discord did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims it’s being extorted or the vulnerability that led to the hack.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-early-access-demo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-early-access-pushed-to-2026-demo-released.1321120/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After originally being scheduled for a release in Q2 2025, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era’s Early Access has been pushed to 2026. A specific window for the year wasn’t announced.</p>



<p>As part of Ubisoft’s celebration of the Might &amp; Magic franchise’s 30th anniversary, it was also revealed that the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era demo is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam.</a></p>



<p>First announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-announced-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom 2024</a>, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is the eighth installment of the long-running turn-based strategy game. It’s the first title in the series since 2015’s Might &amp; Magic Heroes VII.</p>



<p>The game features six factions at launch—Temple, Necropolis, Sylvan, Dungeon, Hive, and Schism—as well as several modes, including campaign, random single maps, custom maps, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer with modes like classic, single-hero, and arena. </p>



<p>Online multiplayer, for the first time in series history, will even feature general matchmaking that allows you to quickly jump into a game with other players.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned, the game was first set to launch in Q2 2025, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed in June</a> to “later in 2025”. At the time, Unfrozen said it was done to “ensure we give Olden Era the care it deserves”.</p>



<p><strong>“From the beginning, our goal has been to create something truly special, and that takes time, care, and iteration,”</strong> they said. <strong>“However, as an indie studio, we need a bit more time to get everything ready for the big Early Access release.”</strong></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-blops-7-sbmm-muiltiplayer-matchmaking-2000633695</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) enters the news yet again as <i>Black Ops 7</i>’s devs have fully committed to an about-face on the highly debated practice of matching folks with relative skill levels in online matches with randos. Not only will matches have more variety of skill level across players, but perhaps most excitingly, randomly matched lobbies that vibe well can stick together across multiple games, much like how things used to work in the good old days of <i>Halo 3</i> and other shooters that let people party up and play together in game after game more seamlessly.</p> <p>The news broke <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes">via a blog post</a> following the game’s beta (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1976285808446537995">h/t <i>CharlieIntel</i></a><i>)</i>, and it’s music to the ears of many. In theory, grouping up people of similar skill levels in random matches sounds good. In practice, opponents of this approach argue that it leads to sweatier, more competitive matches. Its overuse effectively eliminates a more relaxed playstyle in which every match isn’t just a zero-sum game for aspiring esports competitors to rule the leaderboards.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SBMM war is over… never thought we'd see it <a href="https://t.co/nMnglDVgdv">https://t.co/nMnglDVgdv</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1976296080267719063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>SBMM isn’t being totally thrown out. The dev blog states that there’ll be “minimal skill consideration” for default <i>BLOPS 7</i> games. So hopefully that means we won’t see too many players with a pro-level skillset demolishing folks just looking to unwind after work with a few rounds of <i>COD</i>.</p> <p>I’m skeptical that this pivot will see the debate over SBMM go away. Still, it’s a great opportunity for <i>BLOPS7</i> to serve as a case study for how devs can design matchmaking features that optimize having fun without shutting out the more competitive players amongst us.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The days of the touchscreen laptop living in the premium price slot may be over for good, if this Amazon post-Prime Day deal is any indicator. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Touchscreen-Processor-14-Bluetooth/dp/B0FMJJH35F/?tag=kotaku01-20">The original $2,999 price tag on this 14-inch HP touchscreen Intel laptop might verge on ridiculous, but the 87%-off deal that drops that number down to just $390 is also ridiculous, but in a good way</a>.</p>
<p>The huge leaps forward made by tablets and their keyboard attachments may have taken eyes off of the touchscreen laptop, but this HP model is proof that a solid everyday laptop with a touchscreen isn’t just a novelty. Students, creatives, and everyday users who just can’t deal with a trackpad will love how easy the touchscreen makes using this laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4672/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid Foundation</h2>
<p>The guts of this HP touchscreen laptop are right at that sweet spot between “more than you’ll ever need or use” and “so puny that I can’t do anything without lagging.” The Intel Celeron N4500 processor (up to 2.8GHz burst frequency) and Intel UHD graphics chip won’t win in a footrace against premium laptops, but they won’t slow you down at all when you get deep into your daily multitasking. They’re backed by 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, so there’s plenty of room for your files, projects, and apps.</p>
<p>Then there’s the touchscreen and all of the possibilities it presents. Pair it with an inexpensive stylus — there are literally dozens of them at Amazon — and you can annotate presentation slides or other documents, or even jot down quick notes or sketches for yourself on the fly. The touchscreen also lets you tap, scroll, and pinch to zoom in like a tablet. Soon you’ll be swiping through pages and menus and browser tabs faster than you ever could with a trackpad or mouse.</p>



<h2>Office 365 Included</h2>
<p>This deal comes with one year of Microsoft Office 365 Personal, which includes all of the premium Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, and also cloud storage and the security of Microsoft Defender. The HP True Vision 720p HD webcam with dual-array mics and HD Audio speakers make this touchscreen laptop a natural for Zoom meetings and other video calls, and two SuperSpeed USB-A ports, an HDMI 1.4b port, and a SD card reader are great expansion options.</p>
<p>We’d be pulling your leg if we told you this was a solid $2,999 laptop. But while it falls short of that impossibly high mark, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Touchscreen-Processor-14-Bluetooth/dp/B0FMJJH35F/?tag=kotaku01-20">it most definitely overdelivers on the new $390 price tag it’s rocking right now during this post-Prime Day 87%-off deal at Amazon.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-founder-describes-game-pass-price-hikes-as-greed-over-gaming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-founder-describes-game-pass-price-hikes-as-%E2%80%98greed-over-gaming%E2%80%99.1321081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox founder has recently discussed the Game Pass price hikes, describing them as a betrayal of fans and “greed over gaming”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, at the beginning of October 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Game Pass Ultimate’s price would be raised by 50% and that its tier features would change. The players have definitely not taken this move well, given that Xbox console prices <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-revenue-growth-microsoft-is-raising-xbox-console-prices-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were increased just last month</a>. Now, the Xbox founder has shared their views on the Game Pass price hikes. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-price-hikes-are-shattering-the-brand-and-alienating-loyal-fans">Game Pass Price Hikes Are “Shattering the Brand and Alienating Loyal Fans”</h2>



<p>Xbox founder Laura Fryer recently released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGh1-W-nYQA&amp;t=282s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a> (via <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-game-pass-price-hike-laura-fryer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WCCFtech</a>) discussing the recent Game Pass price hikes. Fryer immediately called out the leadership, stating that she doesn’t know whether they understand “what makes Xbox great”. Fryer isn’t sure if the leadership is aware of what the community wants, as they keep “doubling down on decisions” that make it seem they are in a bubble where the “feedback doesn’t reach them anymore.”</p>



<p>Fryer adds, “That yes man culture that took over in 2008 has only gotten worse, and this is the result, a crazy price increase for their fans after announcing that Game Pass had made $5 billion.” She talks about how Xbox has failed to keep content costs stable and the leadership has forgotten “how to make games at scale”, which has led to many layoffs and cancellations. </p>



<p>The Xbox founder talks about how Xbox has thrown away one of its last advantages by increasing Game Pass prices, which had been “the best deal in gaming”. The price hike “feels like a betrayal, like greed over gaming”. </p>

<p>In other news, Microsoft recently addressed rumors surrounding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-addresses-rumors-surrounding-xbox-console-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of the Xbox consoles</a>.

"Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Days later, Epic Games issued a carefully-worded follow-up where it said it had subsequently "worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current Peacemaker storyline." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result? "To avoid any confusion," the developer continued, "we're modifying the Emote choreography in next week's update." To some, the statement seemed unclear as to whether the emote was a reference to the show's own Nazi references. If so, why was it returning? If not, why was it being changed? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, today's big Fortnite patch (which also adds the game's Halloween event Fortnitemares, as well as a first nod to its highly-anticipated The Simpsons mini-season) has now made the switch, with the Peaceful Hips emote now updated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">See the original dance emote and the updated one both below for comparison:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>DC Peacemaker 'Peaceful Hips' Emote will be disabled </p><p>"As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote.

After a little sideways shimmy, each arm is then bent upwards one at a time — the movement seen by some as reminiscent of swastika. After that, there's a momentary touch of the thighs before the arms are placed behind the head and the routine ends with a generous double crotch thrust.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new emote replaces that middle section with a fresh movement — with clenched fists, an arm movement up and then down — that then neatly leads in to the remainder of the choreography.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy 24 hours for Fortnite, which last night had to deal with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-halloween-plans-get-off-to-messy-start-following-social-media-snafu-involving-doja-cat-and-a-sex-toy">rap star Doja Cat breaking kayfabe to criticise the posting of a sex toy reference on the game's social media account that was designed to look like it had been written by her</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, Ubisoft canceled an in-development&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>game that was set to take place in the Reconstruction-era USA last year, citing political concerns.</p>

<p>That's per Stephen Totilo of <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>, who cites "interviews with five current and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">former Ubisoft employees</a>". Said employees told Totilo that they were "enthusiastic" about this potential&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>game, but were "frustrated by its cancellation", which they saw as "Ubisoft bowing to controversy".</p>

<p>If Totilo is to be believed, players would have taken the role of a Black former slave who had moved from the South in order to begin a new life. The Assassins would have recruited said protagonist, and he would have fought the Ku Klux Klan, among other hostile forces.</p>

<p>If you need reminding, said backlash revolved around whether or not the historical Yasuke (who was a real person) would actually have held the rank of samurai. Its proponents claimed historical inaccuracy, but those opposed to the backlash accused its adherents of covert racism.</p>

<p>The second reason the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>project in question was canceled was, according to Totilo's report, the political climate in the US, which a source said was "too unstable" to justify the continuation of the game's development.</p>

<p>The sources to whom Totilo spoke said that cancelling a project in the gaming industry was not unusual (to which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-project-baxter-canceled-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recent events</a> will certainly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">attest</a>), but that doing so for the above reasons was.</p>

<p>The French studio also announced back in September that future games in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series, another franchise that serves as one of Ubisoft's flagships, would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-multiplayer-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">focus much more on their multiplayer elements</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>This is </em><a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/">Lowpass<em> by Janko Roettgers</em></a><em>, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for </em>The Verge<em> subscribers once a week.</em></p><p>The glasses stole the show: When Meta held its annual Connect developer conference last month, the company’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779566/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-smart-glasses-price-battery-specs">Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> got a lot of attention. Without new hardware to announce, VR took a bit of a backseat. Sure, <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/james-cameron-mixed-reality-headsets-generative-ai">there was James Cameron</a>, who is helping the company bring 3D movies, shows, and sports events to Quest headsets. But what about that whole metaverse thing? How’s that going? To get an update on Meta’s efforts to make VR social, I talked to the company’s metaverse VP, Vishal Shah.</p><p>Meta’s struggles with Horizon Worlds, the company’s social metaverse platform, have been well-documented. Shah himself complained in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23391895/meta-facebook-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-too-buggy-leaked-memo?utm_source=www.lowpass.cc&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=exclusive-inside-meta-s-horizon-worlds-reboot">a series of leaked 2022 memos</a> that not even Meta’s employees were using the platform, leading him to pose the question: “If we don’t love it, how can we expect our users to love it?”</p><p>The company has since launched a series of polished games within <em>Horizon</em> and spent heavily to attract VR developers to the platform. At this year’s Connect conference, Meta doubled down on those efforts by announcing not just AI developer tools, but also a whole new game engine for Horizon Worlds.</p><p>All of this is part of the company’s efforts to turn Horizon Worlds into a link between social 3D spaces everywhere, from headsets to phones to your Facebook and Instagram feeds — and one day, as Mark Zuckerberg suggested during his Meta Connect keynote, perhaps even glasses.</p><div><p id="worlds-apart-making-vr-games-work-on-phones-isnt-easy"><h2>Worlds apart: making VR games work on phones isn’t easy</h2></p></div><p>When Meta launched the first version of Horizon Worlds in late 2021, it very much embraced a kind of DIY ethos. Developers could easily build games and worlds in headset, but the resulting experiences all lacked texture and complexity. Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/19/23313469/mark-zuckerberg-horizon-worlds-screenshot-memes-response-upgrades">Zuckerberg’s selfie in front of the Eiffel Tower?</a> That was essentially how Horizon Worlds games looked at the time. “The ceiling of what you could make was low,” Shah says. “It was just not compelling enough.”</p><p>The company began shifting away from this approach in 2023 by building and <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-worlds-50-million-creator-fund/">investing in</a> higher-quality games like <em>Super Rumble</em>, a PvP shooter built by Meta’s in-house studio Ouro Interactive. It eventually fully transitioned from in-headset creator tools to a desktop solution for building worlds <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/horizon-worlds-desktop-editor-now-publicly-available-in-early-access/">earlier this year</a>. That software, Meta Horizon Studio, lets developers create more complex games with TypeScript, including <a href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/10221079610486872/?locale=en_US">haunted houses</a>, <a href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/393502540519645/?locale=en_US">sports competitions</a>, and <a href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/462305146410908/?locale=en_US">party games</a>.</p><p>“That required a skill that not everyone has,” admits Shah. “So can we lower the floor of what you need to get started, but still keep the ceiling really high?” Meta’s answer to that question is AI: At Connect, the company unveiled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780256/meta-horizon-worlds-engine-studio">new tools for developers</a> to create 3D environments, NPCs, and even game mechanics with simple prompts.</p><p>Embracing desktop creator tools has also allowed Meta to take Horizon Worlds beyond the headset. The company <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/horizon-worlds-super-rumble-reboot-mobile-app">began making select games, including <em>Super Rumble</em></a>, available on mobile in 2023. “We have this chicken-and-egg problem,” Shah tells me. “We know the most immersive experiences are in VR. But that’s not where all the people are today. People are on mobile.” And once people discover <em>Horizon</em> games on mobile, they’re more likely to try them in VR, or so the logic goes.</p><p>However, getting people to try <em>Horizon</em> games on mobile hasn’t been easy, with Shah acknowledging that the company’s initial push to bring VR games like <em>Super Rumble</em> to phones didn’t work. “The control specs weren’t right,” he says. “It just didn’t feel right.”</p><p>Now, Meta also allows developers to build mobile-only Horizon Worlds games. Engagement on mobile has supposedly increased by 4x since, but Shah admits that overall mobile use is still nascent. “It’s smaller than VR, but it’s not nearly as small as it was,” he tells me.</p><p>And while Meta keeps investing in mobile <em>Horizon</em> games, its ultimate goal remains unchanged. “This is not about [building] a mobile-only thing,” Shah says. “This is about cross-platform play. This is about making sure people can find these [worlds] from whatever device they’re on, and whatever experience they’re in.”</p><div><p id="why-meta-built-a-new-game-engine"><h2>Why Meta built a new game engine</h2></p></div><p>To that end, the company is also looking to bring <em>Horizon</em> to some of its other platforms. “If you go to the games tab on Facebook, you can find <em>Horizon</em> games,” Shah says, adding that the company was also testing the integration of <em>Horizon</em> games into Instagram.</p><p>Part of this push to bring Horizon Worlds everywhere is the transition to a new game engine to replace the Unity engine the platform was originally built on. “That was the right place to start for us,” Shah says about the popular game engine. However, Unity is primarily known as an engine for developers looking to build single games, while titles like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> tend to run on proprietary engines. “So we made the decision that we’d have to build something much more bespoke for our needs.”</p><p>The new <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/meta-horizon-engine-at-a-glance/">Meta Horizon Engine</a> makes it possible to have many more players in the same world at the same time while also reducing load times. The latter is key to making <em>Horizon</em> feel more like a series of interconnected worlds, and, for instance, allows a group of friends to easily jump from one experience to another without having to spend a lot of time waiting for worlds to load.</p><p>“We’ve done research on this,” he says. “You feel like something takes a long time to load if it’s anywhere over 15 to 20 seconds. It feels much faster if it’s under 15, but the real magic number is under seven [seconds], where it almost feels instantaneous.”</p><p>The new engine will be rolling out in stages. One of the first worlds running on the new engine is Horizon Central, the town square that many people start their journey into Horizon Worlds on. Higher concurrencies also make the new engine the best solution for Horizon Arena, Meta’s concert and events space in VR.</p><p>However, most Quest owners will get their first glimpse of something powered by the new engine as soon as they put on their headset when the company rolls out a redesigned home base soon. “That home environment is just a world,” Shah says.</p><div><p id="everything-is-just-a-world"><h2>Everything is just a world</h2></p></div><p>It’s just a world: That could ultimately become the unofficial tag line for Horizon Worlds. The VR comedy club, meditation space, or 3D shooter? They’re all just worlds. The games your friends are playing on Facebook or Instagram? Also just worlds. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780044/meta-quest-metaverse-hyperscape-capture-vr">virtual replica of your living room</a>, powered by Gaussian splats? Just another world. Future avatar-powered co-presence experiences that will likely be added to wearables like Meta’s Ray-Ban Display glasses? At some point, probably yet another world.</p><p>Turning Horizon Worlds into the connective tissue that ties together social VR hangouts, mobile gaming, and even future XR co-presence experiences is ambitious, to say the least. It will also require the company to make some tough decisions, which could alienate early VR users.</p><p>Meta has taken such steps across its VR efforts in recent years. It stopped updating the original Oculus Quest headset in early 2024, pulled the plug on its fitness tracking service Move <a href="https://www.meta.com/nl-nl/blog/oculus-move-updates-track-your-vr-fitness-stats-and-goals-outside-your-headset/">earlier this year</a>, and has removed some early Horizon Worlds games from the platform. More painful choices may be needed, admits Shah.</p><p>“That’s kind of the phase that we’re in,” he says. “We have to clean up a lot of the core experiences. I’m [spending] a lot of my time just moving throughout the entire OS, saying, ‘Okay, what can we deprecate here? How do we consolidate here?’ We have this amazing ecosystem that’s complex. And if we really want to expand the audience, we’ve got to simplify.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTM1Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Janko Roettgers</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/column/797624/meta-metaverse-horizon-worlds-mobile-vr-social]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s launch day patch was promised to be a big one, and EA weren't lying. The full notes have just arrived ahead of the shooter's launch tomorrow, October 10th. They're over 2700 words long. That's about double the length of my last feature, but solely dedicated to stuff like recoil and times to murderdeath.</p>
<p>If you played the beta, is there anything left you'll actually recognise when you fire up the full version? I've no idea, to be honest, they could have hidden a line about swapping every character model for Mr Bean in here and I'd likely have struggled to clock it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update's dubbed Patch 1.0.1.0 and EA say it's all about "addressing bugs, refining balance, and enhancing clarity throughout the entire experience". I shudder to think how beefy its file size might be.</p>
<p>Headlining as "major updates" are a lot of the things the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-hefty-launch-day-patch-will-bring-over-200-changes-and-ea-know-folks-pine-for-the-sea">announced earlier this week</a>, when they also said they'd heard folks crying out for the ocean. Namely, the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Movement is refined with reduced slide-to-jump momentum, lowered jump height, and increased inaccuracy when firing while airborne or sliding.</li>
<li>Weapon handling has been rebalanced through general recoil tuning and adjustments to ensure more consistent gunplay.</li>
<li>Rush and Breakthrough layouts revised to deliver a better balance between Attackers and Defenders.</li>
<li>Maps improved with better traversal, lighting adjustments, and overall performance upgrades.</li>
<li>UI and HUD have received a range of polish improvements for clearer prompts, smoother navigation, and more accurate displays.</li>
<li>Settings and controls expanded with improvements across multiple areas.</li>
<li>Audio overhauled game-wide with clearer pings, refined weapon and vehicle sounds, and fixes for missing or delayed effects.</li>
<li>Netcode optimized to reduce desync, fast time-to-death, and instances of invisible damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read all of those? Good, you've only got a further 2667 words by my count to go. If you've not equipped the tactical version of your traditional Sunday Papers reading monocle and comfy slippers, I suggest you do it now, Lieutenant videogames.</p>

<p>Right, your eyes are almost certainly clinging on for dear life now, so here's a quick reminder that you can find the exact times for Battlefield 6's full launch on October 10th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-release-time">here</a>. It's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">Edwin's review</a> too, the first paragraph alone had me saluting and pressing F to pay respects to his writing skills. Yes, I know that last bit's a Call of Duty gag, but let me have it.</p>

              <p>Devs behind the sci-fi MMO Phil Spencer liked but canceled anyway form a new studio. More turnover at Halo Studios ahead of its big reveal for the future of the franchise. Would pricing <em>GTA 6</em> at $100 actually be a disaster for Rockstar Games? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I’m doing my best to avoid the <a href="https://x.com/Awk20000/status/1976104048010068331">dog collar conspiracy discourse</a> currently consuming the streaming world and pondering the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-earth-romulan-war-explained-2000669117">deeply mysterious Earth-Romulan war instead</a>. It’s also the <a href="https://www.thepopverse.com/the-full-schedule-for-nycc-2025-day-0-retailer-day-for-all-comics-pros">first day of NYCC 2025</a>. It’s full of toys I don’t need but <a href="https://x.com/VGArtAndTidbits/status/1976295355093340346">desperately want</a>.</p>  <p>Glenn Israel has been an artist working on<em> Halo</em> since he was at Bungie back in 2008. After more than a decade with the franchise, including time serving as a senior concept artist on <em>Halo Infinite</em>, he’s suddenly leaving the studio under mysterious circumstances. The news comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmqrY8ng2GI">amid fresh rumors of growing pains</a> at the studio getting ready to reveal the future of <em>Halo</em> at the 2025 World Championships <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384">later this month</a>.</p>

 <p>“As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe,” Israel <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/">wrote on LinkedIn</a> last week. “There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year. In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are *free to choose*. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values – and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong.”</p>

 <h2><em>The Simpsons</em> are seemingly on their way to <em>Fornite&nbsp;</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE SIMPSONS GLIDER LEAKED <a href="https://t.co/UfWGDw1vrZ">pic.twitter.com/UfWGDw1vrZ</a></p> <p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1976199725121716706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A new datamine leak shows the Kang and Kodos alien ship as a glider. It seems like good timing with the battle royale’s Halloween celebrations rolling out. <em>The Simpsons</em>‘ 37th Treehouse of Horror special is scheduled to air on October 19, 2025.</p>

 <h2>Laid-off devs behind Microsoft’s cancelled sci-fi MMO launch a new studio</h2> <p>The studio’s made of developers who had been working at ZeniMax Online Studios on Project Blackbird and it’s called, fittingly enough, <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight">Sackbird Studios</a>. It’s employee-owned and self-funded. “With internal funding and full creative control, the studio is focused on crafting bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises,” a post on the company website reads.</p>

 <p>“We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people,” said Lee Ridout, Sackbird Studios’ CEO. “When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable.”</p>

 <h2><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> gets a new secret ending in a free update</h2>  <p>It drops October 10 and unlocks after players finish the just-added new game plus mode.</p> <h2><em>MTG</em> head designer pushes back against Universes Beyond “slop” accusations</h2> <p>A pro player’s rant went viral last week as he railed against what he saw as the dilution of<em> Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s identity. “There’s always a line in the sand where people say ‘this is <em>Magic</em>‘ or ‘this is not<em> Magic</em>,’ but everybody’s line is different,” head designer Mark Rosewater said earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minds-behind-magic-the-gathering-say-theyre-making-it-for-anyone-not-everyone/1100-6535324/">proactively responding to criticisms at MagicCon 2025 in Atlanta</a>. “I know your line seems like the line, because it’s so clear of a line to you, but your line is just not everybody’s line. And as the guy who has to make the game, I have to respect everybody’s line.”</p> <p>Rosewater also dunked on <em>MT</em>G’s most popular format to prove his point. “I’m not a Commander fan,” he said. “To me, <em>Magic</em> is a strategic game. I love it because I win when I’m outthinking my opponent. Commander is not a strategic game. It is a political game; you’re playing the people.”</p>

 <h2>Vaporwave love letter <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-story-tribeca-demo-devolver-digital-tony-hawk-1851541108"><em>Skate Story</em></a> finally gets a release date</h2>  <p>It’s coming December 8 to PS5, Switch 2, and PC. No Switch 1 or Xbox versions.</p> <h2>A new report warns against pricing <em>GTA 6</em> at $100</h2> <p>Despite speculation that Rockstar Games’ upcoming sequel could be the first game to break the $100 barrier, a MIDiA Research study claims that less than half of players interested in <em>GTA 6</em> would buy it at that price point.</p> <p>“Our research shows that 59 percent of consumers have some interest in purchasing<em> GTA 6</em>, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game,” analyst Brandon Sutton <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-gta-6-cost-new-research-claims-100-price-point-would-actually-leave-money-on-the-table">told <em>IGN</em></a>. “This notoriety also makes <em>GTA 6</em> the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future.”</p> <p>One response to these findings might be: why not try every price for the game? The increasing popularity of Deluxe Editions shows that you can milk super-fans for all they’re worth and still sell the base version to everyone else.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 reviews are out, the embargo is up, and new BF 6 details are spilling out by the second. One cool detail for PlayStation owners has been revealed, and it’s that the PS5 edition of Battlefield 6 can earn you more XP than other platforms.</p>



<p>The weeks of leaks and back-and-forth rivalry between Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 have culminated in this moment: The long-awaited Battlefield 6 launch. We’ve been assured the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF 6 servers should be ready</a> for the incoming day one rush, and there are even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-6-launch-patch-notes-movement-nerfs-weapon-handling-rebalanced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch patch notes</a> already.</p>



<p>But now multiplayer bonuses revelations are next on the cards.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-earn-more-battlefield-6-multiplayer-xp-on-ps5-than-on-xbox-or-pc">You Can Earn More Battlefield 6 Multiplayer XP on PS5 Than on Xbox or PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Xbox players running to PlayStation. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>As it’s been revealed on social media, if you’re playing Battlefield 6 on PlayStation, you can earn up to 15% additional XP, compared to Xbox and PC users, who are eligible for a maximum of 10%.</p>



<p>This may seem marginal, but it will add up in the long term. With so many player ranks and dozens of Battlefield 6 guns to level up, an extra 5% could be huge.</p>



<p>As it stands, you can earn 5% more XP for owning the game, a further 5% if you join a party, and a final 5% if you “Join a Party With 2+PlayStation Plus Subscribers.”</p>



<p>You can see the evidence for yourself, thanks to <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> will offer +5% additional XP if…</p><p>▪️ You own the game.<br>▪️ You join a party.<br>▪️ You're PlayStation Plus subscriber and join a party with 2+ subscribers.</p><p>These criteria can stack, so PlayStation Plus subscribers can earn up to +15% XP if they meet all of those… <a href="https://t.co/ReHRbnxxhe">pic.twitter.com/ReHRbnxxhe</a></p></div>— Battlefield Bulletin (@BFBulletin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BFBulletin/status/1976305653078507716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Do you think this minor benefit could encourage people to buy Battlefield 6 on PlayStation over Xbox and PC? With Call of Duty leaning heavily into Xbox over the years—thanks to the Microsoft and Activision merger—could this be the start of an exclusive partnership between PlayStation and Battlefield? Let us know in the comments and through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

In addition, the free patch will feature an outfit from Raiders of the Lost Ark, voice language select, and other general fixes.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/55hh0soSvjTmCwqR6X2VyB/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-machinegames-anniversary-update">the game's website</a>, MachineGames notes that New Game Plus and the Cairo outfit were highly requested from the community. New Game Plus unlocks after completing the main story and will let players keep their unlocked Adventure Books. Since Indy should be stronger, MachineGames recommends pushing the difficulty up a notch. Last but not least, there's a new after-credits scene for players who finish Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on New Game Plus.</p>

      </div>

                <p>Longtime Xbox devotees have recently seen several former exclusive games go to PlayStation 5, while Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised prices on Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox consoles in the US</a>. Now, one of Xbox's original team members, Laura Fryer, is calling out her former employer and describing the price increases as a "betrayal" of the trust that gamers placed in them.</p><p>"With this latest increase to Game Pass, Xbox threw away one of their last advantages," said Fryer in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGh1-W-nYQA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest YouTube video</a>. "They were the best deal in gaming... With these price hikes, it feels like a betrayal, like greed over gaming... I recognize that this Xbox console generation isn't over yet, it's almost certainly going to be remembered first and foremost for Microsoft's greed."</p><p>Fryer went on to recap the two hardware price increases this generation, three separate Game Pass price increases, more expensive games, massive layoffs, and multiple studio layoffs.</p><p>"I believe all of these changes and drama will harm Microsoft's brand," said Fryer. "It appears that Xbox is moving towards cloud gaming and away from hardware, but it also could be that they're just incompetent, that they just don't understand what they're doing... They need to rebuild trust with gamers and fans. I know people on the Xbox team that are still there that were there in the early days... They can fix this and I'm rooting for them and wishing them the best."</p><p>Fryer previously shared her belief that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-no-desire-to-make-hardware-anymore-founding-team-member-says/1100-6532825/" data-ref-id="1100-6532825">Xbox is abandoning hardware</a> by outsourcing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a> to Asus.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony and AMD just announced three key technologies that look likely to come to the PlayStation 6 and future AMD graphics cards, with PS5 system architect Mark Cerny and AMD senior vice president Jack Huynh teaming up to deliver the news. The talk is fairly technical, but the three core features - Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores and Universal Compression - look set to make a big impact on future AMD-based hardware. The main goal is speeding up computionally-expensive ray tracing and path tracing in some novel ways, as well as reducing the cost of the upscaling and denoising techniques they rely on. </p>
<p>Let's start with Neural Arrays. In short, this is a new arrangement of the dozens of Compute Units (CUs) that make up a graphics processor like that in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. Normally each of these CUs work alone on a bite-sized piece of the puzzle, which makes sense for most tasks, but can be inefficient for upscaling techniques like FSR or PSSR. Neural Arrays therefore link multiple CUs together in a "smart, efficient way", like a "single, focused AI engine". </p>
<p>The benefit is that this ought to allow for bigger (and therefore higher quality) machine learning models, with less overhead and better scalability. To say it another way, it means that an upscaling algorithm like PSSR ought to run faster at a given quality level, or accomplish more in a given time frame. The same speed-up also applies to denoising algorithms, which are important for ray-traced or path-traced graphics. </p>

<p>Huynh also promises that Neural Arrays will allow for new features, including "dedicated innovations that bring cinematic rendering to an entirely new level." </p>
<p>Radiance Cores are the second new technology, and they're firmly a hardware change. Essentially, this is a new dedicated hardware block in next-generation AMD graphics processors that's "designed for unified light transport", ie ray tracing and path tracing. In the PC space, Nvidia has long held a ray tracing performance advantage thanks to its RT cores, and it looks like finally AMD is adopting a similar strategy. </p><p>Just as other dedicated hardware we've seen appear in graphics cards over the years, such as those that deal with media encoding or AI processing, Radiance Cores accomplish their given task faster than doing the same thing on more generic hardware. This speeds up the intensive work of ray traversal - "digging through complex data structures to locate where the millions of rays being cast hit the millions of triangles in the scene geometry". </p>
<p>As well as the speed-up from having dedicated hardware, this change also unburdens the CPU and the rest of the GPU - so that they can perform the things they're best suited for, such as simulation and geometry on the CPU and shading and lighting on the GPU. </p>

</figure><figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final bit of tech Sony and AMD announced is called Universal Compression, and thankfully it's a bit easier to explain. In short, it's a system that compresses everything that goes out to GPU memory, rather than just a few data types like textures, as is currently the case on the PS5 and PS5 Pro. Again, this is along similar lines to an existing Nvidia technology, in this case Neural Texture Compression. </p><p>By adding this compression step, effective GPU memory bandwidth is much higher. That means frame-rates might increase if you're bandwidth-limited, but more importantly it allows for higher-quality assets and reduces power consumption too. This technique has broad positive implications, but it also specifically helps make both Neural Arrays and Radiance Cores more effective. </p>
<p>These technologies currently exist only in simulation, according to Cerny, but clearly both parties are confident enough to detail them at this early stage. Huynh also mentions that AMD is aiming to bring the technologies to developers "across every gaming platform", which would follow in the company's general approach of open-sourcing its graphics innovations. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Universal Compression is a more extreme version of the Delta Color Compression used on the PS5 and PS5 Pro, which compresses all data sent to graphics memory.  | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It will be fascinating to see how these technologies work when they start to be realised in real hardware, and given the Project Amethyst partnership thus far, it seems reasonable to assume that the two companies will make further announcements over the next few years as the tech gets closer to completion - and when the expected PlayStation 6 is officially announced. </p><p>Beyond the rumoured PlayStation 6, we could also see these approaches being used in a PlayStation or Windows-based gaming handheld. Power consumption and memory bandwidth limitations are key challenges for any mobile form factor, so no doubt the likes of Valve, Asus and Lenovo would be mighty interested in any significant advancements. Valve has famously said that they're waiting for a "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-deck-wont-have-yearly-refreshes-because-its-not-really-fair-to-your-customers-says-valve">generational leap</a>" to justify a Steam Deck 2, and this might just qualify. </p>
<p>Similarly, this is huge news for fans of AMD desktop graphics cards, which have traditionally offered great price to performance in rasterised games and plenty of VRAM, but have fallen behind Nvidia alternatives in terms of RT performance and other features. AMD could massively close the gap here, and that's an exciting prospect. </p>
<p>Either way, I'm happy to see Sony and AMD share the fruits of their partnership so openly, and it's certainly food for thought when it comes to seeing how Sony, AMD and other tech giants are looking to circumvent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-how-playstation-5-pro-lays-the-groundwork-for-ps6-and-beyond">the rise in silicon costs</a> that has prevented faster, cheaper models from arriving this console generation. </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/797640/sony-ps6-handheld-gpu-ray-path-tracing-amd-radiance-cores</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-teases-new-gpu-tech-for-the-ps6.1320976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony’s next console (presumably the PS6) is coming in “a few years time,” according to someone who I’d believe to make that claim. Mark Cerny, lead architect on the PS5 and PS5 Pro, joined Jack Huynh, SVP and GM of AMD’s computing and graphics group, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">YouTube video</a> wherein the pair spend nine minutes going through some very specific, co-developed advancements in graphics technology that will come to the next console. But the pair cautioned that the technologies are still in “very early days” and “only exist in simulation right now.”</p><p>Much of it boils down to how the companies are working to make it easier for future GPUs to handle graphics upscaling, ray tracing, and the super-intensive path tracing techniques used to make game worlds look more realistic. Cerny says “the current approach has reached its limit,” so Sony is working with AMD to integrate components of its next-gen RDNA architecture in future consoles. AMD’s Huynh introduced Radiance Cores (similar in theory to Nvidia’s RT Cores) that are dedicated to handling ray tracing and path tracing. In addition to Sony’s new consoles having the new cores, they will almost certainly be built into AMD’s future desktop GPUs, too, and likely within whatever it’s assisting with in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">Xbox partnership</a>.</p><p>The Radiance Cores supposedly deliver a speed boost to performance, freeing up other components to quickly process shaders and textures instead of having to spin so many plates, so to speak. This new GPU tech will also benefit from advancements in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/671961/amd-fsr-redstone-rdna-4">AMD’s FSR Redstone</a>, its latest AI-assisted upscaling technology, such as Neural Radiance Caching, as well as likely whatever upscaling tech comes after.</p><p>Another key area of improvement is compression, which will free up more bandwidth for GPUs to run future games at peak performance and fidelity. Sony’s improving on the Delta Color Compression technique (used on the PS5 and PS5 Pro) that compress textures and render targets. Its next hardware will utilize the new, more efficient technique called Universal Compression that compresses <em>everything </em>in the pipeline. Huynh says this will let the GPU deliver “more detail, higher frame rates, and greater efficiency.” More compression could raise the performance ceiling of a GPU, so it should also let it run more efficiently in a low-power mode, should the need arise.</p><p>Speaking of, it’s easy to see how these improvements could benefit the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">rumored PlayStation handheld</a> that’s allegedly in development. Sony and AMD’s work to reduce the stress on GPUs could theoretically be applied to any form factor, such as a handheld. Sony has already made strides in efficiency on the PS5, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712212/sony-ps5-power-saver-handheld-rumors">new Power Saver mode</a> that can scale back game performance in favor of lower power consumption.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is one of EA’s most important launches in years. As the company becomes laser-focused on big, bankable franchises and looks to compete with the beast that is Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em>, EA needs <em>Battlefield 6</em> to be a hit when it debuts on October 10th — especially after the previous game in the series had a rough release — and it’s putting an incredible amount of effort into making it successful. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">recently announced $55 billion deal to take EA private</a> has only upped the stakes.</p><p>“EA’s fate is tightly tied to <em>Battlefield</em>,” New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells <em>The Verge</em>. “If <em>Battlefield 6</em> underperforms, it will call into question the strength of EA’s non-sports portfolio. At that point, the company faces pressure to rethink its strategy, perhaps even to divest and lean more heavily on the dependable sports business. It makes <em>Battlefield</em> a bellwether that will tell us if EA can still compete in blockbuster shooters.”</p><p>The pressure for <em>Battlefield 6</em> started building almost immediately after <em>Battlefield 2042</em>’s disastrous 2021 debut. The multiplayer-only <em>2042</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc">added huge, 128-player battles</a> to a franchise already known for epic multiplayer skirmishes. But the game had a rough, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-bugs-fixes-known-issues">bug-filled launch</a> that necessitated multiple patches <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-1">shortly</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-2">after</a> <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-3?isLocalized=true">release</a>. EA <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814517/ea-battlefield-vince-zampella-apex-legends-respawn-boss-ceo-shakeup">moved quickly</a> to put Vince Zampella, cofounder of <em>Apex Legends</em>-maker Respawn Entertainment and former head of <em>Call of Duty</em> studio Infinity Ward, in charge of the <em>Battlefield</em> series to help right the ship. But the damage was already done. A few months after <em>2042</em> came out, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913193/ea-battlefield-2042-launch-expectations">put things bluntly</a> on an earnings call: “The launch of <em>Battlefield 2042</em> did not meet expectations.”</p><p>The <em>Battlefield</em> series kicked off with <em>Battlefield 1942</em> in 2002, and even that first game had a reputation for its big multiplayer battles. I have a memory of a hectic, shenanigans-filled match in an older <em>Battlefield</em> at a LAN cafe when I was a teenager. But the franchise has been steadily overtaken by Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em> as <em>the</em> multiplayer shooter — especially because <em>COD</em> now has an enormous amount of resources behind it for annual releases and major <em>Warzone</em> updates.</p><p>Despite the rocky launch, EA has kept <em>2042</em> going, even releasing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-9-2-0">a surprise update in August</a> that added new weapons, vehicles, and a map. But it’s been clear for a long time that EA has been focusing much more on the <em>future</em> of the <em>Battlefield</em> franchise. Activision has several dedicated studios focused on <em>Call of Duty</em> that lets it launch a new blockbuster game nearly every year. <em>Battlefield</em> has historically been developed by Dice, but EA roped in three additional studios — Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect — to create a new Battlefield Studios structure so that it can make a better push to compete. (EA reportedly wants to get <em>Battlefield</em> on a similar type of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/analyst-says-ea-plans-to-milk-battlefield-for-everything-its-worth-their-goal-is-three-studios-making-battlefield-on-a-3-year-basis-so-they-can-get-to-battlefield-annually/">annual release cadence as <em>Call of Duty</em></a>.)</p><p>Even though EA is also known for titles like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, most of its money comes from a small number of franchises, along with add-ons like microtransactions and battle passes. Live service revenue is already big money for EA; according to its most recent <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Q1-FY26-Earnings-Release-FINAL1.pdf">quarterly earnings report</a>, 83 percent of its net revenue came from “live services and other.” If <em>Battlefield 6</em> is successful over the long term, that potentially makes the game a big cash cow for EA.</p><div><p>Perhaps more than anything, if <em>Battlefield 6</em> is a success, it gives the company another annual game that’s almost a sure hit. EA found a way to keep its soccer franchise going even after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23065405/ea-sports-fc-fifa-branding">dropped the <em>FIFA</em> branding</a>. It brought back an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158294/ea-sports-brings-college-football-back-to-game-consoles-on-july-19th">annual college football game last year</a>, meaning it now has two American football titles it can release annually. The next-generation release in <em>The Sims</em> series, codenamed “Project Rene,” will be free and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870172/project-rene-next-gen-sims-free">won’t replace</a> the hugely successful <em>The Sims 4</em>, which just got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-adventure-awaits-expansion-is-exactly-the-kind-of-getaway-ive-been-looking-for">its 20th expansion</a>. EA even just launched a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date">live service version of <em>Skate</em></a>, and even though that’s still in early access, <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1975229570807890000">more than 15 million players have already tried it</a>.</p></div><p>Beyond overcoming the stigma of <em>2042’s</em> poor launch, <em>Battlefield 6</em> also has the uphill battle of competing with the many other enduring multiplayer shooters on the market like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, and <em>Valorant</em> (a lesson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">Sony learned the hard way</a>). Those also all have the advantage of being free-to-play games, while EA has to convince people to shell out a minimum of $69.99 for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, something that’s especially challenging when a third of video game players buy a new game less often than once per year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">according to Circana data</a>. It’s not an impossible hurdle — the annual <em>Call of Duty</em> releases <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/circana-confirms-black-ops-6-is-2024s-biggest-hit-but-overall-game-spend-in-the-us-falls-9-yoy">still do numbers</a> — but EA has its work cut out.</p><div><p>And this was all the case <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">EA announced a $55 billion deal to take the company private</a> — a deal that includes $20 billion of debt financing. Should the deal go through, that debt adds a lot of money that the new version of EA will have to pay down, and the company could lean on <em>Battlefield 6</em> — and the in-development <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing"><em>Battlefield</em> battle royale</a> as well as future <em>Battlefield</em> titles — to help. The deal could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">also eventually mean</a> cost-cutting measures like layoffs, like what Microsoft did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">following its Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>.</p></div><p>From what I’ve played of <em>Battlefield 6</em>, I feel like EA’s efforts may have paid off. I’ve spent the most time with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw4WBofOkLE">single-player campaign</a>, a gripping thriller where an unstable NATO has to fight back against a shadowy private military group called Pax Armata. So far, it’s filled with chaotic firefights where I almost always feel like I survive by the skin of my teeth. One memorable mission involved night vision goggles, rising tensions between the city’s citizens and Pax Armata, and, eventually, taking down a helicopter. Though, in a chilling moment that made me lose some appetite to keep playing, the in-game helicopter once flew by at the same time <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/us/oregon-national-guard-trump-ruling-portland-hnk">a real military helicopter flew over</a> my home in Portland.</p><p>I’ve only dabbled a bit in multiplayer, but the matches I’ve played have been frantic and exciting, and I really like playing with a lot of other soldiers around me. (Even if, because of the relatively small playerbase during the review period, I was usually playing mostly against bots.) I’m a poor shot, so when I would get frustrated dying over and over again, I’d focus on reviving my teammates. And while the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/pc-portal-experience">sandbox Portal mode</a> wasn’t available during the review period, I’m guessing players will create some wild, imaginative new experiences that could be worth coming back for.</p><p>Early signs look good for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and it has all of the pieces in place for a successful launch. But <em>Battlefield 6</em> needs to be more than that — it needs to be a hit long after it first comes out. The future of EA depends on it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal]]></content:encoded>
