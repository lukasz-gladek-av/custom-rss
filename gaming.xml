			<p>It has been a while since I’ve played a game that has been styled on the classic look of games from the Game Boy era, and one that captures some of that experience too. The most obvious and repeated comparison is to the classic Pokémon games, but The Edge of Allegoria is not a game for kids and doesn’t have you capturing creatures to fight for you.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Edge of Allegoria - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZm_VTFuGjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Edge of Allegoria is crude, full of sexual references, and a load of swearing. Your character is a bit of loser who ends up wandering Allegoria completing quests for not always appreciative people, learning of the plight of Allegoria that is living under the shadow of an evil god and his generals, though most of these enemies seem to keep to themselves in their bases.</p>


<p>Before facing off against them though, your character will face off against all sorts. If you can think of it, it is probably in the game as an enemy or closely resembled. Want to fight a crow? Sure, you can fight a crow. How about deer? Yep. Nymphs? So many. Witches, vampires, ninjas, samurai, djinn, tengu, demons, zombies, succubus? Yep, yep, yep. They are just some of the approximately 150 enemies to fight against.</p>


<p>Combat in The Edge of Allegoria looks an awful lot like the classic Game Boy Pokémon, but instead of creatures, you’re the one doing the fighting and your success is all dependent on the weapons and equipment you buy and find. As you use weapons and equipment, you will gain mastery of them. This mastery boosts your character’s base stats while unlocking also different attacks.</p>
<p>You can have a maximum of five moves to use and it is advisable to regularly change weapons and moves to figure out the best tactics for you. Some moves inflict status effects including poison, burn, bleed, drowsiness, stiffness, and mad. Poison and burn deal damage over time, while bleed, drowsiness, and stiffness can impact defence, attack, and agility. Mad boosts all your stats, except accuracy which drops significantly. There are also moves that allow you to counter attacks and guard against them too.</p>
<p>The overall combat is decent enough, but you will need to stock up on items as you will experience so many status ailments in fights. If you are not prepared, some fights that should be easy will become a challenge to pass.</p>

<p>There is a fairly basic story in The Edge of Allegoria, which centres around a falling out between gods, and one group making you a champion as you are an Anomaly. The quests of the game tackle all sorts of adult themes, including murder, suicide, drug use, and sex fetishes. There are a ton of quests just on the main route, plus a number of smaller side quests to complete with many being fetch quests. Most of these rely on enemies dropping the right item, so prepare for some fighting!</p>
<p>The world design is fine, though there were quite a few times where it was not clear what needed to be done next, leading to some aimless wandering until stumbling across a progression point. There is one dungeon near the end that has you teleporting around rooms, but there is no map to use so you have to make note yourself of where the portals are taking you, eventually finding the boss room. Another dungeon had a lot of doors to open, and the game even comments on this with the main character getting frustrated at it. It is frustrating.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-dock-60w-charger/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another day, another Nintendo Switch 2 leak. Today, a new partial picture of the system's dock started making the rounds online, providing new information on the yet-to-be-revealed consoles.</p>
<p>The new picture of the dock, which was shared online today by Laura Kate Dale, features visible input and output voltage information with other information having been oscured, likely to protect the identity of the trusted source that provided the picture. Additionally, the system will reportedly ship with a 60W charger for use with the dock. As a result, any charging cable compatible with the current system won't be usable for powering the Nintendo Switch 2 when docked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As a result, to my understanding, the current generation Switch mains charger cable won't be suitable for use powering the Switch 2 when docked.</p>
<p>— Laura Kate Dale - Bluesky @LauraKBuzz.bsky.social (@LaurakBuzz) <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurakBuzz/status/1876581690946081024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At this point, the only thing regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 that has yet to be leaked are the games, as in the past few days, we have managed to get a sneak peek at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">system as a whole</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/">motherboard</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/">dock</a>, and even the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/">Joy-Con controllers</a>, which could also be used as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/">PC mouse</a>. The pictures of the motherboard, in particular, have been notable for having confirmed how the T239 chip that powers the system is being produced by Samsung. While the process node is still unknown, there's a high chance the chip is an 8nm SoC, mostly due to the trouble that would involve <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-ampere-efficiency-goals/">porting NVIDIA Ampere architecture to other process nodes</a> instead of using another architecture altogether.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but with almost daily leaks, there's no doubt that an official announcement isn't too far off. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The US Department of Defense has labelled Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - a huge player in the global video games industry - as a Chinese military company. 
</p>
<p>
Tencent itself has responded to say the label is inaccurate, and a "misunderstanding". 
</p>
<p>
The listing of Tencent as a Chinese military company does not immediately impact its ability to do business in the US, but raises the risk of complications in the future. 
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337489/tencent-catl-us-defense-department-chinese-military-companies">The Verge</a>, drone company DJI has seen its US imports blocked since it was added to the same list. But other companies, such as Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, have been added and then removed.
</p>
<p>
In 2020, President Trump issued an executive order which stated that US businesses could not invest in Chinese companies linked to the US military. Trump is set to return to power later this month.
</p>
<p>
"We are not a military company or supplier," Tencent spokesperson Danny Marti said. "Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding."
</p>
<p>
Tencent's reach across the global video games industry is enormous. It owns <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> maker Funcom and UK outfit Sumo Digital, in addition to several of its own companies such as Pokémon Unite maker Timi Studios.
</p><p>
In addition, Tencent owns majority stakes in Dying Light developer Techland, Rime studio Tequila Works, plus mobile studios Miniclip and Supercell. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Unreal Engine maker Epic Games is 35 percent owned by Tencent, while the company also holds notable stakes in FromSoftware, Remedy, Krafton, Paradox, Frontier, Kadokawa, Marvelous, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> and Netmarble.
</p>
<p>
And then there's Ubisoft - another company in which Tencent holds a stake - which is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">in discussions with the Chinese company over a potential stock buyout</a>, in a bid to stabilise the troubled Assassin's Creed maker.

<p>Forza Horizon 3 continued the series' open world gameplay racing, this time set in Australia.</p>
<p>The decision to reboot the servers contrasts with Ubisoft shutting down its racer The Crew last year, for which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sued-over-controversial-the-crew-shutdown">it was sued</a>.

            <p>Imagine the scene: you've just got your hands on that physical Switch game you've been waiting for. Hurrah! But as you open the box, your heart and soul full of giddy anticipation, your eyes land not on that oh-so-special cartridge but an eye staring back at you.</p>
<p>This is what has happened to multiple Switch owners who have reported that, instead of a game, they have instead found themselves presented with a plastic googly eye in its place. Actually. We have come from Goggle Box to Googly Box.</p>

<p>The reports of this eye-sore phenomenon made the rounds with more vigour over the festive period, but it has seemingly been happening for a little while now. "This is what I found when I opened my brand new sealed copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> from Walmart," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1fqg8gv/this_is_what_i_found_when_i_opened_my_brand_new/">one reddit post</a> from several months ago, with a picture of the offending eye.</p>
<p>It seems that because the googly eye sounds a lot like a cartridge when the box is shaken, many have understandably presumed the contents are legit. And, really, why wouldn't they.</p>

<p>As the publication noted, because those concerned weren't expecting to open their box to see an eye instead of a game, they didn't take a video documenting the moment, which is fair enough.</p>

Brooks included two open job listings for research engineers and scientists who will help to advance AI “world models” capable of simulating real-world scenarios by solving problems around training “at massive scale,” curating training data, and studying how they can be integrated with multimodal language models.</p><p>“We believe scaling pretraining on video and multimodal data is on the critical path to artificial general intelligence,” <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/deepmind/jobs/6503217">DeepMind said in the job descriptions</a>. “World models will power numerous domains, such as visual reasoning and simulation, planning for embodied agents, and real-time interactive entertainment.”</p><p>The race to be the first to declare AGI is heating up, so Google’s focus here isn’t surprising. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337106/sam-altman-says-openai-knows-how-to-build-agi-blog-post">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said</a> that the company has cracked how to achieve the tech industry’s long-sought benchmark, and that autonomous AI agents may start to meaningfully join workforces this year.</p><div><p>There are several competitors who already have a head start over DeepMind’s world modeling project, including <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-cosmos-world-foundation-model-platform-to-accelerate-physical-ai-development">Nvidia’s Cosmos platform</a> for advancing physical AI, autonomous vehicle, and robot development; and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200496/ai-fei-fei-li-world-labs-andreessen-horowitz-radical-ventures">World Labs startup created by “the godmother of AI,” Fei-Fei Li</a>.</p></div><p>The new DeepMind team will work alongside existing Google AI projects including its flagship Gemini AI models, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312938/google-veo-generative-ai-video-model-available-preview">Veo video generator</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313409/a-google-ai-model-can-create-playable-virtual-worlds-on-the-fly">Genie</a> — Google’s prior world model for simulating playable 3D environments in real-time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you gotta go fast, you probably don't want to be a stubby-legged spearman who climbs every ladder like a geriatric walrus. Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a> speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection. </p>

<p>Barbuta itself was completed in 4 minutes 55 seconds by player "GrayGooGlitch". It's only 11 seconds short of <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/UFO_50/runs/yj9wdgnz">the fastest existing run</a>. The unrepentantly obscure game is full of old-school trickery, like specific pools of toxic slime that won't hurt you, walls that secretly lack collision, and spike pitfalls with invisible bridges. But it's the randomly fluttering bats that give players the most trouble, as they did here just moments into the run.</p>
<p>But the UFO 50 marathon was also a team effort. Three other players zipped through their own game choices in the allotted time, swapping the controller just like in the good old days of losing a life to a hateful chicken. The next game was Rakshasa, a tough-as-old-boots action game with lots of upsetting frogs. The runner polished it off in 8 minutes and 22 seconds. Then came Night Manor, a point and click horror game with a ton of classical item puzzling but with a killer that follows you through the rooms and will come hunting you if you make noise by doing certain actions like activating a jukebox. They got through that in 6 minutes 20 seconds.</p><p>Finally, it was Warptank, a kind of anti-platformer about a nippy space tank that can't jump but can teleblorp to the surface immediately above it. When I played it for our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ufo-50-review">UFO 50 review</a>, each screen was both a fight with the pixel enemies and a puzzle to figure out. When runner "SpootyBiscuit" plays, he turns it into a rhythmic waltz of warping, sparking off forty-five degree angles and blasting troublesome worms with ease. It was the toughest game to get through, with a time of 28 minutes 27 seconds.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a nifty showcase of the retro-styled games contained within UFO 50, all of which contain some twist inspired by modern game design. Awesome Games Done Quick began at the weekend and runs until this Sunday. Other recent speedruns include a blast through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rain-world-downpour">Rain World: Downpour</a>, but we're still waiting on the player who intends to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-this-years-big-speedrunning-fest-elden-ring-bosses-will-be-defeated-with-the-power-of-saxophone">beat Elden Ring bosses with nothing but his saxophone</a> and a jazzy attitude. That's happening on Thursday. I look forward to it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider <em>slightly</em> hypocritical, given the character's visual design.</p>
<p>Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.</p><!--more-->

<p>I know about the Jimbo's Big Naturals mod because Graham, ever the mercurial wayfinder, posted it in our Slack yesterday. It's the work of artist, fanfic writer and "shitpost artisan" <a href="https://linktr.ee/prettypinkpansy">prettypinkpansy</a>, who came up with the idea while "trapped in bed with a migraine". Presumably delirious and raving, they rose from the sweat-soaked sheets, fired up Aseprite, and went to work. There were some mighty hurdles to overcome. "i cannot give titties to to-do list", <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3leysd5upls2o">reads</a> one despairing Bluesky update. Some hours <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3leyve36eyk2h">later</a>: "let it not be said i am unwilling to admit when i am wrong". The results can now be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/prettypinkpansy/jimbos-big-naturals">Github</a>. Here's some blurb from the creator:</p>
<blockquote>"Jimbo's Big Naturals is a simple edit of Balatro's existing assets to give the jokers boobs. It is not intended to be a "gender swap" mod, though you may view it as making the jokers ladies if that pleases you. It is just the existing jokers, but now they have boobs. I made it myself using Aseprite. It covers 122 of the 150 Jokers in Balatro. Other places where Joker imagery appears (such as wax seals, booster packs, and the Wraith spectral card) are also affected."</blockquote>
<p>To be absolutely clear, this ain't some pendulous waifu mod for the gamerz: it's, dare I say, tasteful, whatever that means, and very much safe for work, assuming you have the kind of workplace where people don't frown upon the spectacle of a busty walkie talkie.</p><p>"No nipples are onscreen," prettypinkpansy explains. "The closest thing to anything scandalous is that Half Joker has a bare chest, but it's torn too badly so that it obscures anything of note." If you don't want to install, you can always view the whole modded sprite sheet <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8b993577e5ede9ff3a9ccc99609bc64c2e36aa601d98850f636dca77f6248e71/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f666336386934432e706e67">here</a>. Given that prettypinkpansy doesn't specify exactly which cards have undergone Big Naturalisation, there's some innocent amusement to be had scrutinising seemingly boobless cards for subtle modifications.</p>
<p>I like Jimbo's Big Naturals. It's that magic kind of mod that is both very silly and surprisingly crafty. It's also a testament to the variety and imagination of Balatro's pixelart card designs: applying the same bodily adjustments to all of them has required a certain amount of imagination in turn. Yes, <em>that's</em> why I'm writing this up. Not because I'm almost 40 and still giggle at the idea of a banana with boobs. Some closing trivia: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3lf34ffhn6s23">this</a> is the developer's favourite Big Naturals card, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3lf34o2p5uc23">this</a> is the one that was hardest to create.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>While Modern Warfare cost $640m.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</a> cost a staggering $700m (£557m) to develop, a new report has revealed. 
</p>
<p>
2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare cost $640m (£509), while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 3 cost $450m (£358), according to figures confirmed by publisher Activision in a court filing, reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare">Game File</a>.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, these figures cover each game's cost over their full lifecycle, it's claimed, suggesting this also covers the development of post-launch support. On the other, these figures do not include the separate amount spent on marketing, which will almost certainly include additional hundreds of millions of dollars per title. 
</p>
<p>
The numbers dwarf the development budgets of pretty much every other video game we've heard about - though development budgets are notoriously kept under-wraps. 
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 cost $220m to make, according to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-court-documents-removed-after-redacted-details-spotted">poorly-redacted court document from Sony published in 2023</a>. That same document also revealed a similar $212m cost to develop <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, with 300 employees attached to the project for up to five years. 
</p>
<p>
Is Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War the most expensive video game ever made? Probably not, but for a relatively standalone boxed product, it is exceptional. 
</p>
<p>
As for what is the most expensive - well, things get more tricky when discussing live-service games. Gacha-powered anime role-player <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> is estimated to have cost $900m to date, with $100m spent on initial development then $200m each year since. Typically, most companies do not divulge such numbers, however. (I'd love to know how much Epic Games has spent on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to date.)
</p><p>
"We need to address... the exploding cost of game development," former chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-comes-a-time-when-we-all-declare-the-war-is-over-former-playstation-studios-boss-shawn-layden-on-the-future-of-video-game-consoles">Shawn Layden told Eurogamer last month</a>, when discussing the issues facing the video games industry today - such as a lack of originality due to the conservatism that comes with having to risk such huge sums making games. 
</p>
<p>
"The PS4 generation, which was the last I was associated with, game dev was 150m if you want to be top of the line, and that's before marketing," Layden said. "So by that math, PS5 games should eventually reach $300m to $400m - and that is just outright not sustainable.
</p>
<p>
"It's like we're at the end of the 18th century, and we're realising that building cathedrals is really expensive. Can we continue to build these massive edifices to God for this incredible amount of labour and time? Or should we just build four walls and a roof, and that's a church, right? I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further. In fact, it's probably grown too far already."

			<p>A Steam Deck 2 powered by the newly announced AMD Ryzen Z2 is not in the works, a Valve employee confirmed.</p>
<p>Following the rumors that started circulating online after the announcement of the next-gen AMD APUs for future iterations of portable gaming systems which suggested that a Steam Deck 2 was in the works, Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed on Bluesky that there is and there won't be a Z2 Steam Deck, specifying how the slide that accompanied the APUs' announcement was just meant to highlight how they were meant for portable gaming systems, and they were not announcing anything specific.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fujt6oiklsacwfkoqyzwiu2z/app.bsky.feed.post/3lf36y66ggs2b" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigjmkrybod6dx43kordi2sff6iwzfq4xhquu67fo2chk5i3vs7cdy">
<p lang="en">There is and will be no Z2 Steam Deck. Guessing the slide was meant to say the series is meant for products like that, not announcing anything specific.</p>

<p>While we won't see a Steam Deck 2 powered by any of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/">AMD Ryzen Z2 APUs</a> announced during CES 2025, it won't take long to see what the next-generation chips can bring to the portable gaming space. The first APUs will make their debut in the first quarter of the year, which will also likely be when the first portable systems powered by them will appear on the market.</p>
<p>With no Steam Deck 2 on the horizon, the OLED model featuring a much better screen and some light improvements over the base model will continue to be the go-to system for those wishing to enter the portable gaming space with Valve hardware. More information on the original system released back in 2022 can be found in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A number of big NVIDIA ACE announcements were shared during the company's CES 2025 keynote. NVIDIA has expanded its ACE (Avatar Cloud Engine) technology, originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-unveils-ace-model-for-next-gen-games-integrating-ai-into-virtual-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Computex 2023, in various ways. The improved tech will provide AI-powered allies and foes in multiple big PC games.</p>
<p>KRAFTON, for example, has gone all-in on NVIDIA ACE. Its leading product, PUBG, will add 'co-playable characters' through the so-called PUBG Ally feature. Powered by the Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k-instruct small language model (SMM), PUBG Ally lets AI teammates communicate using game-specific lingo, provide strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and even fight other players.</p>
<p>KRAFTON CEO CH Kim said:</p>
<p><em>CES 2025 marks a significant milestone for KRAFTON and NVIDIA as we work together to unveil AI technology that will revolutionize the gaming industry. We plan to closely collaborate with NVIDIA to drive the transformation of the user experience with AI-powered innovation, such as CPC, that promises to redefine the future of gaming.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEKUSMqrbzQ?si=qI8HIZZ8b5iO51mj" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inZoi</a>, KRAFTON's upcoming life simulation game, is also using NVIDIA ACE with a spin of its own on the co-playable characters concept. The so-called 'Smart Zoi' will dynamically adapt to what's happening around them and react based on their personalities. For example, a Smart Zoi with a considerate personality could notice a hungry man on the street, go to the food store and grab him something to eat. In another instance, they might help a lost woman by giving them directions.</p>
<p>Kangwook Lee, Head of Deep Learning Division at KRAFTON, said:</p>
<p><em>PUBG IP Franchise's PUBG Ally and inZOI's Smart Zoi, rising as the world's first CPC (Co-Playable Character) built with NVIDIA ACE, are unlocking new and unique experiences. At KRAFTON, we’re excited by the possibilities of ACE autonomous game characters and how AI will enhance the way we create games.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA ACE | inZOI - Create Simulated Cities with Co-Playable Characters" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pk9z1upOj3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Other developers are also implementing similar NVIDIA ACE powered features in their games. For example, NetEase has announced that AI teammates will be added to its highly successful free-to-play Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint. These NPCs will join the player's party, battle alongside them, find specific items that they might need, swap gear, offer suggestions on which skills to unlock, and fight smartly to help the player win.</p>
<p>Zhipeng Hu, Head of Thunder Fire BU and SVP of NetEase, stated:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA enables game developers to push past expected boundaries with AI technology. NVIDIA ACE in NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION allows us to create AI autonomous characters that allows us to create AI autonomous teammates running on the device locally that naturally assist the player in their epic battles.</em></p>
<p>The feature is coming in March to the mobile version of NARAKA: Bladepoint playable on PC, while the native PC version is getting it later this year.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Korean developer Wemade is going to use it in its MIR5 MMORPG to power what they're calling the world's first AI boss, Asterion, Lord of the Void. MMORPG players know all too well that even the most complicated bosses are static and, therefore, predictable for humans. The goal here with NVIDIA ACE is to change all that forever.</p>
<p>The AI model enables Asterion to analyze the party, identify each player's unique skills, and determine who to attack first, such as the healer, traditionally the weakest character. Asterion also recalls past battles similar to the current situation and then determines the most probable course of action to achieve victory. The boss will also constantly adapt, attacking with unpredictable patterns so that it cannot be defeated twice with the same strategy.</p>
<p>Jung Soo Park, CEO of Wemade Next, said:</p>
<p><em>Together with NVIDIA, we have begun a new era of gaming with NVIDIA ACE autonomous game characters. MIR5’s AI bosses are a milestone moment in gaming, enabling unique boss encounters with every play session. We’re excited to see how this technology transforms games.</em></p>

<p>NVIDIA ACE is being utilized in many different ways by developers. For example, the upcoming murder mystery game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628740/Dead_Meat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Meat</a> will use it to power its fully dynamic conversations locally. The game previously used LLMs via cloud, but at CES 2025, they showed locally generated dialogue running on a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU.</p>
<p>Developer Meaning Machine integrated ACE and NVIDIA's Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-128K small language model (SLM), Eleven Labs' Text To Speech (TTS), and Open AI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) into its own Game Conscious AI system.</p>

<p>GoodAI's sandbox game AI People features AI-driven NPCs that interact autonomously with each other, their environment, and the player, creating a dynamic AI-generated narrative. The developer says these NPCs learn, experience emotions, pursue their goals, dream, talk,&nbsp;and create a dynamic story for the player. Built using extensive language and speech recognition models, AI People can now run locally on a GeForce RTX GPU in addition to the previous cloud option.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z98IdBAM4NM?si=uE2ulIT2RcYOyvKR" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>TiGames, the developer behind the Metroidvania game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f-i-s-t-forged-in-the-shadow-torch-grease-stained-furtasy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch</a>, has showcased a tech demo called ZooPunk where the combination of several AI technologies lets NPCs communicate naturally with the player. A speech model listens to their voice and translates the words to text, while a language model parses the text to understand the intention behind the sentence and generate the NPC's response. The NPC's voice is also AI-powered, and NVIDIA ACE provides lip synchronization with Audio2Face. Perhaps more interestingly, the demo shows the first use of on-device in-game Stable Diffusion image generation, where the player can simply ask the NPC to repaint the airship with new art. The ZooPunk demo also ran on the new GeForce RTX GPUs, not on the cloud.</p>

<p>By the way, NVIDIA ACE's Audio2Face is also featured in the recently launched VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/survios-debuts-story-trailer-for-alien-rogue-incursion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>. Moreover, Perfect World Games is using it for its Unreal Engine 5-powered MMORPG World of Jade Dynasty. Perfect World Games brought a showcase video at CES 2025 to demonstrate how Audio2Face allows them to animate their vast cast of characters in both Chinese and English.</p>
<p>The animations are dynamically adjusted based on various variables detected in the recorded voice acting. Of course, if any adjustments are needed, developers can intervene manually to make changes as they see fit, tailoring dialogue for specific scenes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2, the next evolution of the innovative tech used today in over 100 games to reduce latency, promises to further reduce latency by up to 75%.</p>
<p>As announced during CES 2025, NVIDIA Reflex 2 will combine Reflex Low Latency mode with a new Frame Warp technology that will further reduce latency by updating the rendered game frame based on the latest mouse input before it is sent to the display. This new technology was developed based on a study conducted by NVIDIA's esports research team four years ago which illustrated how players could complete aiming tasks faster when frames are updated after being rendered based on the more recent mouse input. As such, shifting or warping an existing frame to show the result of the action sooner could bring some significant improvements in terms of latency.</p>
<p>This is exactly what NVIDIA Reflex 2's Frame Warp tech does. As a frame is being rendered by the GPU, the CPU calculates the camera position of the next frame in the pipeline based on the player's input. Frame Warp samples the new camera position from the CPU and warps the frame rendered by the GPU to the newer camera position, doing so at the very last moment to ensure the latest input is shown on screen. To prevent the small holes in the image created when the new camera position shows a new part of a scene, NVIDIA developed a latency-optimized predictive rendering algorithm that uses camera, color, and depth data from prior frames to fill these holes accurately, making players see the rendered frame with the updated camera position without any hole and with reduced latency for any action that caused the camera shift. All this will allow players to improve their aim and tracking of enemies.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA Reflex 2 | Introducing New Frame Warp Technology" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpDxo2m6Sko?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Together with the explanation above, NVIDIA also showcased NVIDIA Reflex 2 with its Frame Warp technology in Embark Studio's The Finals, which will be among the first games to support it. Without Reflex, on an RTX 5070 GPU at 4K, max settings, latency is 56ms, which is reduced to 27ms with Reflex 1 and to 14ms with Reflex 2.</p>

<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2 with its Frame Warp technology will also provide significant improvements in CPU-limited scenarios. In VALORANT, which will also support the technology soon, on an RTX 5090 that can run the game at over 800 FPS on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-gpu-custom-models-roundup/">RTX 5090</a>, latency is reduced to an average of under 3ms with Frame Warp, which is extremely impressive.</p>

<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2 will debut together with the GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs, with support for other RTX GPUs coming in the future.

The figures detailed below include pre and post-launch development. That is, the cost to develop each game for launch, then the subsequent post-launch development costs associated with feeding the ongoing live service, meaning the development lifecycle of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty games offer a range of free content following release, including new maps, new weapons, and new cosmetics for use across Multiplayer and Zombies. Activision monetizes Call of Duty post-launch by selling battle passes, store bundles, and, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-squid-game-season-2-crossover-and-call-of-dutys-controversial-relationship-with-microtransactions">most recently with Black Ops 6</a>, premium event passes, released in the traditional live service seasonal model in the year each game has to itself before the next Call of Duty comes around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development of this relentless conveyor belt of content, which often includes high-profile crossovers with popular intellectual property such as Warhammer 40,000 and Squid Game, does not come cheap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, onto the figures themselves:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Black Ops 3 (2015)</strong>: $450 million in development costs across the game’s lifecycle, 43 million copies sold</li><li><strong>Modern Warfare (2019)</strong>: $640 million in development costs across the game’s lifecycle, 41 million copies sold</li><li><strong>Black Ops Cold War (2020)</strong>: $700 million in development costs over the game’s life cycle, 30 million copies sold</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">To provide context, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-2-and-horizon-forbidden-wests-budgets-revealed-ftc-documents">Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us 2 cost around $220 million, Guerrilla’s Horizon Forbidden West cost $212 million</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-pressured-its-studios-to-make-big-cuts-amid-increasing-development-costs">Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 cost $300 million to develop</a>. However, these games are not live services, and so post-launch development costs are not necessarily related to the figures as they are with Call of Duty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File</a> noted, these development costs do not include marketing spend, which for Call of Duty will be significant. So the true cost of bringing Call of Duty to market and operating it as a live service will be even higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ever increasing triple-A development budgets are a hot topic within the industry, and have caused some experts to question the viability of these sorts of games, Call of Duty operates on a different level to most of its peers. Black Ops Cold War’s 30 million copies sold will in of itself have generated well over $1 billion in revenue for Activision, then there’s the live service revenue generated by the game during the 12 months before 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard launched. Even with $700 million spent on development and more on marketing, Black Ops Cold War will have been hugely profitable for Activision. You can see why Microsoft forked out $69 billion to buy the company.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Microsoft, the math is now muddled by Call of Duty’s day-one launch on Game Pass, which some analysts had predicted would impact sales of Black Ops 6 but boost subscription numbers. Microsoft itself sounds delighted with the performance of last year’s game, saying sales of Black Ops 6 on PlayStation and PC were 60% higher compared to the 2023 release of Modern Warfare 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has yet to say exactly how many new subscribers Black Ops 6 brought through the door, although CEO Satya Nadella has confirmed that Game Pass set a record for new subs on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Microsoft’s gaming business has suffered devastating layoffs, and Activision has taken a significant hit as part of that. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-union-hits-out-at-heartless-microsoft-gaming-layoffs">Microsoft has cut an eye-watering 2,550 staff from its gaming business</a> since acquiring Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in 2023.

            <p>Two more of Sony's video games are being adapted into films: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<p>Sony made the announcements during its CES presentation this morning. "I'm excited to announce we are working with Sony Pictures on developing a film adaptation of our amazingly popular PlayStation game, Helldivers 2," PlayStation's Asad Qizilbash revealed to audience applause.</p>
<p>So, yes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-prompting-people-to-rediscover-starship-troopers-which-game-director-says-is-incredible">the game that was (at least in part) inspired by a film</a>, which in turn was inspired by a book, is becoming another film.</p>

<p>Later in the same presentation, Qizilbash revealed Horizon Zero Dawn is also getting the film treatment. This news follows a report last year that stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-series-no-longer-moving-forward-following-showrunner-allegations-report">once-proposed TV series based on the Horizon franchise had come to halt</a> after accusations of "bullying, manipulative and retaliatory behaviour" by its planned showrunner Steve Blackman.</p><p>The newly announced Horizon film is now in the "early stages" of development with Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions. "Just imagine Aloy's beloved origin story set in a vibrant far future world filled with the giant machines brought to you for the first time on the big screen," said Qizilbash.</p>
<p>In addition, Sony also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-gets-groundbreaking-anime-adaptation-on-crunchyroll">Ghost of Tsushima anime adaptation for Crunchyroll</a> during CES, which is slated for 2027.</p>

<p>"This project is a testament to the creative synergy within the Sony family, uniting the expertise of PlayStation Studios and PlayStation Productions; the creative team of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/sucker-punch-productions">Sucker Punch Productions</a> and Aniplex; Sony Music's iconic global artist roster; and Crunchyroll's fan-first global marketing and distribution footprint," said Rahul Purini, president of Crunchyroll. "The Ghost of Tsushima anime will offer fans an exciting new way to experience the game in an anime style that will be bold and groundbreaking."</p>
<p>The Legends game mode has players choosing one of four classes (splitting main protagonist Jin's powers between them) to battle enemy hordes inspired by Japanese mythology.</p>
<p>"Having already proven the immense quality and versatility of our gaming properties across multiple successful film and television projects, we couldn't be more excited to announce our first ever anime adaptation," said Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions. "Ghost of Tsushima's rich, immersive world and its fantastical Legends mode based on Japanese mythology provide the perfect canvas for this project, and Aniplex is the perfect partner to translate Sucker Punch Productions' hit video game into a stunning new anime series."</p>
<p>The anime appears to be separate from the forthcoming film adaptation announced in 2021 with John Wick: Chapter 4 director Chad Stahelski at the helm. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shogun-star-in-talks-for-ghost-of-tsushima-film-role">Shogun's Horiyuki Sanada is in talks for a role</a>.</p>
<p>More anime announcements could be on the way from Sony following its "strategic capital and business alliance" with FromSoftware owner Kadokawa. At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony became the largest shareholder of Kadokawa</a>, with the company's anime properties proving a major draw.</p>
<p>Later this year, Sony and Sucker Punch will release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">follow-up game Ghost of Yotei</a> set a few hundred years later on the island of Hokkaido in northern Japan.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-25-to-21/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re into the top half of our Most Wanted games of 2025, and there’s a mix of the familiar and the new in this selection of five. Co-op is a strong factor here, whether it’s sharing in the horror, taking on the latest soulslike experience, or surviving in an MMO with your buddies.</p>
<h2>25 – Little Nightmares 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, NSW, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>The Little Nightmares series has quickly felt like a staple of the horror genres, bleeding an unsettling setting and creepily oversized enemies in alongside puzzle platforming. Original series creators Tarsier Studios have moved on to create their own fresh take on this style with Reanimal, but Little Nightmares 3 is continuing on with Supermassive Games at the helm – another studio with a rich pedigree in horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares III – 'You're Being Watched' Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0oSzWzliENs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of “disturbing places”, Low and Alone will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and nasty things lurking around in the shadows, with this game looking to emphasise full co-op. Whilst the game continues the themes of “eww”, “yuk”, and “bork” found in the first two games, it is set in a completely different location, as Little Nightmares 1 and 2 were both set in The Maw.</p>

<h2>24 – Greedfall 2: The Dying World</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC (out now in Steam Early Access)</em></p>
<p>Here’s one you can actually play already, with Greedfall 2: The Dying World currently going through PC Early Access on Steam. To say that this release has divided the fans of the original is a bit of an understatement, though.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYklAgJGzlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set well before the events of the first game, Greedfall 2 looks set to explore the same world from a new perspective. Now you’ll play as a Teer Fradee native, witnessing the early impact that colonisers from the Old Continent have on this verdant land, before being dragged back to the old world as the story unfolds. What’s much more significant, though, is a complete shift in gameplay style, moving away from action RPG and back towards something more reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins. Combined with the ropiness of an early access game, the initial reception has been mixed, but we’re keen to see how it comes together through its full release.</p>
<h2>23 – Sniper Elite: Resistance</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 30th January 2025</em></p>
<p>You know what you’re getting with Sniper Elite: Resistance, a spin-off story that puts Karl Fairburne’s longtime co-op buddy character, Harry Hawker, in the spotlight. You’ll be sneaking through large levels, silently taking down patrolling guards, sniping from hundreds of meters away (to trigger the series’ iconic X-Ray killcam), and working your way through a variety of missions behind enemy lines in Occupied France.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hands on Sniper Elite: Resistance – Harry Hawker takes aim" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LODts4M4BPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">hands on with Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> at Gamescom this year, saying, “Sniper Elite has become a bit like stealth action comfort food over the past decade, having really settled into the sandbox levels and mission structure in the last few games. Sniper Elite: Resistance isn’t looking to revolutionise the series, but give a new campaign, a few new twists and tweaks to the formula, and just let you settle in with a nice glass of red – to go with all the red you spill in-game.”</p>
<h2>22 – Elden Ring Nightreign</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 2025</p>
<p>FromSoftware aren’t making an Elden Ring 2, but they are working on a spin-off from their smash hit. Elden Ring Nightreign is a more specifically co-op game than before, mixing up the visual style, combat and general setting of Elden Ring with a new format.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN – REVEAL GAMEPLAY TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Djtsw5k_DNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While you can play Nightreign solo, it’s intended to be played with a group of three, working together across multiple in-game days to prepare for a final boss. There’s a little dash of battle royale thrown into this as well, with the playable area shrinking after players defeat a minor boss at the end of each day, limiting the second and third day as you get closer to that final encounter. An interesting twist on proceedings.</p>
<h2>21 – Dune: Awakening</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Early 2025 (PC)</em></p>
<p>With the success of the recent films, Dune video games are popping up left and right, with Dune: Awakening one of the most exciting and intriguing in development. Coming from Conan Exiles developer Funcom Oslo, this is a big open world survival MMO.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Awakening – Survive Arrakis Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1S-l7NySFsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It definitely feels like survival will be quite tricky here, given the setting. Worms are just one unkillable threat to contend with, as sandstorms, the heat and sunlight, and just finding water in this desert all being particular challenges. Of course, you can band together with other players, sharing resources, building bases, going on raids and quests, and deciding which of the factions vying for control over the planet you wish to align with.</p>
<p>There’s no defined release date yet, but Dune: Awakening will have betas before launch. That launch will also be split, first coming to PC before consoles arrive at a later date.</p>
<p><em>That’s this set of five, and we’re getting towards the pointy end of our list. What here takes your fancy, though?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>During Sony’s CES 2025 conference, the company announced some new film and show projects it has begun working on. The key announcements were projects based on Helldivers, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p><iframe title="CES® 2025 Press Conference｜Sony Official" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IV95SMpTW-M?start=2327&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ghost of Tsushima Legends is an anime that is being produced at Crunchyroll, with the basis of the series being the Legends mode of the game. The Legends mode was added in 2020, bringing a co-op multiplayer experience to the samurai game, with four new warriors being made playable and each representing different classes. These were the Samurai, Hunter, Ronin, and Assassin characters who were tasked with working together to deal with supernatural situations. These stories are likely what the anime will be using as inspiration.</p>
<p>When it comes to the big screen, Sony had two major reveals. Both Helldivers and Horizon Zero Dawn will be getting movies. Sony has partnered with Columbia Pictures to make the Horizon Zero Dawn movie, though it is yet too early to know who will be playing Aloy and when it will be release. This follows on from the news that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/04/netflixs-horizon-zero-dawn-show-has-been-scrapped/">Netflix’s Horizon Zero Dawn show</a> had been scrapped in July. The Helldivers movie will be based on Helldivers 2, though again there is no confirmed release window, cast, or even what story will be told through the movie.</p>
<p>The next<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/16/until-dawn-movie-has-a-release-date-for-april-2025/"> big game based movie coming out is Until Dawn</a>, which is set to be released in cinemas this April. Until Dawn’s cast includes Peter Stormare, who has a long career of acting in big blockbusters as well as in videogames, Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn Review</a></h2>
<p>Until Dawn was recently remade and released, following its original release in 2014. In our review for the remake of Until Dawn, Tuffcub said,&nbsp;<em>“Until Dawn remains a fantastic horror game with great acting and plenty of jump scares to get you out of your seat. While not essential for anyone that enjoyed the original game, this remake brings it to a new audience and is a solid update to what was already a great game.”</em></p>

            <p>I don’t want to talk to a game. I assume I’m not alone in this, because the tech’s been around for donkey’s and barely anyone tries to use it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> tried voice commands. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCOM_U.S._Navy_SEALs">Socom U.S Navy Seals </a>shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/jpbkhj/socom_us_navy_seals_voice_commands_for_ai/">wrote a Redditor</a> on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628740/Dead_Meat/">Steam page</a>. Here’s a trailer.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed by now, there’s a caveat to this seemingly boundless NPC reactivity - Meaning Machine are using what they call their ‘Game Conscious (tee-em) AI system’. "The advent of generative AI has the potential to kickstart a golden age of creative experimentation and innovation," they say. "But only if creative people remain at the helm."</p><p>Here is my drive-by reaction to this: if you don’t value the written word enough to have a writer create unique, intentional dialogue, then why make a game based around conversation? Same for actors - there’s an undeniable choppy tinge to the character’s voices you don’t get with a real human reading a whole line like they mean it. But then again, I’d be lying if I said Dead Meat felt devoid of personality. Its characters are certainly a far cry from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-spoke-to-an-nvidia-ai-npc-and-he-mainly-wanted-to-get-me-bladdered">Nvidia AI NPC James</a> spoke to last year, and the dialogue they’ve shown off doesn’t give me any overt slop vibes (edit: actually, kinda.)</p>
<p>On the one hand, co-founder and tech lead Ben Ackland says he’s been working on AI for games for over six years "before it was cool", which you’d think might insulate them from some of the rabid gold-rush evangelism we’ve seen recently. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.meaningmachine.games/game-conscious-ai">their website</a> shows off a separate system called ‘battle banter’ by having it add AI battle barks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, which feels about as close to missing the point as you can get. Sparing dialogue and deliberately lonely encounters? I barely know ‘ers.</p>
<p>All I can really say is this: Dead Meat looks interesting enough (perhaps even interesting enough for me to actually talk to it) and I’m still learning. I’m off to go have a re-read of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">four parter Michael Cook did on generative AI for us</a>. Don’t do any murders while I’m gone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA did not forget about its GeForce NOW cloud platform during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2025-ceo-jensen-huang-keynote-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big CES 2025 keynote</a>. First, it was confirmed that two highly anticipated PC games, the action RPG Avowed from Obsidian and the first-person shooter DOOM: The Dark Ages from id Software, will be available to play on GeForce NOW.</p>
<p>Avowed is coming in a little over a month. Set for release on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, the game will provide fans of the Eora setting (previously seen in the Pillars of Eternity franchise) with a brand new perspective on the vibrant fantasy world.&nbsp;I got to play a few hours of a demo build last month and shared these thoughts in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview article</a>:</p>
<p><em>Overall, this hands-on experience definitely left me hopeful and eager for the final version. It's unlikely to be a big success on the scale of Skyrim or Baldur's Gate 3, but it looks like another fun and engaging role-playing game from Obsidian that improves on their previous first-person title. All the worldbuilding work done for the Pillars of Eternity games will certainly pay off, too, both for returning fans of the isometric cRPGs who get to enter Eora from a wholly different perspective and for newcomers who will feel the depth and uniqueness of this fantasy setting.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages doesn't have a launch date yet, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will support path tracing and DLSS 4</a>. While the GeForce NOW servers don't support the newly announced DLSS 4 yet, Ultimate tier users will be able to run DLSS 3 as usual.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also announced that GeForce NOW is officially coming to a series of new devices, such as Valve's Steam Deck. Truthfully, a beta installation method was <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-can-now-be-installed-more-easily-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by NVIDIA last May. However, a native app will be available for download later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="GeForce NOW | Full Support for Steam Deck Coming Soon" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlK5UWuj9is?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA's cloud gaming solution is also expanding to VR and MR devices like the Meta Quest 3 and 3S, Apple's Vision Pro, and Pico headsets. Starting later this month, VR and MR users will be able to use GeForce NOW on these devices by opening the browser <a href="http://play.geforcenow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on this page</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, NVIDIA is adding India to the list of supported GFN countries later in 2025 thanks to the opening of an RTX 4080-powered data center. Thailand should also be added soon via a local partnership with Brothers Pictures.</p>

            <p>A new trailer for The Last of Us has been released, teasing some of the events to come in the show's second season.</p>
<p>Additionally, while we still don't have a specific date, it has been announced that The Last of Us season two will begin airing in April. That's the same month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">The Last of Us Part 2 will make its PC debut</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer, which you can see below, lasts a little over a minute, but still manages to cram in the suspense. Along with Ellie and Joel, we also get another look at new characters for this season, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever's Abby</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Isabela Merced's Dina</a>. Please note, beneath the trailer I will be going into more detail about what was shown, so <strong>be aware of major spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below</strong>.</p>

<p>A fair portion of the trailer is made up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">snippets of scenes we have seen before</a>: Ellie and Dina getting swarmed by infected in the subway, Ellie at the Jackson dance (although this time with Dina), Joel shedding a tear during a presumed therapy session, the tender moment between a weary looking Tommy and Maria, and so on.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Wright, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-casts-jeffrey-wright-reprising-his-role-as-isaac">reprising his role as Isaac</a>, and the Seraphites are also glimpsed during the latest trailer for season two.</p>

<p>But there are also two moments I particularly want to highlight, which are sure to pack an emotional punch upon the series' release.</p>
<p>The first is the very opening of the trailer, which begins in a hallway with a wailing siren and ominous red lighting. A lone figure walks into the shot. She is holding a gun with a Firefly pendant around her neck. It is Abby, and this scene is clearly set in the hospital <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-explain-joels-john-wick-moment-as-a-god-mode-power-up">after Joel's rampage at the end of season one</a>.</p><p>Those who have played The Last of Us Part 2 know this means Abby is about to come across the body of the doctor who was set to perform surgery on Ellie before Joel killed him - her father. I won't deny, I cried when I played through this part.</p>

<p>The second moment that bears mentioning specifically is the lone shot of Ellie, again bathed in a red light, aiming a gun at an unseen target. The scene then cuts to black, but heavy breathing can be heard.</p>
<p>Based on events in The Last of Us Part 2, I am going to say this moment takes place after Ellie chases WLF member Nora (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">played in the show by Tati Gabrielle</a>) down in Seattle. Ellie proceeds to torture and kill Nora, in one of the already harrowing game's most harrowing moments. Ellie's actions here traumatise her even further, and she returns to Dina and Jesse in a state of shock.</p><p>When I played The Last of Us Part 2, this moment with Nora left me feeling especially uncomfortable. I wonder if those who have not played the game will feel this same sense of unease when the second season airs.</p>

<p>Last year, The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">the second season of The Last of Us will comprise of seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length.</p>
<p>"The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you," Mazin said in June.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part 2's story will not be told in full during season two, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">subsequent seasons expected to wrap up the narrative</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and Sega have released a “pre-development concept video” for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/">new Virtua Fighter project</a> that was announced during The Game Awards last month. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Looks good, right? Well, it’s all just proof of concept right now, labelled as “Pre-development in-engine footage” and “not actual gameplay”, and so there’s absolutely nothing about the game name, platforms or release windows a moment, but it is showing some of the intent behind RGG’s fighting series revival.</p>
<p>There’s various things to note here, from the density of detail through the backdrops to the light 3D shifting through the stage, and an element of destruction as one Akira throws the other Akira around. There’s also some more of that fighting game visual flair with motion trails and other effects as hits land, where Virtua Fighter has generally been more constrained than others in the genre.</p>
<p>All of this is subject to change, of course, but it’s an initial direction that RGG are taking.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has become a lynchpin studio for Sega over the last few years. You’ll know them best as the studio behind the hugely popular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-latest-trailer-reveal-naval-combat/">Yakuza/Like A Dragon</a> series, but as broad as that series has become, they’ve also handled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/">recent Super Monkey Ball games</a> as well. Given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which was in turn fed a branch off from Virtua Fighter, this makes them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve only seen Akira and Sarah Bryant going fighting, and with this pre-production video, it’s a pair of Akira battling.</p>
<p>Fans of the series have been waiting patiently ever since the original launch of Virtua Fighter 5. While it leapt through the past couple of generations with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/18/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-review/">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, and is still very playable on modern consoles, there’s little to no online community right now. Sega is looking to give that game a shot in the arm, both with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny9qqpSc0cs&amp;pp=ygUQdmlydHVhIGZpZ2h0ZXIgNQ%3D%3D">a recent 2.0 update to Ultimate Showdown</a> with a new PC port, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaR2wHDKlU">Virtua Fighter 5 REVO coming later this month</a>.</p>

		<p>HBO has released a new teaser trailer for The Last of Us Season 2, confirming that the show will return in April. Where season one of The Last of Us covered the events of the first game, season two will be delving into the story of the second game, introducing characters like Abby who will have a big part alongside Joel and Ellie.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Of Us Season 2 | April 2025 | Max" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylovT43x3yo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Last of Us Season 2’s trailer gives us a lot of brief shots, showing scenes from The Last of Us Part II captured by the show, with a mix of action and terror as the danger increases for everyone. Neil Druckmann has stated that Season 2 will not cover all of The Last of Us Part II. This was revealed by co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-finale-ending-explained-interview">GQ</a>. When asked if The Last of Us season 2 would feature the entirety of the second game, Mazin said, “No. No way.” Druckmann added, “It’s more than one season”.</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-teaser-trailer-reveals-some-new-story-beats/">The Last of Us Season 2 teaser trailer</a> there was more focus on the story, with one major change being Joel talking to what appears to be a therapist about his experiences. This may help people remember some story beats from the previous season, along with providing additional background to the events that occur in Season 2 without having to dive deeply into all of them.</p>

			<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-gpu-1999-usd-2x-performance-of-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new GeForce RTX Series GPUs</a> at CES 2025, NVIDIA has also unveiled a series of new or updated RTX technologies that will be in upcoming PC games, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>
<p>id Software's much anticipated medieval-themed first-person shooter game coming later this year will run on the latest version of the id Tech engine, powered by full path tracing and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly announced DLSS 4</a> with support for Multi Frame Generation. It will also take advantage of the improved Ray Reconstruction for increased lighting stability and detail. You can take a peek at DOOM: The Dark Ages with the full suite of NVIDIA RTX technologies in the DLSS 4 medley video below. Needless to say, it looks absolutely stunning.</p>
<p><iframe title="RTX. It’s On. | The Ultimate in Ray Tracing and AI with DLSS 4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3fglmDxD2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Billy Khan, Director of Engine Technology at id Software, has shared a comment:</p>
<p><em>With DLSS 4, we are stepping into a new era of gaming. The new ray reconstruction transformer model powers a historical leap in raytracing capabilities; not just accelerating performance but also enhancing visuals in DOOM: The Dark Ages.</em></p>
<p>The game doesn't have a fixed launch date yet. When it comes out, it will be playable on PC, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5 on day one.</p>
<p>Back on DLSS 4 and the newly announced or updated NVIDIA RTX technologies, they will, of course, be available at launch on other upcoming PC titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-is-an-impressive-looking-single-player-third-person-shooter-with-strong-metal-gear-solid-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black State</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a>, all of which will support DLSS Multi Frame Generation. Kadir Demirden, CEO of Black State developer Motion Blur, said:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series and DLSS 4 are game-changing. We now have the power and technologies to realize the future of interactive storytelling with Black State.</em></p>
<p>Rui Casais, CEO of Dune: Awakening developer Funcom, added:</p>
<p><em>GeForce RTX 50 Series and DLSS 4 mark the beginning of a new generation of games.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison - Captured on GeForce RTX 5090" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjnEiP9a9kQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But it's not just new games that will be updated. On top of the 75 games with day 0 support, more hit games from 2024 and 2023 will receive improvements, such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Alan Wake 2. The former is being updated not only to add DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the improved Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution models but also with a new RTX Hair technology. Jim Kjellin, CTO of Indiana Jones developer MachineGames, said:</p>
<p><em>With GeForce RTX 50 Series, players will be able to experience Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at its best. With elevated image quality, performance, and new neural rendering tech like NVIDIA RTX Hair introduces a new level of character realism, truly adding to the immersion of becoming Indy.</em></p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, RTX Hair features a new Linear-Swept Sphere rendering that runs faster, with improved image quality, whilst using less VRAM. You can preview the RTX Hair update in the comparison image below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As for Alan Wake 2, Remedy's horror game will be updated to include the new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx-kit#ido12x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Mega Geometry technology</a>, which is going to be available on all RTX GPUs and laptops. NVIDIA says it can accelerate BVH building for cluster-based geometry systems, enabling up to 100x more ray-traced triangles and better performance in heavily ray-traced scenes, reducing CPU overhead.</p>
<p>The game will also add DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the improved Ray Reconstruction transformer model. Additionally, NVIDIA unveiled that Remedy will introduce a new Ultra quality Ray Tracing preset featuring fully ray-traced refractions, fully ray-traced transparent reflections, and higher quality fully ray-traced indirect lighting. This will all be part of the next Alan Wake 2 update. Mika Vehkala, Chief Technology Officer at Remedy Entertainment, commented:</p>
<p><em>With DLSS 4 and GeForce RTX 50 Series we are seeing significant performance gains which enable us to create new game worlds larger and more detailed than ever.</em></p>

<p>Later this year, three more popular PC games will introduce support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation: Black Myth: Wukong, Marvel Rivals, and NARAKA: Bladepoint. There's no ETA on the availability for the first game, while Marvel Rivals and NARAKA: Bladepoint are both getting the update next month.</p>

<p>During CES 2025, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed a 35-second snippet of in-engine gameplay from the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’ that was unveiled during The Game Awards 2024. The glimpse of this developing title <strong>isn’t </strong>a gameplay sequence, but it’s a perfect representation of what RGG is aiming for with the first new Virtua Fighter game in almost 20 years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pre-development-only-no-gameplay">Pre-Development Only, No Gameplay</h2>



<p>It’s important to stress that the 35-second clip aired by Sega <strong>is not </strong>gameplay. It’s pre-development footage taken from the game’s engine.</p>



<p>In the short video, we get a look at two characters fighting in a marketplace after a brief introduction,. They trade blows for a few seconds, kicking each other into destructible elements of the environment before the sequence fades to black and the Sega logo flashes up.</p>



<p>Check it out here:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s little more than a conceptual thing, but it admittedly looks brilliant, and that’s coming from someone who has never enjoyed a fighting game. The small details like the NPCs milling around in the background are super, and the intro sequence is interesting, taking players outside of the typically tiny environments that players fight in.</p>



<p>At The Game Awards 2024, RGG unveiled the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which will be the first new VF game in the series since 2006. </p>



<p>What do you think about the clip? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/acer-nitro-blaze-11-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/acer-has-revealed-the-nitro-blaze-11-an-enormous-gaming-handheld.1075728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/acer-nitro-blaze-11-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Acer’s recently revealed Nitro Blaze 11 is a new handheld, but they’re cutting it close with the dimensions of this thing. With a massive 10.95-inch display, the Nitro Blaze 11 is by far the chunkiest gaming handheld on the market, and it weighs more than three times as much as a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>It’ll be a forearm workout just wielding the thing, regardless of how powerful or capable it is under the hood.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-performance-portable-gaming">‘High-Performance Portable Gaming’</h2>



<p>Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11 is a certified handheld device, but the portable aspect might be coming under question, given the size and weight of the thing. Once you’ve factored in the casing, the Nitro Blaze 11 is going to be 12 or 13 inches across, which trumps the ASUS ROG Ally X by a couple of inches.</p>



<p>It also weighs a staggering 1050g, while the Ally X, which is widely seen as the industry leader, weighs just 670g. That means a lot when it comes to a portable device. Do you really want to spend a lot of time gaming on something that weighs more than a kilo?</p>



<p>Size aside, the Nitro Blaze 11 is more than capable. It features a 120Hz display, an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS processor, and up to 2 TB of storage. It also has detachable controllers in case you want to take the weight off, and it accommodates WiFi 6E and USB 4.</p>



<p>In the product’s blurb, Acer wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nitro Blaze 11 smoothly transitions between daily tasks and gaming. Whether you’re browsing, working, or playing, this handheld adapts seamlessly with precise Hall Effect sticks, a sturdy built-in stand, and detachable controllers that provide flexibility for solo or connected play with the included connector. The front camera makes video calls and streaming easy, ensuring you stay connected wherever you are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, the gigantic screen will likely be a monumental drain on the relatively small battery. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 comes with a 55 Wh battery, which is nothing compared to the Ally X’s 80 Wh battery.</p>



<p>Finally, the price point isn’t ideal. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 will set you back a whopping $1199, making it the most expensive gaming handheld on the market right now. It’s hard to see a real selling point for this device if I’m being honest.</p>
