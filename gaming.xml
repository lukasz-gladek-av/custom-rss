              <p>Small screens on laptops or handheld consoles (like the Switch) are fine for most things but they can be hard to see when you’re trying to find enemies in competitive games or edit spreadsheets with small text that hurts your eyes. A portable monitor fixes this by giving you a full-sized screen wherever you need one.</p>
<p>The<em> Arzopa A1</em> has a <strong>15.6-inch Full HD screen and can connect to almost anything with USB-C or HDMI</strong> which makes it great for gaming, working or streaming. For Cyber Monday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/">Amazon drops the price of this portable monitor from its usual $104 to $63</a> and this is the lowest price ever which it almost too cheap to pass up to buy a second screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>IPS Panel Quality in a Package That’s Easy to Take on Trips</h2>
<p>This monitor has a 15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920×1080 and the text is clear and the colors are bright which makes spreadsheets and games look sharp. The<strong> IPS technology lets you see the screen from 178 degrees both horizontally and vertically</strong> so the picture stays the same even when you look at it from the side or from above. This is important when you’re sharing the screen with someone next to you or when you have to put the monitor at an angle because of lack of desk space.</p>



<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> works well for regular gaming and work tasks, but competitive gamers might notice a difference when playing fast-paced shooters on 120Hz or 144Hz monitors. <strong>Response time is about 5ms</strong> which is fine for casual games, RPGs and strategy games where clear visuals are more important than quick reactions. The 16:9 aspect ratio works with most laptop screens and gaming consoles so there are no black bars when you mirror displays or make your workspace bigger.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in kickstand folds out from the metal back panel</strong> and locks into different positions which means you can use it on desks, tables or even your lap without needing a separate stand. This design saves space when you travel and gets rid of extra accessories you would have to pack. The m<strong>onitor is only 1.6 pounds and 0.35 inches thick at its thinnest point</strong> so it fits easily into laptop bags or backpacks with your other gear.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C ports</strong> that can handle both video and power from compatible laptops are part of the connectivity which means that everything can be connected with just one cable, so you don’t need a separate power adapter. The <strong>mini-HDMI port</strong> can take signals from gaming consoles, desktop computers, cameras, or any other device with an HDMI output. If your laptop can’t provide enough power, the monitor can get power from a separate USB-C power adapter or through USB-C from your laptop.</p>
<p>The package comes with the monitor,<strong> a USB-C to USB-C cable, a USB-C to USB-A cable, a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, and a case that protects the monitor</strong> and acts as a screen cover while it’s being moved. It only takes a few seconds to set up because all you have to do is plug in the right cable and the display turns on by itself.</p>
<p>If you buy this portable monitor for $63 instead of $104, you’ll get a price that beats most basic external displays while still keeping Full HD resolution and IPS quality. For less than the cost of budget monitors that don’t have portability features, you get a real portable second screen with a built-in stand, multiple ways to connect, and compatibility with a wide range of devices.</p>

              <p>Cyber Monday deals are rolling in. Most of these are Black Friday discounts being carried into the weekend, so if you missed grabbing something during the sale, there’s still a chance to bag it for less.</p>
<p>While several retailers are offering plenty of discounts, Amazon is being the most generous right now. It’s offering up to 50% off its own devices, taking hundreds off security cameras, smart displays, streaming sticks, Kindles, and more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Those looking to give their entertainment setup an upgrade this holiday season should consider nabbing the latest Fire TV Soundbar Plus while it’s going at a 40% discount</a>. This brings the price down to just $150. You’re saving a massive $100 on an audio solution that’s going to make it easy to hear dialogues clearly, plus enjoy your favorite tunes to the fullest. Even better, both Prime and non-Prime members will enjoy free delivery on their purchase, which adds even more value to the offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Audio Modes</h2>
<p>Design-wise, it’s pretty similar to the older Fire TV soundbars. It sits nicely on your TV console without drawing too much attention to itself, and can even be mounted on a wall for a clean, tidy setup. But despite the compact frame, it does not compromise on the sound. Three full-range speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers push audio in all directions. Pair that with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and you’ll enjoy a 3D, room-filling experience that pulls you in, making you feel like you’re a part of whatever is playing on the screen. Sound mimics real life; the Battle of Pelennor Fields from The Lord of the Rings plays out as if it’s happening right in your living room. Watching a scary movie? Footsteps and whispers are going to feel like they’re coming from behind, making the whole thing even spookier.</p>
<p>The Dialogue Enhancer works overtime to keep the conversations sharp by actively pushing voices above background sounds, even with low volume. You won’t have to constantly rewind just to hear what was said. You can also choose between multiple audio modes that optimize the sound based on what’s playing. These include Movie, Music, Sports, and Night modes. The night mode for instance, delivers balanced audio that won’t wake the entire home up, while the music mode gives bass a boost. Speaking of music, you can even use the soundbar as a speaker by connecting it to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth and streaming your favorite tracks.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started couldn’t be simpler. Plug your soundbar’s HDMI cable into your TV’s eARC/ARC port, and power the TV on with your remote. The audio will instantly change from your TV to the soundbar; simple as that. As for the compatibility, it plays nicely with just about any smart TV, plus the screens connected to streaming media players.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">There’s a lot more to like about this soundbar, especially now that it’s going at a $100 discount.</a> This deal lets you grab it for just $150, which is basically nothing for all that it’s packed with. It’s an early Cyber Monday deal, but keeping past trends in mind, we’re expecting it to expire soon. If you’ve been after a reliable audio solution, today is the day to make the move. You’re also going to enjoy free delivery if you place your orders before Dec. 4.</p>

<p>Boy, was 1992 a different time for computer games. Epic MegaGames’ <em>Jill of the Jungle</em> illustrates that as well as any other title from the era. Designed and programmed by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the game was meant to prove that console-style games of the original Nintendo era could work just as well on PCs. (Later, the onus of proof would often be in the reverse direction.)</p>
<p>Also, it had a female protagonist, which Sweeney saw as a notable differentiator at the time. That’s pretty wild to think about in an era of <em>Tomb Raider</em>‘s Lara Croft, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>‘s Aloy,&nbsp;<em>Life is Strange</em>‘s Max Caulfield,&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em>‘s Selene Vassos,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>‘s Jesse Faden,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>‘ Ellie Williams, and a seemingly endless list of others—to say nothing of the fact that many players of all genders who played the games <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> seem to agree that the female protagonist options in those are more compelling than their male alternatives.</p>
<p>As wacky as it is to remember that the idea of a female character was seen as exceptional at any point (and with the acknowledgement that this game was nonetheless not the first to do that), it’s still neat to see how forward-thinking Sweeney was in many respects—and not just in terms of cultural norms in gaming.</p>
<h2>Gameplay to stand the test of time</h2>
<p>Having been born in the early 80s to a computer programmer father, I grew up on MS-DOS games the way many kids did on Atari, Nintendo, or PlayStation. Even I’ll admit that, as much as I enjoyed the DOS platformers, they don’t hold up very well against their console counterparts. (Other genres are another story, of course.)</p>
<p>I know this is blasphemy for some of my background and persuasion, but <em>Commander Keen</em>‘s weird, floaty controls are frustrating, and what today’s designers call the “game feel” just isn’t quite right.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Too many platformer games on PC in the ’80s and ’90s were frustrating to play, and they offered very little ammunition for a PC user to use in an argument with a Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) owner to convince them that PC that costs thousands of dollars is better for <em>those types of games</em> than the much-cheaper consoles; there were both technical and cultural reasons for this</p>
<p>With <em>Jill of the Jungle</em>, Sweeney was one of the first to give PC players that ammunition.</p>
<p>I replayed the entire trilogy of episodes, which is <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fjill_of_the_jungle_the_complete_trilogy">bundled into one package on GOG</a>, in one afternoon recently. It was fun as hell. The movement and jumping are as responsive as you want them to be, and the level design is ingeniously creative. It ramps up in difficulty across the episodes at an appropriate pace, but it’s never unfairly frustrating.</p>
<p>Even the graphics have aged decently well. Yeah, they look retro—but in the fun, nostalgic way Super Nintendo games look retro as they’re rediscovered by new generations, not in the “look, you had to be there” way that a lot of its PC platformer peers do.</p>

<h2>An artifact of historical relevance</h2>
<p>Tim Sweeney, who founded Potomac Computer Systems turned Epic MegaGames turned Epic Games, is obviously a looming figure in the technology, gaming, and entertainment industries today. His company’s Unreal Engine is the default choice for AA and AAA game developers who want a ready-made game engine, and it’s widely used in Hollywood productions like Disney’s <em>The Mandalorian</em>, too.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>, the flagship game of Unreal Engine, is one of the most popular games in history, and was one of the main drivers of the tech industry’s obsession with the “metaverse” in the early 2020s. To this day, major gaming publishers are trying (and largely failing) to copy <em>Fortnite</em>‘s success.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>And Sweeney is an outspoken corporate activist—whether you agree with him or not, and no matter how you judge his sincerity and personal incentives—against platform gatekeepers like Apple and Google, who many feel leverage their positions unfairly.</p>
<p>So all that means&nbsp;<em>Jill of the Jungle</em> would be interesting even if it&nbsp;<em>wasn’t</em> fun, simply because it was the last game Sweeney (who was originally a programmer) personally designed.</p>

      Tim Sweeney left all sorts of Easter eggs in the game, including his own name.

      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p><em>Unreal</em>, the 1998 breakthrough game that arguably made Epic Games’ current industry prominence possible, was designed by then-up-and-comer Cliff Bleszinski; Sweeney only worked on it as a programmer, though, of course, engineering was arguably just as big a part of that game’s success as its design.</p>
<p><em>Jill of the Jungle</em> is a marvel of technical polish and what game designers call “juice”—all the little extra touches that add up to make a game feel great and seem extra—for its time. But it’s also a beautifully designed platformer, with amazingly creative levels.</p>
<p>I don’t always agree with Sweeney’s opinionated stances in the industry, and while many independent game developers champion him as a hero for standing up to the big platforms, I don’t trust his long-term ambitions any more than I do Apple’s. But playing&nbsp;<em>Jill of the Jungle</em>, it’s abundantly clear why he’s been as successful as he is.</p>
<p>There simply aren’t many people in the games industry who can claim equal mastery of engineering and business acumen, and those who have both are often pretty successful. But <em>Jill of the Jungle</em>‘s refined and clever game design also proves that Sweeney understands the creative dimension, too. There are even fewer people who have all three of those skills.</p>
<p>The game is <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fjill_of_the_jungle_the_complete_trilogy">worth a spin</a> just for fun and nostalgia, even if you don’t care about its historical relevance. Maybe I have nostalgia glasses on, but I think it has aged quite well.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-dual-nvidia-rtx-3050-gaming-graphics-card-returns-at-an-all-time-low-after-selling-out-on-black-friday-2000647705</link>
            <guid>1368505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC gamers and computer DIYers alike are going to love this Cyber Monday deal at Amazon after Black Friday — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">the ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 3050 is a gaming graphics card that’s capable of upgrading an older gaming rig or being the visual nerve center of a self-built one, and it’s just $160 after a 20% off deal</a>. That’s a great price for a major upgrade on an older computer, and definitely a more economical choice than buying an entirely new machine.</p>
<p>The RTX 3050 is compatible with PC towers, not laptops. It connects to the PC’s motherboard to drive the computer’s graphic performance. It’s an exceptional mid-range gaming graphics card with 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM, PCIe 4.0 support, HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4a ports, and a compact dual-slot build that allows it to also fit into the more-slender desktop PCs. It’s power- and heat efficient so you don’t need the large tower or big cooling setup to prevent it from overheating.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Reliable HD Gaming</h2>
<p>Installation of the RTX 3050 could not be easier — open the tower, find the motherboard, and either add the card in an empty graphics slot or replace the existing one. Once up and running, your PC will be fully capable of 1080p gaming, which is great for shooters, indie games, and eSports games thanks to the high frame rate and stable performance. It’s not a 4K gaming machine, but it’s plenty of HD power for an exceptional price.</p>
<p>The HDMI 2.1 hookup and fast refresh rate give you the further option of hooking up your upgraded PC to a faster monitor or TV. And as a new card, the firmware updates and the driver support will be better. Since every piece of a tech setup has a finite life before it reaches obsolescence — the point where the manufacturer no longer provides updates or support, and games are no longer compatible — a brand-new graphics card will push that deadline further down the road, thus extending the lifespan of your entire PC for a small price.</p>



<h2>Upgrade or Build</h2>
<p>Swapping out a graphics card to upgrade and extend the life of a PC is rewarding, but building one either from scratch or from the bones of an old dead tower is&nbsp;<em>fun</em>. But the cost does add up when you’re shopping for all of the components — motherboard, internal storage, RAM, and five or six things you didn’t know you needed until you tried to boot up. An inexpensive graphics card is a key component of a DIY build or rebuild, and the performance you get from the GeForce RTX 3050 for its original $200 price earned it an average 4.6-star rating from Amazon reviewers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">Now with this Cyber Monday deal that drops 20% off the price, the RTX 3050 vastly overperforms on its new $160 price</a>. Hit Amazon now before this Cyber Monday gamer deal ends.</p>

<h2>OLED Screens and Eye Tracking</h2>
<p>The <strong>PSVR2 has two OLED panels that give each eye a resolution of 2000×2040</strong>&nbsp;which is 4K total resolution. This gets rid of the screen-door effect that older VR headsets had, where you could see individual pixels. The <strong>110-degree field of view</strong> gives you peripheral vision that is similar to real life, so virtual environments feel truly big instead of like you’re looking through binoculars. With <strong>HDR support</strong>, deep blacks and bright highlights stand out and gives images more depth. The 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate options make fast gameplay smooth which helps with motion sickness and makes head movements feel natural instead of laggy.</p>



<p>The <strong>PSVR2’s best feature is eye tracking</strong> which lets the headset see where you’re looking and use that information in many different ways. Foveated rendering uses the graphics processing power to focus on what you’re looking at directly and lower the detail in your peripheral vision, and it makes things run faster without you noticing any quality loss. Some games use eye tracking to help you aim in shooters, make eye contact with NPCs in story-driven games, or start events based on where your gaze stays.</p>
<p>When there are explosions, impacts, or weather effects like rain, <strong>haptic feedback vibrates through the headset itself</strong> and adds a physical element that regular VR doesn’t have. The <strong>adaptive triggers on the included Sense controllers push back against your finger pressure</strong> in a way that makes drawing a bowstring feel tense or pulling the trigger on a gun feel real. Inside-out tracking uses four cameras built into the headset to keep an eye on the controllers and your play area and you don’t need any sensors mounted around your room.</p>



<p><em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em> shows off what PSVR2 can do with a VR adventure set in the Horizon universe: It has climbing mechanics that use hand-over-hand motion, archery that requires real aiming and drawing and beautiful views that show off the graphics quality. The game was made specifically for VR instead of being a port of a flat-screen game which means that every interaction uses the headset’s eye tracking and haptic features.</p>
<p>For $299 instead of $399, you can get the PSVR2 with Horizon Call of the Mountain which makes high-end VR available at a price that used to only get you entry-level standalone headsets. For $100 less, you get Sony’s best VR technology, including eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K OLED visuals – plus, you get a full AAA game that would cost $60 on its own.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s success is due, in part, to the "hype" and community discussions surrounding the horror game's release.</p>
<p>That's according to Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto and writer Ryukishi07, who said in an interview with <a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202511/57863">Dengeki Online</a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-fs-success-was-helped-greatly-by-memes-fanart-and-theories-it-inspired-devs-say-a-new-approach-to-writing-characters-unlocked-potential-for-virality/">Automaton</a>), that it was memes, fan-made content, and livestreams that made the game trend online, and especially in Japan.</p>

<p>"Recently, discourse about games is being consumed at a rapid pace," Okamoto said. "But games that do get talked about even months after release are the ones that are fun to theorise about and analyse, and they usually get a lot of character fan art. From my experience, titles which are able to show us that kind of hype tend to live on for longer."</p>
<p>Writer Ryukishi07 added that horror games "ultimately boil down to how much the player resonates with them. That's why protagonists of such games tend to be on the less-talkative side, so players can immerse themselves in the game.</p>
<p>"It's not something that makes you feel 'I want them to be my friend', it's more of a dark kind of appeal," he added.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean we can expect all future Silent Hill instalments to be action-heavy or set in Japan, though. Ryukishi07 suggested that while the latest game shouldn't necessarily set a blueprint for "the way the series should follow [...] if the direction we took with [Silent Hill] f is well-received, hopefully it could become one of the examples of the Silent Hill series' expressive range."</p><p>I had a good time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f, awarding it four out of five stars</a>, writing that Silent Hill f's frustrating first-half is outweighed by a brilliant, delirious second that's well worth the initial slog. Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-gets-a-fresh-update-that-addresses-combat-concerns-by-introducing-a-much-easier-casual-option">Neobards has since implemented an update</a> to make replays a little more enjoyable, and the combat sequences a little less frustrating.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-nintendo-sony-goes-no-margin-on-the-playstation-portal-remote-player-as-it-hits-an-all-time-low-after-black-friday-2000648779</link>
            <guid>1368496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming consoles have come through in a big way this past decade. The Nintendo Switch paved the way for the other big players in the gaming space to rethink what it means to be able to game while on the go. We’ve since seen the advent of the Steam Deck—Valve’s PC gaming handheld—along with some other third parties throwing their hats in the race with the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/">PlayStation has its own take on the format with the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5. Amazon happens to have it discounted for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a> The 11% savings equates to the handheld system dropping from $200 to just $179 for a limited time. You end up saving $21.</p>
<p>On the surface, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player looks like if you hacked up a PS5 DualSense controller and stuck the pieces to the side of your Nintendo Switch. That’s not a bad thing. The PS5 controller is comfortable to use, and having the handheld mimic it almost exactly allows for a more seamless experience when playing games between your PlayStation 5 console and your PlayStation Portal Remote Player. The handheld is capable of playing games at up to 60fps, displaying in a resolution of 1080p. Choose between either the white version or the midnight black model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Where the PlayStation Portal Remote Player differs from the other gaming handhelds is its not a standalone unit. The Portal doe not let you play games directly on the unit itself. the games you play are either streamed from the cloud or streamed from your home PlayStation 5 console. So in that sense, it’s more akin to the Wii U gamepad as opposed to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Remote Play let’s you play compatible games you have installed on your PS5 console, be they PlayStation 5 games or PlayStation 4 games. This makes the PlayStation Portal Remote Player a great accessory for families who share the TV room. Are you a dad, trying to catch up on&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II: Remastered</em> before the new HBO season comes back? You can sit and enjoy the game on your PlayStation Portal Remote Player with some headphones while your kid enjoys Ms. Rachel on the TV.</p>



<h2>Better With PlayStation Plus</h2>
<p>With PlayStation Plus, you gain access to an expansive catalogue of digital games—a good chunk of which are Cloud Streaming compatible.</p>
<p>The Game Catalogue is filled with newly released titles that you will have access to play with a monthly subscription. It’s Netflix applied to video games. Dive into games like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and&nbsp;<em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>. You also gain access to the Classics Catalogue where you can explore all the PlayStation games of yesteryear. You can play through the entire original God of War trilogy before stepping into the two latest games that came with 2016’s soft-reboot of the series.</p>

		<p>If you like Helldivers then I recommend you keep an hour free to watch For Liberty! which is a new fan-made film based on Helldivers 2. It is exceptionally professional with spectacular animation and a rousing score that features familiar-sounding riffs.</p>
<p>It’s also very funny and captures the expandability of the Helldivers along with the fascist regime hiding under the name of Managed Democracy. There’s even a little Drag Race reference which I was not expecting.</p>


<p>For Liberty! finds the Helldivers on a planet where the Automatons are conducting experiments on the Terminids and creating cyborg bugs, but for what reason? The plot follows a female Helldiver as they investigate what is going and, of course, kill an awful lot of robots and bugs. It also cleverly uses the first person perspective from the game for a dramatic key moment, and like all good franchise films, teases a sequel right at the very end of the credits.</p>
<p>You can watch the entire movie below, but if you like it go and give them a like and follow on YouTube where you can find out more about the film.</p>
<p><iframe title="For Liberty! A Helldivers Film (Full Movie)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7nXj34kwIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Helldivers 2 has been a huge hit for Sony with an<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-in-august/"> Xbox X|S version launching this yea</a>r. On December 2nd 2025 the Python Commandos Premium Warbond will launch with three brand new stratagems and a new primary weapon. The new gun, a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher called the AR/GL-21 One-Two. It’s “heavy to wield, but the damage dealt is heavy too, making your primary slot more versatile than ever with two guns in one!”</p>

<p>You will also get the M-1000 Maxigun is belt-fed with ultra-high ammo capacity, and there’s a new Guard Dog assistant, this one is armed with a flamethrower. There is new armour, new emotes, new capes and all the usual cosmetic bobbins.</p>
<p>Alongside For Liberty! there is also an official Helldivers film<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/"> on the way</a>. The Helldivers movie will be based on Helldivers 2, but there is no confirmed release window, cast, or even what story will be told through the movie.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1c74ecdbe6fc7"><a title="Bionic Commando - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c74ecdbe6fc7/bionic-commando-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Get your spiciest takes at the ready, because it's time to dive into another edition of Box Art Brawl!</p>
<p>It was a special edition affair <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-snes-classic-mini-console">last time</a>, as we celebrated the 35th anniversary of the SNES by matching up three boxes for the SNES Mini. There was one clear winner in our eyes, and you lovely lot agreed with us! The simplistic Japanese design comfortably walked away with the win, taking 48% of the vote and leaving Europe and North America with the remaining 26% and 25%, respectively.</p>
<p>Inspired by the arrival of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-nes-and-game-boy-library-with-four-more-titles">Game Boy version on Nintendo Switch Online</a> this week, we're taking a look at three covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/bionic_commando">Bionic Commando</a> on the NES — what can we say, it had more variety in its art than the arguably more relevant GB release! It's a trio of different designs to pick between this week, so let's dive straight in.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6zymhtk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e5d22baea3f6e"><a title="Bionic Commando - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e5d22baea3f6e/bionic-commando-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73-bionic-commando">Capcom / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like the promise in its top left corner, the North American cover is all-out action. Our titular hero swings from his bionic arm front and centre, with the odds stacking up behind him. There are giant metal machines, foot soldiers, helicopters, <em>bats</em> — it all builds up a question of 'how will he ever get out of this one? Buy the game to find out!'</p>
<p>Honestly, the colour variety rules in this one, too. It's an all-round goodie, no?</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="fc751c1809b5c"><a title="Bionic Commando - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fc751c1809b5c/bionic-commando-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73-bionic-commando">Capcom / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lot of that action is stripped back for the European release — the helicopters and foot soldiers make the jump, sure, but where are the <em>bats</em>?? The commando's outfit has been swapped out to something that more closely resembles a comic-accurate Vision, and a big old blue border steps up to occupy an unsettlingly large portion of the box.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4633698e5dd54"><a title="Bionic Commando - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4633698e5dd54/bionic-commando-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73-bionic-commando">Capcom / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now this is something different! It might not be quite as kinetic, but the Japanese cover opts for action of a different kind, with our titular hero shooting at the baddies across from him. Be it the looming big bad in the fiery sky or the blood-soaked logo, this cover leans way more into the high-stakes gore of it all, and makes for a rather eye-catching design in the process.</p>

		<p>Right out from the grand finale to Chapter 6, Fortnite has kicked into Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, starting a new era for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite-battle-royale">Fortnite Battle Royale</a> at the Golden Coast. This is more than just a bunch of new locations and branded tie-ins, though, with a clutch of core gameplay changes, including boss battles, simple build and self revives.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter Seven: Pacific Break | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eln66CJHna8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One change is how you drop into your <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> match, with the Battle Bus now out of commission and Storm Surfing the way that you reach the Island instead. From there, the map has new POIs including Battlewood Boulevard, Sandy Strip, Wonkeeland, and Classified Canyon.</p>
<p>But really it’s all about the new gameplay tweaks and additions.</p>

<li>Stay in the Game&nbsp;– In the very rare occasion&nbsp;players are downed, they can use a Self-Revive Device to revive themselves while they’re DBNO (Down But Not Out).
<ul>
<li>Additionally, new DBNO movement options include Roll &amp; Tumble, DBNO Sprint, and Stay on the Move.</li>
<li>Lastly, Drivable Reboot Vans have rolled onto the Island!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defeat the Boss, Be the Boss&nbsp;– Defeat bosses to claim their loot, powers, and transform into them! Becoming a boss grants full Health and Shield, bonus max Health and Shield, infinite Energy, and a powerful ability. Careful: boss positions remain visible to nearby opponents at all times!</li>
<li>Simple Build&nbsp;– Simple Build is an option in Settings (Game &gt; Building) that makes learning how to build simpler. Turn it on, look in the direction you want to build, and just… build!</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that the new battle pass has got a whole host of film references that 12-year-olds won’t really understand. The Bride from Kill Bill is turning up, katana in hand, and Marty McFly will bring 1980s chic to 2025 (a decade on from the “future” that he ended up visiting in the sequel).</p>
<p>This is all a little bit temporary, though. The Battle Bus returns on 4th December, at which point Reload will come back online with the Surf City map, Blitz Royale will have the new Starfall Island map, and ranked will also return. Fortnite OG will also return on 11th December with Season 7.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-nikita-voice-hurry/</link>
            <guid>1368469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has skipped over the issues plaguing one of the rarest rewards in Escape from Tarkov and just issued a code that will give you <strong>Nikita’s voicelines </strong>instantly in the spearhead extraction shooter title. This is in response to waves of people complaining that Twitch drops, which are supposed to unlock the voice, simply aren’t working as intended.</p>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita Buyanov’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, the code you need is right down below.</p>







<h2 id="h-nikita-voice-code-for-escape-from-tarkov">Nikita Voice Code for Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, you need to use the following code: <strong>WILWILBE</strong>.</p>



<p>Like any other code, this <span>can be redeemed via the escapefromtarkov.com site&nbsp;<strong>or&nbsp;</strong>through</span> the launcher. Once you’ve entered the code, you’ll be met with a <strong>green message </strong>if it worked, just like the one below:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, there’s a huge catch. You’ve only got <strong>three days </strong>until the code becomes invalid, so if you’re reading this guide after December 2nd or 3rd, you’re out of luck, and you might never get the voicelines.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov recently launched into a 1.0 state after more than a decade in development. It was the biggest milestone in the game’s history, but it was somewhat marred by network issues, server instability, and a hefty assortment of bugs, all of which led to Battlestate Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bsg-apologize-escape-from-tarkov-launch-problems/">issuing a public apology</a>.</p>



<p>That being said, the game has now become more accessible and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-getting-easier-first-time-decade/">easier for newcomers</a>, and in our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/">Escape from Tarkov review</a> (which scored maximum marks), we wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Through thick and thin, Escape from Tarkov has prevailed. It’s an enormous, deep, and rich game that’s still evolving, it offers unparalleled emotional experiences, and it looks, sounds, and feels great while doing all that. It’s the most punishing game you’ll ever play, but if you put enough hours into understanding this gem of a title, you’ll come to appreciate that it is a generational masterpiece of the extraction shooter market.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you managed to secure Nikita’s voice in Tarkov.</p>

			<p>Epic Games announced the release of Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, following the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1994855116869116102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly successful finale of Fortnite Chapter Six: Zero Hour</a>, where 10.5 million players joined the event in the game and over three million were watching through various livestreams.</p>



<p>As fitting for the Golden Coast island, players will 'Storm Surf' their way to it instead of dropping from the Battle Bus as usual. Once there, they'll find a brand new sun-soaked map that can be explored on foot, with vehicles, and even with the new hot air balloons. The developers outlined the following key locations: </p>



<p>● Battlewood Boulevard<br>● Sandy Strip<br>● Wonkeeland<br>● Humble Hills<br>● Bumpy Bay<br>● Classified Canyon</p>



<p>As you can see in the image gallery below, Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break features a fair amount of variety in locales.</p>

<p>Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break introduces a few juicy gameplay additions, such as drivable reboot vans and a self-revive device that can be used when the player is in the DBNO (down but not out) state. DBNO is also further enhanced with the ability to roll and tumble away from enemy fire, a sprinting ability which uses Energy, the ability to use ziplines, ascenders, and even get into cars as a passenger, or crawling or being thrown into the back of the aforementioned reboot van.</p>



<p>Defeating bosses like Human Bill, Hush, or Beach Brutus will let you claim their powers as well as their loot, giving your character full health and shield, a bonus maximum health and shield, infinite energy, and a powerful ability. On the flip side, your position will be visible to nearby opponents at all times.</p>



<p>In Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, during each phase of the storm, Rift anomalies may summon loot and grant powerful effects to everyone in the match. More anomalies will be added throughout the course of the season.</p>



<p>Furthermore, to ensure fairness at the start of a match, gold bars will no longer carry over from one match to another. As such, players should spend them before the current match ends to reboot their teammates, hire characters, or grab powerful gear from vending machines with a new item stock. Epic is also now letting players drop bars to share resources with teammates.</p>



<p>Additional improvements include redesigned hit markers and improved visibility, ammo status indicators for weapons in the inventory, the ability to aim down sight while jumping, a spectator mode that now automatically tunes into the nearest teammate, and an overhauled emote wheel.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new season adds several new weapons that Epic says are more responsive, offering layered recoil and smoother ADS (aiming down sight) transitions. Reload progress is now saved when your magazine is empty, which is certainly going to be useful. Here's the list of new weapons in Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break:</p>



<p>● Iron Pump Shotgun: A new heavy-hitting Pump Shotgun.<br>● Twin Hammer Shotguns: Dual-wielded Pump Shotguns.<br>● Deadeye Assault Rifle: Scoped, automatic, and built for those who hit headshots at middle-to-long ranges.<br>● Holo Rush SMG: Scoped, fast, and dangerous in tight quarters.<br>● Vengeful Sniper Rifle: Reaps opponents with bolt-action precision.<br>● Arc-Lightning Gun: Zap players, vehicles, and builds with electricity.<br>● Forsaken Vow Blade: Dash in and out faster than with the Kinetic Blade, unleashing a flurry of lightning-fast strikes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fortnite-chapter-seven-pacific-break-wingsuit.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The wingsuit is a featured item for this season, allowing players to glide through the Golden Coast island. Moreover, the following items are returning from the Vault:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Terrain Kart (alongside the usual sports cars and SUVs)</li>



<li>Enforcer AR, Tactical Pistol and Dual Micro SMG</li>



<li>Shockwave and Clinger grenades</li>



<li>Chug Jugs</li>



<li>Shield Kegs</li>



<li>Med Kits</li>



<li>Bandages</li>



<li>Shield Potions</li>



<li>Mini Shield Potions</li>



<li>Zero Build only: Shield Bubble Jrs and Port-a-Bunkers</li>
</ul>



<p>The Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break Battle Pass lets you seek revenge as The Bride, represent the future as Marty McFly and unlock Fortnite originals such as Miles Cross and Cat Holloway, plus a new version of Dark Voyager. It also features special styles for three outfits: Cat Holloway, Carter Wu and Dark Voyager (Reality Redacted). These additional Styles can only be unlocked by completing Quests in Blitz Royale, Reload and Battle Royale, respectively.</p>



<p>By the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quentin Tarantino's The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge</a> will premiere later today at 2 PM Eastern Time.</p>

<p>This latest update features some notable changes, including notifications displaying what software friends are playing, and the ability to send friend requests to players you've spoken to in GameChat sessions.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown via the App Store, including some iOS-specific updates:</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch App - Version 3.2.0 (27th Nov 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>What's New:</strong></p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ptxqgw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<ul>
<li><em>The app no longer supports iOS versions prior to iOS 16. iOS devices must have iOS 16 or later to be compatible with this app.</em></li>
<li><em>The notification you received when a friend comes online has now been updated to include the name of the software they're using, if applicable.</em></li>
<li><em>You can now send friend requests to users you chatted with in a GameChat session.</em></li>
<li><em>You can now copy the hashtags for a software title. This can be done from the details for a screenshot or video.</em></li>
<li><em>You can now create a Nintendo Switch App album in the iOS Photos app. To use this feature, enable it from Settings in this app.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused the order of screenshots and videos to change when downloading several at once.</em></li>
<li><em>Other small bug fixes have also been made.</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If you've not downloaded this app yet, it's designed to enhance the online gameplay experience for the Switch and Switch 2. It allows you to use more friend features and game-specific services for compatible titles.</p>
<p>Nintendo also recently released a new storefront app in select regions for Android and iOS.</p>

<figure data-uuid="531917e66ddbe"><a title="Art of Mana" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/531917e66ddbe/art-of-mana.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix, Dark Horse Books</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dark Horse and Square Enix are celebrating three decades of the Mana series with an English version of <strong>Legend of Mana: The Art of Mana - 30th Anniversary Edition</strong> book.</p>
<p>This is the first time this book has been published in English and will give fans a "deeper look" at the action RPG. Here's some additional PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A full-color art book giving fans a deeper look at the action roleplaying game, <em>Legend of Mana</em>. This will be the first time the book has been published in English and will include art created for the game’s original release in 1999, as well as art crafted exclusively for this book by Yukata koyama, Shinichi Kamoeka, Masaki Takahashi, HACCAN, and Kanta Kamei.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"This 80-page special 30th anniversary edition art book contains <em>Legend of Mana</em>’s vast Lands and Artifacts, character pixel art, Mystic Cards, boss monster illustrations, and more. Fans can take a deeper look into the materials and illustrations created when the original version of the <em>Legend of Mana</em> game was released, including newly drafted selection screen art, character designs, and background art."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, this book includes 80 pages in total. It will be available in hardcover and is scheduled to arrive in bookstores on <strong>28th July 2026</strong> for <strong>$29.99</strong> (or the equivalent). Pre-orders are now available on the Dark Horse website and other sites like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
<p>The Video Game Library (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRnUxHujTyW/">via Instagram</a>) has also cleared up some confusion about the "30th Anniversary" subtitle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The book itself was originally published in 2021 in Japan (30 years after Seiken Densetsu). This is the long-awaited English localization"</p>

<p>Apart from the update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a>, several other titles have reportedly received compatibility fixes. Here's the rundown via Nintendo Everything:</p>

<p>Apart from this, some problems with certain other titles have also been identified. This includes an issue with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sports_party">Sports Party</a>, where waiting on the title screen for half a minute can apparently create an issue. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blade_of_darkness">Blade of Darkness</a> also supposedly have some progression issues.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo recently launched a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-launches-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-search-page">dedicated search page</a>, allowing users to check the compatibility of Switch software on the Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Pinball machines are an enduring icon of gaming, but their main drawback is that they take up a lot of space. Luckily, AtGames has solved this dilemma with its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Games-Licensed-Invaders-Bluetooth/dp/B0BN285THC?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">compact Legends Pinball Micro Machine</a>, and you can get one at the all-time low price of $310 during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a>. The MSRP for these machines is $600, and while the price has fluctuated and dropped to around $330 in the past, this is the first time we've seen one of these tables go on sale for this low a price.

The 15.6-inch LCD screen displays smooth 60fps gameplay, and there's 16GB of storage for loading new games onto the machine. It comes with pre-installed 50 tables from the Zaccaria library, including classics like Space Invaders, Bubble Bobble, and more.</p><p>Along with the digital playing table, it also has a dot-matrix screen to display your high score and game graphics, stereo speakers, haptic feedback, and a nudge sensor.

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 83″ OLED S85F 4K Smart TV (2025) at 42% Off, Time to Throw Out Your 65″ and Upgrade]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-83-oled-s85f-4k-smart-tv-2025-at-42-off-time-to-throw-out-your-65-and-upgrade-2000648809</link>
            <guid>1368379</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s 83-inch S85F TV proves that OLED screens have finally gotten big enough to turn your living room into a real home theater. This 2025 model packs 20 neural networks that upscale everything to stunning 4K clarity and the OLED panel delivers deep blacks and vivid colors that LCD technology can’t match. The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/">just slashed the price to $2,497 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the original $4,297 sticker</a>, which marks <strong>an all-time low for an 83-inch OLED with this level of AI processing power</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI Processing Works While You Watch</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen2 processor has 20 specialized neural networks</strong> that each work on a different part of image quality, such as sharpness, color accuracy, motion handling, and brightness optimization. These networks look at each frame in real time and find objects, faces, and scenes so they can make specific improvements instead of blanket processing that can make some content look too sharp or too bright.</p>
<p>When you stream a show that was made in 1080p or lower,<strong> the AI upscaling doesn’t just stretch the picture to fit the 4K panel</strong> but it also fills in missing details by guessing what should be there based on patterns it sees. This means that older movies and TV shows become clearer and more defined, so they can be watched on an 83-inch screen without looking pixelated or soft around the edges.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Vision AI goes even further by <strong>automatically changing settings based on the type of content you’re watching</strong>: Sports get better motion smoothing to keep fast camera pans clear, while movies get a different kind of treatment that keeps the cinematic feel with the right color grading and motion handling. You never have to go into settings menus or change picture modes by hand because the processor makes these changes automatically as scenes change in the same piece of content.</p>



<p>The<strong> OLED HDR feature makes contrast that LCD panels can’t match</strong> because each pixel makes its own light instead of using a backlight that bleeds into dark areas. When a scene goes from a bright outdoor shot to a dark interior shot, you can see true blacks in the shadows and highlights that stay bright without washing out the whole frame. This self-emissive technology lets you sit at wider angles without changing the color or lowering the contrast.</p>
<p>When you watch nature documentaries, cooking shows, or anything else where accurate color reproduction changes how you see the picture, Pantone validation makes sure that the colors match real-world references. Instead of looking too pink or orange like some TVs that value bright colors over accuracy, skin tones look natural in different lighting and ethnic groups. This validation process checks the display output against Pantone’s color standards.</p>



<p><em>Object Tracking Sound Lite</em> makes <strong>sounds that move across the screen to match where the action is happening</strong> in the frame: This makes the game feel more real, even if you’re using the built-in speakers instead of a surround sound system. The sound moves with the car as it drives from left to right instead of staying in the center channel and it helps your brain naturally connect visual and audio cues. <strong>Alexa integration lets you control the TV</strong>, look for content, and manage smart home devices without having to get up from your chair.</p>
<p>Right now, you can save $1,800 off the regular price of $2,497, and you get the <strong>newest model from 2025 with better AI processing</strong> that older models don’t have. This Cyber Monday deal is great for anyone who wants to improve their home theater and the huge screen, self-lit OLED pixels, and neural network upscaling work&nbsp; make streaming services, gaming, and regular TV watching feel like high-quality entertainment that is worth the money.</p>

Engineered for both work and play, the V2 Iskur supports your upper and lower back, features adjustable armrests, and offers thicker padding to keep you comfortable for long stretches. This model also has a wider seat compared to the original iteration, allowing for more even pressure distribution. An integrated lumbar arch support helps you maintain a healthy posture, and the chair offers an adjustable recline of up to 152 degrees for a more relaxed position. One thing to note is that the V2 Iskur will require assembly, but it's easy and relatively quick thanks to the included instructions.</p><p><strong>Razer Iskur V2 Gaming Chair Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Ergonomic-Gaming-Built/dp/B0DP5SY554?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a> -- $250 (<del>$300</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Ergonomic-Gaming-Built/dp/B0DXS1BVCB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Light Gray</a> -- $250 (<del>$300</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>Amazon also has several other <a href="https://amzn.to/48ex6Ek" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer gaming chairs on sale</a> currently.

              <p>Samsung’s goal with their AI-powered earbuds was to make them understand how you listen instead of making you change how you listen – and they did this before Apple even announced that the AirPods Pro 3 would have similar features. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro has adaptive intelligence</strong> that automatically changes based on your surroundings and makes them smarter than anything else you have in your ears right now.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">lowered the price of these silver earbuds from $249 to just $159 for Cyber Monday weekend</a>. This is the lowest price ever for Samsung’s best wireless earbuds. Since Apple’s latest model doesn’t beat these on any important spec, this deal is even better for anyone who wants high-quality sound without the high price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI That Hears What You Say</h2>
<p>Samsung made these earbuds with Galaxy AI technology which does the hard work for you so you don’t have to think about it. The adaptive active noise cancellation <strong>always keeps an eye on your surroundings and changes itself on the fly</strong>, so you don’t have to mess with settings when you go from a quiet office to a busy street. This means that when the earbuds sense that the environment is louder, they automatically turn up the noise cancellation. And when you need to hear conversations or announcements around you, they turn it down.</p>
<p>The adaptive equalizer goes even further by looking at how the buds fit in your ear and changing the sound profile to fit: Everyone’s ears are different, so the same earbuds can sound very different to different people.</p>



<p>The new fit fixes one of the biggest problems people had with older Galaxy Buds models: they were uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Samsung changed the design of these Buds 3 Pro to a canal style and the stems are shaped like blades which helps with <strong>stability and keeps the weight evenly distributed</strong>. When you use the stems, they light up with a soft glow. This looks cool and also makes them easier to find when you put them down in low light.</p>
<p>The Real-Time Interpreter feature turns these earbuds into a t<strong>ravel buddy that helps you talk to people in person</strong> who don’t speak the same language. When you turn on this feature, the person speaking Spanish hears their language through the phone speaker, and you hear the English translation directly in your ears. This makes the conversation flow smoothly without both people having to huddle around a screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>sound quality is good because there are two amplifiers and planar tweeters</strong> that handle high frequencies well and keep distortion low even when the volume is high. The dedicated high and low frequency channels keep bass and treble processing separate. This keeps tracks with a lot of instruments in different frequency ranges from getting muddy. You can hear this separation best in orchestral music or thick electronic music, where cheaper earbuds tend to make everything sound like a wall of sound.</p>
<p>At $159, you’re getting Samsung’s best earbuds for $90 less than their normal price: This puts them in the same price range as mid-range options that don’t have any AI features. The <strong>two-year Amazon-only warranty</strong> gives you twice the coverage you would normally get.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-crash-to-all-time-low-year-round-lighting-cheaper-than-budget-holiday-lights-2000648801</link>
            <guid>1368355</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting systems get rid of the yearly hassle of putting up and taking down disposable holiday lights every winter, then storing the tangled strands that always stop working the next year. Govee’s permanent outdoor lights “Pro” stay up all year on your roofline or eaves and you can change the color scheme for holidays, seasons, or everyday accent lighting with just a few taps in an app.</p>
<p>Installation is surprisingly easy because the clips have adhesive backs that attach each light in about eight seconds: This gets rid of the ladder gymnastics and frustration that make hanging lights the most hated chore. Normally, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">200-foot kit with 120 RGBIC LED lights costs $759 but Amazon is currently offering it for just $459, which is the lowest price ever</a>. This deal started on Black Friday and will last through Cyber Monday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Gives You Real Color Flexibility</h2>
<p>The RGBWWIC label means that <strong>each bulb has six separate LED chips: red, green, blue, warm white, cool white</strong>&nbsp;and an integrated circuit control that lets you control each light separately. This wider range of colors goes beyond basic RGB systems that have trouble getting whites right. It gives you bright, saturated colors for parties and holidays, as well as natural warm and cool whites that are good for everyday outdoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>warm white mode at 2700K makes the room feel cozy</strong>, like old-fashioned Edison bulbs. The <strong>cool white mode at 6500K</strong>, on the other hand, gives off bright light that is great for security or task lighting around doorways and walkways.<strong> Each light can give off up to 50 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is bright enough to light up the outside of your home instead of just adding decorative touches that get lost in street lighting.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design makes the light into a triangular beam pattern that cuts down on harsh glare while still letting people on the street and in nearby homes see it. This optical engineering stops the raw LED bulbs from blinding people when they look directly at them, making the display more pleasant for you and anyone who walks by your house. The<strong> 75 pre-programmed scene modes</strong> have animated effects like color waves, twinkling patterns, and gradient transitions that move across the whole 200-foot run.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app lets you control each LED individually so you can change the colors of different parts of your roofline to make patterns, text, or images on the outside of your home. You could show off the colors of your favorite sports team, write messages for special occasions, or make patterns of the American flag for patriotic holidays without having to buy different light strings.</p>
<p>The <strong>lights and power adapter both have an IP67 waterproof rating</strong>&nbsp;which means that they can be submerged in water up to 1 meter deep without being damaged. This makes them very safe from rain, snow, and sprinkler overspray. The <strong>IP65</strong> control box doesn’t protect as well but it can still handle heavy rain and dust without any problems. <strong>Govee says these lights will last for 50,000 hours</strong> which is more than 5 years of continuous use or decades of normal seasonal use.</p>



<p>To install, use the included VHB (Very High Bond) adhesive and clips to attach the lights 2 to 4 inches away from the wall or soffit. Each clip snaps onto the light housing and sticks to the outside of your house. This keeps the bulb at the right angle and distance for the best light distribution. The system comes in 16.4-foot sections that connect with waterproof joints. This lets you go around corners, over different rooflines, or skip parts where things like chimneys get in the way.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday price of $459 instead of $759 makes permanent outdoor lighting cost less than many homeowners spend on disposable lights over just a few years, while delivering capabilities that temporary strands can’t approach.</p>

            <p>
I understand why walking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sims</a> aren't really a thing any more. Some of the earliest big names like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a>, and arguably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> all came at a time where indie games were growing in popularity, but were still predominantly 2D. Something simple like a walking sim is obviously quite resourceful compared to contemporary AAA games, but now the indie scene has blown up to the point where mechanics-first genres like roguelikes are dominating. Except I like walking sims! So when a game like nophenia, a walking sim where you're a wolfgirl with a flip phone exploring different dream worlds, shows up, I'm going to pay attention.
</p>
<p>
There is a real boldness to nophenia's very simple Steam page. "There is… no game," the about section explains. "You walk around and explore brutalist but also dream-like environments." Aside from that, it explains that there are dedicated "sit" and "howl" buttons because "wolfgirls are super cool" (wolfgirls are super cool), and lists out the controls. Mysterious…
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
Luckily, there's a (very short, I should note) demo to try out. It really is as simple as it describes, you can walk or run around, jump, but primarily you're taking in the sights. And these sights are quite lonely. There's no one else around, apart from in one dream where there is an infinitely passing train. In another dream, umbrellas strewn across a flooded road imply passersby. You let out a howl, only for it to not be reciprocated. All you can do is press forward, more so figuratively, moving from one dream to the next, taking all the time you want in each of them, unable to return to the previous one.
</p>
<p>
I like the flip phone pause menu too. There's a quality of longing in the demo for some kind of quiet, a sense of digital escape. It doesn't feel like an accident that you start in a messy bedroom with a boarded up door, the main source of light coming from a computer, the current source of all evil in this world. There's a photo mode too, and while aesthetically you're not using your flip phone, that's obviously the vibe, with the screenshots it produces outputting at a measly but nostalgic 640x480p.
</p><p>
Everything nophenia has going for it makes a strong argument for the value of walking sims. They're a genre that forces us to take our time, slow down a little, stay with our thoughts, and that seems to come through thematically here as well.
</p>
<p>
What other dreams nophenia might hold, I look forward to seeing whenever it arrives in early 2026. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3979330/nophenia/">here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-sold-out-after-black-friday-chaos-amazon-offers-ps5-pro-at-record-low-this-cyber-monday-2000648789</link>
            <guid>1368343</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The PS5 Slim, both the Digital and Standard editions, sold out completely during Black Friday sales. But the good news is that Amazon just cut the price of the PS5 Pro for Cyber Monday weekend and gives shoppers a rare chance to get Sony’s very best console at a record low price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This PlayStation 5 Pro usually costs $749, but the current deal brings the price down to $648</a>, a record low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True 4K Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>GPU in the PS5 Pro has 67% more compute units and 28% faster memory than the base PS5</strong> and gives it the power to run demanding games at full 4K resolution without using upscaling tricks. You won’t have to choose between frame rate and resolution anymore when you play games that are optimized for the Pro because the Pro can handle both at the same time.</p>
<p>PS5 Pro enhancement patches for games like Spider-Man 2, Horizon Forbidden West, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <strong>unlock higher resolutions, better textures, and smoother performance that the base PS5 hardware</strong> can’t keep up with. You will immediately notice the difference in image clarity when there is a lot of movement or in detailed open-world environments where the standard PS5 drops resolution to keep performance up.</p>
<p>PlayStation <em>Spectral Super Resolution</em> is a custom <strong>AI-driven upscaling technology</strong> that looks at game images at the pixel level and reconstructs detail that is close to native 4K quality from lower resolution inputs. This machine learning method works differently from simple checkerboard rendering because it looks at how each pixel should look based on trained models instead of just filling in the gaps between existing pixels. <strong>PSSR lets games render at 1440p or 1800p internally and then upscale to 4K with very little loss of quality</strong>.</p>



<p>Dedicated hardware acceleration <strong>speeds up ray tracing calculations by up to three time</strong>s compared to the base console and makes ray tracing much better. Ray-traced reflections, shadows and global illumination effects that used to slow down frame rates on standard PS5 now run at playable speeds. This makes these visual improvements useful instead of just tech demos that you admire for a short time before turning them off.</p>
<p>The <strong>2TB internal SSD doubles the storage space of the first PS5 models</strong> which is good because modern games often take up more than 100GB with all their updates and DLC. With this extra storage, you can keep a dozen AAA games ready to play without having to delete and redownload them all the time based on what you want to play that night.</p>



<p>The <strong>console doesn’t come with a disc drive</strong> so you’ll have to buy games and movies digitally unless you spend $79 on Sony’s optional external drive. This choice keeps costs down, but it also means that there are no used game markets, no sharing games with friends, and no watching 4K Blu-rays without buying more.</p>
<p>The <strong>included DualSense controller has the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong> that made the PS5’s tactile experience stand out. These features set PlayStation apart from its competitors. The console has Wi-Fi 7, which makes downloads faster and streaming more stable. It also has USB-C ports on the front for easy charging of accessories.</p>
<p>The Pro costs only $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition when both are at full price, which is a very small premium for double the storage and much better performance. You’re getting hardware that will last for years and play the best settings on upcoming games, ray tracing features that make gameplay better instead of just screenshots, and instant upgrades to your current game library.</p>

Many of the characters appearing in the event had been teased ahead of time, though exactly what would happen was left uncertain. And indeed, despite going multiple rounds with King Kong and a Star Destroyer, the Dark Presence was still left standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest surprise of the event was quite how much Fortnite celebrated its own beloved lore, with the Dark Presence finally defeated thanks to a last-ditch decision by Jonesy to call in the game's  villainous Cube. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Full Fortnite Zero Hour live event gameplay! 🎬</p><p>Epic just pulled off its own version of Avengers Endgame 🔥</p><p>How would you rate the event out of 10? 👀<a href="https://t.co/ifWqkeNKF6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ifWqkeNKF6</a></p></div>— Beebom Gaming (@beebomgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/beebomgaming/status/1994851824491532353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now sharing gameplay of the event and finding numerous Easter eggs, such as characters from Steal the Brainrot being featured in the background, and Hatsune Miku joining the battle while perched on Godzilla's head. I particularly love this fan creation, which overlays Avengers: Endgame's score on top of Zero Hour's "portals" sequence:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite Zero Hour Event (with Endgame Music)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteZeroHour?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#FortniteZeroHour</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/6Jacvsq3px" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6Jacvsq3px</a></p>— ABALDY (@ABaldy64) <a href="https://twitter.com/ABaldy64/status/1994857279796253165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty here, too, for Fortnite lore fans to digest.

And how is Epic Games going to top this next year? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the event's gameplay portion complete, some players reported seeing their games abruptly crash as an unexpected cutscene began to air.

Fortnite Chapter 7 will begin with our heroes enjoying life on a new map themed around the southern US. There are Fortnite-y versions of Hollywood and Area 51 to explore, while fresh gameplay changes include wingsuits and drivable Reboot Vans. Everything seems pretty chill, until The Last Reality's mothership does indeed turn up (and promptly blows up Fortnite's beloved Battle Bus!)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And after <em>that</em>, for those still connected, Fortnite really did call it a day.

Crikey, it's been a long time coming, but it looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> is finally coming to a close… next year. Up until earlier this week, the fifth and final episode of The Long Dark's Wintermute DLC was due to be released by the end of the year. As you've probably gathered, the end of the year is very close now, so as a result, episode five has been delayed, but it is a delay that at least comes with a concrete release date.
</p>
<p>
The release date in question is March 31st, 2026, about four months away. Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hinterland">Hinterland</a> Studio explained the delay in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/582781208710089005?l=english">Steam post</a> thusly: "While the majority of the episode content is now finished, there was just no way for us to wrap up the remaining cinematic work, the soundtrack, or complete the last bit of mission polish in time for the end of this year as we had originally planned. So we’re taking a couple of extra months to finish that work, then to optimize, fix the bugs, and get it ready for console certification and launch for the end of March."

<p>
With this delay and formal release date announcement came a new trailer too, showing off bits and pieces of what you can expect from episode five, which is titled The Light at the End of All Things. A bit of a wordy title, but, I suppose it goes with the emotional angle the trailer went for. It's just a lot of shots of scenery you'll presumably experience with a melancholic voice over, like a town next to a frozen lake, a boat at night time while an aurora borealis shines above, and some kind of radar station. The last bit of dialogue you hear is "nothing lasts forever," which, sheesh, that's a real bummer my guy!
</p><p>
In any case, while this might be the end of The Long Dark, it's not the end of The Long Dark (the series). About a year ago Hinterlands announced that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-long-dark-2-announced-with-co-op-multiplayer-new-urban-areas-and-sanity-system">working on a sequel</a>, called Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 (can't tell you why Blackfrost isn't a subtitle, seems bad for branding, but what do I know). This one will feature things like co-op multiplayer, some urban areas, and a sanity system, so if this last episode of The Long Dark doesn't scratch certain itches for you, it's possible its sequel will.

<p>The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley posted some mysterious images this morning. However, it seems fans have already&nbsp;started to figure out what those teases could be.</p>



<p>On December 11th, The Game Awards are set to go live on social media. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, the event celebrates the best of the year’s games. This year is host to a plethora of amazing titles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-breaking Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. However, in recent shows, it’s also been home to huge reveals like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-wont-feature-at-the-game-awards-despite-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. This morning, Geoff Keighley and The Game Awards’ socials posted <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1994816833464217796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">weird photos of a mysterious statue</a> and location. Now, it seems the mystery is going a bit deeper thanks to one fan’s journey to said locale.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-game-awards-mysterious-statue-seen-in-real-life-hints-at-future-reveal">The Game Awards’ Mysterious Statue Seen in Real Life, Hints at Future Reveal</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned before, The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley released a picture of a statue and a desert location in New Mexico. Fans on Reddit speculated everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1p9uzuu/another_teaser_for_the_game_awards_do_you_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomb Raider</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1p9vgwx/dont_believe_his_lies_dont_believe_his_lies_dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Half-Life</a>. However, user <a href="https://x.com/TotallyNOTTrio/status/1994843343575224514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TotallyNOTTrio</a> noticed they lived not far from it and took a trip to the site. There, as pictured above, we get a closer look at the statue, which is adorned with demon-like creatures and a big yellow eye with tentacles. According to the user, the staff on location were quiet about what it could actually mean.</p>



<p>Luckily, it seems fans are already hard at work conjuring what it could be. The most likely consensus is that it’s for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s Saros</a>, as the visual design and architecture look similar to the upcoming Housemarque title. Perhaps a bit of a stretch, fans are hoping it’s referring to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/julian-lefay-father-elder-scrolls-passed-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls</a>, as both series have eldritch enemies and a similar visual style. Plus, the series are no strangers to The Game Awards, so the collaboration isn’t out of left field. Its fans are going crazy on Reddit, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/1p9vswt/this_geoff_post_on_twitter_what_you_guys_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">referencing the armor as one of Kratos</a>‘ and others believing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1p9nef1/youre_thinking_about_the_teaser_wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it has a connection to Oblivion</a>.</p>



<p>Another one, Diablo 4, is another good choice, given it feels like it’s time for a new expansion, and the statue fits with something one could see in-game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1p9mf6w/geoff_keighley_dropped_this_new_expansion_or_not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fans on the subreddit</a> do think that, while it does go too far for an expansion, it could tease the Paladin class’s addition to the game. Additionally, it could very well be a new game from a big studio, given the marketing strategy. Unfortunately, it may be some time before it’s known what exactly it is, but it’s certainly one great way to market your game.</p>



<p>What do you think the statue is referring to? Saros? God of War? Elder Scrolls? Diablo? Another franchise? Leave a comment below or on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>
