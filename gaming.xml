			<p>Mafia: The Old Country developer Hangar 13 dug into plenty of behind-the-scenes details about making The Old Country during a PAX East panel. The team discussed their approach to making The Old Country, a few more details about the game's narrative, and also revealed a few core members of the cast.</p>
<p>The panel was hosted by Greg Miller from Kinda Funny Games, with Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes, game director Alex Cox, and cinematic director Tomas Hrebick representing the development team for <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/faq/">Mafia: The Old Country</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot we already know about The Old Country, some of which we learned more about during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">gameplay trailer that was revealed ahead of the panel</a>. One aspect fans were happy to hear was that The Old Country would be closer in style to the first two Mafia games in that The Old Country is a more linear experience, and not necessarily an open-world game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - &quot;Family Takes Sacrifice&quot; Developer Presentation | PAX East" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmeirFVVzCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes did however clarify this point, that while the game will have you on a golden path through the story, you're still free to roam the new setting of 1900's Sicily and explore the world that the team has meticulously created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>In terms of the gameplay, Baynes called it "<em>familiar, but better</em>," while Cox elaborated that there are elements to the gameplay and scenarios that are unique to The Old Country due to the new setting for the series, since each previous Mafia game has been set in an American city. Some of the missions and things you'll do in The Old Country however, are purposeful callbacks to activities veterans of the series will recognize that have been re-tooled to fit The Old Country.</p>
<p>Knife dueling, for example, is one of the new additions to gameplay that we get a short look at in the trailer, that will play a significant role in The Old Country's combat. That's not to say you won't be using a gun every now and then, as the trailer also showed a fair bit of gunplay that Cox and the panel likened more to the first Mafia game, than Mafia III, which was a more bombastic experience.</p>
<p>In terms of the narrative, we were introduced to three cast members who are playing three main roles in the story. Enzo Favara, the lead character in The Old Country and the person you play as in the game, is played by Riccardo Frascari. The Don of the Torrisi family, Bernado Torrisi is played by Johnny Santiago, and Torrisi's daughter, Isabella Torrisi is played by Carina Conti.</p>
<p>Speaking of characters, towards the end of the panel, Cox did confirm that there will be as many as four returning characters from previous Mafia games making an appearance in Mafia: The Old Country, though he did not reveal who it would be and how, to avoid spoiling the surprise for players.</p>
<p>One interesting bit about the studio's work to make Mafia: The Old Country as authentic as possible, relates to the cars we see Enzo drive in the game. They're some of the world's earliest vehicles, and Hangar 13 was able to find a collector in the Czech Republic who let the studio photograph, and even drive these cars and record them, to be as accurate as possible with how these old cars would have sounded.</p>
<p>Overall, it's clear that Hangar 13 put in a lot of work to make Mafia: The Old Country as detailed as possible. The game will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC this coming August 8, 2025.</p>

But a trailer everybody’s watched and a well-crafted trailer are two different things.</p><p>Despite amassing a truly astounding number of views, <em>GTA VI</em>’s second trailer didn’t land for everyone. This is not to say that the game will be bad or that Rockstar somehow dropped the ball, but rather that making a trailer, like any other mode of storytelling, is an art unto itself – one that goes far beyond the simple act of layering music atop footage.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Derek Lieu, a professional game trailer editor whose work you’ve almost certainly encountered – trailers for <em>Half-Life Alyx</em>, <em>Among Us</em>, <em>Psychonauts 2</em>, <em>Riven</em>, <em>Spelunky 2</em>, <em>Firewatch</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Viewfinder</em>, and <em>Stray Gods</em>, to name a few – believes that <em>GTA VI</em>’s second trailer doesn’t do its subject justice. The game, he told Aftermath, looks incredibly impressive, but after watching the trailer numerous times, he doesn’t find himself knowing or feeling as much as he’d like.</p><p>"[The game] looks amazing. It looks great," Lieu told Aftermath. "A trailer is designed to do this thing well, which is to incite our emotions and show a bunch of stuff from this new thing that we haven't seen before. This trailer, or a bunch of B-roll with music over it, can kind of achieve the same thing. But that doesn't make it a good trailer. Just because people get hyped, doesn't mean it's a good trailer. If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped. They would feel, they would care."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Just because people get hyped, doesn't mean it's a good trailer.</p></blockquote></figure><p>One of the trailer’s biggest issues, according to Lieu, is a general lack of narrative. This might sound odd given how much of it is made up of cutscenes, but consider what we’ve learned by the end: There are two characters who we’re obviously supposed to root for, and we know they’re having a grand old crime-filled time in Vice City, but what are the stakes? Why is any of this happening?&nbsp;</p><p>"The only thing we know about these characters is: They do crime and they're a couple,” said Lieu. “We have no idea what their motivation is. Why are they doing crime? Are they being forced to do crime? What's the reason? By the time the first part with the landlord is over, that's, like, 30 seconds into the trailer – an immense amount of time.”</p><p>Lieu drew a comparison to a more effective variation on the theme from Rockstar’s own oeuvre:&nbsp;</p><p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJIxpjXKd1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>GTA IV</em>'s third trailer</a>, where it's like ‘Niko, my cousin!’, you know [Niko] is a person who's come to the United States, you know they're an immigrant, you know their contact is in a really shitty apartment, but they have aspirations of more,” said Lieu. “You have all of that in one shot. That [moment] encompasses the whole story of <em>GTA IV</em>. There's probably something like that in <em>GTA VI</em> somewhere. At least let us know what [the characters] want, and that will make us care more and be interested in how they achieve that."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GTA IV Official Trailer #3" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJIxpjXKd1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Lieu described Rockstar’s trailer output over the years as “uneven.” This, he said, is par for the course with trailers that are produced in-house – as opposed to those created by dedicated editors or agencies like <a href="https://www.altarcreative.com/our-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altar Creative</a>, which has worked with Ubisoft on many occasions. While Lieu doesn’t know for certain if <em>GTA VI</em>’s trailer was produced in-house, he thinks it bears the hallmarks of one that was.&nbsp;</p><p>"Some places, in-house, are amazing,” he said. “<em>Destiny 2</em>, most of them are amazing. Blizzard, <em>Overwatch</em>, their stuff is amazing. Nintendo is kind of uneven, but the good stuff is really good."</p><p>In-house trailers, he said, often lean on viewers’ preexisting knowledge or excitement; they stop short of going the extra mile.</p><p>"The first <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trailers, I think, are also made in-house. They're terrible. The really good ones – they're really tightly edited and the music's done well – are edited by a place called <a href="https://www.hammercreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hammer Creative</a> in Los Angeles. Those [first trailers] are incredibly random because [Square Enix] knows it's <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. Everyone will recognize these scenes. They'll do the work for us. But <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has great music. Put some amazing music under it. Make me remember all this stuff. It's such a wasted opportunity. We could be [up] here, emotion-wise, and instead, whether people realize it or not, they could be so much more excited."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>You can give people room for speculation and reaction videos and stuff and have it be fun to watch.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Granted, <em>GTA VI</em> isn’t set to come out for another year, so perhaps Rockstar doesn’t have the necessary raw materials on hand to assemble a series of scenes that more explicitly lays out the game’s stakes. But Lieu finds that unlikely, given how video game trailers are typically made. He said that some triple-A studios will spend a month just capturing footage, meaning the process of editing together a trailer “can easily be multiple months.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm working on stuff that's for Summer Game Fest time,” he said. “A lot of these games are not super duper early, but there's still a lot of gray box stuff. So I make my draft of the trailer, and then we polish up the things that need to be done for that."</p><p>There’s also the matter of Rockstar’s infamous commitment to littering trailers with as many hints and easter eggs as possible, to inspire the kind of free marketing the aforementioned “details you missed” lists provide. But Lieu doesn’t believe those sorts of smaller flourishes need to come at the expense of a trailer’s storytelling.</p><p>"You can give people room for speculation and reaction videos and stuff and have it be fun to watch,” said Lieu. “If you look at the <em>Tears Of The Kingdom</em> trailers, it's <em>Legend Of Zelda</em>, so everyone's gonna speculate about every single frame. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The full trailer</a> is completely epic. ... There's ups and downs, there's big, pivotal moments. If you look at that trailer in terms of its emotional weight, the graph of that would be [a series of taller and taller spikes, building to a huge crescendo]. <em>GTA VI</em>'s is kinda [flat]."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Official Trailer #3" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHGShqcAHlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Music is another area where <em>GTA VI</em>’s trailer, in Lieu’s eyes, falters when compared to other major game trailers – or even Rockstar’s previous work. Again, the drama and narrative of the trailer take a backseat, in favor of a song that’s just sort of… there. The song itself, “Hot Together” by The Pointer Sisters, fits the trailer’s vibe, but it’s inelegantly deployed despite Rockstar almost certainly having the resources to give it a proper cinematic treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"So watch the trailer for [movie] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGqiHJTsRkQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Knives Out</em></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJN4hN28kg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>It Takes Two</em>'s 'Better Together' trailer</a>. Those both use licensed music, but they trailer-ized the music, which Rockstar has the money to do. Not all licensed music can just be put into a sequence and made into a trailer. If you look at<em> Knives Out</em>, that one, especially, is really customized. If you listen to the music during different parts of that trailer, you could really feel like 'Oh, this is the beginning, this is the middle, and this is the end.' But for [<em>GTA VI</em>], the energy just feels flat."</p><p>As Lieu sees it, all of these issues compound to make the trailer feel disconnected – like a series of unrelated moments rather than a cohesive work. For example, the first chunk of the trailer lingers on a day in the life of Jason Duval, a comically jacked Florida man who makes up one half of the game’s core power couple. But it doesn’t initially read like it’s trying to convey several related events from his perspective.</p><p>"That whole opening minute, I didn't even realize that the first scene where the landlord is saying, 'Go get me my money' connected with a shot of [Jason] slapping the guy and opening the register, which is, like, two shots later,” said Lieu. “It's so quick, too. It doesn't feel like 'This is a day in my life. This happens and this happens.’"</p><figure><blockquote><p>Not all licensed music can just be put into a sequence and made into a trailer.</p></blockquote></figure><p>These are, as far as Lieu sees it, fixable issues. They just require a little more signposting.</p><p>"The part where it's showing the two of them doing crime versus them having beers, there's space in there for really simple contrasts. They could be like 'To new beginnings' cut to [gunfire sounds] 'Hands on the floor!' to ask 'Oh, is this actually a new beginning?' To have that dramatic irony there. There' so many things you could do in there, but it just feels very disconnected. It's kind of forcing us to do the work in a not-interesting way."</p><p>This is not to say that trailers have to hand you everything upfront; some of the best trailers lure you in with a plethora of unanswered questions. They give you the basic premise followed by flashes of scenes that function almost as puzzle pieces. Lieu pointed to A24 movie trailers as an example.</p><p>"A24 movie trailers are really good at this, where you have an idea, and they show a lot of the movie after that. If you watch the trailer for<em> Under The Silver Lake</em>, the premise is that [Andrew Garfield’s character’s] girlfriend disappears, and there's a whole lot of stuff after that setup. All of it seems interesting, but none of it actually helps me understand what happens plot-wise, but it's interesting. It does a good job of [conveying] this context of this problem that needs to be solved and then 'These are things that we go through in order to do that.' But we don’t know how it turns out. We don’t even know which parts of the movie [we’re seeing].”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Under the Silver Lake Official Trailer #1 (2018) Andrew Garfield Thriller Movie HD" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkAztth9PpY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Given that we’re talking about Rockstar, one of the most notoriously secretive studios in the business, we can only speculate about the exact intentions underlying this trailer. But we can speak to the end result and the circumstances surrounding it. Last week, Rockstar announced that it was <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-v-was-released-on-september-17-2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying <em>GTA VI</em></a> from 2025 to May of 2026. To those who’ve been waiting for over a decade to finally go on their latest, greatest, balmiest crime vacation, this might suggest trouble in paradise. Rockstar, then, needed to assuage concerns and keep the hype train moving full speed ahead. </p><p>And so, while you might be tempted to view a <em>GTA VI</em> trailer as an easy layup – after all, this game is going to sell more units than there are grains of sand on its meticulously rendered beaches – it does serve an important purpose. Every trailer, even for games whose success seems like a foregone conclusion, does.</p><p>"As big as <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is,” Lieu said, “it's still important to control the news and keep things top of mind. It's just at a different scale."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/marvel-rivals-healer-strike"><h3>Healers In Marvel Rivals Went On Strike</h3></a><p>Thank your support players once in a while, folks</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
If you've been hankering for a lizard-scented blast of nostalgia, you're in luck; Crystal Dynamics' cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels are being bundled up for a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 16th June.
</p>
<p>
The Gex Trilogy, you might recall, was announced earlier this year, and gathers together the series' original 1995 outing - 2D PS1 platformer Gex - alongside its two 3D sequels, Gex: Enter the Gecko and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, which launched in 1998 and 1999 respectively.
</p>
<p>
Limited Run Games, which is publishing the collection, isn't quite going as far as describing the bundle as a remaster, but it <em>is</em> promising "extras and numerous improvements". There's talk of native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action. That's in addition to artwork and archival material including classic adverts, a music player, and a new interview with the voice of Gex (in the US at least), Dana Gould.

<p>
The Gex Trilogy will initially be available as a digital release when it comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183970/GEX_Trilogy/">Steam</a> on 16th June. However, Limited Run is also planning to give the bundle a physical release later this year, and those wanting to hold Gex's heft in their hands have a couple of options. There's a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-standard-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$39.99 USD Standard Edition</a>, which contains either a disc or a cartridge depending on your platform of choice (the PC version contains a Steam key), plus a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-classic-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$74.99 Classic Edition</a> that also includes a Steelbook, reversible poster, soundtrack selection CD, and a "retro box" resembling a PS1 game.
</p>
<p>
If you really want to go all-out in a fury of nostalgia, however, there's also a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-tail-time-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$199.99 Tail Time Edition</a>, which is available to pre-order from 9th May to 6th July. This includes everything in the Classic Edition (and upgrades the CD to a full soundtrack), then throws in a 7-inch Gex statue, trading cards, a Remote Pin, and a special box featuring artwork from Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano. Oh, and there's a 36-inch inflatable Gex to do with as you please.
</p>

Crystal Dynamics has, of course, long waved goodbye to Gex, having released the likes of its Legacy of Kain series, Marvel's Avengers, and numerous Tomb Raider titles in the years since. Currently, the studio - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">announced layoffs earlier this year</a> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">assisting Microsoft with its troubled Perfect Dark reboot</a>, and continuing work on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">untitled Tomb Raider game in partnership with Amazon</a>. This latter title was presumably planned to launch alongside Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series, but recent reports have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-reportedly-dead">suggested the Phoebe Waller-Bridge penned show has been scrapped</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is, very obviously, a game where you roleplay as space fascists. Like, the game explicitly treats you as fodder for a war against various supposedly evil species all in the name of colonising other planets. It's not subtle! But it's also silly as hell, so the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> more or less gets away with it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a> just announced a new warbond though, and I'll be honest: the new outfits are probably the most fascist looking yet.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, the helmet of the RE-1861 Parade Commander outfit looks mightily similar to a Pickelhaube, those old German soldier helmets with the solo spike on top you've probably seen in war movies your parents always seem to have on. The RE-2310 Honorary Guard's cap looks like a cap a Nazi general might wear too, not to mention the rest of the outfit. Major fascist vibes! Borderline uncomfortable if I'm being real with you, but I'll trust Arrowhead on this one.

<p>
In terms of weapons, the thing you'll probably find most exciting is the CQC-2 Sabre, which is literally just a straight up sword. Nothing fancier than that! Quite simply a sword you can attempt to slice through some Terminids. There's also a new bayonet marksman rifle, the R-2 Amendment if you prefer your blades with a little bit of gun attached to them. You'll find a new throwable too, the G-142 Pyrotech, which spins rapidly while spitting out fire.
</p>
<p>
My favourite of all the additions though is the new stratagem, the One True Flag, which is literally just a Super Earth flagpole that you can use to stab enemies with. It's ridiculous, presumably useless, and I hope it is the only thing people use from now on.
</p>
<p>
This new warbond drops next week, May 15th, so you've not got long to wait until you get to dress up as a super fascist, if you're into that for some messed up reason.

In worker placement tabletop games, they literally can be. In this form of gameplay, you take your team through different tasks of adventures as you build toward end goals. There are many different worlds you can choose to embark on, or themes to try, depending on the game you choose. This list has some of my latest favorites, including both newer and older worker placement games.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Featured in this article"><strong>TLDR: The Best Board Worker Placement Games to Play Now</strong></h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't need no stinkin' blurbs, you can see all the games in this article in the handy side-scrolling catalog above.

The game is about building a vineyard, harvesting grapes, bottling nectar, and selling vino. To do so you’ll have to use your workers wisely during the available time in the season. Players play across multiple years, building their wineries and ageing wine to fulfil orders. Gather your friends and raise a glass to Viticulture, which is playable competitively in its original iteration or as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a> in the Viticulture World edition (<a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RNLM?object_uuid=ba4899ce-31d7-4008-9ed2-a48d30df13a2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see at Amazon</a>).</p></div><p id="yokohama"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Yokohama">Yokohama</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218899"><div id="218899" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Yokohama</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yokohama is a board game about doing business in the titular real-life port city near Tokoyo in Japan. In it, players have a team of workers to help them build their business. Enlist a staff to help you strategically gain resources, build technologies, and complete orders to build your trading empire toward optimal success. The game is moderately complicated, but turns go by rather smoothly once you get the hang of it. It can be played with two to four players but <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/196340/yokohama" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Geek</a> says it’s best with three.</p></div><p id="unconscious-mind"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Unconscious Mind">Unconscious Mind</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218900"><div id="218900" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unconscious Mind</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unconscious Mind is a heavy Euro game about psychology and grief. It is also hands down one of the most gorgeous games I own. Gameplay is complex, providing options for layered strategies in movement and timing to best execute moves. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wX6EA?object_uuid=ba4899ce-31d7-4008-9ed2-a48d30df13a2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DWV7PGWK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Nightmares expansion</u></a> also further adds potential complexities to help make the game more challenging or, with some pieces like the fireworks and the gramophone lighter for folks who may want a softer experience. A heads up, however: this game takes a while to get going. You'll need time for setup, time to teach it to your fellow player, and time for the gameplay itself. It’s far more time than the box says, so be prepared for a longer haul time of gaming when you sit down with this.</p></div><p id="wayfarers-of-the-south-tigris"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Wayfarers of The South Tigris">Wayfarers of The South Tigris</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218901"><div id="218901" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wayfarers of The South Tigris</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wayfarers is a complex but satisfying combination of dice and worker placement game that surprised me with how fun it was it was. The worker placement is connected to dice rolls, giving a bit of a chance to combine actions with workers and decisions, which, when they click, can be rewarding. The game has a lot of decision space to determine your moves. It can seem intimidating at first glance, especially if you're not versed in heavier Euro games. I was first intimidated by this game, and then pleasantly surprised when I finally sat down to play a three-player game of it. While resources are tight, with multiple decisions being key, it provides a lot of replayability. Don’t pass on this game – you’ll miss out on a lot of fun if you do. </p></div><p id="darwins-journey"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Darwin’s Journey">Darwin’s Journey</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218902"><div id="218902" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Darwin’s Journey</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve always wanted to be a scientific explorer like Darwin, you’ll enjoy playing Darwin’s Journey. In it, you race fellow explorers and the legendary Darwin himself across three islands by boat and by land to discover nature and science to put in a museum. This game is easy to navigate and highly repeatable. It’s lovely on the table but also <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=darwinsjourney" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>accessible online</u></a>. It’s worth getting a physical copy of it, though, as it seems to be a big hit with a variety of both seasoned and more casual players.</p></div><p id="fromage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fromage">Fromage</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218903"><div id="218903" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fromage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hungry for a new game that's perfect to share with friends or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-couples">dates</a> (including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> ones), this is a good one, as it literally has food in the title.

A heads up before you grab a bottle of vino and your cheeseboard to open your shop: this is not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">beginner-friendly board game</a>.

As a colorful goth, I found the art in this one extraordinary. Septima is an accessible and user-friendly game that's focused on a theme I enjoy intensely: witches. The game works by building covens, collecting herbs, brewing potions, and, of course, surviving witch hunters and witch trials. I loved it despite the trials and pains of losing allied witches to an angry mob. I highly recommend finding your own coven and playing it yourself. You can also play this one solo if you’d like. Bonus round: there's also an <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gOnEq?object_uuid=ba4899ce-31d7-4008-9ed2-a48d30df13a2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">expansion</a> that includes shapeshifting with animals, adding even more gorgeously designed artwork.</p></div><p id="rock-hard-1977"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rock Hard: 1977">Rock Hard: 1977</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218906"><div id="218906" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Rock Hard: 1977</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rock Hard 1977 is a worker placement game about unleashing your inner rockstar.

The player board is shaped like an amp, paired with your favorite head icon. It was one of Gen Con’s fan favorites. User warning, however: this game has several heavy themes and is not advisable for folks who are not prepared to encounter some very sad content that, while it does happen in the rock star life, is not always groovy to come across if you’re unprepared for it.</p></div><p id="age-of-comics-the-golden-years"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Age of Comics: The Golden Years">Age of Comics: The Golden Years</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218907"><div id="218907" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Age of Comics: The Golden Years</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Chances are that if you are here on IGN, you are like me and love <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/comics"><u>comics</u></a>. Age of Comics: The Golden Years gives you a chance to build a catalogue of comics during the Golden Age. Hire artists, writers, and inkers to help design your book. Race other players on their own publishing journeys to create ideas and publish comics to sell and reach fandom. While the art is full of pulpy goodness, you don’t have to be a comic book fan to enjoy the game. Heck, you don’t even have to have your own original ideas to produce books in the game, either. They sometimes say that you have to fake it until you can make it. In Age of Comics, you can do both if you want to. This one is playable for up to four players but is best with three. Like Septima and some others on the list, you can play it solo if you desire to pull it off the shelf alone. It’s also one of the easiest games on this list to learn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Maelle’s weapon of choice is a fencing rapier; and you best believe she knows how to use it. Actually, so should you, since nearly all of her additional moves are, basically, fencing strategies disguised as stat changes. With only a couple of late game exceptions, and a couple of stray Fire abilities we’ll get into, <strong>the vast majority of her obtainable skills are about doing either heavy Physical damage, or applying some diabolical shit to enemies in order to do heavy Physical damage</strong>. Even if she’s not the one to do the damage, she’s got the skills to set someone else up for success. </p><p>“Oh ho ho ho,” you might say, “but those are all 1-3 hits and Fire skills. She still has her work cut out dealing with shields.” Au fucking contraire, mon ami, <strong>she’s got a skill called Breaking Rules that’s not even terribly far into her skill tree that literally nullifies shields, no matter how many the enemy’s got slapped on</strong>. You know that one Nevron with the floating orbs, and shooting one puts six shields on everybody else on the field? Light work. The game should literally come up with a prompt that asks “Are you sure you want to make the biggest mistake of your stupid life” if you ever try to remove Maelle from your party? </p><h2 id="h311259"><a id="stance"></a>Special mechanic: Stance</h2><figure id="" data-id="228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-recommend-id="image://228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle prepares to strike her enemies in Virtuose stance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maelle prepares to strike her enemies in Virtuose stance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-recommend-id="image://228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle prepares to strike her enemies in Virtuose stance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But of course, there’s the real reason you’re here, which is to figure out how to effectively use the Stance system. And the key word is “effectively,” because it’s extremely easy to get caught out there in Offense Mode, wondering why Maelle just got merked by a leaf hitting her face in a stiff breeze. </p><div><p>To be fair, the game explains her mechanic way too quick, so let’s go over bascis again.. <strong>Every one of Maelle’s abilities puts her into one of four Stances each with their own perks/drawbacks</strong>:</p></div><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Stanceless</strong>: Where you start in every battle. No effects. </li><li><strong>Defensive Stance</strong>: Take less damage; gain 1 extra AP on every successful dodge or parry.</li><li><strong>Offensive Stance</strong>: Deal 50% more damage, but also take 50% more damage.</li><li><strong>Virtuose Stance</strong>: Deal 200% damage.</li></ul><div><p>Now, while Maelle’s skill set can absolutely slay a field of enemies, you still have to think of her in fencing terms. Overextension can get you stabbed, while being a turtle on constant defense doesn’t get things done. Meanwhile, <strong>the game actually incentivizes you to keep moving by giving you an additional AP every time you change stances</strong>. So, figuring out what to put on her to give you the least vulnerability while still being as effective as she needs to be is the trick of it, but there’s a lot of flexibility therein. </p><p>The dream, of course, is to get in Virtuose Mode, where Maelle is become death, destroyer of worlds. But even then, you only get two turns to do the most damage with that, and your team may have other needs, like with one of her skills that grants Shell, or if, say, they’re all dead, and you need to use Phoenix Flame to rez them all. </p></div><h2 id="h311260"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds/synergy</h2><p>For much of the game, the only elemental damage Maelle will have access to is all Fire-based. You get Void damage way down the line. You’ll figure out how that plays out on your own by then. And even then, Fire is going to be enough, especially since <strong>the easiest way to get Maelle into Virtuose Mode most of the time is Burning an enemy and hitting them with Swift Stride</strong>. Yes, that means go get that off your Skill Board ASAP; it’s gonna be a mainstay through much of the first half of the game. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>So, naturally, giving Maelle or her companions Fire abilities to back her up and take advantage of the constant Burn is gonna be an imperative. But, even if you decide otherwise, Maelle’s got plenty of her own. She’ll start with Spark which will get the job done, just know that you’ll have to blow a turn to cast it and it’s already gonna cost you another one to cast Swift Stride. Screw that, let somebody else get that ball rolling, least till you pick up the far more devastating Rain of Fire skill for her later. Both are effective, though worth noting that while <strong>Spark will put Maelle in Defensive Mode, Rain of Fire ends with her in Offensive</strong>. Be prepared for whatever’s coming next. </p><p>Once she’s Virtuosed out, though, you’ll need to capitalize as best you can, and in the early going, the Critical Burn Picto/Lumina (Critical Hit chance goes up 25% on Burning enemies) is a pretty easy place to start. It’d be nice if one of your companions can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">slap a Mark</a></span> or Defenseless on your prey, but the irony there is that if the enemy is Burning already, that first hit will remove the status. <strong>Be mindful of the play order on the left of the battle screen so you can line that up just right and have Maelle go right after an enemy’s been afflicted</strong>. </p><p>Percee and Fleuret Fury are usually a death sentence for enemies after that, and since she’s likely gonna be the last thing a lot of lesser enemies see, Maelle can get a lot of use out of the Dead Energy Picto (3 AP after killing an enemy). But in the event those two skills don’t put a Nevron out of its misery, Fleuret Fury will at least re-up on Virtuose. The main issue here is that Fleuret Fury’s expensive. Keeping Maelle topped off on AP is crucial but, especially for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">a character like Lune</a></span> who’s less useful in a fight where the elements aren’t as effective, it’s worthwhile having someone whose primary job it is to keep Maelle juiced up if her Pictos haven’t gotten to kick in.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>Once she’s tapped out, though, your new job is making sure Maelle can build up to a full bar of AP again.

A Picto like Energising Pain (1 AP after taking damage) can help, but this is the exact situation Defensive Mode is good for, making sure she can take a hit and likely survive longer than her friends.</p><p>Nail these principles and our little fencer will be an absolute menace against anything that threatens the Expedition.</p><hr><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While Explosive Spear proves powerful and is a valuable skill to invest a gem in, that’s for later. Right now, let’s prioritize a movement ability that does damage and allows you to put some distance between you and your formidable foes.</p><p>Disengage, once activated, allows you to leap backward while rupturing the ground in front of you, sending spikes of dirt and stone toward your enemies. It’s an excellent AOE (area-of-effect) ability that grants invulnerability for a short period, too.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tier</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: 6 Mana</li><li><strong>Cooldown</strong>: 1.50S</li><li><strong>Attack Damage</strong>: 93%</li><li><strong>Requires</strong>: Level 3, 9 Dexterity, Spear</li></ul><h2 id="h325246"><a id="lightning"></a>Lightning Spear</h2><figure id="" data-id="2a065dc246d3f3380c0094275a4cf552" data-recommend-id="image://2a065dc246d3f3380c0094275a4cf552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier two Lighting Spear skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The tier two Lighting Spear skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a065dc246d3f3380c0094275a4cf552" data-recommend-id="image://2a065dc246d3f3380c0094275a4cf552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier two Lighting Spear skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With Disengage tackling mobility, it’s time to invest in a hard-hitting projectile attack ability that, honestly, is currently one of my favorite skills in the game. <strong>Lightning Spear hits like an eighteen-wheeler</strong>, sending out a spear imbued with lightning damage that slams into single and group targets, electrocuting an area around where the ability lands.</p><p>It’s an excellent follow-up attack after popping Disengage. Remove yourself from a fight, tap Lightning Spear, and watch as electrical currents charge through the mob ahead of you. It’s also a useful skill when you want to kickstart a fight!</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tier</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: 10 Mana</li><li><strong>Attack Speed</strong>: 50% of Base</li><li><strong>Attack Damage</strong>: 127%</li><li><strong>Requires</strong>: Level 6, 16 Dexterity, Spear</li></ul><h2 id="h325247"><a id="barrage"></a>Barrage</h2><figure id="" data-id="b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-recommend-id="image://b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier three Barrage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The tier three Barrage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-recommend-id="image://b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier three Barrage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>For your third major skill, the tier five ability, I’d opt for Barrage</strong>. While Rapid Assault hits fast and hard, and Storm Lance continues the theme of electrical damage-dealing attacks, Barrage allows you to tackle groups relatively easily. Like with Lightning Spear, albeit less situational, you can pop Barrage first to start a fight, dealing damage across a wide area and softening all targets, or use it after Disengage to finish a fight.</p><p>The downside to an area-of-effect (AOE) ability is dealing with a boss fight, which is generally a one-on-one showdown. While still effective if it lands right, an AOE isn’t as powerful against a single target.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tier</strong>: 5</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: 16 Mana</li><li><strong>Cooldown</strong>: 2.00S</li><li><strong>Cast Time</strong>: 0.70S</li><li><strong>Requires</strong>: Level 14, 34 Dexterity, Spear/Bow</li></ul><hr><p><em>Path of Exile 2</em> Dawn of the Hunt is available now, with a brand-new class, five new Ascendancy classes, unique items and support gems, and additional endgame content to explore!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

the old country--that is, Sicily. Players take on the role of Enzo Favara, a mobster whose life began in forced labor in his childhood. Now, 2K says he's "ready to risk everything to become a man of honor in the Torrisi crime family."</p><p dir="ltr">The game will play like a "classic mob movie," 2K says, and this means players will encounter the criminal underworld and everything that entails. Players can expect to face off against "cutthroat enemies" as they live the life of a mobster battling in turf wars.</p><p>"Enzo's story unfolds in a time when skill with a stiletto blade was a deadly asset, a lupara sawed-off shotgun was a go-to firearm, murderous vendettas raged for decades, and mafiosi patrolled their protection rackets on foot, horseback, or behind the wheel of turn-of-the-century motorcars," 2K said.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_open_world"><strong>Not open world</strong></h2><p>Unlike previous entries in the series, Mafia: The Old Country is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">liner, narrative-driven game as opposed to an open-world title.</a> 2K has said it believes there is a "large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments."</p><p>2K is releasing The Old Country as a linear game, and priced at $50 instead of $70 or more, against the backdrop of the proliferation of games with ballooning budgets, higher price points, and bigger asks from players to spend more time in their worlds.</p><p>So far, players have responded positively to the news of The Old Country's lower price point and trimmed-down scale, but it's too soon to say if this will pay off both in terms of the game's critical reception or sales.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Mafia__The_Old_Country_game_engine"><strong>Mafia: The Old Country game engine</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Mafia: The Old Country is developed using Epic's Unreal Engine 5, as well as Epic's AI-powered MetaHuman technology for its character models. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVhXaoX25AE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this developer video</a>, the developers talk about using Epic's game engine to hone in on "tiny details" to make The Old Country look alive. The use of MetaHuman allows characters to have "micro-expressions" and lifelike details, developers said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4490812-screenshot2025-05-08at1.56.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4490812" data-ratio="0.50695088044486" data-width="2158" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4490812-screenshot2025-05-08at1.56.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4490812"></a><figcaption>A scene from Mafia: The Old Country</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4490812-screenshot2025-05-08at1.56.44pm.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Who_s_developing_Mafia__The_Old_Country_"><strong>Who's developing Mafia: The Old Country?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Mafia: The Old Country is developed by Hangar 13, the same team that made 2016's Mafia III, as well as 2020's Mafia: Definitive Edition. The studio also made 2024's TopSpin 2K25--very much not a mobster game. The Mafia franchise was created by Illusion Softworks, which rebranded to 2K Czech when 2K bought the studio in 2008 and put the team on Mafia II. 2K Czech later merged with Hangar 13.</p><p dir="ltr">Mafia's creator, Daniel Vavra, now heads up Kingdom Come studio Warhorse.</p>

It’s a non-franchise IP from a less-known studio, but backed by Square Enix and led by some of the biggest legends from <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s classic era. So if that caught your eye over <em>SaGa</em> or <em>Shiren the Wanderer</em>, it’s understandable. But don’t sleep on <em>SaGa</em>, you’re missing out.</p><p>Anyway, <em>Fantasian</em> is a distinct kind of RPG and it may feel like there isn’t much out there like it at first. I’ve made some connections to a list of games, some way less obscure than others, that can be reasonably compared to <em>Fantasian</em> for one reason or another. Check them out, if you haven’t yet! Especially the one with “<em>SaGa</em>” in the title.</p><p><strong>Editor’s note</strong>: Hi! I’ve also added a wonderful turn-based RPG from 2025 that is absolutely worth your attention if you dug <em>Fantasian</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4f15f3c95ba7c2d0b5bac00296cae66e" data-recommend-id="image://4f15f3c95ba7c2d0b5bac00296cae66e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Blue Dragon and the titular dragon behind him both give a thumbs up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Blue Dragon and the titular dragon behind him both give a thumbs up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4f15f3c95ba7c2d0b5bac00296cae66e" data-recommend-id="image://4f15f3c95ba7c2d0b5bac00296cae66e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Blue Dragon and the titular dragon behind him both give a thumbs up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> There’s no better place to start than the same studio’s other work. <em>Blue Dragon</em> is an old school-style RPG with a few twists, while <em>Lost Odyssey</em> is more of an ambitious, contemporary <em>Final Fantasy</em>-like experience that effectively leans into visual novels. Mistwalker reuses that technique in Fantasian, but for <em>Odyssey</em> it hired a career novelist for those moments and it <em>shows</em>.  </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b0ea59cefcc1be05d19e615988da7cf9" data-recommend-id="image://b0ea59cefcc1be05d19e615988da7cf9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character wields guns in a combat scenario." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character wields guns in a combat scenario." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Tri-Ace</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0ea59cefcc1be05d19e615988da7cf9" data-recommend-id="image://b0ea59cefcc1be05d19e615988da7cf9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character wields guns in a combat scenario." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Much like <em>Fantasian</em>’s creative combat system that combines puzzle-like solutions and positioning attack trajectory, <em>Resonance of Fate</em> is best known for thinking outside the box when it comes to battles. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzrONfwallY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzrONfwallY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEGA itself once described it</a></span> as a mix between “<em>Valkyria Chronicles</em> and a John Woo movie,” so you know Tri-Ace was cooking at the time.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d33fc8c92e6169436117836cf146bb31" data-recommend-id="image://d33fc8c92e6169436117836cf146bb31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two characters stand in a post office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two characters stand in a post office." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Slow Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d33fc8c92e6169436117836cf146bb31" data-recommend-id="image://d33fc8c92e6169436117836cf146bb31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two characters stand in a post office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’re tackling the comparison from a different angle here. <em>Harold Halibut</em> is a strange (and sweet) indie adventure game that couldn’t have less in common with <em>Fantasian</em>. But there’s one exception: The visuals are strikingly similar in that <em>Halibut</em>’s world is entirely hand-made, every asset a high-resolution scan of a painstakingly-crafted physical object. It’s a great pairing with <em>Fantasian</em>’s hand-made diorama backgrounds. More like this please, video games!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="72bb6f0bfd8697791b40e8c735d065c6" data-recommend-id="image://72bb6f0bfd8697791b40e8c735d065c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pixel art landscape shows the silhouette of a cast of heroes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pixel art landscape shows the silhouette of a cast of heroes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="72bb6f0bfd8697791b40e8c735d065c6" data-recommend-id="image://72bb6f0bfd8697791b40e8c735d065c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pixel art landscape shows the silhouette of a cast of heroes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Obligatory. We’re talking about Hironobu “Father of <em>Final Fantasy</em>” Sakaguchi here. But the first <em>Final Fantasy</em> specifically shares some ideas with <em>Fantasian</em>’s fantasy/sci-fi genre blend. It gets weirdly washed out in the remakes, but later parts of the original NES version gradually remove the bright, organic colors in exchange for darker, dirtier tiles meant to convey metal, rust, and an unspoken explanation for why you start fighting robots. It’s fine if you just take my word for it and stick with the <em>Pixel Remaster</em> instead, though.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-recommend-id="image://d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cast of characters stand in a royal hall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cast of characters stand in a royal hall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-recommend-id="image://d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cast of characters stand in a royal hall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sometimes you don’t have to leave Square Enix territory if you like <em>Final Fantasy</em> but want something new and different. <em>SaGa</em> is a series often flying way under the radar, but those who know it swear by its unusual style, unique systems, and disinterest in player comfort.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
After a year of faintly enigmatic developer blogs, Paradox has finally unveiled its sort-of-but-not-exactly-mysterious Project Caesar, confirming it to be (just as everyone had expected) Europa Universalis 5 - a "new era for grand strategy".
</p>
<p>
Paradox says Europa Universalis 5 has been in developed for the last five years at Paradox Tinto, a Barcelona-based studio assmembled from 'modders, super fans, and the best developers around the world'. The has been to create "the grandest strategy game" ever, and the result is a "very ambitious" Europa Universalis where players can "do pretty much everything".
</p>
<p>
This time around, players can experience history across a span of five hundred years, formulating their nation's strategy of sustainment and expansion from 1337 to 1837, progressing through the Renaissance era, the age of Enlightenment, and beyond. Key to all this is a "living world" built around "pops". Similar to those seen in other Paradox grand strategy games, these population groups are bound by the likes of a shared culture or religion (300 religions are said to be represented in EU5), and can range from a single person to millions.

<figcaption>And here's the announcment trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKaGSIm9juI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Pops are the primary driving force of a nation's econony, working in buildings such as farms and factories to produce goods feeding into all other aspects of EU5. You'll produce food to sustain the population or keep armies moving, for instance, or goods to trade at markets as required. Pops are also split into social classes - from peasants to the clergy and nobility - and further grouped into estates, each with their own thoughts and agendas. And you'll need to keep these groups happy - perhaps granting them special privileges - to pass crucial policies in parliament.
</p>
<p>
How you spend your time is ultimately up to you - you might opt for growth through trade, diplomacy, or military might - but your strategies will eventually guide you through six ages (traditions, renaissance, discovery, information, absolutism, and revolution) and "thousands of historical events". Each age brings different institutions representing the core ideas of their eras and unlocking new technology trees. So players embracing the Quest for the New World institution will, for instance, find it easier to colonise lands during the age of discovery.
</p>
<p>
All this plays out across a "new and larger" world described as the "most accurate and granular map [Paradox has] ever made for a grand strategy game". The means a greater number of nations and "more varied topographical features" - all promising to make for a radically different experience depending on a nation's set-up, neighbours, and even terrain. Geographical features can dramatically impact battle, for instance, with rivers, mountains, and straits all potentially influencing the outcome of war - just be sure not to leave your production houses empty of workers as you swell your ranks on the battlefield.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more granular detail to be found in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZcN-eVta8">Europa Universalis 5's 30-minute long announcement video</a>, but one thing Paradox isn't quite ready to talk about yet is a release date. Currently all it's saying is it's "coming soon".

That could mean a hike of up to  $428 on the most expensive machines like a PS5 Pro. “American consumers would pay $12 billion more for video game consoles,” the report claims. “As a result, U.S. consumers reduce overall [game console] purchases by 73 percent.”</p><p>That worst-case scenario <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">would come close to crippling console gaming</a></span> in its largest market in the world. Fewer consoles sales mean fewer new games being bought, with knock-on effects that quickly filter out to the rest of the ecosystem, especially as each dollar spent on tariffs takes away from money that might have otherwise been spent on a new indie release or battle pass. Trump’s original rollout of the reciprocal tariffs was enough to get Nintendo to halt pre-orders for the Switch 2.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mafia: The Old Country - “Whatever it Takes” Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments," 2K President David Ismailer said in a press release. "We're excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis."</p><p>This is a notable development considering many games and publishers have leaned into bigger open-world designs that require significant time investments to play and enjoy. These might be referred to as "lifestyle" games. Players have so far generally responded positively to the news that Mafia: The Old Country is taking a different approach, but of course, it's still early days.</p><p>The $60 Deluxe edition includes a range of bonus items, including special guns, outfits, and accessories, along with the game's score and a digital artbook. Everyone who preorders The Old Country gets the Soldato Pack, which includes various cosmetics.</p><p>The Old Country takes place in 1900s Sicily, with players taking on the role of mobster Enzo Favara. 2K says the game will play out like a "classic mob movie," featuring a "cast of unpredictable allies and cutthroat enemies." In terms of combat, players will shoot and stab people with knives and shotguns, while players can traverse the Sicilian countryside on horseback or in cars.</p><p>The Old Country launches on August 8 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It'll be followed by another big 2K game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, in September.</p>

What do people that play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> call themselves, frostpunks? Feels too obvious, but I'm going to do it anyway. Breaking news frostpunks! There's a new big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> update that's just arrived in the game, adding some pretty big additions and changes,so let's jump into them. First up, The Pit! No, it's not just some hole to chuck things in, it's a large new map with a "distinctive 'proto-crater' pit counted as mountain terrain," to be found within.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The heating system has seen a big overhaul too. Described as the "biggest systemic change since launch", this one localises heat management to individual districts. Each district can apparently have "unique" effects, as well as consequences if you're failing to keep places warm. There's a new heatmap view too so you can see how each district is doing temperature.

<p>
Serenity mode from the first game is back with this update, a good one for frostpunks that don't like stress. There's gentler weather, way more resources, shorter whiteouts, and the fervour system is completely gone, meaning no conflict between factions and very few protests.
</p>
<p>
You'll find new challenges in-game too, all of which apparently introduce a "unique quest and storyline. Multiple Tales can be combined in a single playthrough. Complete a Tale to unlock a unique Monument Hub to “decorate” your city, but be careful: failure results in game over!"
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game has received a few other tweaks to smooth things over as well, like a rebalanced prologue, improved tutorials, city visuals showing a denser population, alongside other changes. Modding tools are out of beta now, adding in features like a search bar, improved loading times, and tutorials.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> go into a lot more detail about the minutiae changes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498320947205373969?l=english">Steam post</a>, if you're looking for all the nitty gritty bits. There they also promised that alongside future DLC, they are "committed" to releasing more free big updates for Frostpunk 2, all while they work on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-isnt-a-threequel-or-a-spin-off-but-a-remake-of-the-original">recently announced Frostpunk 1886</a>.

                <p>Paradox Interactive has finally confirmed that its Tinto studio's Project Caesar, which it had been teasing through a series of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/tinto-talks.1171/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dev diary posts</a> on its forum, is Europa Universalis V. As the first new entry in this series in nearly 12 years and one releasing in a very different landscape for strategy games, questions arise about what will, or should, change. Paradox's answer is to simply rework and tweak a formula that has proven to work well, rather than changing everything to court new players.</p><p>I attended a digital preview event for Europa Universalis V and went hands-on with an early build of the real-time strategy game ahead of the announcement. I found that its biggest changes didn't address approachability--which you might think would be the primary focus to attract newcomers to the franchise--but instead added strategic depth. Europa Universalis V feels distinct from what came before, but it doesn't lose any of the series' identity and focus on complexity. This might be the most hardcore grand strategy game in Paradox's catalog.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKaGSIm9juI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MKaGSIm9juI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All of the government, military, and economic strategy systems that the series is known for return in this latest entry, working in tandem to create a complex political climate that grows from the in-game starting point of 1337. Players take control of any nation they want from around the world and micromanage nearly every aspect of it. Grand strategy games are overwhelming in the amount of information and strategic options they present players, but become outstanding sandboxes for emergent storytelling once you know where to look and what to do--Europa Universalis V is no different.</p><p>Declaring war on a small neighboring country as Naples, only to get massive swaths of my territory annexed by France's army because I didn't notice the country I was attacking was their ally, was a frustrating moment. But it’s also one I won’t soon forget because it reminded me to pay closer attention to every little political detail Europa Universalis V offers and informed the rest of my play time as Naples. It was the kind of strategic mistake I won’t soon forget, as its fallout informed a non-negligible part of my country’s history.</p><p>The biggest hurdle Paradox will encounter with Europa Universalis V is encouraging players to upgrade to it. Every time Paradox releases a new game in one of its grand strategy series, it's asking players to move away from games they've spent potentially thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars on.</p><p>Ultimately, Paradox believes that the appeal of an upgrade to Europa Universalis V comes from the new gameplay changes. When asked why players should upgrade, game director Johan Andersson said he believes Europa Universalis V has "more mechanics" and "more content" than its predecessor, making the upgrade worthwhile. That answer once again stresses that mechanical depth is this strategy game's biggest draw.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489856" data-ratio="0.5619295958279" data-width="3835" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489856"></a><figcaption>This screenshot from the start of The Age of Discovery shows just how much information Europa Universalis V makes players account for.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg"></figure><p>Some of these gameplay evolutions are influenced by other Paradox grand strategy games, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/victoria-3/" data-ref-id="5000-532092">Victoria 3</a>. For example, the population of Europa Universalis V's provinces is now split into population units, each of which can have different cultural, religious, and economic demands and preferences. Keeping everyone as happy as possible is key to keeping a nation stable, but that's easier said than done. There are also now more minutiae in the goods each province can produce, so players have to be more aware of whether they have a surplus of goods or if they have enough proper trade routes.</p><p>Europa Universalis V also goes back to the series' roots in different ways. First, it removes mana as a mechanic, which restricted when and how players could perform actions. Secondly, it brings back the policy sliders from the first three games in the series, providing a clearer indication of where one's nation stands in relation to different political values. All of these new systems and returning gameplay features give Europa Universalis V a clear identity of its own, if you know where to look.</p><p>And that identity is as a hardcore strategy game. Andersson outright called it "the most grand game we've ever made." Those hardcore fans are the ones most likely to appreciate all of the tweaks Paradox has made to the core of the Europa Universalis formula. But if you're someone who was hoping the next Europa Universalis would strip back complexity to make it more approachable, that's certainly not the case.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489857" data-ratio="0.5619295958279" data-width="3835" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489857"></a><figcaption>A clearer look at the world map in Europa Universalis V. Keep in mind that you can also play as countries outside of Europe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg"></figure><p>The one addition that will make Europa Universalis V a little more approachable is its automation system. It allows players to automate tasks related to the conquerer, explorer, trader, and gardener play styles. By using this feature, players can focus on specific parts of the game, whether for educational or entertainment purposes.</p><p>This approach doesn't sacrifice depth for the sake of approachability, as your best option will still be to manage everything yourself. Still, new players may want to automate certain tasks at first while getting used to all the changes and mechanics that Europa Universalis V introduces. As has historically been the case with Paradox Interactive's grand strategy games, Europa Universalis V is overwhelming at first, but captivating once you get a handle on everything going on. In this way, it doesn't sacrifice the series' identity, but the culmination of all the Paradox grand strategy games that came before it ensures the experience doubles down on the strategic complexity. As a strategy game fan, I love it--I'll take all the mechanical depth and complexity I can get.</p><p>Europa Universalis V does not balk at the challenge of offering a comprehensive grand strategy for its players, simply offering tools like automation so players can ease themselves into everything bit by bit. Although it may be tough for some to move on from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/europa-universalis-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-149860">Europa Universalis IV</a>, a game with over 12 years of updates and DLC, those who make the jump will discover what's shaping up to be the next great grand strategy sandbox from Paradox.</p>

		<p>It’s almost always been the case that you have to wait a good long time between grand strategy and 4X sequels, but those gaps have stretched longer and longer for Paradox Interactive’s most notable series. After the 12 year gap before the much meme’d <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a>, it’s now almost 12 years from EU4 to the announcement and reveal of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis V</a> as well.</p>
<p>Of course, the tone of that wait is different, when EU4 has had a steady flow of expansions over the years, but with a numbered sequel comes the opportunity and the expectation of great changes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Europa Universalis V: Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKaGSIm9juI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first thing to note is that EU5 shunts the starting date of the game even earlier than before, going back to 1337 and capturing more of that transition from the late Middle Ages and into the Renaissance. More importantly, it also brings a few truly seismic world events into the game’s opening few hours (depending on how much you pause the game, that is). The Hundred Years War kicks off between England and France literally months after you hit play, and then just a decade or so later the Black Death rolls through the world, adding an early game crisis point that you’ll feel the ramifications from for decades to come.</p>
<p>As the Black Death is first reported, you’re given a few choices for how to react. You can just keep going business as usual, keep up trade, allow migration and for people to just do their things, or you can enact various isolationist policies. Spending influence you can try to source cures, you can draw all the Nobles to a little retreat that tries to keep you away from the riff-raff, you can close down cities, exile the infected, make scapegoats of the healthy, and more. It’s difficult to know what the best path to take here is –&nbsp;obviously there’s no actual cure or vaccines at this time, so you will feel the pain, and it’s almost just about how long you want to drag this out for. Playing as Portugal, I got the plague fairly late on, but with my choices, I still had that wash of green within my borders much longer than Spain, Morocco or England did. I clearly bungled it…</p>


<p>And that flushed my economy right down the pan, to be honest. With trade massively impacted, production all starved of workers, and my coffers completely dry, I needed a slew of big loans from my nobles, which were then being traded back and forth to foreign banks, and my attempts to micromanage this were barely keeping my kingdom afloat.</p>
<p>Thankfully this is where I could lean on one of the major areas of improvement within EU5. There’s much more automation available to you which, in the long run, will give you more freedom to play this game in the fashion that you want. Initially I was micromanaging trade, putting in deals to meet the needs of the pops and production, quickly clicking through on individual deals, but then seeing them quickly become unprofitable as supply dried up –&nbsp;this can be applied to trade in general, as well as to specific markets. Similarly, I was somewhat fearful of raising taxes across nobles, burghers, and the common folk, lest they get all angry and rebel, but got into such financial straights after the pandemic that I told the AI to take over and rake in enough cash for me to start recovering. There’s further automation for other areas, with the Automation AI based on the same AI leading computer-controlled nations, so you likely will want to keep key areas under your control or supervise, otherwise you could end up in a pseudo spectator mode –&nbsp;albeit one where there’s regular events to make decisions on, where foreign policy and wars are in your control, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, each of these areas has also been revisited by Paradox Tinto to reconsider how they work, whether you put them in the hands of AI or furiously click your way through menus yourself.</p>

<p>Let’s stick with trade for the moment, which is defined not by your cities, ports or nation as a whole, but rather by markets that can cross country divides and regions. For Portugal, my two markets were both based in Castile, both of them with their own tendrils of supply and demand. To a certain</p>
<p>At the heart of any nation is its people, and EU5 has population units more similar to Victoria 3 or Imperator: Rome. There’s some core demographics to pay attention to here, as they’re broken down by their class and working status – from Nobles down through Laborers to Slaves, if your nation’s laws allow them – while there’s also their religion and cultural background to consider for the harmony within your country. When looking at your government, these are broken down into Estates for Nobles, Clergy, Berghers, Commoners, which you’re trying keep their broad approval and happiness. Often times, you’re having to make concessions, especially if (as a monarchy) you hold a council and need their approval to push a new agenda. Approval gradually shifts in a given direction to a neutral position,</p>

<p>Those decisions that you’re making will tie in with the Societal Values system, reviving the policy sliders from older titles in the series and replacing the Ideas of EU4. This breaks particular issues down into polar opposites –&nbsp;Spiritualist vs. Humanist, Land vs. Navy, Aristocracy vs. Plutocracy –&nbsp;and measures along these scales. Naturally, you enact policy and make decisions that nudge things one way or another, but there’s tons of these elements to keep in mind.</p>
<p>One of the ways you can affect societal change is with your Cabinet, a small cadre of officers that you can send out to perform tasks for you. One key tenet is the notion of Control throughout your nation. While your ruler or government presides in the capital, the further away from the seat of power you get, the less it really matters to the people living there, the more like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtYU87QNjPw">Monty Python’s Repressed Citizens skit</a> it might feel like, and the more difficult it is to exert your influence (and gather taxes). Building roads improves Control as the time to travel and the kind of closeness to cities is improved. They can also be set to work restoring your country’s Stability after a period of upheaval or with a looming threat, work to develop a province, try to convert a region’s populace, and much more. They’re an extension of your will and gradually get things done.</p>

<p>In general, there’s a step away from having certain traits and skills be treated as resources. Instead of having to save up points before you can send your advisors on a new task, instead they have a particular skill rating that affects how well and how quickly that job will get done. This does mean that their impact feels much more gradual, but also gives you more flexibility to pivot as world events take place.</p>
<p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of many elements of Europa Universalis 5. For example, we didn’t get stuck into a war, so didn’t try out the revamped military systems, which borrow ideas from Imperator: Rome for having formations, while requiring you to have logistics and resources to keep an army marching. Meanwhile, there’s a new antagonism rating that could see alliances spring up against you if you’re too aggressively expanding through the world. Then there’s playing through the longer passage of time, as technology works through individual trees for the starting Age of Traditions, through the Age of Renaissance, Discovery, and beyond.</p>

<p>Europa Universalis 5 remains a deep and complex historical grand strategy game, and it certainly looks to build and integrate, not only idea that came from a decade of updates and expansions to EU4, but also to some of the more fundamental shifts and ideas that we saw in Victoria 3 and Imperator: Rome. Importantly, there is that on-ramp for newcomers, with the deeper automation set to lift some of the burdens of leaning the ropes, at the same time as lifting some of the micromanagement that can become a chore deeper into a campaign.</p>

		<p>Paradox Interactive has revealed Europa Universalis V, their latest grand strategy sequel that is in development at Paradox Tinto, having gone under the codename Project Caesar for the past year or so.</p>
<p>No release date or window has been set just yet, but the game is now available to wishlist, to keep tabs on announcements through Steam</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Caesar - Official Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaZcN-eVta8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>EU5 has been announced almost 12 years after EU4 arrived in August 2013, but even with all of the expansions and updates for the last game, this sequel promises to be no less deep and complex for ardent fans of the series. Still, Paradox has gone through their game, reconsidered a number of areas and mechanics, and reset the foundations for the coming decade. They’ve done this in tandem with the community, even so far as to founding Paradox Tinto five years ago and the team that was built around it.</p>
<p>There’s some key differences between the two games, some of which can be seen as drawing from other Paradox games released in the last few years.</p>

<ul>
<li>EU5’s start date is 1337, just before the outbreak of the Hundred Years War between England and France, and not long before the other outbreak that defined the era, with the Bubonic Plague set to sweep across Europe in the 1340s. The game continues on through to 1837.</li>
<li>Time is broken down into ages, such as the Age of Discovery where you can colonise distant lands, giving you the opportunity to adopt Institutions that define the technology trees that you follow.</li>
<li>There’s hundreds of millions of people being simulated across the world of EU5. Each province is now broken up into population units (POPS), similar to Victoria 3 and Imperator: Rome, each of which can have a different culture, religion, class and so on. Your fundamental job is to keep the fed, loyal and happy.</li>
<li>Trade does away with merchants and trade nodes, but there is instead a system of regional markets that have their own borders and regions. Setup trade routes between nations, sell surplus goods, and be mindful of needs and desires from your buildings and pops.</li>
<li>Societal Values see the return of policy sliders from earlier games, which were absent in EU4’s Ideas system. These sliders give your nation’s position between two opposing political values, with new sliders emerging as you progress through the ages.</li>
<li>There’s no more “Mana” where you accumulate points for nebulous resources to spend on actions. Now your monarch and their advisors have skill ratings for Administrative, Diplomatic and Military and this will affect the eventual cost over time and speed of actions.</li>
<li>Automation is a bigger part of EU5, letting you offload managing the economy, trade, building, production and more to an AI that is based on the same logic the computer controlled nations use. This is optional, and means that you can focus on what you find fun. If you want to micromanage, then you can, but if you want to focus on foreign policy and war, or deal more with events and major decisions, then you can do that too.</li>
<li>Warfare now has the military formations of Imperator: Rome, adding a tactical layer to your army set ups. Armies can be given directives for how to act in times of war – make a beeline to set up castle sieges, for example – and resource control is a major factor in how long you can go to war for, taking the resources and production away from a nation you’re invading.</li>
</ul>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/survios-debuts-story-trailer-for-alien-rogue-incursion/">Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One</a> was one of the standout VR games in 2024, and for Alien fans with a VR headset to play it, it was the kind of Alien game those fans had been waiting for since Alien: Isolation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Rogue Incursion developer Survios announced that Alien fans without VR headsets will soon be able to join the fun, with Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, a flatscreen version of the original VR game, arriving on September 30, 2025, for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now, with the standard edition coming in at $29.99 USD and the deluxe edition which includes a digital art book and a weapon and armor skin costs $39.99 USD.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5 &amp; PC Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ho3DAL11eA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Rogue Incursion is re-tooled from being a VR game since so much of the original experience was clearly designed for VR. The trailer Survios released today looks like it's showing footage captured in the game's engine, but it doesn't look like actual gameplay.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this is still just part one of a two-part story, a fact that wasn't clear ahead of Rogue Incursion's original release. When Part One launched, Survios released a <a href="https://x.com/Survios/status/1870484344768172495">statement</a> to players saying that it understood why the last-minute addition of the 'Part One' subtitle to the game's full title was negatively interpreted by players, adding that it did not "<em>intend to mislead or cause confusion about what this game is</em>."</p>
<p>It also clarified that it didn't cut the game short or in half, and that this was always the plan, though for whatever reason, the words 'Part One' were not publicly added to the title until after the game launched.</p>
<p>Now that we know Survios has been working on a flatscreen version of Part One alongside the development of Part Two now brings up the question of whether Part Two will be available as a VR headset first, and a flatscreen game later, or if it'll be playable with or without a VR headset at launch.</p>

			<p>The action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has had its early access launch shifted to Summer 2025, developer Grimlore Games <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1920515492902551765" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today. A crowded release window and the desire to improve the game based on the community's feedback mixed to push the studio toward this choice.</p>
<p>Still, the developers said the recent demo playtest was very successful. Thousands of players participated, streamed, and completed surveys. Grimlore said that over 92% of these playtesters rated their experience as positive or very positive, with long-time franchise fans particularly enthusiastic about capturing the spirit of the original while moving forward with modernized systems.</p>
<p>The playtest featured the game's introductory chapter, where players could choose between two masteries and face the first boss, Appollonia the Terrible - a battle that proved a fan favourite. The visuals and audio received outstanding marks, with average scores of 5.25/6 and 5.16/6, respectively, while exploration and environmental storytelling were frequently highlighted as memorable features.</p>
<p>Not all was great, though, which is why Titan Quest II was delayed. Combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balance were all in need of improvements, which Grimlore said are being addressed, while performance optimization continues. Additionally, a customizable control scheme and revamped user interface indicators are underway based on the community's suggestions.</p>
<p>In the game, players will have to face against Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, who is inexplicably out of control. She is corrupting the threads of fate and condemning all those who oppose her to eternal punishment - including the main character. Players must pick up their weapon, fight alongside the gods, and change fate itself to stop Nemesis, free those she's punished, and weave their own epic tale.</p>
<p>They'll get to create their own class by combining two of the masteries, forging a unique hybrid playstyle thanks to different combinations of skill modifiers, attributes, and items.</p>

Rockstar probably knew what it was doing when it led the latest trailer with a scene of Jason working hard while his jacked upper body glistened in the sunlight. Though choosing this scene probably had a double meaning, as Jason mentions that he’s “fixing some leaks” on a rooftop, which is likely a nod <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-aaron-garbut-son-tiktok-1851070189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-aaron-garbut-son-tiktok-1851070189">to the giant leak <em>GTA 6 </em>suffered in 2023</a></span>. While Jason’s filthy, country trashbandit disposition may win over some ladies, too, it’s the kind of thing gays flock to. Sure, there’s probably something to unpack about gay guys gravitating towards men who look like they wouldn’t respect them, but that’s a psychologist’s job, and I am simply a gay man who is predictably drawn to men who look like they would call me a slur. But I’m not alone. Plenty of us are thirsting for the next <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>protagonist in the out-of-pocket ways they tend to.</p><p>This is a win for the girls and the gays. A mere 20 seconds of footage has piqued the interest of every gay gamer you’ve ever met. That’s exquisite targeted marketing on Rockstar’s part, and now the game will get even more free promotion through the inevitable bump in Rule 34 searches for Jason in the coming months. Not that the game really needs that much promotion. This is the kind of game that sells millions of copies on the first day, then stays near the top of the charts for several years. But it’s nice to see Rockstar is aware of every market it can possibly corner.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
