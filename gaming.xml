            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> a soulslike? It’s a question <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-knows-what-a-soulslike-is-silent-hill-f-sparks-heated-debate-within-the-fandom">the Silent Hill fandom has been debating for some time now</a>. But in a recent interview with IGN, Konami insisted it's not, and expressed a degree of frustration with the ongoing debate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As IGN reported in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours">Silent Hill f hands-on preview</a>, its combat has a similar feel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a>’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button and activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks, especially, feel slow and need to be timed well, "contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, Silent Hill f’s combat also features timed dodges and counterattacks, with the latter particularly important in combat sequences. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but we suggested that "unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a>, you will likely have a hard time reacting." That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. It allows counterattacks to last longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talk of parries and counterattacks has come as a surprise to some Silent Hill fans, and Konami’s suggestion that Silent Hill f's combat sequences were ratcheted up because "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-is-combat-heavy-because-challenging-action-games-are-gaining-popularity-among-younger-players-nowadays"><u>challenging action games are gaining popularity among younger players nowadays</u></a>" has split the fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in an interview with IGN at gamescom 2025, Silent Hill producer Motoi Okamoto set the record straight. He insisted Silent Hill f is not a soulslike, despite the mechanics at play in its combat, and even said applying that label to the game is "disingenuous."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is one of the things that we see — the term soulslike — being thrown around on the internet quite a bit,” he began. “And I think it’s a label that’s a little bit disingenuous. Modern players will see like, oh there’s a stamina meter, there’s a dodge, and they're like, ‘Okay, it’s a soulslike.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But to be very honest, a lot of these things we actually pulled from classic Silent Hill titles. Look at Silent Hill 4 — there’s a charge meter for your attacks, kind of like our Focus meter. And even for Silent Hill 3 there's a stamina meter. You see it later on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okamoto went on to say Silent Hill f’s combat mechanics aren’t exclusive to the soulslike genre, expressing a degree of frustration with the online dialogue surrounding the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These things aren’t new and exclusive to soulslike games,” he said. “They’ve been a part of action horror games for a very, very long time. If you have these things you’re labeled a soulslike. And we’d like to reiterate we are an action horror game, but we are not a soulslike.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f comes out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>The new content <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content">follows reports Ubisoft received investment from Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF)</a> specifically to develop additional content for Assassin's Creed Mirage. The PIF is an initiative designed as a way to diversify the country's revenues via investment in foreign companies, with a large arm focused on the video games industry. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>. Ubisoft declined to comment on the report at the time.</p>
<p>Despite this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-sets-sights-on-acquiring-a-bigger-stake-in-nintendo">PIF holds a notable stake in a swathe of gaming companies</a>, including Grand Theft Auto publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Nintendo, EA, Embracer, Nexon, and Capcom.</p>
<p>We had a good time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Assassin's Creed Mirage when we reviewed it</a>, awarding it four stars, calling it "a fascinating new city and the embrace of a classic formula".

            <p>The Division 2: Survivors is "an updated take on the survival extraction experience" coming to The Division 2.</p>
<p>At a panel at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, the company confirmed that though development is currently "in the early stages" under the watchful eye of creative director and "veteran of the Division from the early days of the original game", Magnus Jansén, the team is keen to involve the community from the off.</p>

<p>Interested in trying before you buy and maybe giving a little feedback as you go? Ubisoft is looking to refresh its <a href="http://ubi.li/etf-registration">Elite Task Program, so sign up now</a> if you're a "committed player [looking] to engage directly with the development team and assist in guiding the future of the Division".</p><p>The Division Resurgence – the free-to-play mobile RPG shooter that picks up a few months after the events of the original game – <a href="http://thedivisionresurgence.com/">is also looking for participants for closed tests</a> on both iOS and Android. Ubisoft says it offers "the same gameplay experience as the Division games adapted to mobile gaming", and "with a familiar map updated to reflect the passage of time, the Division Resurgence will bridge the narrative gap between the Division 1 and 2, adding to the existing lore with additional story beats over time."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-is-a-perfect-reimagining-of-the-classic-series.1278849/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Ninja Gaiden</em> is having a renaissance. The last mainline entry was originally released more than a decade ago, but by the end of 2025, there will be <em>three</em> new <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> titles. Two are 3D: <em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>, a modern-day remaster of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> released earlier this year, and <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, co-developed by PlatinumGames and set to release in October. But there’s a new 2D game, too. <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> is a retro-styled side-scrolling platformer from Dotemu and the developers of <em>Blasphemous</em> — and it absolutely rips.</p><p>In <em>Ragebound</em>, you play as Kenji Mozu, a young ninja trained by usual series star Ryu Hayabusa. Early on, Kenji’s body becomes inhabited by the spirit of Kumori, a member of the rival Black Spider clan who adds throwable kunai weapons to Kenji’s arsenal and is briefly playable in special sections.</p><p>As you jump and climb through levels, you’ll have to take on hordes of enemies that impede your path. Many enemies are strategically placed to <em>just</em> get in your way, forcing you to find clever ways to dodge them or take them out.</p><p>Most enemies can be killed with one hit, but a few bigger ones take a few attacks to wear down and are better at standing their ground. However, you can get a superpowered strike that defeats those bigger foes in one shot by killing nearby enemies with glowing auras around them. A turquoise glow means you need to do a sword kill, while a magenta glow means you need to toss a kunai at them. These glowy enemies are <em>also</em> strategically placed throughout levels to generally set up a one-two punch of killing a small fry and a big guy, and nailing the dance of taking out enemies in the right order is extremely satisfying.</p><p>The bosses are typically giant monstrosities that are thrilling to fight, and they can be pretty tough. Fortunately, the game has an Assist Mode you can activate whenever you want to tweak the difficulty, which I often used to turn down the damage so I could persevere through a battle for a little bit longer or just to help me get unstuck.</p><p>I loved exploring the game’s levels, which are drawn with gorgeous pixel art and take place in some creative locales, like a pirate cave and a construction site. There are also hidden collectibles, including scarabs you can use to unlock upgrades and scrolls that open up extra-hard secret stages. And the soundtrack is filled with heavy guitar, synth, and drums to make you feel like a ’90s-era action hero.</p><p>If I had one nitpick, it’s the game’s story and writing, which isn’t as strong as the moment-to-moment action. It’s just weird to see Kumori, a badass ninja lady, say “good grief” to kick off one of the levels. But it’s not <em>that</em> big of a deal; this is a game with a sequence where you ride a jet ski to escape a military boat, after all. In a way, the weak writing adds to the generally campy vibe.</p><p>In a moment where there are a lot of great retro action games to play, <em>Ragebound</em> shows what makes the <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> series special. After my nearly six-hour playthrough<em>,</em> I feel like I might like other <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games — and even if I don’t, <em>Ragebound</em> stands out well on its own.</p><p><sup>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</sup><em><sup> is available now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</sup></em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/716421/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-nintendo-switch-playstation-xbox-pc#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/716421/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-nintendo-switch-playstation-xbox-pc]]></content:encoded>

                <p>KPop Demon Hunters' fictional bands have become some of the hottest musical acts on the planet since the Netflix animated film released in June--but before Huntrix and Saja Boys were tearing up the charts, a quartet of League of Legends characters were making waves in virtual K-pop.</p><p dir="ltr">Even before KPop Demon Hunters was released, the film's fictional K-pop band was seeing comparisons to Riot Games' virtual girl group, K/DA. It's not a stretch to spot the similarities--two animated girl groups releasing catchy K-pop anthems in between fighting enemies with signature weapons and battle costumes. Even some of the costumes and color schemes feel familiar, and both groups have collaborated with real-world K-pop girl group Twice.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it feels likely that the team behind KPop Demon Hunters was inspired by K/DA, it hasn't commented much on the comparison. One of the only official references to K/DA comes from KPop Demon Hunters' music supervisor Ian Eisendrath, who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/" rel="nofollow ">confirms</a> that Riot's virtual band was "one of our many influences" for Huntrix's musical sound. Eisendrath adds that K/DA was just one of "8-12 references" that was mainly used to "envision what these songs could sound like."</p><p dir="ltr">No matter what level of inspiration K/DA had on KPop Demon Hunters, the Riot K-pop project proved almost seven years ago that fans would get behind a virtual girl group.</p><p dir="ltr">Made up of League champions Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai'sa, each member of K/DA is voiced and performed by a real-world pop artist. American artists Madison Beer and Jaira Burns provide the singing voices for Evelynn and Kai'sa, respectively, while members of K-pop group I-dle (formerly (G)I-dle) Miyeon and Soyeon voice Ahri and Akali, respectively. The group is structured like a classic K-pop girl group, with each member having a performing strength, and they mirror certain K-pop archetypes in personality and style.</p><p dir="ltr">K/DA was formed back in 2018 as an opening act for the League of Legends World Championship--and as a vehicle to sell their shiny popstar outfits as skins. The single and music video launched the same day as K/DA's debut augmented-reality performance in Incheon, South Korea, and quickly took off.</p><p dir="ltr">The debut single, Pop/Stars, charted at number one on the K-pop music charts and number five on the overall pop charts for Apple Music in the US, as well as topping Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. The music video went viral on YouTube, reaching over 100 million views in its first month. Despite being a fake band, K/DA made history by becoming the first K-pop girl group to have a single certified platinum with Pop/Stars.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UOxkGD8qRB4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Viranda Tantula, the creative lead on the opening ceremony performance, explained in an <a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/1203022006-1203022006/" rel="nofollow ">interview</a> that Pop/Stars' success was all about commitment to the "fantasy of the champs being in the real world." In order to sell this fantasy, Tantula explained, they had to create a pop song that stands up against real-world pop music and a performance that competes with real-world stadium-level pop.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite how much went into K/DA's debut, it initially wasn't intended to be any more than the one single. "We really went into it wanting to make the singular moment as dope as possible and intentionally weren't thinking much further into the future than that," Tantula said in the same interview. When Pop/Stars started taking off, far eclipsing anything the Riot music team had released previously, Tantula says the team started "chatting about where this could go."</p><p dir="ltr">K/DA was quiet for a while after their debut, though they remained popular with fans who created art, cosplay, and dance covers for Pop/Stars--and spent plenty of cash on K/DA skins. After two years of speculation, the group finally returned with a bang in 2020, releasing the five-song EP All Out and once again gracing the Worlds opening ceremony with an augmented-reality performance of lead single More.</p><p dir="ltr">While none of the All Out tracks reached the viral peak that Pop/Stars saw, the EP performed well as a musical release in its own right--with play counts on Spotify comparable to Huntrix's discography at the time of writing.</p><p dir="ltr">Riot hasn't revisited K/DA since the All Out release--though it did experiment with a boy band, Heartsteel, and an Akali-led side project, True Damage, all of which exist in the same alternate universe of League of Legends lore. The rise of KPop Demon Hunters seems to have brought fans back to K/DA, however: The Pop/Stars YouTube comments are full of people who say they're watching because of KPop Demon Hunters, while the K/DA subreddit is full of Huntrix/K/DA <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KDA/comments/1ltzpxi/popstars_x_how_its_done_kda_huntrix_mashup/" rel="nofollow ">mashups</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KDA/comments/1m3qbp6/kda_x_huntrix_art_by_sumzip/" rel="nofollow ">fan art</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Some fans who were introduced to K-pop by the Netflix film even appear to be jumping to K/DA for their next fictional K-pop fix. Though this could just be because both bands have a similar sound, there's an argument to be made that virtual acts may be less intimidating for first-time fans who aren't ready for the complexity of real-world K-pop fan culture. No matter the reason, both K/DA and Huntrix have proven themselves successful gateway artists for fans who have never engaged with K-pop before.</p><p dir="ltr">The similarities between K/DA and Huntrix may be undeniable, but there's one major element that sets the two groups apart: K/DA is a virtual K-pop group, while Huntrix doesn't exist outside of the narrative of KPop Demon Hunters--for now. The difference is the conceit that K/DA is a band that really exists in our world--they've performed stadium shows, filmed music videos, and even held interviews and addressed fans directly via social media.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1RjqonnU7M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j1RjqonnU7M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Riot's handling of K/DA as a virtual band provides a template that Netflix could very well follow with KPop Demon Hunters. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit AMA</a> with members of the KPop Demon Hunters team, a fan asked if Huntrix and Saja Boys could become bona fide virtual bands, and music supervisor Ian Eisendrath replied, "I would love that."</p><p dir="ltr">Just like K/DA before them, both Huntrix and Saja Boys are blowing up the charts right now--going head to head with some of the most popular real K-pop groups. Huntrix surpassed Blackpink as the highest-charting K-pop girl group when it hit number two on the US Spotify charts, while Saja Boys surpassed the likes of BTS and Stray Kids to become the highest-charting K-pop boy group. There's no word yet on Netflix's plans for either fictional group, but it's not hard to picture them selling out stadiums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I’ve been very vocal about the volume of Soulslikes releases. The market is saturated, and more Souls games are on the way. Valor Mortis is one of the latest to be announced, but this preview comes after playing it at Gamescom 2025. One More Level has an unbelievably exciting new project, as the studio has taken some of the best Ghostrunner qualities.</p>



<p>I knew I had an appointment to play One More Level’s (at the time) unannounced new IP at Gamescom 2025. We learned about Valor Mortis during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live</a>. It became evident very quickly that this isn’t another Elden Ring, Lies of P, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valor-mortis-hands-on-preview/Fallen%20Feathers%20Review%E2%80%94Excellent%20Debut%20Earns%20a%20Feather%20in%20Its%20Cap%20-%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. I can tell you first-hand, this is the most excited I’ve been for a Soulslike in years.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-souls-than-your-usual-soulslike">More Souls Than Your Usual Soulslike</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s give him a big hand. Credit to One More Level</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://omlgames.com/en/game/valor-mortis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Valor Mortis</a> doesn’t hide its genre or obvious inspiration. There are Lanterns serving as the usual Souls checkpoints, enemies respawn, and you lose your resources if you die. It’s standard fare in that regard. However, I’ve been wanting a polished and powerful first-person Soulslike for a while. Everyone goes for third-person, and no one seems to see the potential of a first-person perspective.</p>



<p>One More Level has taken the plunge. You’re a fallen Napoleon soldier in the 19th century, reanimated and revived. I jumped straight into the action with a sword in hand, a first-person camera angle in place, and the game teaching me the basics: How to attack, parry, and other common Souls techniques and movements.</p>



<p>I was elated to see that One More Level hadn’t forgotten its roots. Valor Mortis still lets you perform a sizable dash à la Jack from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghostrunner-2-preload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghostrunner</a>, and there’s some fun parkour and traversal moments. But the core of the game’s structure revolves around combat. This is a Soulslike, and I can say it gets the blood pumping and makes my heart beat furiously.</p>



<h2 id="h-beauty-is-in-the-hand-of-the-beholder">Beauty is in The Hand of The Beholder</h2>



<p>My hour-long demo saw me finish with a sword in my right hand for light and strong strikes, and interchangeable gadgets for my left hand: A pistol or the ability to spew fire from my hand. If you’re familiar with Bioshock or the Dishonored franchise, you’ll know what I’m talking about.</p>



<p>The pistol is great for enemies with big weak points, whereas fire is perfect to coat enemies with a crispy blast of flames and can quickly build up huge damage. I found I needed all three weapons to overcome the boss at the end of the demo. I won’t spoil things, but the boss is big, nasty, malformed, and took some beating.</p>



<p>The fascinating part of the fight for me was that the boss had plenty of weak points to target. Other Souls games emphasize elemental damage and weaknesses, and resistances. The pistol was a necessity, and the weak points added dynamism to the fight. There’s a lot of diversity in Valor Mortis’ gameplay, but you can still upgrade your main stats, like your health and parry capabilities. The unique environment is bolstered by visions of fallen soldiers, so you can learn more about the world—acting as a collectible in some ways.</p>



<p>One hour with Valor Mortis felt like seconds. As a huge Soulslike fan, this is the type of game I’ve been craving. If the tight-knit world-building and slick gameplay of Ghostrunner transfer over to Valor Mortis, this might be a sleeper GOTY contender.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158200/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The last time I tried shepherding an unruly beast, I wasn’t exactly a fan. It was midnight, I was exhausted, and my dog simply refused to come back inside. Typical. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/herdling">Herdling</a> offers a much cosier alternative, replacing a stubborn pup with fantastical beasties that <em>actually</em> listen to me.</p>
<p>Developed by Okomotive, the studio behind the wonderful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/far_changing_tides">FAR</a> series, Herdling carries the same blend of quiet melancholy and atmosphere as the studio’s other games. Though fleeting in length, Herdling is a breath of fresh air - a journey sure to stick with you, even if its core gameplay feels a tad clunky.</p>
<p>The game begins beneath a quiet city overpass at dawn, as your silent protagonist shakes off a rough night in their makeshift shelter. Leaves swirl in the wind as car alarms echo and flickering streetlights guide you toward a meet-cute with your first calicorn - a lovable, smooth-brained lump of horn and fur, like an oversized ram. As the sun rises over distant mountains, your new life as a shepherd begins. Armed with nothing more than a leafy stick and some seriously impressive cardiovascular fitness, your goal is clear: guide a growing herd of beasts toward a better life. Oh, and yes, of course you can pet the calicorns.</p>
<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158193/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The plot takes a comfortable backseat. Without a single line of dialogue, Herdling clearly wants you to <em>feel</em> its story - a choice I appreciate. Games like <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/jusant">Jusant</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/journey">Journey</a> have perfected this approach, telling deeply emotional stories through world and atmosphere, and Herdling follows suit.</p>
<p>The lack of dialogue allows for composer Joel Schoch’s wondrous melodies to do all the talking. Out the gate, Herdling’s soundtrack solidified itself as the primary plucker of my heart strings. An ensemble of cheeky flourishes, soothing ambience, and powerful compositions match the tone and pace of each storybeat. Crashing percussion and soaring woodwinds turn a rush through open fields into something truly epic; gentle keys, on the other hand, speak to the fear of a lonely calicorn. It’s all beautiful.</p>
<p>Your journey is broken into cosy chapters where you clean, feed, and decorate your herd, leading them through foggy forests, abandoned trainyards, and treacherous mountain passes. Call of the wild stuff, really. Along the way, you’ll stop at campsites where you tend to a warm fire, curl up with your herd to rest, and ponder the shepherd’s cryptic dreams. It’s clear Okomotive wants you to bond with your beasts, asking you to name each calicorn you rescue which builds a bond between you (the player) and your herd. And y’know, nothing stings quite like watching the newly christened “Jim” stumble off a cliff. Poor, lemming-like Jim.</p>
<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158194/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay is fairly straightforward, relying on light environmental puzzles and manageable challenges. It’s mostly an easy ride: the odd spike trap, a tricky crevice or two but it’s otherwise a steady trot to the top for your fluffy convoy. Early on, I chuckled when the herding control scheme was disguised as a driver’s ed course: cones, cars, and cardboard boxes - a cute way to introduce Herdling’s quirky control scheme.</p>
<p>The game does throw in a few environmental variations to spice things up - bushes that slow you down, slippery slopes, and gusty winds. On the flip side, clusters of colourful flowers boost your herd’s abilities. Blue blooms refill the stampede meter, yellow ones pop up for the odd environmental puzzle, and red… Well, I’ll be honest, I never really figured out their purpose beyond looking cool when you plough through them. I’ll admit, as much as I’m a fan of these silent, music-driven games, I would’ve liked an odd huff or grunt each time I burned through a stampede boost.</p>
<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158192/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, controlling your herd is intuitive in theory, but in practice? Less so. To guide your pack forward, you stand behind them and hold ZR, nudging left or right like a sheepdog flanking its herd: step to their left, they swing right; step to their right, they swing left. In addition you can tap buttons to slow, stop, and even stampede. However, when a single calicorn is twice your size and moves like a forklift, keeping track of your cursor – or predicting the chaos – becomes a challenge. No surprise then that my fluffy wrecking ball bulldozed that driver’s ed setup first go.</p>
<p>While I eventually felt like a herd lord, the janky herding mechanics began to wear thin fairly quickly. Early puzzles are basic and hazards never evolve much. Occasionally, you’ll break off from the herd to pull a lever, open a gate, or hop across a chasm or two, but that’s about as deep as it goes.</p>
<p>Despite the calicorns’ big, red <em>harrowing</em> eyes, they don’t feel especially <em>alive</em>. They’re tagged with personality types such as brave, affectionate, even ‘rascal’, but these don’t seem to impact how they behave. They mostly just fall in line. Shame, really, because as your herd grows and the game introduces its horrid, gangly bird-like baddies, you get a real sense of what Okomotive is aiming for.</p>
<figure><a title="Herdling Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158191/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At one point, I even purposely guided one of my troops (of course, it was Jim again) into a spike trap. For science, of course. Sure enough, they took damage, which obviously made me feel bad (I’m not a <em>monster</em>), but a quick snack from some nearby shrubbery patched up the unlucky test subject. Still, it’s clear challenge isn’t the point here. Like the FAR games, Herdling is about the mood - the phenomenal soundtrack, the thoughtful world, and the lovable cast of furry characters.</p>
<p>That said, performance on the Switch 1 is disappointing. It’s playable, sure, but frame rate drops and muddy textures really detract from the experience - especially in a game that thrives on immersion. There’s also a camera bug near the start of the game which can be frustrating. Fortunately, the Switch 2 handles Herdling better with a smoother framerate, but textures and lighting still look a bit flat.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Herdling is a cosy, heartfelt trek that feels like a breath of fresh air and its stunning atmosphere and soundtrack do much of the heavy lifting. Whilst the game rarely stumbles, it seldom soars and often gets stuck behind janky controls or disappointing performance. Still, for all its rough edges, Herdling is a memorable adventure. If you’re chasing the next grand expedition, this game might fall short, but if it’s vibes you seek, look no further than this herd of lovable, clumsy beasts.</p></section>

Fans had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-developers-discuss-series-modern-day-future-basim-and-why-theres-no-new-isu-artifact">subsequently hoped to see more from the character</a>, though it's unclear if this add-on will include any new answers to his ultimate fate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Mirage was released, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creeds-wild-meta-story-might-be-getting-even-stranger-soon">players found an odd post-credits scene hidden in the game's files</a> that Ubisoft has since acknowledged, though never fully explained. Perhaps this too will finally be addressed in Mirage's upcoming new content, more details of which will follow in the weeks to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-expansion-claws-of-awaji-release-date-revealed">Assassin's Creed Shadows, meanwhile, is the game's big Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, curiously also developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux, that's due for launch on September 16.

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you played this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Andrewww</b> finished off the story of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, enjoying the fan pleasing touches at the end of the story, but won’t be able to go back and fully explore everything since he was playing via PS Plus. But he wanted more Star Wars, so he’s been watching Andor, and went back to the not-quite-as-good Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the bank holiday weekend, and check in as I work through a whole host of Gamescom previews.</p>

<figure><a title="OFF" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/108bafb36749a/off.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Fangamer</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, it's the weekend once again, which means it's time to get some gaming done!</p>
<p>But first, a recap. This week, Capcom launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/capcom-launches-resident-evil-30th-anniversary-website">an intriguing 30th anniversary website for Resident Evil</a>, though there's not much on there right now beyond some cool artwork. Gamescom also happened, which means we got some really cool announcements including a port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> in 2026, and brand-new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/atari-announces-bubsy-4d-from-demon-turf-developer-fabraz">Bubsy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/he-man-is-the-next-80s-icon-getting-his-own-stunning-arcade-style-retro-revival">He-Man</a> games! What!</p>
<p>Nintendo also showcased a new Direct looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which officially launches on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. We even got to go hands-on with the game at Gamescom, and it's looking really nice, y'all.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">release date</a>. No big deal.</p>
<p>Now, let's see what we're all up this weekend, hmm..?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186593,186826 @ 1755961942 -->
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at the moment. I ended up buying the Year 3 Character Pass, so I'm currently getting to grips with Sagat (ooh, matron) and I can't wait for the other characters to launch.</p>
<p>I'm also quite keen to jump back into the GameCube app and play a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Wind Waker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, but we'll see how much free time I manage to carve out.</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>It's no good, I just can't stop playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on my Nintendo Switch 2. Every time I think I've done the vast majority of quests, I'm made aware by an off-hand comment vaguely referencing a mission I have absolutely zero memory of, so I'm compelled to do my duty (I know) and tick an item off my list that I didn't even know was there.</p>
<p>This time around it's a little quest called 'Don't Fear the Reaper'. Anyone familiar with this should know that this could take me some time...</p>

<h2>Zion Grassl, Video Producer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/off">OFF</a> may not be a long game by any means, but having just rolled credits on it the other day means my slate is pretty clean now! Of course, I’m slowly chipping away at the battle pass in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> as I <em>HAVE</em> to have those Green and White Ranger skins! Whenever a game lets me play as Tommy, you know I’m in.</p>
<p>I’m also playing though <strong>REDACTED</strong> and am having a pretty swell time with it! I’d say more…but…embargoes, amirite? I’ll spew about it soon, promise.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Ever one to have my finger on the pulse of what’s hip and trendy, I have started playing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> on my PS5 after getting dewy-eyed reminiscing about my time with it on PS2. It’s still a damn good game, I’ve got to give it that, and I’d love to get it wrapped up this weekend so I’m all clear for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> takeoff in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Let’s stay with the contemporary theme and throw in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, too. I never played this one back in the day, so it’ll be nice to see what it’s all about!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>After dabbling around with Chibi-Robo for some screenshots this week, I think I'm actually going to play the whole darned thing, something I've never done before. It's weird and delightful and actually a little bit uncomfortable, which I love so far. So I'm excited to dive in further.</p>
<p>That's really all I have planned. Very uneventful, right? Have a good one, all!</p>

Barter with the shopkeepers while keeping a keen eye on the value of your offer and the shopkeepers’ mood to get the best deal possible. If it goes well, they might offer you valuable items at bargain prices, but if you get too greedy, you risk upsetting the shopkeeper, who might hike the prices in response.</p><p>What’s more, the underground world is also home to a strange resource called stockinum, the value of which fluctuates constantly…</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/million-depth-launches-november-12]]></content:encoded>

These awards call on a "panel of expert gaming jurors" and the community to decide the winners.</p>
<p>The recent Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has taken out "best gameplay" of the show, placing it ahead of other titles like <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Although Mario Kart World missed out on the gameplay award, it did win "best Nintendo Switch 2 game" of the event, beating not only Donkey Kong Bananza but also upcoming releases like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4ohrinq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Apart from this, Pokémon was the winner of the "best booth", Capcom won the award for the "best lineup", and the anticipated indie title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> won the best trailer.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award">see the rest of the award winners</a> along with the assessment procedure and criteria on the Gamescom website.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many different ways to experience The Witcher these days. My own entry point into this world was playing through the first Witcher game back when it first came out in 2007. But it wasn't until The Witcher 3 that I really felt the depth of the story. I loved exploring the world, playing Gwent, and getting an up close and personal look at Geralt's complicated love life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a similar feeling with the first couple of seasons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-witcher">The Witcher series on Netflix</a>, but now that Henry Cavill has left the show I find myself mostly just looking forward to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">next Witcher game</a> in the franchise. Since that game is still years away, however, I've been recently looking into The Witcher TTRPG as a potential new way to experience that world. It's currently only $15 for a six-book bundle at Humble Bundle and it certainly looks intriguing at that price.</p><div catalogid="af01313a-a9f9-4c39-b028-cf6df9563c2e" id="227219"><div id="227219" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Six digital books included</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher TTRPG Bundle</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">What comes with this bundle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This Witcher TTRPG bundle includes a total of six books. You can get the full bundle by spending $15 or you can choose to pay more and support charity. According to the website, this bundle supports <a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals</a>. Here's all of the digital books included with your purchase:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Witcher TTRPG Core Rulebook</li><li>The Witcher: A Book of Tales</li><li>The Witcher: Tome of Chaos</li><li>The Witcher: A Witcher's Journal</li><li>The Witcher: Lords &amp; Lands</li><li>The Witcher TTRPG - Easy Mode</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Is The Witcher TTRPG worth playing?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher Tabletop RPG was created by <a href="https://rtalsoriangames.com/witcher-trpg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R. Talsorian Games</a> in collaboration with CD Projekt Red. The core game is set somewhere between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> on the video game timeline. Since I haven't had the chance to play the game myself, I did a bit of digging into reviews and Reddit threads to see if it's worth playing. The <a href="https://spritesanddice.com/reviews/witcher-ttrpg-review/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most comprehensive review</a> I could find comes from a site called Sprites and Dice. The author goes into a lot of detail about the core rule book and subsequent books available while looking at it through the lens of an experienced D&amp;D player. I recommend checking that out if you need a deeper look at what you'll get with this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a pretty <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/fd9ecn/opinions_on_the_witcher_ttrpg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpful Reddit thread</a> I found where multiple people have given their thoughts about this TTRPG. A common theme throughout that is that those who actually played it enjoyed it overall. One user complimented the character creation involved while pointing out the imbalances in some of the classes. Basically, if you don't decide to be a Witcher or a Mage you won't get the chance to engage with the full rulebook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Disclosure</strong></em><em>: Humble Bundle is part of IGN Entertainment, the division of Ziff Davis that includes GamesIndustry.biz, IGN, and MapGenie.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 22, 2025 11:45 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-tabletop-rpg-books-are-only-15-at-humble-bundle-right-now]]></content:encoded>

DICE has announced that there's now a penalty for making consecutive jumps that lowers the jump height. Momentum carried from a slide into a jump has also been tweaked to reduce its speed. Nevertheless, Battlefield 6 principal game designer Florian "DRUNKKZ3" Le Bihan wants players to know that the movement changes "are not drastic."</p><p>"Movement is also getting more responsive in general in places that have felt a bit clunky before. so there is a lot more that is getting quality improvements [and] polish in this same area," wrote Le Bihan on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1958563338301935939" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. "Adding diminishing returns to jumping is what we're actually doing, an initial slide or an initial jumps will not be affected.

<p>It's almost here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After a long wait and even some delays, we're now just weeks out from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<p>The 'hands on' previews have been rolling in from Gamescom this week, so we're rounding up a handful here including our own. This is the final demo before the game goes on sale to the public on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, here's a summary of our own thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think you'll all love it, if you do like Hollow Knight - they've absolutely smashed it here... it runs beautifully...the atmosphere, the graphics, it all just plays totally perfect together"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186836 @ 1755961648 -->
<p>So, what did other outlets have to say? Here's the rundown:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview-gamescom-2025/">GamesRadar+:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Silksong is building smartly on exceptionally solid foundations, and it's doing so with a greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hollow-knight-silksong/preview">PCGamesN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong feels exactly like we hoped it would. Beautiful yet brutal. Charming yet challenging. It doesn't seem like a massive departure from the original, but with a few tweaked and rebalanced techniques, it still freshens up the formula."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-only-is-hollow-knight-silksong-real-ive-played-it-and-its-harder-and-faster-than-the-original-but-is-it-better">Eurogamer:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Silksong is the game of the moment. And Team Cherry has opted to make this more difficult and a bit more awkward. For platforming fans like me, that's catnip - but will the average player curious in the franchise be so intrigued?"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/">Insider Gaming:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gameplay loop is back. The slick dashes, jumps, and swipes are a key part of Hornet’s arsenal. Tactical jabs and prods, using Hornet’s agility and nimble frame to evade attacks; these are hallmarks of what made the original so special and accessible."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-preview-gamescom/">The Gamer:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"I saw nothing to suggest it is reinventing the wheel, although I don’t doubt there will be more than a few abilities to differentiate things. In my humble opinion, this isn’t a bad thing. Hollow Knight is such a unique Metroidvania, that another story in that world is fine by me. After the eternal wait, we’re agonisingly close to playing Team Cherry’s next adventure, and it already feels like it was worth the wait."</p>
</blockquote>

                <p>Steam darling Peak's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest patch</a> changes the game for Steam Deck players and speedrunners who love nothing more than a good glitch.</p><p>Peak version 1.25.a makes a few major changes and a bunch of minor ones. The biggest alteration is that the game is now Steam Deck Verified.</p><p>"Finally.....the game is good on Steam Deck," the team wrote in the patch notes. "Deck players will know it's been good for a while! The Mesa Update added the last of controller support needed and with this patch we've added some text adjustments needed to get the Verified badge."</p><p>There are a whole bunch of fixes and adjustments as well. Most prominently, it's much harder to glitch your way to the top of the mountain than it has been over the last couple of weeks.</p><p>"Made fog walls taller so you can't shoot over them to win the game in a minute with the Scout Cannon exploit," Team Peak wrote. "A lot of you asked us not to change the Scout Cannon but no promises were made about the map."</p><p>Previously, players could use the Scout Cannon to blast themselves so high that they were able to clear all five of the game's biomes and reach the goal at the peak. With the fog wall change, cannons can still send players ridiculously far under the right circumstances, but they're now much more likely to smack into the wall of shifting fog that separates each biome and fall to their deaths. That said, we did manage to use the cannon to clear at least a couple of biomes before crashing back to earth when testing the update, so ridiculous cannon stunts remain possible.</p><p>Interestingly, this patch also added the ability to toggle off The Looker, a character who could randomly appear behind certain rocks, and who would disappear if you got too close or looked at them for too long. Even if you do leave the feature enabled, the character's appearance will be more rare moving forward.</p><p>One issue many Peak players have run into is that a bunch of the game's merit badges, tied to its Steam achievements, don't seem to unlock, even after doing everything required to earn them. Those issues have been resolved for the Cool Cucumber, Plunderer, Clutch, and First Aid badges.</p><p>Other issues addressed in this patch include problems with beehives (insect phobia textures work now, and you can't put beehives into your backpack anymore), alongside several balance changes (hot rocks in the Kiln now damage players correctly, the Cure-All item can cure some thorns in the Mesa biome, and the Magic Beanstalk is faster to climb).</p><p>Peak is the latest and one of the best examples of the genre that gamers have began to lovingly (or not-so-lovingly) as "friendslop"--relatively simple co-op-first games that include an element of humor, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/repo/" data-ref-id="5000-662250">R.E.P.O.</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lethal-company/" data-ref-id="5000-566928">Lethal Company</a>. Getting to the top of Peak's mountain requires skill and knowledge, but things like exploding spores, the fact that you can lose consciousness and fall off the mountain, and lots of other hazards, are undeniably meant to cause laughter.</p><p>Peak has sold over 10 million copies on Steam according to Geoff Keighley, and has recently added features like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">Mesa biome</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">cannibalism</a>, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just when fans were beginning to lose faith – or at least get extremely sick of hearing people trot out the same tired memes during every Geoff Keighley game showcase – <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/hollow-knight-silksong-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned</a>. Set to release <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in just a couple short weeks</a>, it’s a real video game with levels and characters and everything. That in mind, we’re left with a question: Which half-imaginary whisper of a game will take its place? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we hazard a few guesses.</p><p>This time around, we discuss <em>Silksong</em>, which looks like… more <em>Hollow Knight</em>. Cool! Also, the developers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have said</a> they will not be sending out pre-release review code, citing concern that it would be “unfair” to Kickstarter backers and regular players. But perhaps that approach is better for interesting writing about the game – and games in general – in the long run?</p><p>Then we talk about other cool games that received a Gamescom spotlight: <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, <em>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2</em>, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Xmv9eAIZA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Denshattack</em></a>, which looks way better than all those other games. Lastly, we discuss the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact of Trump’s tariffs on video games</a> – for the first time in maybe ever, console prices are going up toward the end of a generation, not down – and how they represent a stealth tax on <em>GTA VI</em> (which will probably be very expensive in its own right). Oh, and Chris decides to just make his own PlayStation 5, until he realizes that it’d probably land him in jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can spend half a decade quietly crafting a masterpiece video game (first we will have to learn how to make games, so it will take even longer than <em>Silksong</em>).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Given that <em>Silksong </em>is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left? What is the next <em>Silksong</em>, essentially? Now, the obvious answer is <em>GTA VI</em>, but that’s coming out next year; it’s in that sort-of-already-real space.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That’s real.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong><em>Half-Life 3</em>.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> If <em>Half-Life 3</em> even exists in any capacity.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Is <em>Pragmata </em>coming out finally?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, I played it at Summer Game Fest! It’s a <em>Lost Planet</em>-ass mid-2000s video game. It’s awesome. I really enjoyed the demo.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>That’s all I need. We’ve gotta get code for that.</p><p>Whatever the guy who made<em> Shadow Of The Colossus</em>’ next game is. That’s already cued up [to be a game people will have to wait forever to play].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Some people in chat are saying <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, but I think that’s in the same space as <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> where we’ve seen some of it. We don’t have an exact date yet, but it is real. <em>Bloodborne 2</em>? We don’t know if we’ll ever get that. <em>Wolf Among Us 2</em> is a good one.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Parameters are, it actually has to have been announced in some capacity.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The big one, in my mind, is <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>. All we’ve seen is a logo, and it has <a href="https://aftermath.site/elder-scrolls-vi-trailer-six-years-later" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been six years</a> – seven years now! – since we saw that logo. And that’s it. <em>Starfield </em>came out and was kind of a dud, and now we’re just waiting.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> There’s a Nintendo Switch RPG that’s, like, a cop RPG, and it’s from a Japanese developer. It’s been in development hell for a minute. What was it? <em>Decapolice</em>. That one’s mine. It was supposed to come out three years ago, I want to say.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The sequel to <em>Octopath Traveler</em>: <em>Decapolice</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>I wrote down some others: <em>Skate 4</em> kind of already exists, so that doesn’t count. <em>Ark 2</em> does, though. They’ve been working on that forever. We got that weird trailer with Vin Diesel 8,000 years ago, and its release date remains TBD.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> People in chat are mentioning<em> The Last Night</em>. The guy making it wound up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/16/15802708/the-last-night-hands-on-gamergate-cyberpunk-e3-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being a Gamergater</a> and then kinda disappeared?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Which one?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh! <em>The Last Night</em>! That pixel art sidescroll-y noir thing. We first saw that in… what? 2018? 2017? I think that game just disappeared into the ether. I don’t know if we’ll ever see that again.</p><p>Another one: <em>Fable</em>. The one game that Microsoft hasn’t canceled yet. Because I was gonna say, there’s a whole raft of Microsoft games, but then a bunch of them got canceled earlier this year. It’s like, well, so much for that.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, a lot of games that would have been on this list just got canceled. You also have the <em>Black Panther </em>game and the <em>Wonder Woman</em> game, for example – these things that seemed potentially interesting and then got smothered in the cradle.&nbsp;</p><p>And then finally, my sort of joke answer to this question that I do think counts as a valid answer: the <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake. You would think it wouldn’t be that difficult to get across the finish line, but it keeps getting delayed and pushed back, and we still haven’t really seen anything substantial of it. But at the same time, I can’t imagine people in Geoff Keighley chats being like “<em>Prince of Persia</em> remake when??? Show us the<em> Prince of Persia </em>remake!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>It’s not really something to rally around.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>. That’ll be the one people talk about any time there’s a hint of something fantastical or akin to <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>’ vibe in a Geoff Keighley showcase. “Oh, it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>! <em>Elder Scrolls</em>!” Then when it’s not, they’ll be like “Noooo, I don’t care anymore! This looks like trash!”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Update]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker"><h3>A ‘Game Capture Director’ Is The Person Who Gets The Gameplay Footage For A Video Game Trailer</h3></a><p>'The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both Jaws and Pac-Mac in a single trailer'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi]]></content:encoded>

Ubisoft calls the new content “an updated take on the survival extraction experience” that is currently “in the early stages” of development. Aiding as creative director for Survivors is Magnus Jansén, who previously served as creative director on the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division"><u>The Division</u></a>. During today’s gamescom panel, he confirmed that, after a few years away from the franchise, he’s “back” and “working on something very, very exciting.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>...a hint to, maybe, the biggest new thing we’re doing is right there in the name.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“As some of you had already figured out, the wintery, survival extraction experience is coming to The Division 2,” Jansén said. “I know some of you are, like me, fans of the survival mode that we had in the first Division, and obviously, we think that those of you who like that, will be very, very happy, but it’s more than a remake. We are doing cool, new things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He admits there’s little else to reveal, considering The Division 2: Survivors is so early in development. However, Jansén does have one note to leave fans with: “But what I will say, and this is like a teaser, is that a hint to, maybe, the biggest new thing we’re doing is right there in the name.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, I’ll just leave that there, and then I’ll be back next year,” he added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tom Clancy's The Division 2: Survivors Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll have to wait at least a few months to get a first look at The Division 2: Survivors. It’s release date on the roadmap is currently listed as “TBA,” so don’t expect its arrival until later in 2026 at the earliest. However, Ubisoft did provide eager fans with a first look at concept art (above), which may offer more hints about some of the scenarios players can find themselves in when Survivors eventually launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development,” executive producer Julian Gerighty said in a statement. “Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Division Resurgence</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Also included in today’s gamescom The Division announcements was an update on Ubisoft’s upcoming free-to-play mobile RPG MMO, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-resurgence"><u>The Division Resurgence</u></a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Replaced Is a Beautiful, Brilliant 2.5D Cyberpunk Thriller | gamescom 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/replaced-is-a-beautiful-brilliant-25d-cyberpunk-thriller-gamescom-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/replaced-is-a-beautiful-brilliant-2-5d-cyberpunk-thriller-gamescom-2025.1278651/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When you’ve played video games long enough, you eventually develop something of a “Spidey Sense” when you see a game that seems like it’s going to be extra special. You never know until the final product is on your hard drive, of course, but more often than not, that sixth sense is correct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replaced, a 2.5D action-adventure game drenched in an absolutely stunning sci-fi cyberpunk pixel-art aesthetic – complete with incredible camera work and moody music – is making that Spidey Sense tingle. I’d already played a brief three-part demo over a year ago, which only reinforced that feeling I first got after the initial reveal four years ago. This time I got to play the first 30 or so minutes of the campaign, and it did nothing to dampen my enthusiasm for what could be – if the rest of the game delivers – an all-time indie classic in the same category as Limbo, Braid, Inside, Balatro, etc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Right from the jump it’s obvious that Replaced’s art director knows what the heck they’re doing. The look of this dystopia, set in an alternate-history 1980s America, takes the 16-bit graphics I grew up with and plusses them up with soft dynamic lighting and some absolutely brilliant cinematography. Toss in just the right amount of depth of field and you get a world that looks lived-in. It oozes griminess and despair but somehow makes them look gorgeous. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Replaced is set in an alternate-history 1980s America and takes the 16-bit graphics I grew up with and plusses them up with soft dynamic lighting and some absolutely brilliant cinematography.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as R.E.A.C.H., an AI that lives in the body of a man named Warren, who wakes up after having been literally left for dead amongst a pile of corpses. The world of Phoenix City you see before you is the evolution of a worldwide nuclear event that occurred several decades prior. There are diaries, news articles, and other ephemeral bits of world-building information scattered around for you to collect and read in your Wingman – think of it as this cyberpunk world’s version of a 1980’s Walkman-meets-Palm-Pilot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Replaced starts simply enough, keeping you on a left-to-right 2D plane, old-school-style, and having you do little more than some basic platforming. But it establishes its setting so amazingly well – and quickly to boot. Whether it’s the aforementioned digital clippings revealing pieces of the radiation-coated backstory or the searchlight-wielding snipers who will gun you down in one shot if they spot you, things are clearly grim in Phoenix City. Before long you’ll have to fight to survive, as you’ll be forced to throw hands with a couple of faction members and soon entire gangs of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where Replaced will next impress you: it’s packing a proper Batman: Arkham combat system. Enemies who are about to attack will get a yellow lightning bolt over their heads. Press Y when you see that to instantly counter them. And then – my fellow Arkham veterans know where this is going – when a red lightning bolt appears over a foe’s head, that means they’re about to unleash an unblockable/uncounter-able attack, and you need to press the A button at just the right moment in order to dodge-roll away. Successful dodges and parries charge up a special-attack meter, which in Replaced’s case, means you get to either fire a shot from your found firearm at distance, or brutally execute an enemy if you’re at point-blank range. Of course, it’ll get more complicated; before long rifle-wielding bad guys will enter the fray, and the timing window changes on their (obviously) unblockable bullets. Enemy heavies will complicate things too. There was just one in the opening minutes of Replaced, and, probably by design, he wasn’t too tough to tango with. All of his attacks are unblockable, and he takes a ton of hits to bring down, but he didn’t have friends left by the time we faced off, so it was a very straightforward introduction to the higher-hit-point heavies you’ll face off against later in the game. So I expect the fisticuffs to ramp up significantly over the course of Replaced’s runtime in every sense of the word: number of enemies, difficulty, etc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon Replaced began introducing the 2.5D elements, literally expanding its world by letting me walk to the background or foreground to get something I needed to progress onwards. You’ll need to grab onto dumpsters to slide them around in order to climb up on them to reach a higher ladder, or to bridge a gap, just as one example. While this opening sequence didn’t offer me too much freedom of movement within the environment, I know it eventually will, because I’ve seen it before in last year’s demo. I should add, though, that exploring will sometimes reward you with pickups that are often tucked out of plain sight – I won’t go so far as to call them secrets – and they’ll fill out your dossier and shed a little bit more light on this broken world, or give you an upgrade. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that Replaced is going to have replayability, per se, but if the developers do an awesome enough job at building out the backstory of Phoenix City, that might deliver enough motivation to want to go back and find all of the hidden bits of information. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Replaces is packing a proper Batman: Arkham combat system. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s demo – again, since it was the very beginning of the game – also didn’t show off the biggest pleasant surprise from my initial hands-on with it last year: the RPG hiding under its 2.5D cyberpunk aesthetic. From the first couple of extremely impressive trailers, I’d thought that Replaced was “just” a side-scrolling action-adventure game. But no, it’s got sections packed with quest-giving NPCs and the ability to free-roam the area. I absolutely can’t wait to dig into more of this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But getting back to this newest slice of Replaced, I should take a moment to compliment the music. A moody synth soundtrack is key to nailing the vibe in any dystopian cyberpunk piece of media, and Replaced wastes no time confirming it understands the assignment in that department. And I’d actually like to get back to the visual identity of this game for a second as well. The pixel art, as you can already tell, is phenomenal, and the use of color and lighting is top-shelf, but I’d also like to shout out the animation. I’m not sure if this will make sense, but in attempting a retro look complemented by modern visual touches like in Replaced, there is such a thing as the animation being too good. I would argue that the development team at Sad Cat Studios has struck a perfect balance here. Neither R.E.A.C.H. nor his enemies move too smoothly. Instead, they have a slightly stilted movement to them, which only adds to the broken, beat-down spirit of Phoenix City, and it sells the neo-16-bit look even more perfectly, in my eyes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I reached the end of the demo build of Replaced, all I wanted was to play more. It is simply a captivating game from top to bottom, and I can’t wait to see where R.E.A.C.H.’s story goes as well as what the deeper plot reveals. I’m also eager to find out how much deeper the combat and RPG elements specifically go. I’d love nothing more than for my Spidey Sense to prove correct and for Replaced to be one of the best and most memorable games of 2026 (even if we already know that Grand Theft Auto 6 will dominate the headlines). We don’t have a release date for Replaced quite yet, but I get the sense that it’s close. Hopefully we’ll soon find out exactly when we can see just how special the final game is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

                <p dir="ltr">When I watch a great pro match of a fighting game like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 or Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, my reaction is equal parts awe and bafflement. The sheer speed and hyper-kinetic action flies by so quickly that I can only make sense of a percentage of what I'm seeing, and the people who have mastered the chaos must be a different species. Kirby Air Riders is like that: a bubblegum colorful confection of speed, agility, and action that feels overwhelming, but still fun to play.</p><p dir="ltr">My hands-on experience at Gamescom started with some tutorials showing the ropes of handling your ride. The ride accelerates automatically, which may seem like it suggests simplicity, but there's still a lot of finesse and fine control to handling your ride. Nailing a drift around a corner takes precise timing, and when you take a jump you can get a speed boost with a clean landing--which means tilting your racer slightly to land parallel if you're coming up on a hill. Those mechanics felt approachable and easy to grasp during the limited time of a demo, but had enough depth that the skill ceiling looks high.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Kirby Air Riders Is Faster, Deeper, and Cleaner Than The Original</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is a sequel to Kirby's Air Ride, but the shift to Air <em>Riders</em> is a significant one. There's a particular emphasis on the characters themselves and their unique powers, and this is where I could most keenly sense Masahiro Sakurai's experience with the Smash Bros. series. It feels like an evolution of that, and bringing that spirit of balancing different power sets into a new racing context.</p><p dir="ltr">After the tutorial featured, I played as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-character-in-kirby-air-riders/2900-6901/" data-ref-id="2900-6901">two different characters</a>: Magalor, the antagonist of Kirby's Return to Dreamland; and Starman, a recurring Kirby enemy. The riders seem to handle slightly differently, but the major difference is their special moves. Magalor activates a massive beam that shoots behind him, hitting any opponents that are coming up on your tail. By contrast, Starman's special was not an offensive tool at all. Instead, he could fly into the air on command using your regular spin attack while the special was activated. This seems primarily suited to help reach high places, though in a pinch you could also use it to dodge, at the expense of some speed.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo mostly focused on the City Trials mode, which is separated into two parts. First you explore the wide-open hub area gathering power-ups and switching your weak starter vehicle for a better one. There's a layer of strategy here, as various icons that you collect give you increased defense, weight, boost, and so on. You can use these to compensate for any of your racer's weaknesses, or make a naturally strong aspect even stronger. Once the first phase is over, everyone's total power-ups get tallied up and your build gets taken into the second phase. I could imagine that, as players grow more familiar with the game, serious competitive players will start to optimize combinations of racers and air rides with which types of icons they should prioritize for collection.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

dir="ltr">The build you craft during this first phase has a huge bearing on how competitive you'll be in the second one. Once all the players tally up their powers, they're able to choose one of four game types, and the game will recommend one that's optimized for your build. Some are more combat-focused while others are centered more on racing. I chose the recommended mode in my first game, a combat/racing fusion with Magalor and held my own decently well. For my second game, I picked one of the modes that was not recommended (mainly in order to stay grouped with the other human players in our closed session) and my unoptimized build showed on the almost pure racing track. Plus, Starman's vertical-focused power just isn't the best for a regular race around an oval track, but maybe I just need to get good.</p><p dir="ltr">Both phases feel extremely fast, so while one is about prepping a build, they both reward skilled play. And it's easy to see, even from my limited experience, how choosing your rider, finding your ride, and gathering power-ups could lead to a fierce Kirby Air Riders meta, as advanced Air Riders players explore different options to optimize their competitive edge.</p><p dir="ltr">For casual players like myself, Kirby Air Riders looks to be a sweet experience to play with friends, especially in couch co-op, fueling a rowdy party atmosphere. But I suspect that there's going to be a whole other layer of the game, with the speed and skill of a fighting game, and that one seems destined for the competitive stage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a tough time for new video game IPs. According to a new report, Wildgate, the new online PvP game from developer Dreamhaven, has struggled with sales since it’s release.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/blizzard-co-founder-s-game-startup-struggles-amid-industry-glut?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Cecilia D’Anastasio</a> reports that Wildgate has <strong>sold just 130,000 units</strong> in its first month plus. The data, which comes from a letter Dreamhaven co-founder Michael Morhaime sent to staff.</p>



<p>The Blizzard co-founder said that despite positive reviews from critics, the game performed below commercial expectations. It wasn’t just Wildgate that struggled, either. Dreamhaven’s other game, Sunderfolk, has sold just 62,000 copies since it released in April. Because of the struggles, he said, the company is looking for new financing. </p>



<p><strong>“Our monthly expenses are outpacing revenue,” </strong>Morhaime said in the letter, adding that Dreamhaven’s focus is to now <strong>“urgently”</strong> reduce costs. </p>



<p>He added that he is<strong> “committed”</strong> to making sure the studio survives its current financial turmoil.</p>



<p>Wildgate is currently available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. Through August 28, the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504780/Wildgate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on sale on Steam</a> for under $20. In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game earlier this year</a>, we said that Wildgate showed potential for being the multiplayer game of the year. The main concern, however, was getting players to buy in and keep them engaged with the game. Based on the current state of things, it appears that concern remains.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Wildgate and developer Dreamhaven? Let us know down below, and join this discussion and more in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Team Cherry's Hollow Knight sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is finally releasing on September 4 after years of development and fears from the community that the game may never see the light of day. But Silksong is real, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">we've played it</a>, and the upcoming launch is looming so large that multiple game studios have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">delayed their upcoming projects to get out of the way</a>. But why did Silksong take so long to make?</p><p>Team Cherry founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said Silksong was not stuck in development hell or anything like that. The enormous success of the 2017 game--it's sold more than 15 million copies--allowed the Australia-based developers to develop the follow-up at their own pace.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"It was never stuck or anything," Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p><p>Silksong was originally envisioned as an expansion to Hollow Knight, but it became a big enough project to shift to a full, standalone release. That's one of the reasons why it didn't come out sooner.</p><p>As for why Team Cherry went quiet and didn't discuss development updates with fans over the years, Gibson said the team opted not to because, "All we could really say is, 'We're still working on it.'"</p><p>Pellen added: "Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game."</p><p>At one point, Silksong was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially scheduled to launch before June 2023</a>, and Pellen said the team did "genuinely believe" the game would make it out then. But that didn't happen, of course.</p><p>The wait could have been even longer. Gibson said Team Cherry has a development structure that allows its members to "see results fasts," with ideas turning into real elements of the game "almost immediately." That was a fun way to work, Gibson said, but it also presented challenges.</p><p>"I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," Gibson said. "Because I went, 'Everything I'm drawing here has to end up in the game. That's a cool idea, that's in. That's a cool idea, tha'ts in.' You realize, 'If I don't stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.'"</p><p>Silksong will release on September 4 for console and PC, and <a href="https://google.com/search?q=silksong+game+pass+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=silksong+game+pass+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhAMgYIAhBFGDwyBggDEEUYPNIBCDMzNDZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you'll be able to play it at launch via Game Pass. </a></p><p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom this week</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Remember that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/across-the-spider-verse-spider-man-lego-teen-animate-14-1850506788"><span>scene in </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span>: </span><i><span>Across the Spider-Verse</span></i></a> <span>that showed a Lego version of Peter Parker living his best blocky life? If you didn’t know, that segment was animated entirely by then 14-year-old animator Preston Mutanga, who caught the filmmaker’s attention after he recreated the movie’s first trailer in the style of a Lego movie. It’s been two years, and the now 16-year-old Mutanga is still hard at work building scenes and trailers from Lego blocks. His recent projects include making the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaY7pJbYDy8"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl_VFCX_iaM"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> trailers look like something right out of a kid’s toy box, but it’s his latest incredible videos that have really caught my eye: faithful remakes of scenes from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, done in such spectacular fashion that they could have been an official collaboration between Sony, Netflix, and Lego.</span></p> <p><span>Mutanga has uploaded two videos featuring the Lego versions of Huntr/x to his TikTok account. One is a snippet of one of the coolest parts of the movie’s first musical number, “How It’s Done,” which shows the group skydiving down onto a blocky version of Seoul and kicking some demon booty on the way down.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The second is less action-packed but longer, and lets Mutanga add a cute nod to his </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>roots. It’s a scene, maybe a third of the way into the movie, after the demonic Saja Boys boy band has started getting their flirty, sexy demon claws into the hearts and minds of the world. They’ve weakened the Honmoon barrier between the real and demon worlds, and the girls are trying to figure out what to do while maintaining their Kpop girl group cover. Their manager, Bobby, comes in to give them an update on their rivals’ newfound virality, and as he scrolls through videos of the Boys’ fans dancing to their hit song “Soda Pop,” a familiar webslinger briefly appears on his phone.</span></p>   <p><span>Mutanga’s incredible work speaks for itself, but I will say I sure hope someone over at Lego or Sony is ready to give this kid a job when he’s of age.&nbsp;</span></p>
