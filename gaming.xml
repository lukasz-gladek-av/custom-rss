Amid positive feedback, it emerged that the contract that creators had to sign to gain access to the game included a number of clauses that prevented any disparaging comments.</p><p>As streamer and retired professional Overwatch player Brandon Larned, aka Seagull, revealed on X / Twitter, the non-disparagement clause in the contract prevented creators from posting negative reviews, or even comparing it to competitors, such as Blizzard’s Overwatch.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Extremely disappointed in <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MarvelRivals</a>. </p><p>Multiple creators asked for key codes to gain access to the playtest and are asked to sign a contract.</p><p>The contract signs away your right to negatively review the game.</p><p>Many streamers have signed without reading just to play</p><p>Insanity. <a href="https://t.co/c11BUDyka9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/c11BUDyka9</a></p></div>— Brandon Larned (@A_Seagull) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Seagull/status/1789468582281400792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Reaction to this clause was overwhelmingly negative, with developer NetEase coming under fire for its attempt to block even constructive criticism of the game. Now, NetEase has issued an apology for what it called “any unpleasant experiences or doubts caused by the miscommunication of these terms”, and announced plans to revise the contract.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We sincerely apologize for the confusion, suspicion, and frustration caused by these excessively restrictive terms and thank you for sharing with us.</p></div><p>“The Content Creator Program is a small-scale project that aims to aid in the production of incredible content by supporting Creators through giving them more resources,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1789895401723822410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetEase said in its statement</a>. “We actively encourage Creators to share their honest thoughts, suggestions, and criticisms as they play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Every season, <em>Fortnite</em> players can spend their time playing matches and grinding Quests to earn enough XP to unlock every cosmetic in the Battle Pass. This season, however, players claim it’s “almost impossible” to do it without spending real money on Tier Skips, and they’re not impressed. </p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">With <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-new-fortnite-season-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5, Season 3</a> now firmly on the horizon, players only have a couple of weeks to complete their Battle Pass before the new one launches, but as Awesomedogman3 stated on Reddit, it’s proving to be an extremely difficult task to accomplish. </p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">“XP this season is just downright awful,” they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1cq9jwi/xp_this_season_is_downright_awful_and_epic_made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “For starters, doing the three daily match quests doesn’t even give you a full level. In fact, it only gives you 60,000 XP for doing them. Weekly Quests only give you 10,000 XP each… Last season they [were] 10,000 XP [too], but there was also a 30,000 XP one thrown in.”</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">“Epic’s idea to give players more XP [is to] force them to play the other garbage modes, and even then they are as bad, if not worse, than [Battle Royale]’s Quests. They also nerfed playtime XP for all those modes. I am almost certain it is almost impossible to get to level 151 without having to buy levels.”</p> <figure data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Fortnite characters running towards the camera holding guns." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fortnite-fans-name-one-classic-feature-they-want-back-more-than-anything.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Getting XP these days is tough. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">This sentiment was echoed throughout the community, with 2tan2tame saying that “the inclusion of all the other game modes and the XP drop has made me just stop playing,” while Jimlad116 said that after having a baby with his wife, they had previously been able to get through the season pass together but are “not even close to finishing the base Battle Pass this season” and is “honestly considering just quitting the game altogether.”</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">I personally have felt like the Battle Pass has made the game too grindy for a long time, and haven’t purchased one in a long time. Back in the days of Chapter 1 I could easily finish a Battle Pass in a season, but with more frequent seasonal updates, and the additional XP requirements, there’s just no way I’m going to get close. I already have a full-time job, and I can’t commit to playing four hours of <em>Fortnite</em> on top of that just to unlock some cosmetics. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">I understand that the idea of Battle Passes is to keep players hooked and coming back to your game, but there has to be a limit to this, otherwise, people will just give up and stop playing the game. It seems like <em>Fortnite</em> is about to reach that cliff edge, and they may need to pull back before it’s too late. </p>

            <p>Brass-blasting rhythm game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a> honked its way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-deserves-to-toot-its-own-horn">into our hearts </a>when it released in 2022. Since then, it's garnered a dedicated fanbase that have kept its spit-valve full to bursting with creations like this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-final-fantasy-7-trombone-champ-mod-is-pitch-perfect">Final Fantasy 7 mod</a>. Trombone Champ mods are special among rhythm games for consisting of two elements: the button-tapping composition of the song itself, and the background visuals. You honk-tap away while unicorns or giant close-ups of full English breakfasts cavort in the background. Although, if your breakfast is cavorting, you probably want to cook it a bit longer.</p>

<p>One community member, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Gloomhonk/videos">Gloomhonk</a>, has risen to legend status for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">creative and hilarious clips</a>, like <a href="https://youtu.be/Vn06ADuXDnQ">this take</a> on Don’t Stop Believin’ where you enrage the guitarist by bogarting all the solos.

Now, they’ve set their talents to creating custom backdrops for new tracks for players to go bell-to-bumper against each other in this year’s <a href="https://toottally.com/ttcc-2024/">TootTally community championship</a>.</p>
<figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uzxmJQjP8M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The championship - which is soon entering its finals - sees players compete for a crowdsourced prize pool. It’s currently sitting at 1000 USD - enough to buy five of the cheapest trombones I could find and declare sonic armageddon on your unsuspecting neighbours. Or maybe not, maybe they’re cool. Maybe they also own five trombones. Maybe they’ll join in. Maybe you could start the world’s most trombone-heavy ska band. Actually, don’t do that. Just play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059990/Trombone_Champ/">Trombone Champ</a> instead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A second remake of the original Resident Evil is apparently in the works, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cqllq0/danielrpk_a_resident_evil_1_remake_is_in/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, DanielRPK, who proved to be somewhat reliable in the past, revealed on their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/resident-evil-104124284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> that a new remake of the first entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM powered by the RE Engine is now in development.</p>
<p>While DanielRPK did not reveal any additional information on the new Resident Evil remake, @PRE_Atarabiya revealed on X/Twitter that the game will be released in 2026 to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary. Additionally, the user revealed some additional information on the yet-to-be-revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-delayed/">ninth entry in the series</a>, saying that Leon Kennedy will be the main character in the game's introduction and will be 48 years old, as the game will be set in the Summer of 2025.</p>

<p>While a second remake of the original Resident Evil definitely makes a lot of sense, we have to take its existence with a grain of salt until an official confirmation comes in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Square Enix has announced in its financial earnings call that it will be releasing its games as multiplatform moving forward rather than releasing exclusively on one console.</p>



<p>The move to multiplatform is a part of Enix’ new strategy, <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which states</a>, “the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs. Especially in regards to major franchises and AAA titles, including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles.”</p>



<p>Under the same changes to strategy, also outlined is the publisher’s shift from “quantity to quality”.</p>



<p>“The Group will pursue a shift from quantity to quality as its medium- to long-term philosophy regarding the DE segment’s portfolio. To that end, it will first work to establish the optimal portfolio, striking a balance between a “product-out” approach that reflects the imaginations of its employees to the utmost, and a “market-in” approach that leverages customers’ voices and data to inform development efforts. It will strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years.”</p>



<p>The change in strategy has already seen several of its games canceled, which did not align with Square Enix’s new approach.</p>



<p>As the industry continues to consolidate and games become increasingly expensive, it isn’t hard to see why Square Enix would like to broaden the number of platforms it releases its games on. With consoles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> expected to launch in Spring 2025, too, it isn’t difficult to see where Square is going with its new strategy—and it’s a strategy that is likely to be followed across the industry.</p>



<p>What do you think of Square Enix’s new strategy? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <p>Square Enix has released its financials for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, with the results largely below what it had previously forecasted.</p>
<p>As a result, the firm is set to implement a brand new strategy going forward, hoping to achieve "stable profit generation" in its digital entertainment segment by 2027.</p>
<section>
<ul>
<li><a href="#section-1">The numbers</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-2">The financial highlights</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-3">Looking ahead: The new strategy</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<h2 id="section-1">The numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales</strong>: ¥356 billion ($2.28 billion, up 3.8% year-on-year from ¥343 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Digital entertainment sales</strong>: ¥248 billion ($1.59 billion, up 2.6% YoY from ¥245 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Operating income</strong>: ¥32.5 billion ($208 million, down 26.6% YoY from ¥44.3 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Profit attributable to owners of parent</strong>: ¥15 billion ($96.2 million, down 69.7% YoY from ¥49.2 billion)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-2">The financial highlights</h2>
<p>Square Enix's digital entertainment sales were ever so slightly up, mainly thanks to its HD Games sub-segment, the firm said. The solid performances of Final Fantasy 16, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster, Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth saw HD Games sales increase to ¥99.2 billion ($636 million) versus ¥78.5 billion ($503 million) the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, the firm's MMO and Games for Smart Devices/PC Browsers sub-segments both declined year-on-year (11% and 10%, respectively), with the latter in particular seeing new releases underperforming and unable to compensate for weak performances from Square's back catalogue.</p>
<p>The operating losses across its digital entertainment segment were due to higher development cost amortisation and advertising expenses, it continued, as well as "higher content valuation losses versus the previous fiscal year."</p>
<p>Square Enix's results for the year were largely below what it had previously forecasted (for instance, it expected an operating income reaching ¥55 billion and it did ¥32 billion). Back in April, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-takes-140-million-hit-on-cancelled-games">the company had warned investors that its results for the year would be taking a hit</a> due to cancelled projects.</p>
<p>"Operating income, ordinary income, and profit attributable to owners of the parent for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 were below the company’s forecasts primarily due to weaker HD games sales than expected in the Digital Entertainment segment and to the recognition of valuation and abandonment losses associated with its content production account following a close examination of the company’s development pipeline," the company said in its financial report.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Looking ahead: The new strategy</h2>
<p>As a result of this disappointing financial year, Square Enix will be implementing a new strategy going forward, it announced.</p>
<p>The company's previous strategy included a target to rebuild its portfolio across both the HD Games and Smart Devices segments, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-wants-to-slim-down-lineup">streamline said portfolios</a>, and expand its MMO business.</p>
<p>However, it said its journey to "better profitability in HD game development" has been "incomplete", adding: "[We] launched many titles but some failed to live up to profit expectations, especially outsourced titles and some AAA titles."</p>
<p>It also noted a slowdown in SD games, gaps in its management infrastructure, and "cannibalisation of our new titles due to the launch schedule's overlap."</p>
<p>Its new strategy to tackle these challenges is called "Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens" and is a three-year plan targeting long-term growth. The company wants to enhance its productivity and release titles more regularly by "by optimising [its] development footprint," it said. That will involve revamping its organisation, retiring its "business unit-based organisational design."</p>

<p>The company said it will also "aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs." For its SD segment too, Square said it'll be looking beyond iOS and Android, and at PC launches.</p>
<p>It also intends to step up digital sales in order to diversify its earnings opportunities, and further develop its IP across multiple media and markets.</p>
<p>The company is set to "rebuild its overseas business divisions from the ground up," it added. That will involve optimising costs across its European and American offices via "structural reforms."</p>
<p>Finally, the company said it'll be looking into making "strategic investments" to expand into "additional domains."</p>
<p>For the financial year 2025, Square Enix expects to increase its operating income to ¥40 billion ($256 millon), which would represent a 22.9% boost. However, the company forecast that its sales will continue to decline, down 13% to ¥310 billion ($1.98 billion).</p>
<p>It's also intending to achieve "stable profit generation from the overall DE segment and to generate a consolidated operating margin of 15% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027."</p>

            <p>
Square Enix is "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy, including "Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs".
</p>
<p>
The company's new medium-term business plan was shared today alongside its latest financial report, and follows news of both a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">review of its development system</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-abandons-112m-of-in-development-projects-in-an-effort-to-improve-quality">abandonment of £112m of in-development projects</a>.
</p>
<p>
The multiplatform strategy is part of a move to "diversify earnings opportunities" and aims to allow more customers to "enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalogue titles".
</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>
Square Enix's biggest releases in recent years have been console-exclusive to PlayStation, including the likes of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Final Fantasy 16, and Forspoken, with PC releases either alongside or in the pipeline.
</p>
<p>
While no specific games are identified here, it suggests that some of the company's biggest could make their way to Xbox in future - or perhaps Switch 2. At the least, Square Enix's biggest game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-14-new-series-xs-version-tested-vs-ps5">Final Fantasy 14 - made its way to Xbox recently</a>.
</p>
<p>
The strategy will "maximise digital sales of new titles" as well as "pursue initiatives designed to win over PC users" which the company sees as a growth opportunity.
</p>
<p>
The shift to multiplatform also includes mobile games, which will not only release on iOS and Android but potentially PC too. Mobile gacha game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-heading-to-steam">Final Fantasy Ever Crisis is already set for a Steam release</a>.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix will also "leverage IP across media formats", suggesting the likes of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest could be seen more outside of games.
</p>
<p>
The company's new development pipeline will shift from quantity to quality, balancing developer creativity with data from customers and the wider market. AAA releases will be released regularly, while "mid-class titles" will prioritise profitability. As such, it will be "bold" in creating new franchises, to prioritise "novel forms of excitement" balanced with earnings potential.
</p>
<p>
All of this is to focus on creating "unforgettable experiences", marketing talk for good games.
</p>
<p>
So why all this change? It's due to declining profits. The last financial year saw an increase in net sales of games of one percent, but a decrease in profit from games of 38 percent. 
</p>
<p>
Games like Final Fantasy 16, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and the Pixel Remasters boosted sales, but a year-on-year decline in MMO and mobile games plus high development costs accounted for the loss in profit. The £112m write-off also impacted profits.</p>
<p>
No specific sales are given, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has reportedly underperformed</a> despite being the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-fourth-top-selling-game-in-the-us-this-year-but-reportedly-remains-far-behind-remake">fourth biggest game in the US</a> so far this year.
</p>
<p>
Other sectors did fare better: merchandise profits, for instance, had a 51 percent increase in profit. 
</p>
<p>
So what's next for Square Enix? Most imminent is the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Final Fantasy 14 expansion Dawntrail</a>, which will likely provide a boost in profits. As previously reported, it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">most profitable game in the series</a>, while previous expansion Endwalker was so popular the game had to be taken off sale.
</p>
<p>
After that, there is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-pc-version-in-final-stages-of-optimisation-director-says">PC release of Final Fantasy 16</a>, and a presumed PC release of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth following its Remake equivalent.

            <p>There is a Star Wars mod for Helldivers 2 out there and it looks brilliant.</p>
<p>The mod in question was shared over the weekend by ToastedShoes, whose name you may recognise from that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-already-has-a-pokemon-mod">PC Pokémon mod for Palworld</a>. And, while they say it brings Clone Wars to Arrowhead's shooter, there is something about it that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-battlefront-3-dead-as-dice-focuses-fully-on-battlefield-report">makes me think of Battlefront 3, and what that could have been</a>. Hmm...</p>
<p>Anyway, I will bring myself back to the present, and this mod. As you may already have assumed, it is utterly chaotic, with players in Star Wars skins fighting enemies from the franchise such as Droideka and B1 droids. Roger Roger!</p>

</figure>
<p>This marriage of bombastic Helldivers 2 gameplay with a Star Wars makeover honestly works so well. But, while I am itching to give this Helldivers 2 Star Wars mod a go for myself, it is currently not available publicly.</p>
<p>"Right now the mods don't work consistently across all planets and difficulties so we want to iron out the kinks before dropping them," ToastedShoes wrote in a post on social media platform X. However, the YouTuber did state the Star Wars mod will be made available "very shortly", so keep your eyes peeled.</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We will also be dropping the mod pack from this video in its entirety this week over on Nexus Helldivers 2 but ruined with mods<a href="https://t.co/40fmxqQGcW">https://t.co/40fmxqQGcW</a></p><p>Along with that we are planning on releasing the tools we built from the ground up, so you can all make your very own mods</p></div>— Toasted (@ToastedShoes) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1789686363786485784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>"Thanks again for all your support and love! I can't wait to see the entire community enjoying the mods with friends," they closed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can check out ToastedShoes taking the Helldivers 2 Star Wars mod out for a spin in the video below.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has been immensely popular since it burst onto PlayStation and PC earlier this year, but that doesn't mean there hasn't been controversy. Earlier this month, publisher Sony announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers 2 players on Steam would be required to link to a PlayStation Network account</a> - something it said this was always meant to be a requirement for players on PC.</p>
<p>The news was immediately met with intense backlash, which resulted in an influx of negative<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements"> reviews from Helldivers 2 players on Steam</a>. Many <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">asked for a refund</a> as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">Helldivers 2 was pulled from sale in 177 countries</a> where PSN is not available. All of this led Sony to ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">overturning plans to enforce mandatory PSN linking for Helldivers 2 players on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</h2></div><section><p>Square Enix has announced a significant company reboot amid tumbling profits.</p><p>Reporting its financial performance for the financial year ending March 31, 2024, sales in the Digital Entertainment segment, which includes video games, rose by 2.6% but profit fell by 15.8%. This despite the sale of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/foamstars">Foamstars</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>. Specifically on HD games, the subcategory Square Enix uses to encompass all the above games, the company saw a significant operating loss of ¥8.1 billion (approximately $51.9 million).</p><p>Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both launched as PlayStation 5 exclusives, and while Square Enix <em>has</em> announced a sales figure for Final Fantasy 16, it has yet to do so for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the second game in the company’s trilogy of Final Fantasy 7 remakes. In its financial report, all Square Enix would say is it has suffered from an “incomplete journey to better profitability in HD game development”, and that it had “launched many titles but some failed to live up to profit expectations, especially outsourced titles and some AAA titles.” It seems likely Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, at least, is included in that.</p><p>In response to the tumbling profits, Square Enix announced what it calls “Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens”, a three-year plan for rebooting for long-term growth. This involves a rethink across all parts of the business, but the highlight is a “shift to a multiplatform strategy." Square Enix said it will “aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs.” Note the wording here of “Nintendo platforms”, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025">Nintendo set to announce its Switch successor console before April 2025</a>.</p><p>As part of this multiplatform push, Square Enix said it will "build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles." The suggestion in all this is mainline Final Fantasy games will ditch PlayStation exclusivity going forward, although Square Enix has yet to announce specifics beyond Final Fantasy 16's upcoming launch on PC.</p><p>There’s also a shift from quantity to quality, Square Enix said, and a bid to deliver “ensured fun.” Square Enix has been accused of pumping out too many Final Fantasy games in too short a timeframe, so perhaps this means the release of major Final Fantasy games will be spaced out a bit more.</p><p>Overall, it’s a tough time for Square Enix, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-maker-square-enix-takes-140-million-hit-in-content-abandonment-losses-as-it-revises-game-pipeline">which had already absorbed ¥22.1 billion (approx $140.9 million) in what it called “content abandonment losses” ahead of today’s financial report</a>. Square Enix did not name the canceled or rescoped in-development titles.</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-dawntrail"><u>Dawntrail</u></a>, the expansion for ongoing MMO Final Fantasy 14, launches in late June. Square Enix also has <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, the third game in the Final Fantasy remake trilogy, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate"><u>Dragon Quest 12</u></a> in the works.</p><p>In February, Square Enix director and president Takashi Kiryu reportedly told analysts about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-reportedly-overhauling-how-it-makes-games"><u>plans to create a new company structure</u></a> following falling sales in its digital entertainment business, despite the release of Final Fantasy 16 in June. Square Enix said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-sold-3-million-copies-during-launch-week"><u>the PS5 exclusive sold three million copies</u></a> during launch week. A PC port is in the works.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New Call of Duty 2026 and Call of Duty 2027 details might have been leaked by a known leaker.</p>
<p>Although this year's and next year's Call of Duty entries have yet to be officially announced, we might already have some early details on the 2026 and 2027 installments. According to known Call of Duty leaker Tom Henderson, next year's <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoD will be a semi futuristic Black Ops 2 seque</a>l, and as now<a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral/status/1789753516757524538" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted</a> on X by known leaker VISCERAL, Call of Duty 2026 will be a new CoD: Ghosts entry. According to the leaker, this new entry is being developed by Infinity Ward and is currently codenamed "Project Devilwood". In addition, CoD 2027, with codename "Project Anvil", is said to be a new Advanced Warfare title from Sledgehammer Games.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CALL OF DUTY 2026<br>"Project Devilwood" in development at Infinity Ward and will be a Ghosts title.</p>
<p>CALL OF DUTY 2027<br>"Project Anvil" in development at Sledgehammer and will be an Advanced Warfare title.</p>
<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/Vondyispog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Vondyispog</a> <a href="https://t.co/7FCRN0xe02">pic.twitter.com/7FCRN0xe02</a></p>
<p>— VISCERAL (@zvis_ceral) <a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral/status/1789753516757524538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We haven't been able to verify these details, and as such, the information above should be taken with a pinch of salt for now. Since 2015, the Call of Duty series has had a three-year development cycle with Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer trading off development duties. "This fall's game will be Treyarch's first on the three-year development cycle," Activision Publishing former CEO Eric Hirshberg said about Black Ops III during an earnings call back in 2015. "It will be loaded with innovation, and we're excited to share more details with our community soon."</p>
<p>Last month, the leaker posted some additional details about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Splinter Cell Remake</a> from Ubisoft. According to the leaker, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-stealth-ray-traced-reflections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the remake will feature ray-traced audio</a>, and enemies being able to detect the player based on ray-traced reflections.</p>
<p>More details about this year's Call of Duty entry will likely be revealed in the coming months. Late last year we <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered that the game might have a Gulf War settin</a>g.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this 'leak'? Will Call of Duty 2026 indeed be a new Ghosts entry? And what about CoD 2027? Hit the comments below.</p>

            <p>Sony has reportedly formed a new studio made up of former Deviation Games employees.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7190611686209249280/">LinkedIn</a>, former technical director Michael Anthony suggested that the studio is "working on an undisclosed IP".</p>
<p>"All the people I see working there that have signed up are top class developers," he wrote. "I hope that you can create a top class new IP with your studio that hopefully gives you all the time you need to create a quality product and not have to deal with the red tape of previous projects."</p>
<p>It would seem Deviation Games co-founder Jason Blundell is involved with the studio. As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-reportedly-forms-studio-with-former-deviation-games-devs/">VGC</a>, former employee JC Farmer shared on <a href="https://twitter.com/JCbackfire/status/1736852589927702938">social media</a> last December that they landed a job as a junior game designer at PlayStation, adding that they work for Blundell.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Sony for further clarification.</p>
<p>Deviation Games was founded in 2020 by Blundell and Dave Anthony, known for their work on the Call of Duty franchise.</p>
<p>The studio was working on a new IP for PlayStation, as announced at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-elden-ring-highlight-summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest in 2021</a>. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jason-blundell-exits-from-deviation-games">Blundell left the studio in September 2022</a>, with Anthony continuing to lead the studio as CEO and game director.</p>
<p>Deviation Games <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/deviation-studios-reportedly-lays-off-up-to-90-staff">went through a round of layoffs last May</a> in which up to 90 workers lost their jobs. The studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-backed-deviation-games-closes">announced its closure in March this year</a>.</p>

            <p>Some fresh astral god trivia from my accidental molar expedition a few weeks back: each of the Maw's teeth is different. Some form a fractal baleen network of crosshatched layers disappearing backward into the vanishing point; others are shaped like lockpicks, raccoon heads and semi-detached houses. This week's new game releases are no less motley and misshapen, though thankfully not quite as heavily varnished with plaque: there's something in the shop for everyone, I think. </p><!--more-->
<p>Today, the 13th May, we open with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/homeworld-3">Homeworld 3</a>, the long-awaited space strategy-me-do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-review">which Nic has already reviewed and is broadly fond of</a>. It's gracefully accompanied by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131010/The_Land_Beneath_Us/">The Land Beneath Us</a>, a turn-based rogue-lite dungeon crawler in which you tunnel into an underworld inspired by Welsh mythology. 14th May brings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671720/Athenian_Rhapsody/">Athenian Rhapsody</a>, which brazenly describes itself as "a souls-like platonic dating simulator with cooking-mama and WarioWare style battle mechanics". On the 15th, there's android-bisecting boomer shooting from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131010/The_Land_Beneath_Us/">Mullet Madjack</a>, period RTSing from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128860/Men_of_War_II/">Men Of War 2</a>, and  Paper Mario-ish choose-your-own adventuring from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866320/Baladins/">Baladins</a>.</p>
<p>And then, on the 16th, a perfect singularity of little and large, eccentric and mainstream titles in the shape of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674590/Histera/">Histera</a>, a free-to-play PvP shooter in which the arena glitches between time periods, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293910/Read_Only_Memories_NEURODIVER/">Read Only Memories: Neurodiver</a>, sequel to the 2015 hit 2064: Read Only Memories, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/">Ghost Of Tsushima: Director's Cut</a>, the PC port of the open world samurai blockbuster, and Simogo's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/">Lorelei And The Laser Eyes</a>, which sounds a bit like an Agatha Christie story spliced with the Crystal Maze. For an intellectual end to the week on 17th May, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356150/Arcane_Assembly/">Arcane Assembly</a>, a metroidvania in which you program your own spells using a visual scripting language.</p>
<p>Not a bad showing, I reckon! I'll be off on an Exciting Press Trip from Thursday morning - amongst other things, I'm attending the latest Digital Dragons conference in Poland. As ever, you can follow our increasingly baffled and self-defeating attempts at journalism in the liveblog below, and we welcome suggestions in the comments about games or events we've missed.</p>

    Square Enix have published some <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf">financial results</a>, which includes a new "medium-term business plan" in which they will "pursue a shift from quantity to quality". Basically, the last couple of years led to some losses for the company, and they're changing tack. Presumably that means making fewer games. It's all in keeping with what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announces-112m-in-content-abandonment-losses-as-it-seeks-to-be-more-selective">the company said recently about being "more selective"</a>.

"I wanted Helldivers 2 to be so perfect that I absolutely destroyed myself. I abandoned my friendships, I pulled all-nighters. The company wasn't asking me to do that, it was just I cared so much about making it good that it totally consumed me." I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that from everything we know of crunch, it's just as often an unspoken mandate as an explicit ask, but it does sound like a case of genuine passion here.

It included no-nos on:</p>
<p><em>a. Making disparaging or satirical comments about any game-related material, such as game features, characters, or music.</em></p>
<p><em>b. Engaging in malicious comparisons with competitors or belittling the gameplay or differences of "Marvel Rivals" or providing subjective negative reviews of the game.</em></p>
<p>While this is all ridiculous, the "satrical comments" part seems especially irksome. Trying to control the tone of coverage is one thing, but telling people they can't be anything but reverent towards your deriative hero shooter is something else. Anyway, at least they've apologised. For being caught. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Square Enix <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported financial results</a> for the fiscal year that ended on March 31. The results weren't great, as the Japanese publisher narrowly missed the revenue target and majorly missed the operating income target, with the latter also down 26.6% compared to last year.</p>
<p>However, Square Enix also announced today a brand new medium-term business plan that will last through March 31, 2027. The plan's title is Square Enix Reboots and Awakens – 3-years<br>
of Foundation-Laying for Long-term Growth. The key changes compared to the studio's previous plan are an aggressive multiplatform strategy and a focus on quality over quantity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For HD titles, the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs. Especially in regards to major franchises and AAA titles, including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles.</em><br>
<em>In addition, it will also devise a platform strategy for SD titles that includes not only iOS and Android, but also the possibility of PC launches. Furthermore, the Group will strive to maximize the acquisition of new users when launching a title and that of recurring users after starting management of game operation.</em></li>
<li><em>The Group will pursue a shift from quantity to quality as its medium- to long-term philosophy regarding the DE segment’s portfolio. To that end, it will first work to establish the optimal portfolio, striking a balance between a “product-out” approach that reflects the imaginations of its employees to the utmost, and a “market-in” approach that leverages customers’ voices and data to inform development efforts.</em><br>
<em>It will strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As for the multiplatform strategy, it is likely that the commercially underwhelming launches of <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-fell-short-high-end-sales-goal-slow-ps5-adoption-blamed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy XVI</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ff7-rebirth-sales-ffxvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> have finally pushed Square Enix to forego PlayStation exclusive debuts of its premiere franchise. Both games, despite strong critical reception (especially of FFVII Rebirth), failed to sell as much as the publisher wanted, having only been released for PS5. In the future, it's likely Square Enix will strive to launch games day and date on all available platforms.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Square Enix [5,253 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the establishment of a new medium-term business plan covering the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027, which it calls “Square Enix Reboots and Awakens: 3 Years of Foundation-Laying for Long-Term Growth.” <span id="more-882266"></span></p><p>The goal of this business plan is to overcome the challenges faced in its previous medium-term business plan, including low profitability of its high-definition games sub-segment, a slowdown in the games for smart devices and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,057 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> browsers sub-segment, insufficient franchise-by-franchise portfolio <a title="Genres > Management [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and some gaps in Square Enix’s management infrastructure.</p><p>The four pillars of its new business plan are as follows:</p><table><thead><tr><!-- AD: content -->
        <th>Pillar</th><th>Initiative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>(1) <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a> productivity by optimizing the development footprint in the Digital Entertainment (DE) segment.</td><td>Focus on development of titles delivering “Fun” that only the Group can create and build the development structure.</td></tr><tr><td>(2) Diversify earnings opportunities by strengthening customer contact points.</td><td>Shift to a multiplatform strategy.

To that end, it will first work to establish the optimal portfolio, striking a balance between a “product-out” approach that reflects the imaginations of its employees to the utmost, and a “market-in” approach that leverages customers’ voices and data to inform development efforts. It will strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Focus on development of titles delivering “Fun” that only the Group can create</strong><ul><li>With the goal of developing titles that deliver unforgettable experiences to customers and ensure excitement, the Group intends to focus on the following points. First, mindful of the need to launch HD titles that help attract additional fans to the Group, the Group will regularly release AAA titles in its major franchises to maintain and build upon its fan base. In addition, the Group will strive to increase its success rate in SD games by launching a carefully curated selection of titles. It will additionally explore ways to leverage its rich library of IP.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Establish an internal development footprint that brings “Fun” that only the Group can create</strong><ul><li>The Group will retire its business unit-based organizational design and strive to establish an operationally integrated organization with the goal of revamping its internal title development footprint and bringing more capabilities in-house. In addition, while keeping balance between the creativity of its individual employees and the management centered on the organization, the Group will transition to a project management structure. To that end, the Group will redefine the mission for producers and other related employees and organize its internal supporting structure. Also, the Group will improve its development investment efficiency, by reviewing the overall management process of title development.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>(2) Diversify earnings opportunities by strengthening customer contact points</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li><strong>Shift to a multiplatform strategy</strong><ul><li>For HD titles, the Group will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> platforms, <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,019 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox [24,006 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>, and PCs. Especially, in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalog titles, it will build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles. In addition, it will also devise a platform strategy for SD titles that includes not only iOS and Android, but also the possibility of PC launches. Furthermore, the Group will strive to maximize the acquisition of new users when launching a title and that of recurring users after starting management of game operation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Building continuous customer contact points of our titles by stepping up digital sales</strong><ul><li>The Group will strengthen user flow of digital sales of new titles at the time of launch regarding the initiatives of promotion. In addition, it will generate the opportunity of generating revenue in our rich catalog titles’ line-up, which leads to strengthen its earnings base by expanding sales of catalog titles. Moreover, the Group will engage in initiatives which focus on the acquisition of PC users.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Create the interaction with customers by increasing sophistication of publishing function</strong><ul><li>The Group will pursue integrated sales &amp; marketing operations in Japan and make efficiency of publishing by consolidating the marketing functions that were previously spread across creative business units, expanding shared knowledge, and eliminating duplicate functions. Also, it creates a new reporting line in order to enhance collaboration between sales and marketing functions. It will also address the increasing sophistication of marketing by leveraging first-party data, including through the utilization of CRM solutions and data analytics, when developing an ad campaign for HD and SD titles.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Generating the opportunity of new revenue by offering IP across a range of entertainment experiences</strong><ul><li>The Group will pursue a cross-media strategy capable of approaching new markets. Specifically, it will expand area of license business by establishing a new department focusing on IP business development at global markets. In addition, it will build an organization which makes more active use of its IP by offering it across all media formats. The Group also hopes to generate synergies by integrating the organizations affiliated with its Merchandising segment.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>(3) Roll out initiatives that create greater foundational stability</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li><strong>Rebuild overseas business divisions from the ground up</strong><ul><li>The Group has begun optimizing costs at its European and American offices via structural reforms. It will also promote intra-Group collaboration in Japan and abroad and strengthen the functions of its London development site. For example, the Group intends to work to strengthen the close collaboration between its divisions in Japan (creative studios and publishing) and to enable greater mobility of talent between them and the Group’s publishing functions overseas.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Revamp policies on human resource allocation &amp; investment to balance both “creativity and productivity” in Japan</strong><ul><li>The Group will build its flat organization by increasing opportunities of promotion by selection in order to pursue a new talent at our company and streamlining the process of decision-making. Specifically, it will roll out a new human resources system in line with integrated management of development functions, building a new system for hiring, promotion, and appointment of management. Moreover, the Group will rebuild training system for new graduates and introduce internal education programs to enhance capabilities of junior and mid-level employees.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Enhance business infrastructure by implementing PDCA cycle in a timely and appropriate manner</strong><ul><li>The Group will pursue refining its management accounting system that enables greater visibility into business activities. In addition, the Group will not only make infrastructure enhancements that maximize the productivity of its employees under hybrid-working system, but also build its attractive office environment that helps unleash creativity for its development teams.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>(4) Allocate capital giving consideration to the balance between growth investments and shareholder returns</strong></p><p>The Group has formulated a capital allocation policy that gives consideration to the balance between growth investment and shareholder return, earmarking a maximum of ¥100 billion for total strategic investments (growth investments or shareholder returns) over a three-year period.</p><p>As regards growth investments, the Group will carefully select investment opportunities that contribute to the enhancement of corporate value and will utilize insights from its own businesses. It will explore the possibility of undertaking inorganic investments designed to expand its business domains and create greater stability.</p><p>Meanwhile, to reward its shareholders, the Group will issue regular dividends based on a basic policy of achieving a dividend payout ratio of 30%. In addition, in a change from its previous approach to capital allocation, the Group has set aside ¥20 billion for the funding of potential repurchases of its own shares to be executed flexibly between May 14, 2024 and May 13, 2025 based on consideration of factors including strategic investment opportunities, the Group’s financial position, and its share price. The firm has also revised the breakdown of its per-share dividends (interim dividend and year-end dividend).</p><p>Through these initiatives, the Group will strive to further enhance its corporate value.</p></blockquote><p>Further information is available via <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592661.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Square Enix’s medium-term business plan presentation</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you go onto any anime streaming site, chances are you’ve seen anime with wacky titles like <em>Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon</em> or <em>Do You Love Your Mom and Her Two-Hit Multi-Target Attacks?</em> While the titles make them sound like April Fool’s jokes, these are real anime and are part of a popular subgenre known as <strong>isekai</strong>. </p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">In isekai, protagonists are transported or reincarnated into another world vastly different than their own. Seeing the protagonist develop confidence, gain strength, and grow into the shoes of a hero makes isekai anime very appealing to fans of all ages.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">While I couldn’t tell you why so many isekai have odd titles that reveal the majority of the plot, I <em>can</em> tell you what the 10 best isekai anime of all time are.</p>
 <h2 id="h-10-the-devil-is-a-part-timer" data-injectable="false">10. <em>The Devil is a Part-Timer!</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR75Z5KKY/the-devil-is-a-part-timer">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Maou and chiho the devil is a part timer" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="840" data-injectable="true">A light-hearted comedy and reverse isekai, where Satan was forced to retreat through a portal that transported him to modern-day Tokyo. Due to Earth’s lack of magic, Satan and his demon generals lose their powers and are transformed into humans. Satan takes up the name, “Sadao Maou,” and gets a job at MgRonalds (a parody of McDonald’s). Instead of waging war, Sadao and the generals face the struggles of life at minimum wage, while spending their time off figuring out how to return to their world.</p>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false"><em>The Devil Is A Part-Timer! </em>Is an entertaining take on the isekai genre that provides a unique answer to the question, “What if the overpowered characters were transported to our world instead?”&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">9. <em>The Saga of Tanya the Evil</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR9P57W96/saga-of-tanya-the-evil">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="tanya the evil sunshine clouds" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">After an unfortunate death and encounter with a mysterious character known as Being X, a Japanese salaryman is reincarnated into a new, war-torn world as a young girl named Tanya. Hoping to eventually live a life of luxury, Tanya enlists in the military with the expectation that the knowledge from her past life could jump-start her career.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true">As Tanya proves herself to the Empire and rises in the ranks, she strays further from her original goal of living a life of luxury, as being an overachiever gets her assigned into increasingly dangerous combat roles. Tanya’s power is frequently put on display in large-scale, explosive fight scenes with some of the best action animations to date.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">8. <em>.hack/Sign</em></h2> <p data-characters="24" data-current-count="24" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://tv.apple.com/ca/show/hacksign/umc.cmc.8kfw99ey3sbva6lif5ub40lq">Apple TV</a></p> <figure data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt=".hack//Sign cast" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Bee Train</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">Arguably considered the anime that pioneered the MMORPG setting, <em>.hack/Sign</em> was one of the first anime to explore the psychological and sociological subjects surrounding video games.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">After Tsukasa wakes up in an MMORPG known simply as The World, he struggles to remember who he was and how he got into the game. After realizing that he can’t log out of the game, he begins his search for answers. Eventually, he meets the Crimson Knights and their leader Subaru, who—along with several other players—decide to join his investigation, since Tsukasa’s very existence seems to be the key to The World.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false"><em>.hack/Sign</em> paved the way for many popular isekai series, like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-start-watching-sword-art-online-sao-watch-order/"><em>Sword Art Online</em></a> and <em>Log Horizon</em>. While the psychological and slow-burning aspect of <em>.hack/Sign</em> may not appeal to everybody, its role in expanding the isekai subgenre and merging the world of video games and anime has secured its spot as one of the best isekai anime of all time.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">7. <em>Gate</em></h2> <p data-characters="20" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/gate-ce311a68-cf4d-417c-902d-a188af25a6b0">Hulu</a></p> <figure data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="gate elf with rpg" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Hulu</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true"><em>Gate</em> is a balanced blend of both a regular isekai and reverse isekai. Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) officer Youji Itami travels through a mysterious gate into a fantasy world ripe with supernatural creatures and medieval warriors after said beings invaded Tokyo. Youji and his team work to create an alliance with the empire on the other side of the gate and add a diverse cast of fantasy characters to their group along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The humor is, at times, on the mature end of the spectrum, with silly depictions of war between warriors clad in iron armor against attack helicopters, mortar teams, and modern-day assault rifles. But despite its violence, <em>Gate</em> is an appealing isekai that explores a difficult path to coexistence between different worlds.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">6. <em>Overlord</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G69PZ5PDY/overlord">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="overlord ainz and albedo" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">If you’ve ever wondered what it’d be like to be the last player character in a world filled with NPCs (non-player characters), <em>Overlord</em> is the anime for you. But while every world needs heroes to save it, they also need villains to be saved from. Ainz Ooal Gown, an overpowered elder lich, sets out to conquer the world alongside his loyal cast of followers.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">After experiencing all the world has to offer, his final quest is to put his power to the test and see just how OP he has become. <em>Overlord</em> is packed with non-stop entertainment, with lovable characters and some of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-anime-with-op-main-characters/">most ridiculous displays of power in all of anime</a>.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">5. <em>KonoSuba: God’s Blessing on This Wonderful World!</em>&nbsp;</h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GYE5K3GQR/konosuba--gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="konosuba kazuma aqua and megumin" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">By far one of the funniest isekai and anime in general, <em>KonoSuba: God’s Blessing on This Wonderful World</em> follows ordinary protagonist Kazuma Sato as he finds himself stumbling into increasingly dangerous yet hilarious situations. While his party members include a goddess, an un-killable knight, and a famous magician, their contrasting personalities end up being the fuel for most of the series’ conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">Despite having the Adventurer job (class) and being much lower level than his companions, Kazuma ends up being the glue that holds everything together. How he does so is what makes <em>KonoSuba</em> one of the most hilarious isekai anime out there.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">4. <em>Eminence in Shadow</em></h2> <p data-characters="20" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/the-eminence-in-shadow-66f37cf4-dba5-4511-ae26-e4092df1668b">Hulu</a></p> <figure data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="eminence in shadow cid" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Nexus</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">Minoru has always wanted to rule from the shadows. After being reincarnated into another world, Minoru takes advantage of his new life as Cid Kagenou and becomes the mysterious Shadow, leader of Shadow Garden.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Cid amasses followers and tasks them with looking into the rise of a fake group known as the Cult of Diabolos, an imaginary enemy that sounds fitting for Shadow Garden. Unbeknownst to Cid, his imagination influences the development of the world around him. The conspiracies and intrigue actually become real.</p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">Cid’s grandiose lines, and the lengths he goes to be the most dramatic character he can be, makes <em>Eminence in Shadow</em> stand out amongst the typical isekai anime of recent years.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3.<em> Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRGG9798R/rezero--starting-life-in-another-world-">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Re:Zero subaru and emilia holding hands" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">While its cast of bright-haired twin maids and cute creatures make it seem like another cutesy isekai, <em>Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World</em> is quickly filled with death and conflict for protagonist, Subaru Natsuki.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">After being transported to a fantasy world, Subaru is cursed with a power that, at first, doesn’t sound too bad: “Return by Death.” Much like an autosave feature from video games, Subaru’s power becomes a cycle of failure and death, as he learns that this world is anything <em>but</em> a game. Subaru has to learn to make the most out of each resurrection, in order to save the people around him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false"><em>Re:Zero</em> is an isekai that punches above its weight and can hold its own when compared to the most popular anime. While it checks off all of the boxes for what makes a satisfying isekai, it boasts character development and emotional appeal that isn’t always expected from the isekai genre.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GYZJ43JMR/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="That time i got reincarnated as a slime rimuru" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Satoru Mikami ends up being reincarnated as a slime after losing his life. While slimes are typically considered a bottom-tier monster in any fantasy world, Mikami is granted a few unique abilities based on his final thoughts before his death. With his built-in AI-like Great Sage assistant, and the Predator ability that makes him a slime version of Kirby, Mikami—now known as Rimuru Tempest—seeks to be a Demon Lord, the pinnacle of all monsters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">With his newly acquired powers, Rimuru focuses on building a nation of monsters that allows his fellow monsters and followers to have a peaceful place in the world. <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime’s</em> Rimuru ends up becoming one of the wisest and most inspirational isekai protagonists of all time.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">1. <em>Inuyasha</em></h2> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70204995">Netflix</a></p> <figure data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="inuyasha and kagome clouds" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Viz Media</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">Since its anime debut in 2000,<em> Inuyasha</em> can be found in nearly every conversation or online debate over what is considered the greatest anime of all time.&nbsp;High school student Kagome Higurashi is sent back in time to the Sengoku period in Japan to help a half-demon, Inuyasha, recover the shards of a powerful jewel. While at first the two are hesitant to trust each other, Inuyasha and Kagome form a slow-building romance that influences their fates.</p>
 <p data-characters="597" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="false">Whether you’re looking to get into anime for the first time or you’ve been transported into the past and want to experience the classics, <em>Inuyasha</em> is the isekai anime for you. It’s difficult to pin one genre to <em>Inuyasha</em>, since it does everything so well that you’ll often forget that it was an isekai. The animation, though over 20 years old, still holds up wonderfully. The romance between Inuyasha and Kagome rivals that of many other love stories in romance anime, all while treating fans to a decade-long adventure that contains something that every type of anime fan can appreciate.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Our natural fear of the unknown immediately makes us keen on blending Science Fiction with Horror, but the combination isn’t all that easy to pull off. For every <em>Alien,</em> you get ten movies like <em>The Happening</em>, and, well, the <em>Alien</em> sequels. </p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">Here are ten movies that did the formula justice, some of which even pushed the genre forward by adding surprisingly effective, fresh new elements.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloverfield.webp?resize=640%2C360" alt="The statue of liberty's severed head in Cloverfield" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloverfield.webp?resize=640%2C360?w=800 800w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloverfield.webp?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloverfield.webp?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Bad Robot</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Cloverfield (Matt Reeves, 2008)</h2> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Movies about big monsters ravaging through a city rarely fail to entertain, no other did it better than Cloverfield, the only film courageous enough to ask people to experience all the fear and devastation in first person perspective.</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">The found footage genre can go from scarily horrifying to incredibly good at putting you to sleep. After <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, <em>Cloverfield </em>is likely the most interesting attempt at this genre — and one of the best Kaiju films ever made.<br></p>

Instead of a bunch of people who get more than they bargained for by venturing where they shouldn’t, <em>The Myst</em> tells the story of a family just going about their business when their town gets engulfed by a mysterious mist that, you guessed it, is hiding scary things within. </p>
 <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">There’s no lack of cool jumpscares and monster designs here, but <em>The Myst</em> never stops being about family, a family that ends up having to face making a decision that you’ll never forget.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Jeff Goldblum before the accident" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1600 1600w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">The Fly (David Cronenberg, 1986)</h2> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><em>The Fly</em> references in <a href="https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/The_Fly">more popular media</a> are so prevalent that younger audiences might attribute the accidental mix between a person and an insect to a surprisingly popular trope, not a specific film. Still, David Cronenberg’s <em>The Fly</em> is much more than the imagining of one of humanity’s (apparent) greatest fears. </p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Though we tend to remember the scene of the accident and the very gory climax of the film, the entire deterioration of Jeff Goldblum’s character is more than worthy of everyone’s time.<br></p>

Yes, even though it features spooky monsters and scientific concepts are thrown around, those take the backseat to a surprisingly great love story between a regular guy and a mysterious Italian woman. <em>Spring</em> would’ve been an interesting experiment even if it had failed in the daunting task it set out to achieve, but it doesn’t.</p>
 <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false"> It’s heartbreaking that not many people know about this one, and there’s only one way to fix that.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Empty London" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Google Play</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2003)</h2> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">While it’s only natural to think of George A. Romero’s movies or <em>Resident Evil</em> when you think about Zombies, it’s hard to deny how much <em>28 Days Later</em> revitalized the genre.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Running infected were some of the most divisive movie monsters when we first saw them, but now we can all admit they’re much scarier than the classic zombie type. Also, <em>28 Days Later</em> doesn’t just rest upon this update, as it weaves a personal and at some points even heartwarming tale of survival in an outbreak-ravaged England that you’ll never forget.<br></p>

Instead, it masterfully shows the slow descent into madness of a ship’s crew that accidentally strayed off course and has to come to terms with the possibility of never reaching the destination.</p>
 <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">While <em>Aniara</em> doesn’t feature jumpscares, it’s hard to ignore all the existential dread it fills viewers with by constantly giving them new hope and squashing it in front of their eyes.</p> <figure data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="One of the Cube's &quot;contestants&quot;" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1600 1600w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Cube (Vincenzo Natali, 2000)</h2> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="208" data-injectable="false">As far as low-budget sci-fi horror goes, I doubt you can do better than <em>Cube</em> — In fact, some of its darkest aspects are so well-conceived that you’ll have a hard time noticing it was even low-budget. </p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><em>Cube</em> invites viewers to experience a reality where a bunch of people are seemingly put at random into a megastructure composed of cubes that lead into other cubes, some of which feature deadly traps. The movie offers no answers, which helps the incredible violence of <em>Cube</em> feel extremely alien — or something late-stage capitalist humans would totally come up with.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Alien (1979) - Trailer HD 1080p" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4v4Kn0J6E-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979)</h2> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">Ever since the release of <em>Aliens</em>, fans have been arguing over which is the best between the two original <em>Alien </em>films. <em>Aliens</em> fits more neatly in the sci-fi action category, and, as for the main reason why it’s not featured on this list, well, I just don’t think it measures up to the original.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">The original <em>Alien </em>from 1979 set an incredibly high bar for Sci-Fi horror by introducing us to a story equal parts Sci-Fi and Gothic Horror. Unlike <em>Aliens</em>, <em>Alien</em> revels in its buildup, and the moments we spend trying to understand what’s happening and watching the Xenomorph grow are as enthralling as the moments we spend being afraid once this perfect killing machine reaches maturity.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Predator" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1600 1600w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Predator (John McTiernan,1987)</h2> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">If you like the action of <em>Die Hard</em>, <em>Terminator</em>, or even <em>Commando</em>, <em>Predator </em>has that for you, but what sets it apart is a brilliant genre subversion. <em>Predator</em> follows a group of soldiers led by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who are naturally the biggest and baddest dudes in the world — but not in the Universe.</p> <p data-characters="665" data-current-count="970" data-injectable="true">After a mission in which Arnie’s squad kills an entire battalion like it was a video game tutorial, they start dropping one by one in a gruesome fashion. Out of nowhere, what you thought would be another celebration of testosterone, turns into a slasher where the hopeless victims are all badasses you’d think each could’ve carried their own horror movies. On top of all the beautifully well-realized Sci-Fi and Horror crossover, <em>Predator</em> cements <em>Arnie</em> as the greatest action hero of them all by showing how the man isn’t afraid of getting slapped around by something bigger and stronger that forces him to use his wits to come out on top.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Thing's artwork" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=1920 1920w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Universal</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-thing-john-carpenter-1982" data-injectable="false">The Thing (John Carpenter, 1982)</h2> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">What makes <em>The Thing</em> special isn’t the evil shapeshifting alien that hunts down the members of a likable crew one by one — though it features the best practical effects ever seen in cinema history. It’s the sense of dread you cannot shake by having to constantly wonder who’s the monster and who’s just an equally dangerous human on the verge of losing it.</p>
 <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">John Carpenter’s loose remake of Howard Hawks’s <em>The Thing</em> <em>From Another World</em> was a critical and commercial flop upon release, with Roger Ebert <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-thing-1982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeing it</a> as little more than ”&nbsp;a gross-out movie in which teenagers can dare one another to watch the screen”. Still, I believe there’s no better possible laurel for a sci-fi work than coming out ahead of its time, and <em>The Thing</em> was quick to get a cultural reappraisal that propelled it into the podium of sci-fi horror, which it hasn’t left since.</p>

We've compiled together the best times to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-switch-consoles">buy a Nintendo Switch</a> below, complete with every sale you might see a deal at. </p><h2>Best Times to Buy a Nintendo Switch</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/07/switch-blogroll-1656326807534-1656337488233-1660451221826-1667834141044.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h3><p>Like most video game consoles, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday are the best times of the year to buy a Nintendo Switch. Each year, Nintendo has released the same console bundle for Black Friday: a Red/Blue Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundled in for free. While this deal is priced at $299 every year, it is possible Nintendo will discount it further as the Switch approaches the end of its lifetime. </p><p>We've also seen Black Friday deals on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-lite">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, where a free game and discount are bundled together. It is anyone's guess as to what Nintendo will have to offer for Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2024, but we would count on the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle returning for another go around.</p><p>2024 will likely see some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Switch deals</a> ever considering the Switch 2 will be releasing sometime in 2025.</p><h3>Holiday Weekends</h3><p>Another great time to pick up a Nintendo Switch is one of the major holiday weekends in the United States. This includes Memorial Day Weekend, Independence Day, President's Day, and Labor Day. More often than not, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy will host exclusive three day sales, which sometimes can include deals on Nintendo Switch hardware. These discounts usually are locked behind memberships like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-walmart-plus">Walmart +</a> and My Best Buy Plus/Total, so do keep this in mind if you are aiming for the best deals.</p><h3>Amazon Prime Day</h3><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Prime Day</a> is always one of the most popular sales events of the year, and naturally, you can usually find a good Nintendo Switch deal here. In addition to hardware, dozens of games and Switch accessories are always on sale. This makes Prime Day one of the best times to buy a Nintendo Switch, as you can save money on both the console and accessories alongside it. </p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day 2</a>, which takes place in October, also acts as the beginning of the Black Friday deals season. This event usually takes place sometime in October based on past years. So, any major Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals are likely to be available during this sales event as well.</p><h3>Clearance Sales</h3><p>Recently, retailers like Woot have listed Nintendo Switch models for prices we've rarely seen before, sometimes up to $75 off. These deals happen spontaneously, mostly when the retailer is clearing inventory out. To catch these deals as they happen, we recommend following the <a href="https://twitter.com/IGNDeals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Deals account</a> to get notified immediately.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that these same retailers offer open-box and refurbished units at an even lower price, so if you are okay with open-box purchases, consider this as an option. These consoles are certified, which means the retailer has tested and verified the condition of the console. Often, the "Excellent" refurbished consoles are simply open box, with not a scratch on the system itself.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 is Coming Soon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/14/nintendoswitchsymbols2-blogroll-logos-1686770489792.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo Switch is officially seven years old as of March 2024, with its eighth year in the market officially underway. Since console generations tend to last around seven to eight years at the very most, we do expect Nintendo to release a Switch successor sometime within the next nine months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">According to recent reports</a>, Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to feature magnetic Joy-Con, a 1080p screen, and more.</p><p>Since a release date is on the horizon, the price of Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-oled-model">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> are all likely to drop significantly as we head closer to Switch 2. If you are comfortable waiting to purchase a Switch, you can likely score the console at an all-time low towards winter 2024.</p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

 <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/solo-leveling-arise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solo Leveling: ARISE</a></em> puts players in the shoes of both Its protagonist Sung Jinwoo, and a wide array of other hunters as they face the threat of the Gates.</p> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">Although featuring impressive visuals and a unique progression system, the main star of <em>Arise</em> is its fast-paced combat. The latter revolves around precise inputs and incentivizes the use of creative character builds. Players will also find a comprehensive story mode here, which holds tightly to its source material. The mode is the core of the experience and must be played to unlock key mechanics and features. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">9. Honkai Impact 3rd (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/honkai-impact-3rd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em></a> is HoYoverse’s golden child and allows players to take control of more than 70 battlesuits as they fight for all that’s beautiful in the world. Even if still dated for some, its combat can also be seen as the branch upon which <em>Genshin Impact</em> grew. In it, you can switch among up to three characters while performing groundbreaking attacks and being light on your feet. </p>
 <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">The debut of its Part 2 in February 2024 also made the game more approachable than ever. Part 2 brought to <em>HI3</em> a visual upgrade and a new storyline featuring both a fully explorable map and a new main cast </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">8. Reverse: 1999 (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Bluepoch.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">A sleeping hit for many, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/reverse-1999/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reverse: 1999</a></em> puts players in the role of the Timekeeper Vertin in her quest to stop the destruction caused by the Storm. During the story, she will then travel through multiple time periods. Each stop will present you with additions to the main cast and distinct settings. </p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">The game also has in its combat system a huge plus by featuring a mix of card and turn-based mechanics. Its noir feel and intricate character models also help differentiate <em>R1999 </em>from its peers and make it a worthy pick for all. </p>
 <h2 id="h-7-goddess-of-victory-nikke-pc-mobile" data-injectable="false">7. Goddess of Victory: Nikke (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Shift Up Corporation</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="760" data-injectable="true">If you accept the game for what it is aesthetic-wise, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/goddess-of-victory-nikke/"><em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</em> </a>is one of the most approachable gacha games in the market. A courtesy of its above-average pull rates and generous rewards in the early/mid-game. <em>Nikke </em>also sets itself apart by being a shooter and allows you to take squads of up to five characters to the field. Although the game features many idle mechanics, you will need to be present for the best results in certain battles. </p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">The title’s narrative also manages to score big hits when it counts and excels, given its production value. As an extra, <em>Nikke</em> is<em> </em>known for receiving crossovers with many popular franchises. The latest brought <em>Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World’s</em> Ram, Rem, and Emilia to the game. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">6. Arknights (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Hypergryph</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true"><em>Arknights</em> is a highly technical tower defense game where character placement and an understanding of the terrain and enemies can make or break you. Thankfully, the game allows players to apply a multitude of different strategies by picking among its hundreds of Operators. Its narrative is another plus, as it feels engaging and succeeds in doing justice by its cast and making you feel like a part of it. </p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Like <em>Nikke</em>, <em>Arknights</em> can be considered F2P friendly. That can be seen in how select 4-star Operators like Myrtle can perform on par with premium and featured units. You can also clear late-game stages while using only low-star characters. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. Punishing: Gray Raven ( PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false"><em>Punishing: Gray Raven</em> puts players in the shoes of the Commandant of the Gray Raven squad, as they and the constructs under their command fight in the war against the Corrupted. The game is considered a standard, given its polished visuals and fast-paced combat style. The latter of which is focused on performing perfect dodges and well-timed combos. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">Its overall style and the quality of its narrative also cause<em> PGR</em> to be constantly compared to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/nier-automata/">Nier: Automata</a></em>. So if you are a fan of PlatinumGames’ epic and are looking for an engaging narrative, you will feel right at home. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. AFK Journey ( PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Lilith Games and Farlight Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="716" data-injectable="true">A spin-off of the hugely popular <em>AFK Arena</em>, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/afk-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AFK Journey</a> </em>allows players to assemble squads of up to five heroes to take part in many modes. The latter is also where the game shines, as you can find options for fans of open-world exploration, standard PVP, and even roguelikes. As most modes do not demand many inputs, <em>AFK Journey </em>can also be seen as the ideal pick for all looking for a game to run in the background.</p>
 <p data-characters="128" data-current-count="128" data-injectable="false"><em>AFK Journey </em>is the most F2P-friendly name in our list by a large margin given its generous rewards and daily mode availability. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3. Fate/Grand Order (Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Lasengle</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Royalty in the genre, <em>Fate/Grand Order</em> continues to be a solid pick almost a decade after its release. As a branch of the Fate series, the game allows players to control more than 450 Servants as they take part in highly tactical turn-based battles. Players can also deepen their connection with each servant and unlock special interactions and quests by completing various activities. </p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Diving into <em>FGO </em>will demand a lot of catching up. Fortunately, the game’s community is known for being extremely receptive and it’s sure to offer a home to all, newcomers or seasoned masters alike.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">2. Genshin Impact (PS5 / PS4 / PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">The title responsible for shaking up the market,<em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact </a></em>sits at the top as the current flagship of the gacha genre. </p>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><em>Genshin</em> offers the full package to fans by providing an experience rivaling that of most current-gen AAA titles in both visuals and performance. Its open-world style and vast but not excessive cast of playable characters also set it apart as one of the most fun gacha games around for newcomers. On the other hand, its exploration-focused approach makes the game one of the most time-consuming picks on our list in the early and mid-game stages. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">1. Honkai: Star Rail (PS5 / PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">A spin-off/sequel of <em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em> but by all means its own game,<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Honkai: Star Rail </em></a>takes players on a journey across the universe. The game also mixes the exploration/character mechanics that made<em> Genshin Impact</em> such a success with an unbelievably polished turn-based combat system. Those looking for characters will also be pleased, as <em>Star Rail </em>features a roster of more than 40 unique ones. </p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false"><em>HSR’s</em> story is also praised for always delivering in the biggest moments and staying consistent. At the end of the day, <em>HSR </em>improves upon the best of its older siblings to deliver what I believe to be the best gacha experience currently available. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Helldivers 2</em> review bomb campaign players went on before <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-reviews-are-already-looking-better-after-sonys-backpedaling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony reverted</a> the upcoming requirement for a PSN account login inadvertently created a great design for an in-game cape. Now, it looks like that cape may have been brought to life, and players can’t want to get it. </p> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">Over the past week or so, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players have been through a pretty rough series of movements against and then for the game they love. When Sony indicated that a PSN account would be required to play from the end of May, players went on a review-bomb campaign until this requirement was rescinded. After that, a positive review-bombing campaign began, making a pretty interesting pattern on the game’s review stats page.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-arrowhead-reveals-helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-could-be-coming" data-injectable="false">Arrowhead reveals <em>Helldivers 2</em> review bomb cape could be coming</h2> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true">Over the weekend, Arrowhead Game Studios’ CEO Johan Pilesedt shared a cheeky <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1789410993119846721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image of a cape</a> in <em>Helldivers 2</em> that looks suspiciously like the Steam reviews <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-ceo-jokes-about-accidental-cape-design-from-negative-steam-reviews-and-players-want-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image that he joked</a> would make a great cape in the game. Players immediately jumped on the past and began begging to have it in their inventory.</p>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">Users seemingly lost their minds when they saw this and posted amazing replies, like <a href="https://twitter.com/RealRifkin/status/1789407821068743152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Basetrade’s comment</a>, “ID LIKE TO DOWNVOTE THIS POST BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY.” </p> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">The cape would be the second to commemorate the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community. The first was the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-can-claim-a-special-commemorative-malevelon-creek-cape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malevelon Creek cape</a> that every player was given in recognition of the insane number of deaths on the planet and how much players hate fighting on it. </p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">This new cape could mean more, though. It recognizes the power of the community working together not just in the game but outside of it, too. The review bombing was a form of protest, as players aimed to force Sony to reverse its decision to require PC players to have a PSN account.</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true">However, just because a cape may be on the way, it doesn’t mean the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community is done fighting. At the time of writing, 177 countries are unable to purchase the game after it was delisted from Steam. Those countries do not allow PSN accounts, meaning it was impossible for those users to play the game once the PSN requirement was instated. </p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">User G.O.A.T.Gaming replied to this same post, saying, “You promised everyone would be able to play Helldivers, and they can’t. We trusted you!” Pilestedt has explained in multiple social media posts that it would be in Sony’s hands to fix this, but Arrowhead Game Studios is hoping it will be resolved soon. </p>

<p data-characters="241" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since it was initially released, <em>Helldivers 2</em> has always had two enemy factions for players to fight against. While players always suspected more would come eventually, it looks like the Illuminate might be arriving in the very near future. </p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Players in <em>Helldivers 2</em> have noticed hints that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-illuminates-have-popped-back-up-in-an-unexpected-way/">Illuminate faction</a> has been present in the game here and there since its release. However, there’s never been any concrete evidence or enemy unit to point a firearm at and kill. the last few days feel different, though, because the developer has been teasing the faction on Twitter in open conversations with fans. </p> <h2 id="h-pilestedt-is-throwing-around-illuminate-rumors-for-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">Pilestedt is throwing around Illuminate rumors for <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="blue laser illuminate in helldivers 2" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Lifeless’ YouTube channel</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">Arrowhead Game Studios’ CEO Johan Pilestedt has been hinting at the Illuminate from the original <em>Helldivers</em> game over the past couple of days. In response to a call for collaborations alongside a <a href="https://twitter.com/LoopyLewis1990/status/1789402287779004544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phenomenal video that showcases</a> a mod for <em>Helldivers 2</em> that brings <em>Star Wars</em> to the game, Pilestedt said, “Imagine if there was a predator-like alien species in the Helldivers universe that were exiled from the galaxy that were planning vengeance!”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Imagine if there was a predator-like alien species in the Helldivers universe that were exiled from the galaxy that were planning vengeance! 🤔</p>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1789405330104836434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">This is exactly what the Illuminate is. Given their lack of presence in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, it’s assumed that they were eventually wiped out by Super Earth. At least their presence in the local galactic region. That would make them pretty damn cross, and I see them coming back swinging after they’ve licked their wounds a little. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Had the craziest dream that this whole <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Helldivers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Helldivers</a> account linking controversy was revealed to be a marketing ploy by Arrowhead to announce the in-game arrival of the Illuminate, who are attempting to turn Helldivers against Super Earth via social-engineering psiops. It was WILD</p>— ThusKindly (@thus_kindly) <a href="https://twitter.com/thus_kindly/status/1788518071646187863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Pilestedt isn’t the only one with Illuminate on the brain, though. User ThusKindly on <a href="https://twitter.com/thus_kindly/status/1788518071646187863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter shared</a> what reads like a pretty harrowing dream in which it was revealed that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-reviews-are-already-looking-better-after-sonys-backpedaling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN account link war</a> between <em>Helldivers 2</em> players and Sony was actually a marketing ploy with the new enemy faction as the surprise ending. </p>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">But we’ve been down this road before. Previously, Arrowhead Game Studios was served with evidence of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-blue-laser-remarks-fuel-speculation-of-imminent-new-enemy-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blue lasers the Illuminate use</a> on the battlefield being caught in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. That was months ago, though, and the enemy faction hasn’t been seen since. While Pilestedt discussing the enemy doesn’t guarantee it’ll be added in the next update, it does make a story shakeup seem like it’s going to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">At the time of writing, there’s a lovely space at the bottom of the galactic map where a new enemy faction would fit right in. It’s the perfect time for them to appear, too. Players are engaged in a grind to kill 2 billion Automatons for the current Major Order, meaning all of Super Earth’s attention is laser-focused on the top left-hand portion of the galaxy. Not the bottom. </p>

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The first two episodes of<em> Doctor Who</em> season 14, with Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor, were released on May 12, and rather than the Doctor himself, everyone is talking about one character—Maestro. They’re one hell of a villain, but where have you seen that face before?</p> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">It seems that no matter where you look currently, you simply can’t avoid the face of Maestro. The musically talented villain is the undeniable star of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-who-could-be-the-one-who-waits/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjItNGQv4iGAxVTVPEDHXGuCjcQFnoECBYQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw36nDMu5hzpsMg2zdAe-0Ub">The Devil’s Chord</a>, the most recent episode of this season of <em>Doctor Who </em>so far, and they’re actually a pretty familiar face to some people.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">In the show, Maestro is hell-bent on their mission to rid the world of music and keep it for themselves, but in real life, the actor who plays them is as opposed to this idea as it gets.&nbsp;</p>

It’s safe to say that she’s got a serious amount of talent and is noted for her ability to perform off-the-cuff impersonations of celebrities. To date, she has released two studio albums (The Inevitable Album in 2014 and The Ginger Snapped in 2018), so if anyone was perfect for the role of Maestro, it would be her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">However, familiarity with Jinkx is more likely to come from her roles on television. While she doesn’t have an extensive acting career behind her, she was one of the featured drag queens on season five of <em>Ru Paul’s Drag Race</em> back in 2013, winning the season. She came back to the show in 2022, when she took part in season seven of <em>Ru Paul’s Drag Race All Stars</em>, going on to win that too and earning the title “The Queen of Queens”.&nbsp;</p>

She voice acted in an episode of <em>Steven Universe</em>, playing the main antagonist of the episode “ Lars of the Stars”, Emerald. She was also in an episode of <em>Blue Bloods</em>, playing Tallulah, as well as providing her voice as Normulon and Lemongrab in the gender-swapping <em>Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Dying Light (2015) is soaring on Steam amid a monumental sale that has slashed the game’s price tag down to single-digit dollars. This open-world zombie title, which is often considered one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever made, first wowed audiences almost a decade ago with its high-octane parkour mechanics and grisly combat engine.</p>



<p>As Techland has slashed the price to celebrate Zombie Awareness Month, tens of thousands of people have flooded into the game, boasting the player count by around 330%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-undead-rising">Undead Rising</h2>



<p>On Steam, which has readily available player data, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/239140#6m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a peak player count of 39,812 players</a> was recorded in the last twenty-four hours. Last month, that peak player count sat at around 9,049. By contrast, 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human, which was released to a mixed reception, boasts a twenty-four-hour peak player count of around 7,000.</p>



<p>The all-time high for Dying Light on Steam is 45,770, so this special sale almost reached a new record. </p>



<p>For reference, the last time Dying Light scored anywhere close to these numbers on Steam was in February 2022 – when Dying Light 2 was released. Isn’t it funny how that works?</p>



<p>Dying Light is well worth playing, even almost a decade after it emerged. It features an immersive, entertaining story that’ll keep you occupied for a good thirty to fifty hours, and there’s a fantastic option for multiplayer if you want to slay the undead alongside a friend. It was one of the defining games of the last generation and one of the best zombie games ever made, so it’s well worth paying a couple of dollars to get ahold of it.</p>

<p>Players can also expect MyFaction Content which includes an ECW Paul Heyman Manager Card and unspecified MyFaction Superstar Cards when the pack drops on 15th May for all platforms.</p>
<p>You can see a brief snippet of the action in the teaser below:</p> 
<p>Don't forget that the Post Malone and Friends pack – containing Post, Sensational Sherri, Mosh, Thrasher, Honky Tonk Man, and Jimmy Hart Manager – will follow in June and the Pat McAfee Pack is slated to release in July.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-u-turns-on-modder-ban-following-community-backlash">WWE 2K24 recently unbanned a prolific WWE modder following complaints from its community</a>.</p>
<p>WhatsTheStatus - who was banned last week for "violation of terms" - revealed on Twitter/X that, after speaking with 2K and the WWE team, they had "come to an agreement, and a fair one at that". Originally, 2K and/or developer Visual Concepts was unhappy with WhatsTheStatus' mods, saying that as they "negatively impact the game experience for other players", the modder was banned in order to ensure there is a "positive WWE 2K24 experience for all players".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the year’s breakout TV series may be getting more episodes. Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/hiroyuki-sanada-deal-shogun-renewed-season-2-fx-emmys-drama-1235911076/">reports</a> that Hiroyuki Sanada, who produces and stars as Lord Yoshi Toranaga in the once-limited series <em>Shogun</em>, has inked a deal to play the part again in a second season, making it all the more likely a second season will happen.</p> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Keep in mind, season two has not been officially ordered; per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/shogun-season-2-status-strong-chance-1235896010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, this is an “if-come” deal that just secures Sanada’s involvement, should it get greenlit. Though details are still scarce, the events of season two would likely go beyond the events of James Clavell’s novel that the show’s based on, considering how the original season already covered most of it. But really, should they even do that?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">'Shōgun' Star Hiroyuki Sanada Inks Deal To Return For Season 2 As FX Limited Series Mulls Emmy Switch To Drama Amid Renewal Buzz <a href="https://t.co/7v2o503ICw">https://t.co/7v2o503ICw</a></p>— Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) <a href="https://twitter.com/DEADLINE/status/1788954613867229289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <h2 id="h-jumping-off-the-pages" data-injectable="false">Jumping off the pages</h2> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">We know that the character of Toranaga is loosely based on real-life Tokugawa Ieyasu who, you guessed it, went on to become the Shogun of a Shogunate that lasted for over 250 years. Many tales can be told of that time, but that would be missing the point of the show.</p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">Nobody sets out to make a series finale that sucks, but many series still end on notes so low they cause entire fandoms to break down and wonder if they ever really loved the series all that much. See: <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true"><em>Shogun </em>masterfully passed its final test — and definitely not because it ever took the easy way out. <strong>Spoilers ahead:</strong> Though the FX series covers most of the events of the novel it’s based on, it makes the beautifully deliberate choice of ending before the novel does — but not as a way to leave space for a second season.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">While many were expecting the big battle that the series had been teasing ever since the POV character, John Blackthorne, got recruited to help Toranaga because of his naval warfare proficiency, they got one hour of people talking. This ending would spell disaster many-a-show—but that made for a beautifully subversive closer here. <em>Shogun’s</em> finale spends its climax essentially telling the viewer that this was always Toranaga’s show, never Blackthorne’s.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Blackthorne Draws Lord Toranaga a Map of the World - Scene | Shōgun | FX" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClmWZX28ARg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true">When asked about the involvement of shipwrecked sailor in Toranaga’s master plan, the warlord finally admits he only really has Blackthorne around because he finds him funny. Toranaga excelled at war, sure, but what made him so admirable was his ability to win battles even before they were fought. We never see the final battle because it just isn’t necessary. </p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">What matters is that we see Toranaga planting the seeds for his final victory. We spend the entire series seeing Toranaga moving ahead of his enemies, even when everyone and both gods seem to be against him. It was somehow so much more rewarding to <em>know</em> there’s only one way it could turn out than to see it play out in the same overblown CGI bonanza you see in every big blockbuster nowadays.</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">Much like Toranaga’s rivals, the people expecting the big battle were paying attention to the wrong moves, and that’s on us — and his rivals. His victory is inevitable; why drag it out?</p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">What’s on whoever will keep on making the show, however, is the emotional core going forward. Even though they were just pawns in Toranaga’s game of war, many characters that gave their life so that Toranaga could win through the smallest possible amount of bloodshed. These roles were the heart of the show, and I don’t envy the task of filling the gaps they left behind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="302" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s easy to think of the entire fantasy book genre being aimed at children, but that’s just not the case. There are hundreds of fantasy books and series aimed at adults and young adults that will free you from the shackles of grounded reads and help you dream beyond the rules of reality. </p> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">I always loved reading fantasy books growing up because they take you away from the mundanity of everyday life. I can’t say if the best ones blend real life with their fantasy concepts or not because I genuinely love them all and devoured any sci-fi and fantasy I could get my hands on as a kid. However, there are still plenty of fantasy books to dig into as an adult that you probably didn’t come across as a child and make for accessible reads to help you get into the genre. </p>
 <h2 id="h-the-best-fantasy-books-for-adults" data-injectable="false">The best fantasy books for adults</h2> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Below, I’ve listed what I think are the best fantasy books for adults who want to get into the genre or return to it after a long hiatus of living a busy day-to-day work life. I’ve tried to veer away from anything too niche but also include a few books that are the beginnings of a really engrossing series, just in case you’re hooked after the first page and know you need the next dozen novels. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">10. <em>The Hobbit</em> – J.R.R. Tolkien</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="the hobbit best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">To me, if you’re looking to read the best fantasy books for adults, then you can’t go wrong with anything from J.R.R. Tolkien. Author of the incredible <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> series, he’s got a huge backlog of titles for you to delve into if you adore this universe. However, I’d recommend you begin with <em>The Hobbit</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Unlike the movies, this story is fairly short and to the point but extremely gripping. Where the films drew out everything they could, the book is well-paced and follows the original Hobbit on his unexpected journey across Middle-Earth. During this journey, he encounters all manner of fantasy creatures, establishing the very foundations of everything we know about fantasy today. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">Regardless of whether you’ve seen the movies or not, this is a fantastic starting point for a journey into fantasy. If you love it, you can continue on into <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and far beyond. You could <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-lego-the-hobbit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">try the <em>LEGO</em> game</a> if you want to experience the book through a new medium. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">9. <em>A Game of Thrones</em> (A Song of Ice and Fire #1) – George R.R. Martin</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="a game of thrones best fantaasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">If <em>The Hobbit</em> didn’t exist, <em>A Game of Thrones</em> may be the most well-known fantasy book and TV series of all time. It all begins with this first book, where absolutely everything that could go wrong goes wrong. It’s the start of an epic saga that sees one family torn apart by greed, and a world that doesn’t know it’s about to fall to darkness come closer than is comfortable to complete annihilation. </p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">The story follows the Stark family as they enter into the highest level of society and the fight for the Iron Throne that plays out behind the scenes. No one is safe, not even the king, and there’s a threat looming over the world that no one is prepared to even admit exists. Winter. </p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="774" data-injectable="true">What I love about this first book in an entire series that could all be the best fantasy books for adults is how well it introduces every character, setting the tone for what’s to come. You get to know a colorful cast of genuinely interesting people who have all found themselves somewhere in the royal court that extends around the entire region where it’s set. There’s political drama on a global and local level and some of the best lines you’ll ever read. </p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">Don’t go into this if you can’t take losing your favorite characters, though. This series as a whole is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-episode-is-the-red-wedding-in-game-of-thrones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty brutal</a> and will absolutely not hold your hand while you grieve. It delves into the darkest parts of the human heart in a world where power is everything, and you must do whatever you can to seek it. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">8. <em>The Gunslinger</em> (The Dark Tower #1) – Stephen King</h3> <figure data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="the gunslinger best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><em>The Gunslinger</em> is the first book in <em>The Dark Tower</em> series, all of which are great fantasy books for adults, but it can be read in isolation and enjoyed without needing to continue through the full set. It follows a lonely character who equates to a fantasy cowboy on a journey of vengeance to find one man. This man has been evading him for a long time and has the ability to twist the minds of those around him, but this cowboy is more than capable of looking after himself.</p>
 <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">This book does a fantastic job of setting up the series and makes you fall in love with some really well-realized characters. Everyone the protagonist has a meaningful relationship with becomes a friend to you as the reader, and you end up missing them when the story moves on. </p> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">If you like a bit of dark fantasy but not too dark, this is the perfect book for you. It doesn’t require you to read all about tentacled monsters and flying whales, but it does invite you into a desolate world that’s intrinsically linked to ours and tells a tale of reluctant fatherhood that will have you rooting for everyone involved as they trudge ever onward. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">7. <em>Neverwhere</em> (London Below #1) – Neil Gaiman</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="neverwhere best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller, and <em>Neverwhere</em> is one of his most underappreciated books. I first discovered it as an audio drama created by the BBC, which is a great way to consume this fantasy book for adults, and was hooked on London Below from that point. the universe feels similar to Fallen London but takes a much more literal approach to its translation of the surface world. </p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">The story follows a young man who innocently helps a young girl one night, only to be transported from Earth into London Below. This underground version of the city twists it in whimsically dark ways that make it feel oppressive at first but also somehow welcoming and charming after a while. </p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">It’s a fantastic read and a great way to get into the universe. I’d say it’s probably better if you have at least some level of knowledge of the city of London because some of the characters and locations and their twists might be lost on you without any. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">6. <em>Outlander</em> (Outlander #1) – Dianna Gabaldon</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="outlander best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="764" data-injectable="true">You might know <em>Outlander</em> from the impeccable Amazon Prime show. If not, you’re in for a treat once you’ve read this amazing fantasy book for adults. While the series is close to historical fiction, it’s all framed through a fantasy tale of a woman falling through time without any real knowledge of how she did it. She must find a way to exist in a time when women hold no power and any woman with an ounce of intelligence is treated as a witch. </p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">I adore the setting for this book and the rest of the series: Scotland in the 1700s. It takes a beautiful country and transports you to a time when it was as lush and green with a reasonable amount of civilization as it has ever been—before the English came in and ruined it all. </p> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">Through this book and the series at large, you’ll learn so much about the history of England and Scotland, but it’s the love story between Jamie and Claire that will stick with you. Fair warning: pretty much every book has a few adult scenes, so if that’s not the kind of thing you’re after, maybe skip this one. </p>

The first book here follows a police officer who, standing guard at a crime scene all night, notices what appears to be a ghost dog. This leads him into a world filled with mystical wonder and starts him on a path you don’t expect when you join the force. </p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">What I really enjoy about this book and the series at large is how it blends folklore into modern life without it ever feeling jarring. If you enjoy this entry, there’s so much more for you to dig your teeth into. It’s also quite a fresh series in terms of when it was published, so it’s got loads of modern tropes that will help you really get lost in it. </p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="715" data-injectable="true">This series can really bridge the gap between standard fiction and the best fantasy books for adults out there. Author Ben Aaronovich has worked on a number of popular TV shows and is brilliant at bringing stories to the table that are self-contained but add to a wider story arc without making you feel like you’ve missed something. </p>

It’s hard to tell what the story is from either, and that’s partly because it’s completely bonkers. It’s set in a rich fantasy world that’s thick with lore from centuries of history. Every event is fueled by something that happened in the past, and it makes the whole thing feel like you’re exploring a culture more than reading a book. </p>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">What makes <em>The Drowning City</em> one of the best fantasy books for adults is how dark some of its subject matter is. Each location is so vivid that I felt like I was walking down their streets or getting pulled into the canals by their ghosts. the</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">I really can’t tell you much about this story without needing to add context that will spoil the plot. What I can say is that you enter the titular location as a newcomer alongside the protagonist and learn all about the magic and politics of the local region as she does. It’s so much fun to explore and is part of a trilogy that you could go on to read if you like a bit of dirty fantasy. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">3. <em>The Golden Compass</em> (His Dark Materials #1) – Philip Pullman</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="the golden compass best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">Before the TV adaptation was created, I wouldn’t have included <em>The Golden Compass</em> in this list of the best fantasy books for adults. However, I believe that the show opened a lot of people’s eyes to how dark the world that Philip Pullman created really is. </p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">In this book, you enter into a world where human souls stand by their side as creatures that can change shape until they hit puberty when they settle into one form. What starts out as a tale of children disappearing quickly morphs into one that spans entire dimensions, leading to a war between worlds that’s worthy of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. </p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">The best part of this book, in particular, is its characters. Each one is beautifully flawed and feels like a firm friend you’ll never forget. The book brings them all to life from mere words on a page, and I think any book that can do that is worth your time, regardless of your age. </p>

This follow-up is smaller in size but much broader in scope. It’s set in a star system where the people of each planet have different roles within the stellar society and explores what happens when one society seeks to overthrow and take control of another. </p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">This series only consists of two entries, but they’re gripping and explore the fantastical side of sci-fi that sees humanity intertwined with elements of the universe in a way I’ve never seen explored before or since. That’s why they’re some of the best fantasy books for adults you could hope to read. </p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">At the heart of the plot is a love story that’s probably one of the easiest to understand and identify with, how your weaknesses and strengths can complement someone else’s. It’s beautiful in its own way, a small time investment, and a couple of books you won’t regret picking up. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">1. <em>14</em> (Threshold #1) – Peter Clines</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="14 best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="776" data-injectable="true">I went into <em>14</em> expecting to be reading something along the lines of <em>Silent Hill 4: The Room</em>, but I was so, so wrong. While it treads the line between sci-fi and fantasy, I think it fits more into the fantasy genre because it’s more of a mystery book about an apartment building and a group of people who all take the oddities they notice about it as a given, and don’t ask questions. That is until one of them starts poking around and makes a startling discovery. </p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">This book is part of a series that’s connected, but you don’t need to read in order. That’s why I love it. If you enjoy a good mystery thriller with twists that are so out of this world you’ll never see them coming, this is a fantastic book to pick up first. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="false">The fantasy elements lean quite heavily on the work of H.P. Lovecraft. So, if you’d rather avoid the tentacled region of fantasy, give this a miss. I will say that it does a great job of not being anywhere near as vague as some of those old horror novels and won’t scare you so much as it will get your adrenaline going. Especially in the final chapters. </p>

<p>Despite the rumblings, Sucker Punch isn’t working on a Sly Cooper game, according to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>Earlier today, rumors began to swirl following Giant Bomb’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPtzkxO0Ges&amp;ab_channel=JeffGrubb%27sGameMess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Grubb’s video</a> “Perfect Dark and Summer Game Mess update”, where Grubb speculated that Sucker Punch could be working on a Sly Cooper game, which is causing Ghost of Tsushima 2 to take a long time to release. Speculating on Sly, Grubb said, “That’s speculation, but it’s definitely smoke out there, but maybe where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”</p>



<p>Grubb’s comments and speculation subsequently started to make the rounds on Twitter, with some users representing the information as fact. However, Bloomberg’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1789694171176984792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Schreier</a> swooped in on the rumor to debunk it.</p>



<p>“No truth to this one, sorry to say. Sucker Punch is a one-project studio. The reason Ghost of Tsushima 2 isn’t out yet is because AAA video games now take 5-7 years to make. (Also, Sucker Punch is smaller than most other AAA game developers)”, he said.</p>



<p>As for if Sucker Punch will ever make another Sly Cooper game remains to be seen, but at the moment, the team is entirely focused on the next Ghost of Tsushima game.</p>



<p>The last mainline Sly Cooper game to be released was Thieves in Time in 2013 by Sanzaru Games. Despite the game featuring a secret ending alluding to a future installment, Sanzaru issued a statement in 2014 that the studio was not developing a new game in the series.</p>



<p>Do you think Sucker Punch will ever do another Sly Cooper game? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p data-characters="262" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Local Game Stores are becoming increasingly difficult to find as the world shifts to digital storefronts. Luckily for those living in remote areas or whose favorite store closed down, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has a thriving online player base across many platforms. </p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="189" data-injectable="false">Many popular platforms take the (excuse the pun) magic from the tabletop to the internet. Each accommodates a variety of game modes and features which makes some more appealing than others.</p> <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">Player preferences are primarily formed around three criteria:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false"> <li>Game modes (Ex.

Wizard of the Coast’s <em>Magic: The Gathering Online</em> was the primary platform for players who wanted to play Magic over the internet.&nbsp;But for many paper<em> </em>players, paying for an additional digital collection of cards simply wasn’t affordable. </p>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false"><em>Cockatrice</em> launched with the promise of a completely free-to-play Magic experience online, a promise that has held up to this day.</p> <figure data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="magic the gathering mtg cockatrice board" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">As time has passed, so too have the technology and capabilities of the internet. While <em>Cockatrice</em> still receives support and occasional updates, the interface is dated and the client feels like a chat room from the early 2000s. Setting up and playing on <em>Cockatrice</em> has gotten easier over the years, but can still be off-putting to some players.&nbsp;</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">3. <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo"><em>Magic: The Gathering Online</em></a><em> </em></h3> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">In 2002, Wizards of the Coast launched <em>Magic: The Gathering Online,</em> which could be considered a pioneer of online card gaming. While heavily criticized for its in-game economy and numerous bugs, MTGO has managed to stay alive despite facing many competitors over its two-decade lifespan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Unlike <em>Cockatrice</em>, MTGO provides <strong>gameplay automation</strong>, meaning instead of arguing with your opponents, you can blame the computer for everything (and you will). At any point in time, MTGO can be described as a buggy but complete experience. For those who don’t mind the costs associated with a digital collection, there isn’t a more comprehensive platform for playing Magic online.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="mtg online duel scene" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>

 <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="161" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, MTGO is only available in English and on Windows PCs.

Arena is a vast improvement over Wizards of the Coast’s first child, MTGO. The UI has been modernized and the game rules engine was built from the ground up and is written in a way that allows for endless development.&nbsp;</p>

For people new to Magic, Arena is the place to be. While other options mostly cater to people already familiar with MTG, Arena provides a tutorial, helpful tooltips, and beginner decks to introduce beginners to various mechanics.</p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the future of paper MTG was unclear. <em>SpellTable</em>, previously known as <em>VirtualEDH</em>, was quickly developed as a way to keep the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-commander-in-magic-the-gathering-mtg/">Commander game mode </a>alive (since Commander had limited online support at the time).&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">Within months of its inception, <em>SpellTable</em> joined Wizards of the Coast and was able to expand support to all formats. <em>SpellTable</em> maintains the authentic paper MTG experience by utilizing a mobile phone or webcam and a good ol’ tabletop surface. Over time, the developers have enhanced the app with features that create a sort of “paper Magic 2.0” feeling.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re looking to make a little bit of money on the Marketboard or simply want some more storage space to avoid your inventory filling up in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you’re definitely going to need a retainer or multiple. Here’s how to get them, including how extra retainers work.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Hiring a Retainer in <em>FFXIV</em> doesn’t only bring with it access to the Marketboard or extra storage – hiring a Retainer and training them up through ventures will allow them to head out on their own adventures, returning with materials or items which can then be used or sold. Don’t worry if this all sounds a little daunting, I can help you figure it out.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-hire-a-retainer-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to hire a Retainer in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Retainer Vocate options in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Before you can hire a retainer in FFXIV, you’ll need to have completed the level 17 MSQ quest “The Scions of the Seventh Dawn.” Then you’ll be able to pick up the side quest, “An Ill-Conceived Venture”, which unlocks Retainers. You must do this side quest in the same city state in which you started (Limsa Lominsa, Gridania or Ul’dah).&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">The quest is always given by an NPC called Troubled Adventurer and can be found in the following location in each state:</p>

 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve hired a retainer, you’ll be asked to design them using the Character Creation menu that you used to create your own character, then give them a name. Once this is done, you can access the Retainer service by interacting with any Summoning Bell.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="54" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">Once you do this, you’ll have the following options:</p> <figure data-found-rows="12" data-current-count="1100" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Option</strong></td><td><strong>What it means</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Entrust or withdraw items</td><td>Opens the retainers inventory, allowing you to transfer items from your own inventory for storage.

These can be obtained in a variety of ways, such as with Wolf Marks, GC Seals or in return for certain types of Tribal Quest currency.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">Depending on the class or Job applied to the Retainer, the options given when assigning a venture may vary, but in general, there are three different types of venture to which a Retainer can be assigned:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"> <li>Job specific (Hunting, Mining, Botany or Fishing)</li> <li>Field Exploration (Usually takes 18 hours, costs 2 Ventures)</li> <li>Quick exploration (after the Retainer reaches level 10, takes one hour, costs 2 Ventures)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="false">While Field Exploration ventures take a lot of time to complete, they’re excellent in terms of helping your Retainer level up as they reward far more experience. However, Quick Exploration ventures allow you to gain more items, including gear, much more quickly. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2Xql8H">Wrestling is a huge part of Mercedes Varnado’s career, having gained notoriety as Sasha Banks for the WWE before crossing over as Mercedes Moné for the AEW. But her fans may not realize she is also a huge <em>Sailor Moon</em> fan. The professional wrestler, who recently jumped to acting for <em>The Mandalorian</em>,  has a deep appreciation of the classic magical girl fantasy anime based on Naoko Takeuchi’s 1992 manga. Fans of both wrestling and anime know she donned a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SashaBanksWWE/comments/sm264k/sasha_banks_sailor_moon_attire_royal_rumble_2022/">Sailor Moon-inspired outfit</a> during the 2022 Royal Rumble. So it’s no surprise that she’s openly campaigned <a href="https://comicbook.com/anime/news/mercedes-varnado-sasha-banks-wwe-sailor-moon-live-action-movie-role/">to play Sailor Jupiter</a> in a live-action adaptation of Sailor Moon, if that ever happens.</p>
<p id="QUXy3C">Polygon caught up with Varnado during this year’s Crunchyroll Anime Awards, so naturally we had to ask: Given her love of the anime, which sailor scout does she think would make the best professional wrestler? </p>
<p id="edFpPc">“I would say Sailor Mercury,” Varnado told Polygon. “She’s such a badass; she has such a good attitude. I feel like Usagi would always be a little late to the ring, she would probably slip during her matches a little bit.”</p>

<p id="rSt7Au">Introduced in the eighth episode of Sailor Moon season 1, Sailor Mercury is the first Sailor Guardian that Usagi discovers and the first to join her cause fighting the forces of the nefarious Queen Beryl. Mercury’s true identity is Ami Mizuno, a shy bookworm with an abnormally high I.Q. who is known for her talent for mathematics and computers. Though initially timid, Ami goes on to become the chief strategist of the Sailor Scouts and has a positive, resilient attitude whenever faced with a challenge. </p>
<p id="WqEw15">The 1992 <em>Sailor Moon</em> anime would go on to run for a total of five seasons. The series’ combination of tokusatsu-inspired action and romantic melodrama is credited with revolutionizing the genre of Magical Girl anime, with the combined popularity of the anime’s assorted home releases and films contributing to the comic’s status as one of the best-selling Japanese manga of its time. In 2014, Sailor Moon was later adapted into another anime series called <em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em>, in commemoration of the series’ 20th anniversary. <em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em> is a reboot of the original anime that more closely follows the story of Usagi Tsukino and co. as it was told in Naoko Takeuchi’s original manga.</p>
<p id="BKiIGE">Aside from the series’ popularity, however, Sailor Moon has had a major impact on fans (particularly girls) who grew up watching the anime, and that includes Varnado herself. “I still go back and watch <em>Sailor Moon</em> to get my life lessons, to get my energy,” Varnado told Polygon. “So she still inspires me to this day.”</p>
<p id="cGAUYN"><small><em>Sailor Moon</em></small><small> is available to stream on Hulu. </small><small><em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em></small><small> is available to stream on Crunchyroll.</small></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="214" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re a fan of cozy farming games like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, a new one has hit the scene with an adorable and strangely familiar art style, a historic setting, and a deadly twist — <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em> is a project created by&nbsp;Unwound Games and originally funded through backing on Kickstarter. The project reached its funding goal within 90 minutes of launching on the site, raising almost $30,000 USD in order to develop the game, which was released fully on Steam on April 29, with a price tag of $19.99 USD. It has gone on to have Very Positive reviews, though not without a few complaints, which I’ll get to later.</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">The art style of <em>Plum Grove</em> is a delightful reminder of <em>Paper Mario</em>, with 2D characters roaming around a 3D world containing 2D elements. It almost feels like a stage, with cardboard props that can be hidden behind or interacted with.</p> <figure data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Cemetary, showing the art style of Echoes of the Plum Grove" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false"><em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em> is set in what I can only assume is colonial New England, judging by the fashion and the method by which you end up there in the first place. After a disastrous voyage in which everyone else perishes, your character washes up on the shores of <em>Plum Grove</em>, gains a farm and sets off to build relationships with locals, explore the world and progress the story.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="866" data-injectable="true">As for the deadly twist, unlike other games of this type, the villagers around you age, get sick, and even die after you’ve grown close to them. It’s kind of heartbreaking to get to know your neighbors, build relationships and then watch them get Smallpox and die, but you do get some closure by being able to attend their funerals. You can also kill your neighbors with items such as Death Cake, but I’m not sure why you’d want to. There are also ghosts who roam the land.</p>
 <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">If you don’t disable aging, your character will eventually die, so it’s a good job to head out in search of romance, marriage, and, eventually, a child. In fact, considering the fact that this is colonial New England and disease is rife, it might be a good idea to have a whole host of children because once you die, your story will continue through them. You can either experience pregnancy (as a male or female character, <em>Plum Grove</em> doesn’t want to strip that experience from anyone) or adopt children.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Settings menu in Echoes of the Plum Grove" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">If you don’t want to face death during your playthrough, you have the ability to disable this (as well as disease) in the settings of the game, which is nice. <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove </em>also allows you to turn off the fishing minigame and disable things like hunger, energy and taxes. Yes, you have to pay taxes in <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">As with other cozy farming games, such as Stardew Valley, Echoes of the Plum Grove has its own events calendar, including events such as a Bake Off and a fishing festival. Speaking of fishing, the minigame is actually vaguely fun, something which shocked me as a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/youll-never-hear-me-admit-it-but-i-enjoy-fishing-in-stardew-valley/">long-time fishing minigame hater</a>. Upon hooking a fish, you just need to follow a path using your mouse until you catch up to the fish creating the path. Again, if you don’t want to do this, you can turn the minigame off in the settings and simply catch anything you hook, but where’s the fun in that?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Events calendar in Echoes of the Plum Grove" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true">There are some complaints that hold weight from players. There aren’t a lot of options when it comes to character creation, but once you’ve begun to play, you can visit the tailor’s shop to expand your wardrobe. The tools are flimsy at best and repairing them is not only expensive but time-consuming. You can’t repair them yourself, so your only option is the Blacksmith in town, who takes a whole in-game day to fix anything.</p>
 <p data-characters="551" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">The biggest complaint that players have so far, myself included, is how <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197969286163/recommended/1536090/">grind-centric</a> <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em> is. You don’t get an axe to begin with, though you can purchase one from the Blacksmith, so the only initial way to get wood is by shaking trees around the map, of which there aren’t many. Despite this, recipes call for a staggering amount of resources. The main story can also only be progressed with a rather large stockpile of wood, as well, so you’re going to have to make a choice between crafting and actually progressing.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The hag in Echoes of the Plum Grove" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="false">With that said, there are a lot of things to enjoy about <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em>. The locals are interesting, especially the local hag who quests you with insulting 20 people. She’s my favorite. You can get married, have children and forge a lineage through them. You get to explore not only the living world but also a crypt filled with ghosts who want to pass on to the other side. If you’re in a cozy game lull and don’t mind a grind, <em>Plum Grove </em>is a good option.</p>

<p data-characters="241" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Stardew Valley </em>is filled with quests to complete and secrets to find, some of which unlock new areas to explore. One of these new areas, the Witch’s Swamp, not only unlocks new sights but also new features. Here’s how to unlock it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Before you can trigger the quest that unlocks the Witch’s Swamp, you’ll need to have either completed the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-community-center-guide/">Community Center bundles</a> or the Joja Warehouse tasks. Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to wait for a cutscene in the Mountains to play one night after you retire to bed.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-dark-talisman-in-stardew-valley" data-injectable="false">How to complete Dark Talisman in <em>Stardew Valley</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Wizard in Stardew Valley" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">After the Mountain cutscene, you’ll receive a letter from the Wizard in the mail. His ex-wife, also known as the Witch, has some magic ink in her house that needs to be retrieved. Unfortunately, you can’t just rock up to the Witch’s Hut and ask for it back – you need to find the Dark Talisman first, which will grant you access to the Swamp.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">To complete the Dark Talisman, you’ll need to first talk to Krobus. He can unlock a door within the Sewers that leads to the Mutant Bug Lair. Head inside, and you’ll find the Dark Talisman after battling through, as the name suggests, some mutant bugs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve got the Dark Talisman, head north to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-does-a-train-is-passing-through-mean-in-stardew-valley/">Railroad area</a> and find the cave in the top right corner. You’ll be able to place the Talisman on the artifact blocking the entrance and proceed through the cave.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">Make sure to take some Void Mayonnaise with you when you enter the Swamp. You’ll need to give it to the Witch’s Henchman, completing another quest called Goblin Problem and allowing you further into the Swamp. Head into the Witch’s Hut and you’ll find the magic ink on a table, which you can pick up and return to the Wizard to complete Dark Talisman.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-to-do-at-the-witch-s-swamp-in-stardew-valley" data-injectable="false">What to do at the Witch’s Swamp in<em> Stardew Valley</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/witchs-hut-inside.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Shrines inside the Witch's Hut in Stardew Valley" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/witchs-hut-inside.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/witchs-hut-inside.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/witchs-hut-inside.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/witchs-hut-inside.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">There are a few things that you can do once you’ve gained access to the Witch’s Swamp. There are a couple of fish there, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-the-movie-theater-in-stardew-valley/">Void Salmon</a> and Catfish.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>iPhone users without a penchant for jailbreaking can finally enjoy the blocky polygons and shifty textures of the original PlayStation with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgamma-game-emulator%2Fid6499106870">Gamma</a>, a free PS1 emulator that hit the iOS App Store last night. Gamma comes courtesy of developer ZodTTD, which has been creating emulators for the iPhone since the earliest days of third-party iOS apps.</p><p>The app has both iPhone and iPad versions with support for Bluetooth controllers and keyboards, as well as customizable on-screen controller skins. It uses Google Drive and Dropbox syncing for backing up your game files and save states (those are the snapshots you can save at any time and reload, a little like pausing your game — great for old-school games that don’t let you save any time you want). Like the Delta emulator that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150467/delta-emulator-apple-app-voice-notes-ai-vergecast">ruled the App Store’s top free apps list for weeks</a> before being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147206/this-is-krispy-kremes-finest-hour-on-the-app-store">unseated by free donuts</a>, the app will also go grab game cover artwork for you automatically.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A screen recording of a game running on the Gamma emulator." loading="lazy" decoding="async"

will.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Gamma</cite></p></div></div><p>Thankfully, Gamma doesn’t require you to go find any BIOS files to run PS1 games. That said, I had trouble running the first two games I tried — <em>NASCAR 98</em> and <em>Shrek Treasure Hunt. </em>But that may have just been the game files I was using, as I could run <em>Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee</em> just fine. Third time’s the charm, right? </p><p>According to Gamma’s App Store page, it collects identifiers that can be used to track you, and may collect location and usage data. For what it’s worth, the app didn’t trigger a location data access request for me, nor did it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data">prompt me for tracking permission</a> (though it did do so for my colleague, Sean Hollister).</p><p>Benjamin Stark, aka ZodTTD, has been around the block. Stark pointed out to <em>The Verge</em> via email that Delta developer Riley Testut’s first iOS emulator, GBA4iOS, borrowed code from an emulator Stark had made called gpSPhone (something Testut <a href="https://rileytestut.com/blog/2013/08/06/the-biggest-beta-test-in-ios-history/">wrote about in 2013</a>). But even that app, Stark said, was based (with permission, he added) on gpSP, an Android emulator created by a developer called Exophase. </p><p>That tradition continues with Gamma, which Testut told <em>The Verge</em> via email is “based off Delta’s codebase (excluding the actual PSX core),” adding that “ZodTTD has my full permission to do that.” Testut said Stark is “the reason I started developing emulators in the first place.”</p><div><p>Stark also developed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-05-30-turbografx-16-emulation-hits-the-iphone.html">TurboGrafx-16</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-12-23-somewhat-playable-n64-emulator-released-for-jailbroken-iphones.html">N64 emulators</a> for the iPhone in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Later, he had a run-in with Google when the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-30-android-playstation-emulator-psx4droid-pulled-from-market-finge.html">pulled his app PSX4Droid</a>, also a PS1 emulator, from the Android Market in 2011, at a time when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-05-29-android-markets-most-popular-emulators-disappear-without-a-trac.html">Google was removing</a> many of the most popular emulators from the online store. He <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-04-07-zodttd-makes-psx4droid-3-0-free-claims-google-booted-him-from-a.html">later made the emulator freely available</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-04-08-playstation-emulator-for-android-goes-free-and-open-source.html">open-sourced the code</a>. </p></div><p><em><strong>Update May 12th, 11:36AM ET: </strong>Added additional context and details shared by Gamma developer Benjamin Stark.</em></p><p><em><strong>Update May 12th, 2:10PM ET: </strong>Added comment from Delta developer Riley Testut.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
