			<p>The price of the PlayStation VR2 headset has been permanently cut in all regions, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/a-great-new-price-for-playstation-vr2/?sf276497679=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> today.</p>
<p>From March, the virtual reality headset will be available for $399.99 / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980. The Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle, which includes the headset, the Sense controller, stereo headphones, and a voucher code for the Horizon Call of the Mountain game, will also be available for the same price. The lower price also makes it a more enticing buy for those looking for a PC VR headset, as the PlayStation VR2 headset can be used on PC with the adapter that was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-system-requirements/">last year.</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation VR2 launched two years ago but failed to significantly impact the market, mostly due to its high launch price, which has essentially stayed the same until now, not counting temporary price drops and deals. Still, the high price was worth it for VR aficionados, as the headset delivered a next-gen VR experience that is significantly superior to that offered by its predecessor, as Kai highlighted in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 headset had a lot to prove to justify a cost higher than that of the base PlayStation 5 console needed to operate it. The hands-on test confirms that this is how next-gen should look and play in virtual reality with an experience unlike anything else in the HMD space. Every aspect of the first PlayStation VR has been improved (aside from Cinematic Mode largely remaining as is) with no expense spared for comfort and design. This is the sort of revolution in virtual reality that can showcase not just the experiences that are fun to play but also those that can take advantage of the next-generation console’s power.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has announced that it's giving most of its staff the day off on Friday, and while a concrete reason isn't stated, it's almost certainly because that's the day on which&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>comes out.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, a notice on the Japanese Pocketpair X account states that the studio's bosses have been receiving "mysterious" messages from staff, who claim they'll be "unwell tomorrow".</p>

<p>Pocketpair then says that because it's expecting a large volume of employees to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">call in mysteriously sick on Friday</a>, it's decided to give the majority of its staff the day off. However, the studio also says that updates for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and <i>Craftopia</i>&nbsp;will be unaffected by this holiday.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pocketpair-palworld.jpg?itok=m-gZo3Mr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pocketpair-palworld.jpg?itok=wVW-pyUi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is probably what a lot of Pocketpair employees will be seeing on Friday.</figcaption></figure><p>As Automaton points out, Pocketpair actually did the same thing back in 2022 for the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>release date, so it's clear the studio understands just how badly its staff is going to want to play these massive, time-consuming epics.</p>

<p>It looks like Pocketpair isn't the only one that wants to play&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, either. The game's first open beta, which took place in November, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam records</a> for the franchise, and that's including fully-released games.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of, er, monster-hunting action RPGs.</p>

<p>Taking place in the dusty Forbidden Lands, the game features a greater emphasis on storytelling, as well as the classic epic struggles with giant monsters you've come to know and love from the series.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>for yourself when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th (i.e. tomorrow).</p>

<p>If you want to prepare yourself for the game, you can take a look at its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-global-release-timings" rel="nofollow">global release timings here</a>, and make sure to read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">our own Tyler's review</a> to find out what he thought of&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618705/pokemon-legends-z-a-chikorita-tepig-totodile-battles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Like its predecessor, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> </em>is bringing back three classic starter pokémon to get you started on your next adventure.</p><p>Though <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>will likely introduce a number of new creatures, Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile will be the first three partner pokémon you can choose between as you journey into the depths of Lumiose City. The starters were the stars of the <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>teaser The Pokémon Company debuted during this year’s Pokémon Presents. Details about the game are still sparse, but we now know a little bit more about how its battles will work.</p><p>Like other <em>Pokémon </em>games, you will be able to fight wild pokémon found throughout certain areas, but rather than just launching attacks turn by turn, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>will require players to think strategically about the range moves have and where their monsters are on the battlefield. The video — which focuses on how moves can have different effects and levels of damage depending on a pokémon’s position on the field — makes <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s battles look a bit like fighting in <em>Diablo</em>. </p><p>The video also emphasizes how, because the game is set entirely in Lumiose, many of the areas where wild pokémon can be found are special locations like alleys and rooftops, where the creatures are learning to cohabitate with humans. Like in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a></em>, players will be able to catch monsters <em>without </em>battling in some cases by simply throwing pokéballs at them from a distance.</p><p>That mechanic, in particular, should make the game feel much more fluid than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet, </em>but we won’t know for sure until <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>debuts for the Switch family of systems sometime later this year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From the trailer, we've seen it will definitely include both Mega Evolution and Terastalization, and the reveal suggested it will canvas all different types and eras of Pokemon battles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Pokemon Champions will connect with Pokemon Home, allowing players to transfer Pokemon from all other games to battle in it and finally giving fans something to do with the hundreds of Pokemon just sitting in their boxes from past generations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon Champions is "now in development" for both Nintendo Switch and mobile, but did not get a release date. It will be playable in Latin American Spanish at launch in addition to other languages previously available in Pokemon games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon Champions appears to be the same as Pokemon Synapse, a game that first leaked last year as part of the larger "Freak Leak" that saw tons of internal Game Freak info drop online, including unreleased games, meeting notes, Pokemon designs, and more. At the time, the most firm details we had were that it was being co-developed by Game Freak and ILCA, while everything else seemed to be a work-in-progress and a bit speculative. Those who looked into the leak suggested it was a multiplayer game of some kind and some compared it to Splatoon, but that comparison seems to have been slightly off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything else we saw at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced">today's Pokemon Presents right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Luimiose City is undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment plan" that aims to turn the city into a place people and Pokemon can share together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Pokemon Legends: Arceus, players will run around big open spaces and encounter Pokemon they can run into and try to catch or battle to weaken. However, battles will be a bit more advanced this time around. Moves now have shorter and longer reach and an area of effect, meaning position is very important. Mega Evolution will also be part of this game and can change the tide of battle at any time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There also seems to be a lot of verticality in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, as the player is seen zooming up to the top of a building, exploring rooftops, and even jumping from building to building.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon live in places called Wild Zones, which appear to be gated by level or something similar, and this is where the majority of your encounters seem to take place.

Decisions, decisions.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What can you buy with 7,000 PokéCoins?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">To make things easy, here’s a breakdown of what 7,000 PokéCoins can get you in Pokémon GO right now:</p><p><strong>Pokémon Go Shop Boxes</strong>Box NamePrice (PokéCoins)What’s InsideSpecial Offer?</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Explorer Box</strong></td><td>5,250</td><td>20x Super Incubator, 30x Egg Incubator</td><td>39% off</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Voyager Box</strong></td><td>6,500</td><td>100x Lucky Eggs, 50x Star Pieces</td><td>50% off</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Starter Box</strong></td><td>100</td><td>10x Pinap Berry, 1x Lucky Egg, 30x Poké Ball</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Beginner Box</strong></td><td>150</td><td>15x Poké Ball, 5x Great Ball, 1x Lucky Egg, 1x Super Incubator</td><td>One-time only</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Pokémon GO Individual Items</strong>ItemPrice (PokéCoins)What It Does</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Remote Raid Pass (x3)</strong></td><td>525</td><td>Join Raid Battles remotely</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Premium Battle Pass (x3)</strong></td><td>250</td><td>Raid or get premium Go Battle League rewards</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Super Incubator</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Hatches eggs 33% faster</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Egg Incubator</strong></td><td>150</td><td>Hatches eggs (3 uses)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lure Module (x8)</strong></td><td>680</td><td>Attracts more Pokémon to a PokéStop</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Incense (x8)</strong></td><td>250</td><td>Lures wild Pokémon to your location</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Item Bag Upgrade</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases storage by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon Storage Upgrade</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases max Pokémon capacity by 50</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Pokémon GO Upgrades</strong>UpgradePrice (PokéCoins)What It Does</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Item Bag</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases max item storage by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon Storage</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases max Pokémon capacity by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Postcard Pages</strong></td><td>100</td><td>Increases max saved Postcards by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Team Medallion</strong></td><td>1,000</td><td>Lets you change teams (once per year)</td></tr></tbody></table><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had 7,000 PokéCoins burning a hole in my trainer bag, I’d probably go straight for the Voyager Box at 6,500 coins. It’s a ridiculous deal with 100 Lucky Eggs and 50 Star Pieces at 50% off, meaning I’d be set on XP boosts and Stardust bonuses for months. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If raiding is more your thing, stacking up on Remote Raid Passes (525 coins for three) is a solid move if you want to farm Legendaries without leaving your couch. And for anyone who’s perpetually running out of space (guilty), throwing a couple of Pokémon Storage and Item Bag upgrades into the mix would make life way easier.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Claim three free Pokémon in Pokémon Go</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re grabbing this PokéCoin deal, you might as well snag some free Pokémon while you’re at it. Right now, Pokémon GO is offering a <strong>triple code reward</strong> that gives you <strong>Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus</strong> at no cost. To claim them, log in to your Pokémon GO account on the <strong>Pokémon GO Live website</strong> and enter the following codes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Tornadus:</strong> 4RD3GGA4ZMEGP</li><li><strong>Thundurus:</strong> 4Q4UZLY6MUH9K</li><li><strong>Landorus:</strong> 9PTA874LYDAJH</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

Sadly, the game doesn't really give you all the information that you need. Managing your inventory can also be an arduous task, leading to a bit of confusion.</p><h3 id="How_to_craft_traps_and_tranquilizers">How to craft traps and tranquilizers</h3><p>Here's how to make traps in Monster Hunter Wilds:</p><ul><li>Purchase a Trap Tool from the Provisioner NPC at any base.</li><li>Go to your tent to craft either a Pitfall Trap or a Shock Trap:  <ul><li>Pitfall Trap: Requires 1x Trap Tool and 1x Net - You can craft a Net by using 1x Ivy and 1x Spider Web.</li><li>Shock Trap: Requires 1x Trap Tool and 1x Thunderbug Capacitor.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Before you head out, make sure you have multiples of any tranquilizer-type item as well.

You'll notice this once you see a notification at the right-hand side of your screen telling you that you should use traps. You'll also see the creature limping away to another location. Follow it and, in most cases, you'll see it resting due to its injuries.</p><p>Place a trap nearby and attack the monster once. Move near the trap to lure the creature toward you. Once the trap has been activated, use several of your Tranq Bombs via your item pouch until the beast is incapacitated.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Once a creature has been weakened it's important that you dismiss any <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-ai-companions-sos-flare-guide/1100-6529744/" data-ref-id="1100-6529744"><strong>AI companion</strong></a> that's with you on a quest, since the damage that they deal might kill the monster instead.

The difference between this process and slaying a creature is that you won't get to carve its carcass. Also, the vast majority of main quests simply require you to "hunt" or "slay" beasts. You wouldn't need to worry about capturing creatures alive except in certain missions that have this particular requirement.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how to trap and capture monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds. </p><p>Need more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?

As such, you must remove AI companions from your squad to prevent them from accidentally killing your target. You can do this by pressing the Start button -&gt; Missions &amp; Quests -&gt; Support Hunter Info.</p><p>You may also reselect the SOS Flare action from the radial menu.

The trailer also played into nostalgia by showing sequences of the popular N64 game Pokemon Stadium, which was all about battling. Pokemon Champions is an extension of this legacy and now allows players to do battle on Switch and mobile devices against each other, wherever they live, thanks to the internet.

		<p>The Ukraine-based developers behind the acclaimed Metro series have announced La Quimera, a brand new sci-fi shooter set in a world created by Nicolas Winding Refn and E.J.A. Warren.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>La Quimera (which translates to The Chimera in English) takes players to a Latin American megalopolis with a lush jungle setting, casting you as a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier caught up in the battle between rival factions. All you really have is a customisable exosuit that enhances your mobility and abilities in combat, alongside sci-fi energy weapons, those robot dogs and other drones. The intention is to combine the tense gunplay of the Metro series with in-depth storytelling from this new setting.</p>
<p>You won’t have to go it alone, with La Quimera featuring support for up to 3-player co-op through the story.</p>
<p>From the trailer and imagery released today, there’s a great look to this game, both on a technical level, and stylistically. There’s a classic Killzone vibe to seeing enemy soldiers with the glowing eyes on their armoured masks.</p>

<p>“Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series,” said Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn. “We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.”</p>
<p>La Quimera is coming from Reburn, the studio formerly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/4a-games">4A Games Ukraine</a>, while the 4A Games brand, 4A Games Malta studios and the Metro series all remain with Embracer Group and its publishing label Plaion. Reburn is a team of over 110 developers that previously worked on that Metro series, with a wealth of experience going back through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>, Metro: Last Light and Metro 2033, and even back to the founders working on the original STALKER. La Quimera’s development is being led by Sasha Kostiuk, who served as gameplay and AI designer on Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light.</p>
<p>While the setting will be completely different, let’s look back at this team’s most recent work. Metro Exodus released in 2019, taking the post-apocalyptic tale out on the tracks to head across Siberia. Nicole scored it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">an excellent 9/10</a>, saying, “Metro Exodus provides an immersive FPS experience that marks a new milestone for the franchise. Its survival-horror, sandbox and shooter elements are remarkably well balanced, constituting an engaging and thrilling game that’ll leave you no stranger to a good jump scare. The once linear horror franchise has been reformed, introducing expansive environments to indulge in without derailing the narrative. Metro Exodus is a must play.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, 4A Games Ukraine made two big announcements: one, it's being rebranded to Reburn; two, it is developing a new cooperative sci-fi first-person shooter game called La Quimera.</p>
<p>First things first. Metro fans were probably puzzled by the aforementioned sentence, just like I was when I got the news. Let's clarify things right away, then. Following the beginning of the political instability in Ukraine, dating all the way back to 2014, part of the team at 4A Games moved to Malta. Back then, both studios still worked together on Metro Exodus.</p>
<p>After the launch of Metro Exodus in 2019, 4A Games Malta and 4A Games Ukraine were both big enough to handle projects separately. A few months later, the Malta office <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games-new-world-interactive-and-four-more-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired by Embracer</a>, while the Ukraine office remained independent and received unrelated investments to make its own IP, which would become La Quimera. The studios are effectively separate now, as reflected in the rebrand, although they are both allowed to use the 4A Engine seen in Metro titles.</p>
<p>Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series. We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.</em></p>

<p>The game is set in a Latin American megalopolis and lush jungle environments. Players will step into the customizable exosuit of a down-on-his-luck PMC (Private Military Company) soldier battling rival factions. The world and story of La Quimera were written and created by movie director Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon) and E.J.A. Warren. Combining Latin American folklore with advanced weaponry and technology, La Quimera will be playable in single-player mode or with up to two friends in co-op for a total of three players.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRoLav0VCYk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Reburn promises that fans of the Metro franchise will enjoy the familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling mixed with new gameplay experiences through unique and highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons. There's no release date yet, but Reburn said more about the game will be revealed in the coming months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Games has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Games' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=1KNYrj3i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=ALSsfXh4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the next project from Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games).</figcaption></figure><p>Rather impressively, Reburn says it's working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn for the "world and narrative" of&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>. Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>It's likely that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">two AAA titles</a> that 4A Games is apparently working on for its parent company Embracer Group, with the other presumably being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metro-exodus-developers-still-working-on-next-game-despite-war-in-ukraine-sdk-released" rel="nofollow">next game in the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

There were updates on <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, a new season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, and a totally new multiplayer gameplay: <em>Pokémon Champions</em>.</p><p>While the reveal was light on the specifics,<em> Champions</em> appears to a game focused solely on battling. Players will be able to import their pokémon from <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> or <em>Violet</em>, Pokémon Home, and other games into<em> Champions</em> to use in battles against players around the world. There are restrictions, however, on the pokémon you can use. The fine print says that not every pokémon available in Home and elsewhere will be available in <em>Champions</em> and those obtained in <em>Champions</em> cannot be ported back to Home.</p><p>It seems like <em>Champions</em> is a gamified version of the online battle simulators competitive <em>Pokémon</em> players use to test team composition and monster builds. The Pokémon Company was specific in that the game is coming to “the Nintendo Switch family of systems,” indicating this game might make an appearance on the forthcoming Switch 2. It’s also coming to Android and iOS.</p><p><em>Pokémon</em> is a very malleable franchise, able to fit a wide variety of game genres that The Pokémon Company seems keen to experiment with.

(Anybody remember <em>Pokémon Conquest</em>, the strategy RPG that was essentially Pikachu meets <em>Nobunaga’s Ambition</em>?) With <em>Pokémon Champions</em>, The Pokémon Company has found yet another way to reach gamers outside of its core games.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ukraine-based independent games studio Reburn have just announced a new shooter, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a>, which I would summarise as Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> playing kiss-chase in the near-future jungles and neon sprawls of Latin America. It’s got world and narrative writing from Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn, and is playable in single player with three-person co-op support. Here’s a trailer.

Who are Reburn exactly? Apparently, they’re a rebrand of former Metro developers 4A Games Ukraine, with 110 people on the books including “lead gameplay designers, artists, sound engineers, programmers, and more from across the entire Metro series”. The project lead is  Sasha Kostiuk, who was gameplay and AI designer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a> and Metro Last Light and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus">Exodus</a>. Reburn’s CEO and founder is Dmytro Lymar, previously director and CEO of 4A Games Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
While all this may seem quite cut-and-dried, there’s actually scope for some confusion about who and what is or isn’t 4A Games. I asked the PR for clarification and have now been educated. To briskly recap, 4A Games began life in Ukraine back in 2006, working on Metro 2033. In 2014, a portion of the team split off to found a new studio in Malta in response to political instability in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The two studios retained close connections, however, agreeing to share the 4A Games trademark and 4A’s engine technology. They collaborated on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>. Then, in 2020, celebrated mass-redundancy peddlers Embracer bought 4A Games Malta. Around about the same time, 4A Games Ukraine got funding for an original project, La Quimera. Now, they’re working on it as a wholly separate outfit - though they’re keen, naturally, to cash in on their association with the Metro series.
</p>
<p>
Returning to La Quimera, it casts you as “a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier” with a customisable exosuit. “Fans of the Metro series will enjoy familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling combined with new game experiences through unique and highly detailed environments, characters and weapons,” comments the release.</p>
<p>My thoughts right now are 1) I get the gentlest frission of Gears Of War’s squad narrative from the quieter parts of the trailer, and 2) those guns are so wildly overfaceted I can’t decide which bit is the business end. It’s like they were crafted from Rubix cubes. The greebling appears to be eating the wielder's hands. I dread to think what graphics card adverts look like in La Quimera’s cyberpunk future.

So far, three mainline Metro games have been released, with the most recent one being 2019's Metro Exodus. A VR spin-off called Metro Awakening also arrived last year.</p>

                <p>Velan Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/midnight-murder-club/" data-ref-id="5000-633798">Midnight Murder Club</a> will be taking hide-and-seek into some lethal places on the game's new early-access launch date, March 13. This first-person shooter places 1-6 players on equal ground by forcing them to explore Wormwood Manor in complete darkness except for their flashlights and the flicker of light when a gun is fired. But things are going to get even wilder with two new gameplay modes.</p><p>Within Midnight Murder Club's new Wildcards mode, the battle royale in the mansion is upended by cards that can rewrite the laws of reality around them. When players pick cards from their collection, they can given special abilities like super speed or the power to self-detonate upon death. Some of those powers will extend to the other players in the match as well. At the end of each battle, players are given new cards to experiment with as they embrace the chaos around them.</p><p>The Guest Pass Edition doesn't change the actual gameplay like the Wildcards mode, but it does let additional players join in even if they don't own a copy of the game. As long as at least one person owns Midnight Murder Club, they can invite five other people to play the game for free. Presumably the Guest Pass Edition will also be available with the game's other modes, including Free for All, Thief in the Night, Team Deathmatch, and Headhunters.</p><p>Players can purchase the full game for approximately $20, and the Guest Pass Edition will be available on day one for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

            <p>Pokémon Presents arrives each year on the 27th February to celebrate the original release of Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green in Japan and give fans a glimpse of what The Pokémon Company is up to.</p>
<p>This year we finally got a look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> gameplay, as well as the brand-new Pokémon Champions mobile and Switch game. There's also plenty coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>, and the cute Netflix show Pokémon Concierge will return.</p>
<p>The presentation was a bit light on details, but with next year being Pokémon's 30th anniversary, we can likely expect a bigger celebration in 2026.</p>
<p>Here's everything shown at this year's Pokémon Presents.</p>

<p>The big announcement we were all waiting for came at the end of the presentation, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-wont-arrive-until-late-2025">first look at Pokémon Legends Z-A gameplay</a> (presumably <em>not </em>running on a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>). Set in the Kalos region's Paris-esque Lumiose City, it continues the action-RPG style from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-arceus-walkthrough-guide-missions-objectives-8039">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> but now in an urban setting.</p>
<p>The city is undergoing a high-tech urban redevelopment plan so humans and pokémon can live in harmony, with inner-city Wild Zones to catch 'mon in real time. There will be a new style of battling based on positioning and timing; Mega Evolutions will be included; and your first partner pokémon will be a choice of Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile.</p>
<p>It's set for release in late 2025, potentially teeing up a battle with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.</p>

<p>Now in development for the Switch "family of systems", plus iOS and Android, Pokémon Champions is a brand new game focused solely on Pokémon battles, with the aim of bringing them to a global audience to be enjoyed by everyone. Not much was shown but the battle focus sounds similar to the old Pokémon Stadium games. It will connect with Pokémon Home too, so you can use your caught Pokémon from the likes of Pokémon Go, or Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It's being developed by subsidiary The Pokémon Works (with Game Freak overseeing).</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-fourth-expansion-releases-really-really-soon">new booster pack for the mobile trading card game will be added tomorrow</a>, 28th February. It's called Triumphant Light, is headlined by Arceus EX, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-leaks">unfortunately its existence leaked yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>What <em>is </em>new, though, is that Ranked Matches will be added at the end of March for those into the competitive battle scene. Further, Mega Evolution is also coming in 2025, with Mega Lucario EX and Mega Gardevoir EX cards shown.</p>
