            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's a big year for Dying Light; the open-world zombie series is celebrating its tenth anniversary, and developer Techland is marking the occasion with a variety of projects. That includes a newly detailed audio and visual refresh for the series' debut instalment, which arrives in a free update - titled Dying Light: Retouched - this Thursday, 26th June.
</p>
<p>
"One of the best things about working with your own engine is that the people building it are just next door," Techland <a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26">explains over on its blog</a>. "Over the past couple of years, we've added a lot, customised a lot, and learned how to squeeze more from the tech we already have. One day, someone just started applying those learnings to some old assets - and it just clicked that we could do that across the whole game."
</p>
<p>
As such, players can expect the likes of increased texture resolution and quality, as well as improved lighting and physics based rendering. Techland also promises a new 8K Ultra shadow quality ("a lot of surfaces that previously looked rather flat now really pop out and get depth!", it writes), and there's an increased maximum level-of-detail option for those with hardware to support it, meaning Dying Light's most detailed assets can now be seen much further away.

<p>
As far as audio goes, original composer Paweł Blaszczak has remastered Dying Light's soundtrack for the update, while new tracks and ambient sounds have been "woven in" throughout. That's alongside "seriously juiced up the hit reaction audio in combat", which is said to sound "more satisfying [and] more impactful."
</p>
<p>
Techland does, however, take great pains to stress - over the course of three whole paragraphs, in fact - that Dying Light's Retouched update is all about "enhancements" and is "not a complete overhaul or remaster." Additionally, the "level of changes" players can expect will "vary by platform".
</p>
<p>
Dying Light: Retouched launches Thursday, 26th June for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Notably absent from that list is the original Switch, and Techland has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-retouched-update-isnt-coming-to-nintendo-switch-as-techland-denies-plans-for-switch-2-port">confirmed to IGN</a> the update is "not coming" to Nintendo's platform, which received an impressive port of Dying Light back in 2021. Don't expect a version of Dying Light for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> either, as Techland says it has "no plans [to release one] at this moment."
</p>
<p>
It's apparently all-hands-on-deck for the studio's upcoming 18-hour standalone adventure, Dying Light: The Beast, which launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 22nd August. And there's more planned for the series beyond that; Techland <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-teases-multiple-unannounced-dying-light-projects-including-board-games-and-a-webcomic">previously revealed it's working on "multiple unannounced projects"</a> that "go beyond video games", including board games, a webcomic series, merchandise, and "more".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-is-removing-over-20-games-including-hades-and-monument-valley-123023128.html"><em>Engadget</em></a>, Netflix is removing over 20 games from its mobile library next month. The list of titles on the chopping block includes heavy hitters like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hades/hades-review-the-highs-and-lows-of-repetition">Hades</a>, the Monument Valley series, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/deaths-door/deaths-door-review-reaping-the-rewards">Death’s Door</a>.</p><p>On July 15, 22 titles, which require a Netflix subscription to play, will exit the service. Some games, such as Hades, were only available on mobile devices through Netflix, so it’s unclear if they’ll become available on other mobile storefronts. Although July 15 is the removal date, some titles will disappear before then (such as Hades, exiting on July 1). Here’s the full list of games making their exit:</p><p>Battleship<br>Braid, Anniversary Edition<br>Carmen Sandiego<br>CoComelon: Play with JJ<br>Death’s Door<br>Diner Out: Merge Cafe<br>Dumb Ways to Die<br>Ghost Detective<br>Hades (available only on iOS)<br>Katana Zero<br>LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed<br>Ludo King<br>Monument Valley<br>Monument Valley 2<br>Monument Valley 3<br>Rainbow Six: SMOL<br>Raji: An Ancient Epic<br>SpongeBob: Bubble Pop F.U.N.<br>TED Tumblewords<br>The Case of the Golden Idol<br>The Rise of the Golden Idol<br>Vineyard Valley</p><p>Netflix’s entire mobile library consists of 114 games, which means roughly 20 percent of its library is disappearing. While this isn't the first time games have been delisted from the mobile library, these removals come as some question Netflix Games' long-term future.</p><p>Last October, Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-has-closed-its-aaa-gaming-studio-133014946.html">shut down its triple-A game development studio</a> in Southern California, leading to the departures of several high-profile talents only a few months after the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-games-engagement-tripled-in-the-last-year-in-part-thanks-to-gta">expressed optimism</a> about its games division. In January, the company <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-abandons-release-plans-for-6-games-including-tales-of-the-shire-dont-starve-together-and-compass-point-west/">canceled plans </a>to bring previously announced titles to the service, including Thirsty Suitors, Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, and Don't Starve Together. In February, &nbsp;Netflix <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">laid off staff</a> at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, which it acquired in 2021. The streaming giant has even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663933/netflix-black-mirror-bandersnatch-kimmy-schmidt-removal">scaled back on interactive programming</a>, removing shows such as <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em>. &nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/25/netflix-is-delisting-over-20-games-from-its-mobile-library-next-month-including-hades]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> is, by most measures, an authentically promising-looking game. You get to build your own Jurassic Park, a dream we’ve all had at some point or another while succumbing to our own hubris. This time around, the series is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simulating 75 dinosaur species</a> across generations, with traits both beneficial and pernicious getting passed on to dino-youths. There are “distinct female, male, and juvenile variants” with “unique social needs” and “brand new behaviors.” All that painstaking effort, and yet developer Frontier was planning to take the easy way out with non-prehistoric park partners – until recently.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this month, prospective players noticed an AI disclosure on <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em>’s Steam page. "Scientists' avatars are created using generative AI," it read. This led to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of negative comments</a> across multiple Steam threads, the kind of storm some developers would opt to try to wait out. As of this week, however, Frontier is singing a different tune: “Thanks for your feedback on this topic,” reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/?ctp=16#c599656262950498876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post on the game’s Steam forum</a>. “We have opted to remove the use of generative AI for scientist portraits within <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em>.”</p><p>Confusingly, some have suggested that <em>Jurassic World Evolution 2</em> also used AI for scientist portraits, though the game’s Steam page includes no such disclosure. Then again, the game came out in 2021, before Valve began requiring developers to take this specific tack where AI is concerned. Aftermath reached out to Frontier for more information but did not receive a response as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, this is a more or less optimal outcome compared to, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ark-aquatica-ai-trailer-snail-games-studio-wildcard-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple companies on another dinosaur-themed game playing hot potato with accountability</a> for hacky use of AI that serves no one, least of all the people pouring their blood, sweat, and tears into the rest of the video game.</p><p>"Good,” one Steam user replied to the devs’ post about removing generative AI from the game, “I'm sure you can afford an artist to create them for you. It's not like <em>Jurassic Park</em> is a small IP."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety"><h3>Roblox Accused Of Allowing Sexual Exploitation In Four Separate Lawsuits</h3></a><p>All four — and more reportedly incoming, lawyers say — are filed by the same law firm</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/jurassic-world-evolution-3-ai-removed]]></content:encoded>

                <p>This fall, visitors at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-our-first-look-at-the-nintendo-museum/1100-6526006/" data-ref-id="1100-6526006">Nintendo Museum</a> in Japan are going to get an opportunity to catch a glimpse of history from Nintendo's five decades in the video game industry. Nintendo Museum has announced that an art gallery will be opening on September 3 featuring "a wide range of game artwork, including character illustrations and concept art."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405684179693786" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The Art Gallery will open on Wednesday, September 3rd on the 2nd floor of the Nintendo Museum Exhibition Building. Visitors can explore a wide range of game artwork, including character illustrations and concept art.</p>  — ニンテンドーミュージアム (@Museum_Nintendo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405684179693786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The announcement was light on details about what kind of artwork will be presented in the gallery, or how far back it will go. Although Nintendo became widely known in the early '80s for arcade hits like Donkey Kong, the company's first foray into gaming came in the early '70s with lightgun games. Since the launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1985, Nintendo has remained a major player in gaming.</p><p>The Nintendo Museum already has exhibits that celebrate the history of Nintendo's video games, as well as a selection of minigames that visitors are allowed to play. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">GameSpot's two-day visit to the museum in 2024</a>, Dan Ryckert noted that it "is light on text, descriptions, placards, and other traditional elements of a museum." He added that the room with fully-functional giant controllers from the Famicom, SNES, N64, and Wii Remotes was his favorite.</p><p>Nintendo Museum also has a large selection of exclusive merchandise. In response to demand from around the world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-museum-puts-limits-on-gift-store-merch-to-discourage-scalpers/1100-6526911/" data-ref-id="1100-6526911">Nintendo Museum added limits to the merch that visitors can buy</a> in order to discourage scalpers. The museum still requires visitors to register for tickets, and <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405685819670914" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo also noted</a> that anyone who wishes to change their reservation for September should cancel their old reservation and reapply by the end of June.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds.1228494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<h2>A clear improvement</h2>
<p>As you can see in the included charts, SteamOS showed noticeable frame rate improvements in four of the five games tested. Only <em>Borderlands 3</em> showed comparable performance across both operating systems, with Windows eking out ever-so-slightly higher frame rates in that game's benchmarks.</p>


<p>For the other four tested games, the stock Lenovo Windows drivers were sometimes significantly worse than those included with SteamOS. When playing <em>Returnal</em> at "High" graphics presets and 1920×1200 resolution, for instance, changing from Lenovo's Windows drivers to SteamOS meant the difference between a hard-to-take 18 FPS average and a downright decent 33 FPS average.</p>
<p>Sideloading the updated Asus drivers showed a noticeable improvement in Windows performance across all tested games and even brought <em>Homeworld 3</em>'s "Low" graphics benchmark test to practical parity with SteamOS. In all other cases, though, even these updated drivers resulted in benchmark frame rates anywhere from 8 percent to 36 percent lower than those same benchmarks on SteamOS.</p>
<p>These results might seem a bit counterintuitive, considering that games running on SteamOS must go through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/valves-upcoming-steam-deck-will-be-based-on-arch-linux-not-debian/">a Proton translation layer</a> for every native Windows instruction in a game's code. But Valve has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">put in consistent work</a> over the years to make Proton as efficient and cross-compatible as possible; not to mention its <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-improving-mesa-graphics-drivers-on-linux-for-a-secret-game/">continued work on Linux's Mesa graphics drivers</a> seems to be paying dividends for SteamOS graphics performance.</p>
<p>Running SteamOS also means eliminating a lot of operating system overhead that the more generalist Windows uses by default. Microsoft seems aware of this issue for gamers and has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">recently announced</a> that the upcoming "Xbox Experience for Handheld" will "minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks" to allow for "more [and] higher framerates" in games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dbrand-admits-it-had-a-%E2%80%98spectacularly-terrible-response%E2%80%99-to-killswitch-joy-con-grip-detachment-complaints.1228482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Dbrand will send replacement Killswitch Joy-Con Grips for the Switch 2 to buyers after admitting it had a “spectacularly terrible response” to complaints that the controllers could detach from the console if held a certain way while the grips were on. The company is currently working on tweaks to the grips as well.</p><p>A few days ago, some owners of the case noticed that the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers could pop off if you had the case and grips on <em>and</em> held the console primarily by a Joy-Con. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lgav3g/i_love_my_killswitch_2_buttttttt/">short video</a> helps illustrate the issue.</p><p>On Sunday, Dbrand posted a more than 4,000-word response <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">on Reddit</a> titled “Killswitch Joy-Con Detachment Update” where it said that “nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this.” Dbrand argued that the detachment only happened when all three of the following conditions were met:</p><div><blockquote><p>You are specifically holding onto the console from only the Joy-Cons, in such a way that your fingers are making no supportive contact with the main console, <strong>and</strong></p><p>you are holding the Switch 2 with only one hand, <strong>and</strong></p><p>your Switch 2 is held more parallel to the ground than not.</p></blockquote></div><p>Part of the issue is that the Killswitch case’s Joy-Con grips wrap around the inner part of the Joy-Con, creating a small lip. “By adding those lips, particularly the ones on the interior face of the Joy-Cons, we filled the ‘air gap’ between the Joy-Cons and the Main Case,” Dbrand said. This means that it’s easier for the Joy-Con to create leverage against the main tablet part of the console so that detachment can occur “when held under a very specific set of conditions.”</p><p>In some “particularly severe instances of detachment” highlighted on Reddit by Dbrand, the company also believed the Joy-Con grips had “an inner attachment lip that’s <em>a hair thicker</em> than desired.” Dbrand said that it had adjusted its tolerance guidelines for mass production to “filter out any Joy-Cons that cross that ‘lip is 0.12mm too thick’ threshold.”</p><p>For users who were worried that they were having issues, Dbrand asked them to reach out to support and “describe the regular use scenario that is resulting in detachment” and the company would get them replacement grips in July.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz7c2yd/">More</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz7z9l8/">than</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz9czxr/">one</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz7lxrw/">commenter</a> pointed out that Dbrand’s post echoed Steve Jobs and Apple’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/25/iphone.problems.response/index.html">famous response</a> to iPhone 4 antenna issues caused by a way people could hold their phones. And yesterday, Dbrand published a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">new post</a> where it said it would “try out a new communication strategy where we both say fewer words and devote less of them to blaming you” and offered to send everyone, “whether or not you’re experiencing this issue,” a replacement set of Joy-Con Grips.</p><p>“As easy as it is to boil our original post down to <em>‘you’re holding it wrong</em>,’ what we’re sober to now is the point that <em>you should be allowed to hold it however the fuck you want, without detachment occurring</em>,” Dbrand said. “We get it. Please continue dunking on us for the next six to eight months for reincarnating Steve Jobs.”</p><p>Dbrand is working on two new versions of the grips: one with “an even <em>thinner retaining</em> lip compared to the ‘good’ stock we’ve already shipped” and one with a new retaining lip design that the company says “fully resolves the detachment issue.” However, that second option won’t be ready for a “mass production trial” until July 10th, and “at that point,” Dbrand will be able to tell if it will be using the first or second options for replacements.</p><p>Dbrand says to expect its next update on July 10th.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/693121/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-joy-con-case-replacement-detachment]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's taken a while to get it sorted, but developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has finally managed to fix Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's wonky A-Life system as part of the post-apocalyptic shooter's latest massive update - meaning players can now expect a bit more life to their wasteland adventure as NPCs live their simulated lives and pursue their own goals. Oh, and official modding tools are here too, but you'll need to clear some considerable space to install them.
</p>
<p>
Starting with A-Life, it's been the beating heart (or possibly the brain) of the Stalker series since its debut in 2007, creating a more dynamic, and more emergent, post-apocalyptic landscape by simulating NPCs - stalkers, bandits, mutants, and more - that move around the world, hunt, fight, and interact even when offscreen. Stalker 2's version of A-Life was supposed to take things even further, but like much of the game at launch, was pretty broken.
</p>
<p>
GSC <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam">previously explained</a> much of Stalker 2's A-Life weirdness was down to optimisation hurdles, with the studio ultimately having to significantly reduce the size of the area around players that A-Life worked in order improve performance. Some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-receives-first-major-patch-including-a-life-fixes">initial fixes arrived shortly after release</a>, but it's only now, some seven months later, the system is finally working as intended.

<p>
As per the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399?l=english">latest patch notes</a>, today's huge 1.5 update - AKA the Guns &amp; Looting update - now simulates life for all characters, and not just those in the player's view. NPCs will "continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end", and can be encountered resting or interacting in different locations. Additionally, players can meet the same stalkers after some time.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more besides A-Life, though; patch 1.5 introduces new features (players can now experience the Water Electric Tornado anomaly out in the Zone, for instance, and acquire the Kora handgun and Three-Line Rifle), as well as AI and combat improvements, balance adjustments and bug fixes, plus various quality of life additions. That's alongside the release of official modding tools for Stalker 2, which are <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-zone-kit">currently available via the Epic Games Store</a>. Interested parties might want to brace themselves, however; you'll need somewhere in the region of 700GB harddrive space to install them.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer, if you're wondering, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">gave Stalker 2 three stars</a>, calling it a "mess of bugs and jank that nonetheless stays faithful to the open world survival shooter of yesteryear."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-tested-12-switch-2-cases-and-these-are-the-best.1228416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You might find it kind of sad to put a hard-earned gadget into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches. So, I wasted no time testing cases on the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and it didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best.</p><p>I tried several types of cases on the Switch 2. I tested flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I also tried slim cases that have one job: to protect the console when it isn’t in use.</p><div><h2>What I look for in a Switch 2 case</h2><section><p>We use each Switch 2 case as it was designed to be used. We follow the instructions included to get the best fit and protection, noting along the way when a feature works better than expected, or worse. We don’t perform drop tests (I’m using my personal, and thus treasured, Switch 2 unit), but we try our best to find weak points in each case.</p></section><section><p>Installing a case should be easy, not cumbersome. Given the Switch 2’s hybrid design, a multi-step process for attaching a case is expected, but it should be easy to achieve a successful installation every time with little effort.</p></section><section><p>Since a lot of tech cases are made before said technology is even publicly available, I’m watching like a hawk to make sure the cases that I try actually fit the Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference isn’t good enough for me or you.</p></section><section><p>Some cases come with compromises, such as not allowing the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers to be detached. Others block the kickstand, and/or prevent the console from fitting into its original dock for playing on a TV. Compromises are fine as long as you know what they are beforehand. I think most people want to access the Switch 2’s unique features, so I’ve focused mostly on picks that retain them, although I may include some picks that limit them.</p></section></div><p>I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for slim zip-up/clasp cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables or cartridge storage.</p><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><a href="#the-best-switch-2-case-for-both-handheld-and-docked-play">The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play</a></li><li><a href="#the-best-slim-protective-switch-2-cases">The best slim, protective Switch 2 cases</a></li><li><a href="#the-best-form-fitting-shells-for-the-switch-2-in-handheld-mode">The best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode</a></li><li><a href="#what-s-coming-next">What’s coming next?</a></li></ul></nav></div><p>As for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the <strong>Dbrand Killswitch</strong> is the best model overall. I published a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review">full review of the Killswitch</a>, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.</p><div><p id="the-best-switch-2-case-for-both-handheld-and-docked-play"><h2>The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->60</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Very secure fit</li><li>Makes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)</li><li>Clever dock adapter</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Chunky dock adapter</li><li>Not the most affordable case</li><li>Front protection only comes in the $80 tier</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The least expensive Killswitch tier <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">costs $59.95</a> and includes a rear cover for the console and a small piece to adhere to its kickstand for a matching style, plus Joy-Con 2 grips, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes a skin for your hardware. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Switch 2 console case makes it impossible to fit into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into it, essentially acting as a USB-C extender. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><cite>Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent travel cover that protects the front of your console during transit, or just for safekeeping when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.</p><p>I couldn’t post this without addressing the controversy surrounding the Killswitch’s design, specifically that it allows the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without pressing their release buttons. If you hold your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion is likely to detach. This could obviously cause serious damage to the console. Dbrand insisted in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">lengthy Reddit post</a> that most players don’t (and shouldn’t) hold their consoles this way. I <em>can</em> easily replicate the issue, though I didn’t notice it during my testing, mainly because I’m a worrywart who’s perhaps unnecessarily gentle with tech. However, I could see this being a more pressing issue if you have, say, a younger kid who roughhouses with technology. Either way, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">Dbrand later confirmed on Reddit</a> that all buyers are getting improved Joy-Con 2 covers that should fix the issue.</p><div><p id="runner-up"><h3>Runner-up</h3></p></div><p><strong>Genki’s Attack Vector</strong> case is similar in some ways to the Killswitch, as it consists of three pieces: one that goes around the console, and two pieces that wrap around each of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector">$49.99 kit</a> improves on the Killswitch with swappable modular grips that come in three sizes to let you customize how the Joy-Con 2 fits in your hand. It follows a small, medium, and large model, with the smallest adding some minor ergonomic benefits, and the largest being what large-handed folks will likely gravitate toward to make the Switch 2 comfier to hold. Its large, palm-filling grip feels as good to use as the Killswitch, but it’s a very close race and I’d be smitten to use either.</p><p>However, one notable downside with the Attack Vector is that the Joy-Con 2 sleeves can be pulled off with relative ease, unlike Dbrand’s. Their fit is accurate, technically, and they won’t fall off during normal use. But they’re not as secure as I want them to be.</p><p>Also, Genki advertises that you can keep the Attack Vector on when you insert your console into the Switch 2 dock, but its launch unit doesn’t work as intended. Genki addressed complaints on forums that the case doesn’t fit the console perfectly, and is working on a fix that it expects to finish in July. It will ship a replacement middle piece to all who have already purchased the case, and those who buy the case going forward will receive the fixed product.</p><div><p id="the-best-slim-protective-switch-2-cases"><h2>The best slim, protective Switch 2 cases</h2></p></div><p><strong>Power A’s slim zip-up case </strong>for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried. </p><p>At just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F69R7LLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$19.99</a> (half the cost of <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-2-carrying-case-screen-protector-multi%2F6625926.p%3FskuId%3D6625926" rel="sponsored">Nintendo’s official carrying case</a>), protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).</p><p>This case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the ones listed below.</p><p>For $10 more ($29.99), <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680463/belkin-nintendo-switch-2-charging-case-battery">Belkin’s slim case</a></strong> is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell prevents accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.</p><p>Belkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.</p><div><p id="runners-up"><h3>Runners-up</h3></p></div><p>JSAUX makes a relatively slim zip-up Switch 2 case that absolutely pops with color. Expressiveness is its main appeal, as this <strong><a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-Protective-2/dp/B0F2F38LZK?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$25.99 case</a></strong> slouches on other features you might want. Once it’s opened, all there is to see is a velcro strap that secures your Switch 2. Underneath it is a fabric tray stitched into the case that can hold 12 game cartridges. Like the Belkin and PowerA cases, this one prevents accidental pressing on the Joy-Con 2 sticks through its shell. It’s a little too light on features to recommend broadly, and it’s thicker than the other models.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Genki’s $42.99 Sleeper Case</a></strong> is a <em>very </em>tough soft case. Its wool-wrapped shell doesn’t have nearly as much give as other slim cases. Plus, its screen guard can carry up to 18 cartridges. However, I dislike how much the Switch 2 moves around when you shake the case (the fit is snug if you have the company’s Attack Vector case equipped). Notably, Genki’s Neil Trachy, who handles marketing and media relations, shared with <em>The Verge</em> that a production error may impact how well its zipper works in the long run, and that a free fix is coming in July for all who’ve already purchased one. The fix will be implemented for all future purchasers of the case. </p><p>“Our Sleeper Case was upgraded to a waterproof zipper last minute and unbeknownst to our production team, the adhesives used were not binding well to the zipper. [...] While the case is still rock solid, the weak point will be the glue that holds it all in place.”</p><div><p id="the-best-form-fitting-shells-for-the-switch-2-in-handheld-mode"><h2>The best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode</h2></p></div><p>The <strong>Killswitch</strong> is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.</p><p>If you don’t <em>ever </em>plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Protective-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0DMV31N3F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><strong>$29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor</strong></a> is a suitable option. It fits around every nook and port of the Switch 2, with openings for its speakers and air intake. It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its original dock.</p><div><p id="what-s-coming-next"><h2>What’s coming next?</h2></p></div><p>This case features many of the qualities that I like about the Dbrand Killswitch for a lot less ($29.99 versus $59.99), even one-upping it by being able to fit into the Switch 2’s original dock without the need for an adapter. I look forward to testing it when it launches.</p><p>I intend to keep this post updated as frequently as I’m able to test new cases.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/reviews/691319/best-switch-2-cases]]></content:encoded>

Each enemy I encountered (or at least each one I was able to kill) reacted based on which part of their body I shot; crawling headless after I kneecapped them, and popped their heads. Both of the blood-soaked firearms I tried have an older feel to them, more like the oomph of the original BioShock than the punchy crack of the guns found in most contemporary shooters, though Crisol’s trailer (and weapon wheel) promise a seemingly diverse arsenal of sanguine shooters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After making my way through a few city blocks, absorbing blood from dead bodies and popping zombie-like critters blocking my path, I came across a locked gate with a winch. Locked by a padlock with a chain – classic! Like clockwork, I set out looking for the bolt cutters I’d found in half a dozen survival horror games before. But before I could start looking, some kind of gigantic, arcane cyborg – a towering mass of blood-soaked bones and clanking machinery with a mask of a woman’s face crying blood – picked me up and tossed me around.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/03-1750729005759.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The beast chased me down the street to the window (conveniently) of the hardware store, but couldn’t touch me once I dove in. Safe for now, I grabbed the bolt cutters from the back storeroom and every coin in the cash register and set out to snip the chains that kept me from safety. But the beast was back at my heels practically the moment my feet hit the dirt road, hurling threats my way as it hunted me down.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I hope Crisol doubles down on these two different kinds of survival horror to produce layers of tension between the blood-for-bullets combat and high-stakes stealth in the full release.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Crouching to minimize the noise I made, I found a shortcut through a fish store, making a bunch of noise at one end before cutting through the store, snipping the chains, and cranking away at the winch to open the gate in front of me. I heard the creature thudding towards me, and just pushed away in the quick-time event faster, hoping I could squeeze through instead of running back to cover. The gate opened with just enough time to spare; I rushed out of the courtyard to safety, the gate snapping shut before my assailant could catch me.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/07-1750729018828.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This puzzle-like stealth section, though very simple, added a lot to my demo. I can see the ways this could evolve into a tense blend of stealth and shooting if I eventually need to dodge bigger enemies at the same time as popping the smaller, stoppable ones with my sanguine arsenal. I hope Crisol doubles down on these two different kinds of survival horror to produce layers of tension between the blood-for-bullets combat and high-stakes stealth in the full release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I enjoyed my demo well enough, I felt like I hadn’t seen anything new beyond the Bloodborne-like, health-for-ammo trade-off and some really cool weapon and enemy designs. I’m sure puzzles and progression will begin to differentiate themselves from Resident Evil as the game gets more complex. But I didn’t get to see much of that in this demo, which was clearly very early in the campaign. Still, I have a feeling Crisol: Theater of Idols will be worth checking out for its distinct take on survival horror with a Spanish flair.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/crisol-theater-of-idols-is-a-horror-fps-influenced-by-spanish-folklore]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From February to May, personal injury law firm Anapol Weiss <a href="https://www.anapolweiss.com/roblox-lawsuit-attorneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed four separate lawsuits</a> on behalf of children who were allegedly exploited by adults on the platform. The law firm said it’s “investigating hundreds of similar cases” and plans to file additional lawsuits in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p>The most recent lawsuit was filed in May in the Superior Court of California on behalf of a 16-year-old girl who, according to the filing, met a “serial predator who was on an FBI watch list for previously targeting children on <em>Roblox</em>” in the game. Throughout the 82-page complaint, the law firm details claims of exploitation and abuse in <em>Roblox, including </em>Bloomberg’s extensive reporting into <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Roblo</em>x’s “pedophile problem”</a> andHindenburg Research’s 2024 report that accused the platform of inflating metrics and called it a “<a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pedophile hellscape</a>.” <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2024/Roblox-Refutes-Misleading-Claims-in-Hindenburg-Report-2024-IsPnj4offj/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox called</a> Hindenburg Research’s report “misleading” and disputed several claims made in the Bloomberg report, with a spokesperson telling the outlet, "The long-term growth and longevity of Roblox depends on our ability to provide a safe and civil experience for our users." <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/roblox-rolls-out-more-child-safety-tools-on-its-game-platform?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox continues to roll out safety tools</a> as pressure mounts from outside groups.</p><p>In the complaint filed in May, Anapol Weiss alleges that the alleged predator, who is not named, “engaged in innocent conversation but gradually escalated to sexual topics and explicit exchanges.” He convinced the girl to move their conversations off <em>Roblox</em>, and eventually to meet in person, where the complaint says he sexually assaulted the girl and forced her from Indiana to Georgia. The girl escaped to a police department, according to the complaint.</p><p>“Plaintiff has suffered unimaginable harm,” Anapol Weiss wrote. “Her innocence has been snatched from her forever. Tragically, what happened to her is far from an isolated event. Indeed, Plaintiff is just one of countless children whose lives have been devastated as a result of Roblox’s gross negligence and defectively designed app.”</p><p>The firm’s three other lawsuits — two filed in April 2025, in California and Texas, and another filed in February in New Jersey — make similar claims. The three previous lawsuits also name Discord as a defendant for its alleged role in allowing child abuse to proliferate on its platform.</p><p>Roblox maintains that it’s committed to the safety of children on its platform. <em>Roblox</em> itself is more popular than ever, reaching n<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ew concurrent player records</a> consistently over the past several weeks. The platform is an essential app for many children, a place where they’re able to be social and creative. But court dockets over the past year paint an alarming picture of the app’s underbelly, revealing a deep, and, seemingly, systemic issue. Since January, United States police have arrested at least a half dozen people who allegedly used <em>Roblox</em> to find and exploit children, including <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ord.185914/gov.uscourts.ord.185914.9.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coercing minors into making pornography</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/air-force-member-charged-sexual-exploitation-nine-year-old-child-long-island" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying children for</a> sexually explicit photos, according to court documents reviewed by Aftermath.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-fights-protect-children-online-subpoenas-roblox-child" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier subpoenaed Roblox</a> for information about how the game is used by kids age 16 or younger, as well as for documents showing how Roblox protects children from “mature content.” The attorney general's office, via the subpoena, is also looking for communications to and from Florida users reporting abuse and communication with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, among other things. “We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing—if any—to avoid interactions with predators,” Uthmeier wrote in a news release.&nbsp;</p><p>In a similar move, <a href="https://www.njoag.gov/ag-platkin-sues-messaging-app-discord-for-unlawful-practices-that-expose-nj-kids-to-child-predators-and-violent-sexual-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin announced in April</a> that he’s suing Discord over “for deceptive and unconscionable business practices that misled parents about the efficacy of its safety controls and obscured the risks children faced when using the application.”</p><p>Alongside the new safety initiatives, in May Roblox hired former Lego Group executive Dr. Elizabeth Milovidov <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/05/roblox-head-of-parental-advocacy-dr-elizabeth-milovidov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as the company’s parental advocacy lead</a>, a role designed to help Roblox “empower families to help children use technology safely and responsibly.” The latest safety updates allow parents to block people and specific games on a child’s <em>Roblox</em> friends lists; previously, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/roblox-parental-controls-friend-blocking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Mashable</a>, parents had to block an entire game rating or maturity level, not on a game by game basis. Parents also have a more detailed look into their kids’ <em>Roblox</em> activity, showing information like the most played games. In March, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/humans-still-surpass-machines-roblox-has-been-using-a-machine-learning-voice-chat-moderation-system-for-a-year-but-in-some-cases-you-just-cant-beat-real-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox also announced</a> it's been deploying an AI tool to detect problematic voice chats. <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/11/major-updates-to-our-safety-systems-and-parental-controls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A <em>Roblox</em> update from November</a> added new parental controls and restricted communication for children under 13.&nbsp;</p><p>A Roblox spokesperson shared the following statement with Aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>As a policy we cannot comment on pending litigation. With that being said, Roblox is deeply committed to the safety and well-being of our community and helping protect children is&nbsp;a top priority.&nbsp;We invest significant resources in advanced technology, including robust filters and human moderation teams, to detect and address inappropriate content and behavior and do not allow user-to-user image sharing on our platform. We partner with law enforcement and other organizations aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children around the world, and we will continue to evolve our safety practices to promote a secure and positive experience for everyone on our platform.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced through its Nintendo Today app that The Legend of Zelda movie will no longer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-will-arrive-in-cinemas-in-march-2027/">arrive in cinemas in March 2027</a>. Instead, a brand new release date of May 7th, 2027 has been given. The only reason that has been given is that this delay is due to production reasons, and no further information has been provided apart from that.</p>



<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>Announcing the project in late 2023, Miyamoto said on social media, “I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega hit films.</p>
<p>“I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.”</p>

<p>There are no details of any cast announcements for The Legend of Zelda movie, nor is there any details of what story this movie will have. We do not know if the movie will adapt one of the games or be an original plot, introducing new elements to The Legend of Zelda lore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rob Yescombe, the writer behind films like Outside the Wire and Jackpot!, and games like <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/">RiME</a> and The Invisible Hours, has secured the rights for The Invisible Hours after developer Tequila Works was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-auctions-off-its-brand-and-ips/">shuttered and auctioned off the rights to their IP</a>.</p>
<p>Yescombe secured the rights to The Invisible Hours in the auction, and now plans to remaster the VR game, presumably for modern headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and PS VR2, and develop a screen adaptation of it, though it's unclear if he intends to make a film or TV show of the game.</p>
<p>"<em>I adored making The Invisible Hours</em>," Yescombe said in a press release. "<em>Truly, the best creative experience of my life. Fans still reach out to me, even after all this time - they love it as much as I do. The VR hardware market has grown massively since 2017 - multiple millions of units - making The Invisible Hours a prime candidate to remaster for a new generation</em>."</p>
<p>Yescombe is currently trying to find partners to help him bring The Invisible Hours back, which, if he's successful in doing so, would be a happier ending compared to the one Tequila Works and all of the studios' titles currently have, which is the one where they were all sold at auction.</p>
<p>While he's right that the player base of VR owners is bigger than it was in 2017 when the game was first shown and in 2018 when it launched, it's still not the booming market that many developers have believed it could be. In 2025, VR has been a year away from being the next big thing for more than a decade at this point.</p>
<p>We'll see if Yescombe can find a partner and/or studio to remaster The Invisible Hours. Or at the very least, a studio willing to work on the screen adaptation, which could potentially be the more lucrative option for the murder mystery.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You airdropped in with the <em>Warmachine</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-gravediggers-command-starter-and-battlegroup-box-review" rel="nofollow">Gravediggers Command Starter and Battlegroup Box</a>, but the enemy has dug in harder than you thought, and you call for reinforcements. Steamforged Games has answered those calls, and the Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansions are ready for deployment.&nbsp;In&nbsp;this article,&nbsp;we'll have a look at what both boxes contain and how they fit into the Command Starter and Battlegroup Box.</p>

<p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases began with a brand-new 2-player starter set, which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=JJvrSvU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=Wf9h_BqY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When the Trenchers go to war, they don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><h2>Airdrops Requested!</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers are a new army under the Cygnar faction, and can trace their history back to the early days of <em>Warmachine</em> in 2003. The Gravediggers come from a group known as the Trenchers, who were a theme army in the original <em>Warmachine</em> and grew and developed through the various editions of the game. Now, under Steamforged Games, the Gravediggers bring the Trenchers back with a unique twist: they can airdrop weapons, supplies, and even Warjacks into the battlefield, letting them react to the changing landscape and keep your opponents on their toes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-2.jpg?itok=bFIAVlEI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-2.jpg?itok=_v3MY3Up 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Core Expansion includes a whole host of new units to add somre new tricks to your army.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Gravediggers Command Core Expansion Set includes a force that can be played out of the box, but you will have to make some choices on force construction, unlike the Gravediggers Command Starter Set, which will get you straight into the game. But if you're looking for a larger force, or you already have the command starter and want to expand, then the Core Expansion will suit you well.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Core Expansion Set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Major Grant Vargus (Warcaster)</li>
	<li>Lieutenant Stella Barron (Character Solo)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Rangers A (Unit)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Rangers B (Unit)</li>
	<li>Trollkin Express Sniper (Command Attachment)</li>
	<li>Heavy Machine Gun Crew (Solo)</li>
	<li>Mantlet (Light Airdrop / Defense)</li>
	<li>Gun Mages (Unit)</li>
	<li>Blocker (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
	<li>Skirmisher (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
</ul><p>Leading the box from the front is Major Vargus, who has Fleet and Evasive to allow them to get to the front quickly and attack with their powerful Balefire Cannon with D3+1 shots. They also give other Cohort units in their battlegroup Fleet, which lets them spend 1 focus point to add 2 speed that turn. Their feat also gives nearby friendly units +3 armor, allowing you to set up a gunline in the face of the enemy and hamper the power of their return fire. Vargus is backed up by Lieutenant Barron, who, once per turn, can use their Battle Plan ability to give a friendly model a bonus from a choice of 3, like Sneak, which gives a nearby unit with concealment, stealth.</p>

<p>The box comes with 3 units, 2 units of 5 Rangers, and a unit of 3 Gun Mages. The Gun Mages can deploy further forward than normal at the start of the game, and come armed with Magelock Pistols, which can fire 3 different types of ammo, giving them either +3 range, an additional dice on attack (then discarding the lowest), or an Electro Leap, which can damage another enemy nearby to their target. The Rangers come in units of 5, and each has 3 heavy rifles and 2 machine gun-armed Rangers. The Rangers can dig in to give their unit concealment and combine their attacks for brutal strikes against resistant enemies.</p>

They can make a free attack once per turn if an enemy comes within 8 inches, and their weapon's tracer round attack ignores stealth, and lights up enemies,s making them easier for your other units to hit. A Trollkin Express Sniper is also included and can only be attached to a Ranger unit. The Trollkin ignores concealment and cover when making attacks, and when targeting warjacks, they can pick the damage column when they hit. They also give the unit their attached to a once per game&nbsp;Cautious Advance ability, where the unit makes a full advance, digs in, and then performs combat actions.</p>

<p>The box completes with airdrop units and has 2 of the 3 Heavy Airdrop warjacks (with the third, the Raider, in the Auxiliary Expansion), and the Light Airdrop Manlet. These units can arrive as part of the Heavy and Light Airdrop command cards, and appear 1 inch away from the unit playing the command card. The warjacks in this set can come in under the control of Vargus (who doesn't have a Warjack in this set, but can use one from other sets), or under the control of Stella, the Rangers, or Gun Mages.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set, like the Core Expansion detailed above, can be used by itself with some choices out of the box or combined with the Command Starter (or any other Gravedigger set). This expansion adds more specialized units and completes the options for the Light and Heavy airdrop command cards (if you've picked up with Command, Battlegroup, and Core sets, you will have all of the airdrop options).</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Colonel Allison Jakes (Warcaster)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Commandos (Unit)</li>
	<li>Commando Officer (Command Attachment)</li>
	<li>Captain Argo Brock (Character Solo)</li>
	<li>Beaker (Character Heavy Warjack)</li>
	<li>Raider (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
	<li>Fuel Canister (Light Airdrop)</li>
</ul><p>The Auxiliary Expansion Set is commanded by Colonel Jakes, the highest-ranking Gravedigger available. Jakes likes to synergize with multiple units, using abilities like Butcher's Bill, which allows you to advance 3 inches and attack with a nearby unit, if one of your units was damaged that turn. This combines with the Synergy spell, which provides a cumulative bonus (capping at +3) on melee attacks and melee damage to each subsequent model hitting a unit. Backing up Jakes is the warjack Breaker, with an empowered arc node, which reduces the cost of spells channeled through it by one. Breaker is extremely durable, removing an additional damage when the repair action is used on it, along with the ability to spend a focus point once per turn to remove D3 damage, further boosted by being resistant to corrosion, electricity, and fire.</p>

Their rate of fire D3 chain gun is effective against medium and large models, and they can draw fire from nearby friendly units with their Shield Guard ability. The Commandos in this set are a unit of 3 Grunts and 2 Support Troopers, and also come with the Command Attached, Commando Officer. As you would imagine, the Commandos can forward deploy, and they can also deploy in any of our control phases after the first turn with their Ambush ability. When attacking, if they hit and fail to damage, they always deal 1 damage, and they can drop a smoke template as an action to avoid return fire. If the unit has the Officer attached, they get access to the Mission Objective ability once per game, which gives all members of this unit +2 to hit and damage a chosen unit for the rest of the turn.</p>

<p>The Auxiliary Expansion closes with a Raider warjack, that is the third type that can be deployed using the Heavy Airdrop command card (along with the Blocker and Skirmisher from the Core Expansion) and the Fuel Canister from the Light Airdrop command card, which can be deployed instead of the other Light Airdrop options from the other Gravedigger sets.</p>

<h2>Warmachine Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansion Sets Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>If you're just starting out in your <em>Warmachine</em>&nbsp;or Gravediggers journey, then I do encourage you to start with the Gravediggers Command Starter, which gives a solid impression of the faction and a good core for starting out. After that, adding in either the Battlegroup Box for extra warjacks, or the Core or Auxiliary Expansion sets adds some real flair for what the faction can do. The Core Expansion Set adds a lot of unit options, empowering your gunline, whereas the Auxiliary Expansion adds some synergies with Jakes and the sneaky options of the Commandos. If you are serious about the Gravediggers, then you will want to purchase all 4 boxes, which will give you access to everything currently released for the Gravediggers (except the massive Boom Boom McCoy warcaster), which will give you a lot of army creation options, especially for your light and heavy airdrops.</p>

<p>The standout units from the Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansions Set for me are the Commandos and Rangers. I love how they capture the airborne nature of the real-world units, but beyond that, the Rangers Trollkin Express Sniper is a lot of fun (for you, not your opponent).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee has announced a new strategic partnership. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-rebrands-for-30th-anniversary-with-inspired-by-players-label" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently rebranded</a> tabletop publisher has signed a deal with Maestro Media, which will provide the company with extensive tabletop game distribution in English-speaking territories.</p>

<h2>The Asmodee Maestro Media Distribution Agreement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Maestro Media has agreed to an exclusive distribution partnership with Asmodee. Under this agreement, effective immediately, Asmodee will be the exclusive distributor of all English-language versions of Maestro Media's products across the United States, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africa.</p>

As part of their new "Inspired by Players" label, the tabletop giant is pushing forward with bringing high-quality tabletop games to players worldwide. It's an apt label considering their recent announcements of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan Sixth Edition</em></a> and the acquisition of the co-op zombie franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a> from CMON.</p>

<p>This strategy aligns with Maestro Media's recent activities. The company, founded in 2015, has earned a reputation of bringing various established IPs into the tabletop space. Those include the board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-donald-duck-happy-camper-board-game-celebrates-characters-90th-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Donald Duck: Happy Camper</em></a><em>,&nbsp;The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls</em>, a board game adaptation of the iconic Stanley Kubrick movie <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2001-space-odyssey-board-game-tasks-you-with-outsmarting-hal-9000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></a>, and the Kickstarter smash success <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/maestro-media-announces-clash-of-clans-epic-raid-board-game-based-on-hit-mobile-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em></a>.</p>

<p>“Partnering with Asmodee is a defining moment for Maestro Media,” says Javon Frazier, CEO and Founder of Maestro Media. “As we enter this next stage of growth, we’re focused on expanding the ways fans connect with our games—and there’s no better partner to do it with. Asmodee’s reach, reputation, and commitment to quality align perfectly with our vision of continuously creating unforgettable, community-driven experiences. We’re honored to keep growing alongside them.”</p>

<p>At time of writing, there are little details on product availability and release timelines for Maestro Media's catalog.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of 2025, despite it still feeling a smidge like it's in early access. The choice to transform the fantasy of playing football (soccer for the American folks!) from the traditionally tactical experience seen in most other football games into more of a high-action, mechanically complex throwdown with an emphasis on pulling off acrobatic plays and heroic saves is very cool. It's led to incredibly rewarding moments and crushing defeats, and riding the wave of those two extremes is a big reason why I enjoy games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/" data-ref-id="5000-397027">Rocket League</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>. It's also why I love Blue Lock, a manga/anime often cited in comparison to Rematch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We did see A LOT of players referencing Blue Lock, more than we expected, actually!" Rematch creative director Pierre Tarno told me via email. "We didn't really know it was so popular--it wasn't a major inspiration for the game, though internally some of us do enjoy both manga and anime!"</p><p dir="ltr">For the unfamiliar, Blue Lock is about 300 Japanese high school football players getting locked away in a black site training facility overseen by the mysterious mastermind Jinpachi Ego. Ego tells the group they'll be put through a series of trials, all in hopes of honing one of them into the world's best striker--someone so egotistical that they'd sacrifice Japan's irresponsible emphasis on teamwork to selfishly score goals no matter what and lead the Japan national team to victory. The other 299 failures will never be allowed to play on any Japan team again, ending their football careers in the country.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521621" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521621"></a><figcaption>When Rematch was first announced, I remember immediately thinking it looked like Blue Lock.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A lot (and I do mean, <em>a lot</em>) of what you can do in Rematch is similar to what characters do in Blue Lock (who themselves are written to emulate the flashiest, most well-remembered traits of famous football players, turned up to 11). Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGDAX9Qty4E">Meguru Bachira</a>, you can master dribbling and fast step-overs to cut through the defense single-handed, only passing the ball to teammates who challenge your imagination of what you can do. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW1jQQkZU9I">Seishirō Nagi</a>, you can pull off skillful ball takedowns and utilize misdirection, ball control, and acrobatic flair to become a goal-scoring genius. And like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a6RXxjPpts">Shōei Barō</a>, you can intercept passes meant for teammates (or outright take the ball from them while they're trying to dribble), scoring the goal yourself to steal the show as the match's heel. The opening cinematic of Rematch might highlight the opposite values, but the <em>mechanics </em>of the game allow you to play with ego.</p><p dir="ltr">Even the rules and setting of Rematch emulate Blue Lock--one of the earliest (and fan-favorite) arcs focuses on 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 match-ups where every player is trying to score, there are no off-sides, and the high-tech facility that all the players are contained in verges on futuristic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521622" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521622"></a><figcaption>Pass? When the goal is right there? I don't think so.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A quick search for "Rematch Blue Lock" will reveal a ton of clips on TikTok and YouTube of people emulating the manga/anime by doing something really cool solo and not passing the ball to their teammates, even when the entire defense collapses upon them. And I can't count the number of times I've been up against or playing alongside someone who has used the character creator to make their player incredibly pale-skinned with short, stark-white hair and a black uniform sporting number 11 (like Nagi), or to give their tan-skinned player dark, medium-length hair with dyed yellow tips and a blue uniform with number 8 (like Bachira).</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, not every person playing Rematch is doing so because they like Blue Lock. I'm sure most of them are like Richard Wakeling, who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rematch-review-unbelievable-tekkers/1900-6418378/">reviewed Rematch for GameSpot</a>, and came to Rematch because they loved playing the sport in real life (or are just fans of Sloclap's work!). But there is clearly a not-insignificant portion of the playerbase that is jumping into Rematch to embrace their egotistical Blue Lock fantasies and play the hero of the match who scores all the cool goals or pulls off clip-worthy dribbling.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521623"></a><figcaption>A lot of people in Rematch think they're Nagi.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite all those clear parallels, Rematch is not developer Sloclap's attempt to emulate Blue Lock. It's not the team's attempt to emulate really any singular story centered around football.</p><p dir="ltr">"The setting and art direction really came from the pillars of the game, rather than from specific pieces of media," Tarno said. "Rematch is a game about the joy of playing football with your friends, about how individual talent is necessary but never sufficient, and at the end of the day, it’s the collective that matters. The focus on teamplay and positive sportsmanship is what drove our choices on setting and art direction: a colorful, positive vision of the future."</p><p dir="ltr">Sloclap is hoping Rematch has a positive future itself, and the team is already working on updates to the game beyond the soon-to-come cross-play.</p><p dir="ltr">"Emergent strategies and mechanics started appearing [during the beta], but they consolidated during launch week," Tarno said. "Most of them are valid and should not be removed, but one exploit we'll be removing is the 'dolphin jump,' in which players exploit the outfield dive to move faster even when they've run out of stamina. We're considering advanced ways that could be used to optimize movement speed and stamina usage, but this one looks really weird and will be removed!"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521624"></a><figcaption>The goalkeeper deserves more options to stop the multitude of shots that strikers can take.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much like other online multiplayer games that came before it, Rematch is evolving as more players jump in, and Sloclap has noted that its vision of Rematch may change to match players' expectations. That probably doesn't mean a Blue Lock crossover is coming (but we live in a post-Fortnite world, so who knows), but other aspects of the game are changing to reflect a shift in focus--such as the way 5v5 has ceased to be the "standard" mode, despite Sloclap setting it up to be the default way to play ranked matches.</p><p dir="ltr">"The initial vision we had for the game was a 5v5 experience, which features more tactical configurations, more challenge in making precise passes, and [more development of] your vision of the game dynamics," Tarno said. "The 3v3 game mode is very popular, however, and we're seeing a lot of players requesting a 3v3 ranked queue, so it's really a matter of taste for players."</p><p dir="ltr">On that, I agree with the herd. I know Sloclap wants 5v5 to be the experience for Rematch, but the game feels a lot more tactical and strategic when played on the tighter 3v3 and 4v4 fields, and it's easier for the player who's keeper/sweeper to call out the action, stay engaged, and feel useful on the smaller field.</p><p>Maybe just give the keeper the ability to pull off a last-ditch shachihoko fish kick to save the ball like Blue Lock's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GmwocGtH14">Gin Gagamaru</a>? That would be cool!</p>

                <p>It's come to light that the Xbox 360--a console originally released in 2005--has just received a new system update. Reddit user trackwalker said they booted up their Xbox 360 to find that the dashboard was updated.</p><p>What's new? That's not exactly clear, but replies to trackwalker's post on Reddit mention <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/1ljh196/comment/mzjq2t8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game thumbnail images no longer appearing stretched out.</a> Others are pointing out that the dashboard now prominently displays ads for the Xbox Series X|S consoles, encouraging people to "experience next-gen performance" by upgrading to a new system.</p><p>The Xbox 360 store <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-xbox-360-store-shuts-down-for-good-today/1100-6525372/" data-ref-id="1100-6525372">officially closed in July 2024</a>, at which point hundreds of games and content for them vanished. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/xbox-360-update-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TrueAchievements reported</a> that also at this time, a number of tiles related to the store got dumped as well, making the dashboard overall look pretty lackluster.</p><p>Any backward-compatible Xbox 360 (and original Xbox) games remain available for purchase on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox.com. Online multiplayer support, meanwhile, depends on publishers and developers for Xbox 360 games and wasn't affected by the store's shuttering.</p><p>The Xbox 360 generation was a high point for Xbox, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-360-sales-reach-80-million-units/1100-6415644/" data-ref-id="1100-6415644">more than 80 million units sold.</a> The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-one-sales-were-less-than-half-of-the-ps4/1100-6506476/" data-ref-id="1100-6506476">Xbox One, released in 2013, reportedly sold worse</a> and the <a href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1420141968546537472" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S is understood to have underperformed the Xbox 360 as well.</a> Microsoft is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">developing a new home console with AMD</a>, in addition to pursuing new branded handhelds like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/" data-ref-id="1100-6532506">upcoming Xbox ROG Ally.</a> Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle/1100-6532660/" data-ref-id="1100-6532660">partnered with Meta for an Xbox-branded VR headset.</a></p>
