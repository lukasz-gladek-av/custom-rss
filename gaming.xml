            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that its&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year, and a new champion has been announced for the roster as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/2xko-closedbeta-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the game's official website, <i>2XKO</i>'s closed beta begins on September 9th, and Riot says that once the beta is online, its "goal is to keep the game online, outside of any necessary maintenance". That means there won't be any downtime; once you're in, you're in.</p>

<p>However, this does also mean that&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s closed beta will only be available for PC, so if you're hoping to check the game out on consoles, you'll have to wait a while, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ny8DU7MY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ijwjn5Pd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The silver lining here, however, is that&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>will support cross-progression, so if you get started in the closed beta on PC, you'll still be able to transfer whatever progress you make to your preferred version when it launches.</p>

<p>To get a chance to check out the closed beta, you can <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/beta/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign up here</a>. If you participated in either of&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s Alpha Lab tests, then you're already signed up for the closed beta and you can just wait for your confirmation email.</p>

<p>As well as announcing the closed beta, Riot also revealed a new champion for the game's roster in the form of the Piltover enforcer Vi. Given that she fights with a massive pair of gauntlets, she's pretty much a no-brainer for&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>.</p>

<p>Vi's trailer reveals her to be a powerful and fearsome combatant, and her design looks like it's somewhere in between the original&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>look and the newer&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>aesthetic. You can check out her trailer here.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is, it's a&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>&nbsp;fighting game that features champions from the MOBA's roster duking it out in two-on-two combat.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" rel="nofollow">designated&nbsp;<em>Project L</em></a>, the game was subsequently renamed to&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" rel="nofollow">in February last year</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, but its PC closed beta begins on September 9th, and it's also set to land on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S when it launches in full.</p>

            <p>If I'm interpreting the press materials for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gossamer-matrix">Gossamer Matrix</a> correctly, this is an FPS in which you might accidentally stuff a chocolate bar into your AK47 while trying to reload. The result will not be a fusillade of chocodrops. Instead, you will be gunned down like the miserable office slob you absolutely are. So keep your workspace tidy, chief.</p>
<p>I'm looking at my desk as I type these words. It contains: a piece of paper with "gel" written on it, purpose unknown; a stolen Cafe Nero mug, never cleaned; Vikram Chandra's memoir Geek Sublime; and a bag of raisins. I do not own a gun, because this is the UK and one of the UK's few advantages is that the vast majority of people don't own guns, but if I did own a six-shooter and were lured into a gunfight right now, I guarantee I'd be stuffing raisins into the chamber while choking to death on my own bullets.</p><!--more-->

<p>Which is hopefully the kind of doofiness that will make Gossamer Matrix fun. In this, gloriously non-widescreen and Haribo-coloured arcade shooter from catmilk, you are a security guard tasked with rescuing your company's board members from the invading forces of Mallow Corp. To do this you must wrangle with a "physics-based interaction scheme" that obliges you to load guns by dragging bullets onto them and yanking at their bits. All the while managing a screenful of other stuff that has minimal ballistic potential.</p>
<p>It's hard to get a clear sense of things in the absence of a demo, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2002840/Gossamer_Matrix/">the Steam page</a> fills in the picture somewhat. "Things can quickly get overwhelming if you don't take the time to keep your workspace clean," it notes. "Empty magazines, candy wrappers, and dirty syringes will crowd your vision and obstruct your pockets if not disposed of properly, and being distracted on the clock is not a luxury you can afford."</p>
<p>This looks and sounds like a hoot and a holler. I now consider games with dedicated reloading buttons desperately quaint. If you're wondering where you've come across this before, it turns out Alice0 (RPS in peace) listed it as one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-101-most-anticipated-games-of-2023">most anticipated games of 2023</a>. That was before I started at RPS, mind you, a period popularly known as the "Bozo's Interval", so I feel no shame about posting the game again.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-acid-bright-office-shooter-gossamer-matrix-you-have-to-reload-while-managing-a-deskful-of-junk]]></content:encoded>

Whether you’re someone who loves anything starring the little yellow pellet-muncher, or just want a challenging Metroidvania to sink your teeth into, this one should be right up your alley. You’ve got quite a journey ahead, but the first few hours can be a lot to take in, so here are four tips to help you acclimate to <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196646,196215" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h414767"><a id=""></a>Take it slow and steady</h2><p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is a surprisingly tough Metroidvania with a lot of traversal between checkpoints, so surviving the powerful foes and dangerous environments takes patience and precision. Take your time and consider your next move when approaching groups of enemies or hazardous obstacles. You can even move your camera around to survey the vicinity when needed. </p><figure id="" data-id="5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-recommend-id="image://5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-recommend-id="image://5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And make sure you explore each area thoroughly, too, as there are tons of well-hidden secrets to find. You’ll sometimes even find that the environment is hiding secret pathways that are only revealed when you come in contact with it. Sneaky!</p><h2 id="h414768"><a id=""></a>Always be chompin’</h2><p>One of <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>’s most unique mechanics is Devour. By pressing in on the right stick, you can pick up and eat enemies after you kill them. Doing so will fill up your GAIA meter (more on that below) and reward you with materials you can trade for useful perks (stylized as PERKs in the game). So, yeah, you’ll want to be doing this <em>constantly</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-recommend-id="image://609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-recommend-id="image://609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Dead enemies will disappear if you don’t Devour them quickly, so make sure you’re consistently jamming that right stick to grab ‘em up and toss ‘em down your gullet. Luckily, you can pick up multiple dead enemies at once, making things slightly less tedious when dealing with groups. </p><h2 id="h414769"><a id=""></a>Save GAIA for bosses to make quick work of them</h2><p>As you eat enemies and fill up your GAIA meter, you can eventually transform into GAIA, allowing you to dish out huge damage while taking none yourself. You’ll occasionally need to use this to traverse through otherwise impassable environmental spots, but otherwise, I’d really recommend you save it for bosses. At least early in the game, transforming into GAIA trivializes foes that might otherwise take a while to kill. I mean, I obliterated this stupid bear boss in the picture below so quickly I didn’t really even see its moveset. </p><figure id="" data-id="e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-recommend-id="image://e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-recommend-id="image://e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And as I mentioned above, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> often has quite a bit of ground to cover to reach checkpoints. So, if you don’t want to have to make the long trek back to a boss, it’s probably best to use everything at your disposal to get past it. That being said, if you feel GAIA makes things too easy, go at it the swordfighter way. It’s your game — play it however you want.</p><h2 id="h414770"><a id=""></a>For love of god, manually control PUCK</h2><p>You’ll spend a lot of time riding D-Lines as PUCK in <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>. These segments function like on-rails Pac-Man levels, and they often require a significant amount of twitchy movement to overcome. As such, you’ll want to be sure you’re being as precise as possible and really thinking through how to handle D-Line movement.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-recommend-id="image://ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-recommend-id="image://ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By default, PUCK will automatically move in whichever direction you’ve recently faced it. You can brake by using the right trigger on your controller, but due to the constant hazards in your way during D-Line rides, I’d really recommend switching to manual control. By pressing the left bumper on your controller, you can take full control over when and how PUCK moves. It’s so much better.</p><hr><p>Now that you know to do, get PUCKin’ in <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/shadow-labyrinth-tips-pluck-manual-eat-gaia-1851786714]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Obsidian has expressed a strong interest for game preservation to Eurogamer while talking about whether Grounded 2 will usurp and replace Grounded 1 when it arrives in early access at the end of July.</p>
<p>Speaking in an interview, executive producer Marcus Morgan told me: "We actually have this strong passion to ensure our games can stand the test of time and keep updating through history." He pointed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ten-years-after-its-launch-pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-a-turn-based-combat-mode">the surprise patch Obsidian released for 10-year-old isometric role-playing game Pillars of Eternity</a>, earlier this year, as proof. "There's a strong desire on our side to make sure that our games are preserved," he said.</p>
<p>"Now, are we going to be doing content and these story expansions to Grounded 1?" he added. "No, that's the continuation of Grounded 2. But even as recently as April we released our [update] 1.4.7 to Grounded 1, so there's a maintenance and a desire that that game will always exist. So we'll keep that up; it's not going anywhere if people still want to play Grounded 1 as well.</p>
<p>"But we are, in terms of where we're moving the story, where we're expanding things: if you want more Grounded, we'll be more into Grounded 2 versus Grounded 1. We're pushing things forward with Grounded 2."</p>

<p>Morgan's comments reference a bigger problem games face where if their servers are taken offline, they effectively cease to exist. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">EA recently announced it would switch the Anthem servers off</a>, for example, and when that happens, no one will be able to play the game. Anthem will, for all intents and purposes, disappear.</p>
<p>It's become such a problem that an anti-closure movement has sprung up in response, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">Stop Killing Games</a>, and its petition has amassed hundreds of thousands, potentially more than a million, signatures of support. It seeks to ensure publishers leave their games in a playable state after official support is pulled.</p>
<p>Grounded theoretically falls into the at-risk category by being multiplayer, it being built on the idea of co-operative survival in a back garden world, as an inch-high teenager. But there's a crucial difference that potentially future-proofs it.</p>

<p>Morgan explained: "One of the things that we did in terms of how we structured Grounded is multiplayer is done through peer-to-peer, which in first blush, feels antiquated versus dedicated servers. But we were able to blend that with shared worlds, and what that does is it allows you, effectively, a cloud save that you can share with your friends. So it gives that experience of being able to have a more dedicated server vibe, but it doesn't have that same requirement of actually having servers.</p>
<p>"And this is no commentary on the Stop Killing Games stuff or anything like that," he added. "More to say it does establish [Grounded 1] so it can exist into the future a lot easier than if you're on the other side, where you are more of a server-based game."</p>
<p>Grounded 2 releases in early access on 29th July. The sequel introduces mounts and moves the action from a backyard world into a larger space called Brookhollow Park, introducing new biomes, deeper systems and gameplay with it. I'm currently playing the sequel but can't say anything more until the day it comes out. Pop back then.</p>

			<p>The Pokémon Company hosted a Pokémon Presents event today, which had a slew of announcements, including a new mobile game called Pokémon Friends that's out on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 and mobile devices, a 2026 release window for Pokémon Champions, and a new story trailer for the highly-anticipated Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Starting with the brand-new game that was announced, Pokémon Friends is a new puzzle game that can be played on iOS and Android mobile devices, or on your Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 system. It's a puzzle game that includes 2D and 3D puzzles, all in the service of creating your own plush room that you can stuff to the brim with Pokémon paraphernalia. </p>



<p>"<em>Solve puzzles and get your daily 'aha' moment,</em>" the trailer proclaims, as Pokémon Friends is seemingly the latest in The Pokémon Company's line of mobile games it wants people checking in on daily, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sms37W1x3-M">Pokémon TCG</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbW585_nTj0">Pokémon Sleep</a>. And speaking of those mobile games, there were also announcements for the above two, along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4YBHig-wfA">Pokémon GO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLBCN7LsQkY">Pokémon Unite</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_GOGmkusY">Pokémon Masters EX</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBoDsuE1t0Q">Pokémon Café ReMix</a>. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>There were also two announcements on the adaptation front, with new episodes announced for the Netflix series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzL8NUUgwdc">Pokémon Concierge</a>, and the reveal of a brand new stop-motion animated show, Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd &amp; Pichu. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu | Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/om_7wKXw1XE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's being developed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.aardman.com/">Aardman</a>, a stop-motion animation studio that has worked on films, television series, and video games for the last 40 years. You've seen their work if you've ever seen films, shows and games from series like Wallace &amp; Gromit, Chicken Run, and Shaun the Sheep. The only downside is that it won't arrive until sometime in 2027, so we still have some time to wait for its launch. </p>



<p>Pokémon Champions being shown off was one of the other highlights in the presentation, which is also releasing on Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, and mobile devices. A gameplay overview dug into various elements of the game, including how battles, training, and recruiting Pokémon work. It's another title that doesn't have a 2025 arrival point, as it'll launch sometime in <strong>2026</strong>. </p>

</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> getting a story trailer was what The Pokémon Company closed the event on, showing off more gameplay of it running on Nintendo Switch 2, and of course digging into the plot's narrative, and what appears to be the main conflict of the plot, that Pokémon are mega-evolving on their own, causing danger and chaos across Lumiose City. Which also reveals new mega-evolutions, like Mega-Dragonite.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There was also the reveal of a Nintendo Switch 2 bundle including Pokémon Legends Z-A, which will be available when the game launches on October 16, 2025.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Bundle Available Oct. 16 in America as well - retails for $499.99 at Nintendo Store and select retailers.

</div></figure>



<p>Lastly, the other key highlight from the show was more information about the Pokémon Kanto theme park, which is due to be open "<em>soon</em>," which is being built in Tokyo, Japan, in an amusement park called Yomuriland. Over 600 Pokémon will be featured in the park, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemons-upcoming-theme-park-was-inspired-by-isolation-during-the-pandemic-says-junichi-masuda/">according to</a> The Pokémon Company chief creative fellow, Junichi Masuda.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As one of the longest Pokémon Presents events in the history of this showcase, it delivered on having enough announcements to fill up the 24-minute runtime. </p>



<p>This year's previous Pokémon Presents event was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">dedicated look at Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, which also announced the October release date, and promised that the Switch 2 version of the game will feature "<em>improved graphics and frame rates</em>," which sounds great, but hopefully it doesn't mean that the Nintendo Switch version of the game will be anything like previous Pokémon games in terms of <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-update-late-february-bug-fixes-functionality/">performance</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em> is one of my go-to games for replayability. With so many haunts, variability in gameplay, and even the way that a house develops differently sitting down you've always got to be prepared for something new. With the <em>Betrayal At The Niebolt House: The Evil of Pennywise</em> expansion, players get to take on the roles of a group returning after 27 years of torment to put a stop to Pennywise.</p>

<p>Included in the box you'll find a "Come Home To Evil" Scenario Card, ten Pennywise Encounter cards, four tokens, a Henry Bowers character overlay, and three IT-themed miniatures for Henry Bowers, Pennywise the Clown, and Pennywise the Spider. The expansion also includes four new rooms, a thematic story preamble for the Derry setting, and five new haunts inspired by <em>IT Chapter II.</em></p>

<p>Come Home To Evil<br>
You are a group of friends who survived It's last feeding frenzy in the town of Derry when you were kids. Now, It has stirred again after 27 years, and you've been drawn back to the Neibolt House to confront the savage shapeshifter. As you explore the house and experience nightmarish events, will you turn on your friends? Or will you band together to defeat It once and for all?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What is <em>Betrayal</em>?</h2>

<p>If you're new to <em>Betrayal</em>, the basic premise of it is that you and your group of explorers begin in the entrance hall of a mysterious mansion. As you take turns, you'll enter rooms and flip over tiles from a large stack of rooms, building the house as you play the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=1snp6sUF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=_Le6PjM6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Exploring the house, you'll have a chance to earn items, experience strange and supernatural events, and discover ominous Omens. Once enough Omens have been gathered, a Haunt kicks off.</p>

<p>Once the Haunt kicks off, you're no longer playing a collaborative game of haunted house exploration, but instead, one (or maybe more) of the players will turn to the side of evil. They may have been killed, with the player now controlling monsters in the house, have become evil themselves, or some mix of the two.</p>

<p>Each team of players now has its own unique goals to win the game as new mechanics come into play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=t5Y-qPok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=0aHkYeCG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, there are a number of changes made to the base game so that no matter what, you always feel like you're part of the universe of IT.</p>

<p>The largest critique of <em>Betrayal: The Evil of Pennywise</em>&nbsp;is also one that it shares with the base game, as you move into the Haunt and there's a chance for players to die if things go awry and if you die quickly, then you're fully out of the game. When these haunts can take 30+ minutes, that's time that you're just not getting to engage in any aspect of the game.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Betrayal At The Neibolt House</h2>

<p>In order to adapt your game to fit the theme of the expansion, you'll get to add your four new tiles to the game board. From there, you'll start your game as normal with the expansion-specific scenario card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=tR291cYU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=UVru6pKT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The largest change is that instead of pulling Omen cards when you see an Omen symbol on a revealed room, you'll instead pull a Pennywise Encounter card. These cards pull inspiration from the source material, where you'll see a red balloon pop and potentially take damage, or overcoming floating lights is able to help you gain sanity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The four new room tiles are unique to the expansion, but that doesn't mean that they can't be staples of your standard Betrayal experience</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that a few new tiles are in the deck, and you're pulling Pennywise Encounters instead of Omens, is really all you need to change going into <em>The Evil of Pennywise,</em> making setup an incredibly fast process and for it to be familiar for all returning players.</p>

<h2>Experiencing The Haunts</h2>

<p>Discussing the haunts can be a bit difficult without spoiling too much, so I'll keep it generic here for a bit. There are five themed Haunts in <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, each focusing on a key plotpoint from IT Chapter II, whether it be facing Henry Bowers, or facing off against Pennywise The Clown itself.</p>

<p>The game has done a fantastic job of adapting these scenes to best fit the gameplay of <em>Betrayal</em>, with Haunt number 2 in this book probably becoming my favorite Betrayal experience with a great mix of unique gameplay, interesting problems to solve, and a very visible threat continuing to grow until it becomes too much for any player to handle.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-henry-bowers.jpg?itok=t_Lg9Jpl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-henry-bowers.jpg?itok=YTlEemWv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To get deeper into the spoilers, each of the different haunts progresses you further through the narrative of the source material. Starting by having to fight Henry Bowers, then getting trapped in a disconnected house, having to find your artifacts, and then performing the ritual and taking on Pennywise.</p>

<p>It almost feels like there should be a recommended goal to build the house, but make alterations so you can do each of the haunts in order to create a legacy game feel as you and your friends make it through the events of <em>IT Chapter 2</em>.</p>

<p>To cap off the experience, I'm a big fan of the final two haunts of the game having no traitor, but Pennywise be an mechanic-driven antagonist. It stays true to the source material while also creating a very unifying experience for the players.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-fighting.jpg?itok=WRzmueU3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-fighting.jpg?itok=xDtPzzo6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Betrayal: The Evil of Pennywise</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If there was ever a board game to use the IP of <em>IT</em> and Pennywise, <em>Betrayal </em>is the perfect choice. This expansion is incredibly fast to setup, enhances the base game, and allows for you and your friends to experience a variety of mechanically unique haunts.</p>

<p>While only adding five new haunts, this won't take long to get through; each of the haunts is very unique and memorable to the source material.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <em>Betrayal</em>, there's really no way that more haunts are ever going to be a bad thing, this should be a must buy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to reopen the Bureau.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Pokémon Presents, we saw a ton of new footage of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, including a brand new Mega Evolution. But for lore nerds, what was far more interesting was the official, confirmed appearance of a very popular character from our adventure in Pokémon X and Y. And yes, I'm going to spoil it for you below this video, so don't keep scrolling if you don't want to know.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you watched today's trailer, you'll know this isn't much of a spoiler: Emma, from Pokémon X and Y, is officially confirmed for Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Emma <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">has been a part of fan speculation</a> ever since the game was announced, and theories about her presence in Z-A have only multiplied over time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some context, Emma is a young girl in X and Y who is adopted and trained by Looker, a detective in Lumiose City who's become a fan-favorite character after multiple game appearances. At the end of X and Y, Looker effectively hands over the keys to his Looker Bureau to Emma. We've already seen that the Bureau appears in this futuristic Lumiose, so it makes sense that Emma would be running it. What's more, her design suggests she's still running around the city as the crime-fighting Essentia, based on the outfit under her jacket.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— 【公式】ポケモン情報局 (@poke_times) <a href="https://twitter.com/poke_times/status/1947648245611536839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Emma's presence does beg some questions. When exactly is Pokémon Legends: Z-A set? We don't know! Emma is definitely older in her Z-A appearance, but probably not so much older that there would have had time to essentially rebuild Lumiose from the ground up, from its X and Y aesthetic to the futuristic city appearing in Z-A. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Have there been time-traveling shenanigans? Is this Emma's daughter, also named Emma? Probably not that second one. Maybe the denizens of the Kalos region are just really, really fast at building cities.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="de" dir="ltr">Serebii Update: Official artwork for Emma &amp; Mable in Pokémon Legends Z-A <a href="https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/zsdP9u36Dw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zsdP9u36Dw</a></p>— Serebii.net (@SerebiiNet) <a href="https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/1947648427816308992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth pointing out here that another familiar face from X and Y appeared during today's trailer, albeit one that's maybe a little less instantly recognizable. If you spotted Mable, the new director of the Pokémon Research Lab, you might have recognized that she's a former member of Team Flare. She's uh, not exactly the most moral of people in X and Y, so it will be interesting to see if she's reformed since then or if there's something unsavory going on at the research lab.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were other reveals during today's trailer, including brand new characters like Naveen, Lida, and either Urbain or Taunie. We also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-species-revealed-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">saw a brand new Mega Evolution, Mega Dragonite</a>.

It's called Pokémon Friends, and it's a daily brain teaser game featuring lots of Pokémon-themed puzzles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the trailer, we got a look at a number of examples of the sorts of puzzles we'll encounter in Pokémon Friends. The first one showed a design of tiles with light bulbs on them, asking players to draw a line from one tile that touched every single other tile only once. Another had a player sliding lined tiles around to connect a path so that water could flow from one side to the other. Still others involved connecting train tracks, predicting which balloons wouldn't be popped by a flying arrow, sliding around an ice maze, and more. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All the games are themed around Pokémon such as Pikachu, Piplup, Mudkip, Sableye, and more. Completing puzzles gets the player in-game Pokemon plush items that they can use to decorate a virtual room.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Friends is out right now on iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. It costs $9.99 on Nintendo Switch, and is "free to start" on mobile but eventually will block the player from progressing without paying. The game purports to feature over 1,200 different puzzles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Mega Dragonite actually takes inspiration from Dragonair with the wings on its head and pearl on its tail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolutions will factor into the story as well, as there will be Rogue Mega Evolution Pokémon who can't contain their own strength for some reason and need to be stopped.

If you have a Pokemon like Furfrou, you'll even be able to change their appearance as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber Interactive, the video game company behind Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, has announced a brand new Hellraiser game alongside a trailer that’s not for the faint of heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival is a story-driven, single-player survival horror action game set in the Hellraiser universe. It's developed by Boss Team Games, creator of the recently delisted Evil Dead: The Game, and is due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser, for the uninitiated, is a cult classic horror franchise made up of 11 films and various comic books, all based on The Hellbound Heart novella by English author Clive Barker. The star of the show is Pinhead, a ‘Cenobite’ who harvests human souls to torture in sadistic experiments. And you can see that in action in the trailer, which — <strong>content warning!</strong> — contains as much sex as it does body horror.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer is certainly in keeping with the look and feel of Barker's original Hellraiser movie, which began life in the late 80s. We see one character use the franchise's infamous puzzle box, the Lament Configuration, to open a gateway to hell, and the Cenobites made famous by the movies walk through to do their thing. In a move sure to delight fans, actor Doug Bradley returns to the role of Pinhead for the first time in nearly two decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barker is also involved in this new Hellraiser video game, helping out with the story. "Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings,” he commented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They’ve immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence — the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque — and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to help his girlfriend from a hellish abyss. As Aidan, you’ll harness the box’s infernal abilities to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and the Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s talk of harnessing the abilities of the Genesis Configuration in combination with “earthly” weapons to “inflict bone-breaking, flesh-searing pain (or pleasure?) upon your enemies.” You fight hell's wretches, deviants, cultists, and priests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser was thrust back into the public consciousness in 2022 with a franchise reboot film. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellraiser-review-2022-hulu">Hellraiser review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Hellraiser is a reinvigorated reboot that gets the blood pumping, starting with Jamie Clayton’s worthy Pinhead performance that sets a fresh tone with immense reverence paid to Clive Barker's works.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The previous record-holder was also a Nintendo system: Game Boy Advance. In 2001, the handheld reportedly sold 1,367,433 units, so GBA held the top spot for almost a quarter of a century before Switch 2. The other systems that got off to hot starts in Japan include Nintendo DS with over 1.2 million units sold and PS2 with over 1.1 million units sold.</p><p dir="ltr">Switch 2 launched on June 5. Nintendo announced that the system had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">sold more than 3.5 million units in four days</a> globally, becoming the fastest-selling console ever for the company. However, Nintendo hasn't provided any updated sales numbers since then.</p><p>Nintendo just revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle/1100-6533331/" data-ref-id="1100-6533331">a new Switch 2 bundle with Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> will launch in October for $500. Currently, there's a similar bundle for Switch 2 that comes with Mario Kart World, instead. For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/">Switch 2 hardware review</a>.</p>

When you search for Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason, who are going to play the adventurer Link and Princess Zelda, respectively, you get something more, along with the usual info.</p><p>Typing in those actors' names into your search bar, on mobile and desktop, it will show you some images, their Wikipedia pages, social media accounts, and news of the casting, but also a little nod to their upcoming roles.</p><p>When you search for Link actor Ainsworth, you will notice a message that reads: "KYAAAA! HYAAAAA!", just like the noises Link makes as he slashes his way across Hyrule and around the world. There's also a small male elf emoji next to it for a nice touch.</p><p>Now, searching for Zelda actress Bragason, a little note now appears at the top of the page which reads: "Well, excuse me, Princess," along with a female elf emoji. It's a fun little reference to Link's catchphrase in the short-lived Legend of Zelda animated series. Fans will remember episodes aired on Fridays attached to the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_6gccuhhfY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i_6gccuhhfY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Bragason, an English actress, gained recognition with her role in the 2017 series Three Girls and later appeared in the 2021 horror film Censor. She also voiced young Luna in Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy (2021), a CG film tied to Final Fantasy XV. Since then, she has taken on various TV and film roles. Ainsworth, also an English actor, is known for his work in The Haunting of Bly Manor, Flora &amp; Ulysses, and Disney's live-action Pinocchio.</p><p>A live-action Legend of Zelda movie is in development, co-produced by Nintendo and Sony Pictures. Directed by Wes Ball (Maze Runner, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes), the film will be produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Marvel producer Avi Arad. Ball has stated he aims for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-director-swinging-for-live-action-miyazaki-aesthetics/1100-6519717/" data-ref-id="1100-6519717">visual style inspired by Studio Ghibli</a> while keeping the story grounded in reality.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda movie is currently scheduled to be released on May 7, 2027.</p>

<p>We spent a day at The Chinese Room's studio in Brighton, England, and had the opportunity to tour the workspace, interview developers, and, of course, go hands-on with Bloodlines 2. Our cover story dives deep into the character options, the game's history, and our impressions of the combat in an open-world Seattle. We played as all four of the game's playable clans, and we'll go in-depth on how skill progression works. Of course, all of this coverage is wrapped in the context of Bloodlines 2's troubled development timeline, which we shed some light on for the uninitiated. As always, it's only the tip of the iceberg, and you'll be able to see the rest of our exclusive coverage all month long at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/Bloodlines2">GameInformer.com/Bloodlines2</a>.</p><p>The rest of the issue is jam-packed with content as well. Editor-in-chief Matt Miller traveled to Wizards of the Coast's headquarters to learn about two upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons books about the Forgotten Realms, a setting you'll find familiar if you played Baldur's Gate 3. Marcus Stewart spoke to Giant Squid's Matt Nava about Sword of the Sea and got exclusive details about a new area in the game. And Wesley LeBlanc dug deep into Grounded 2, the upcoming survival sequel from Obsidian, to learn everything he could about the game prior to its Game Preview launch next week.</p>
