<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 could be on its way to PlayStation 5 (PS5) sooner rather than later. According to a tease posted on social media by Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the Xbox console exclusive is likely one of the next first-party Xbox games to come to competing consoles.</p>



<p>In a reply to a user on Twitter who questioned “if” the game will come, Corden gave a more definitive tease of the possibility.</p>



<p>“Not if, “when!” and when is pretty soon from what I’ve been hearing,” <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1889342523807527095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. </p>

<p>The plan to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring more Xbox games</a> to PlayStation—and even Nintendo Switch—is something that Microsoft has been actively discussing for some time now. As sales of Xbox hardware continue to drop, the company is looking at all avenues to increase its gaming revenue moving forward. The most recent Xbox exclusive to be announced for PS5 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, which is set to launch this spring on the platform. Also coming in the spring is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. The latest rumors claim that Bethesda’s newest game is looking at an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April release</a>.</p>



<p>Sony announced on Tuesday its first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-state-of-play-for-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> for the year will take place on February 12.

            <p>
Following its multiplayer launch at the end of last year, free-to-play tactical FPS Delta Force will get its delayed single-player campaign mode, Black Hawk Down, next Friday, 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Delta Force - a revival of defunct developer NovaLogic's long-running shooter series - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-reviving-delta-force-fps-franchise">announced by publisher Tencent</a> in 2023. At the time, there was much talk of its single-player story campaign - inspired by Ridley Scott's 2002 movie Black Hawk Down and the classic Delta Force campaign of the same name - but it didn't materialise when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-call-of-duty-challenger-delta-force-hawk-ops-launching-as-pc-open-beta-this-december">Delta Force's multiplayer component launched into PC open beta</a> in December.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has given Black Hawk Down a slightly later than expected 21st February release date. It'll be playable both solo and co-operatively, with players taking on the role of an elite Delta Force operative as they "relive one of the most iconic military operations, where a straightforward capture operation turns into an impossible extraction." There's not much else to report just yet, but Tencent says it'll be sharing more "in the following days".

<p>
Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delta-force-hawk-ops-has-a-real-shot-at-knocking-call-of-duty-and-battlefield-off-their-perch">broadly impressed by Delta Force</a> when he played it ahead of its open beta launch last year, saying it had a "real shot at knocking Call of Duty and Battlefield off their perch". Its reception hasn't been quite so warm on Steam, however, with ongoing player complaints of rampant cheating having <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/">contributed to its "mixed" rating</a>.
</p>
<p>
Delta Force is currently only available on PC but the game - and its Black Hawk Down campaign - are set to arrive on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 at a later date.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>According to Activision founder Bobby Kotick, Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger was at one point in time interested in buying Nintendo, or at least interested in exploring the idea of buying Nintendo.</p><p>Kotick said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2MN7nJdijzjfcP232NsHZF?si=mHGPjwjXQMiFbuZZEWcgqA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grit podcast</a> that Munger was not a fan of video games, but saw an opportunity to potentially make a bid for Nintendo. Munger is said to have floated the idea of spending some of Berkshire's immense holdings on making moves in the video game space. One of Munger's ideas, apparently, was to buy Nintendo.</p><p>"He goes, 'You know, I was looking at a couple other companies in your sector. I think if we bought yours, we should buy that company Nintendo, too,'" Kotick recalled. "He said, 'Have you guys looked at it? I was like, 'Yeah.' It was trading [at the time] at like 13 billion, with 7 billion in cash. He goes, 'You know, I don't think anything is gonna go really bad before I'm dead, and then if it goes bad after I'm dead, they'll just chalk it up to the folly of an 82-year-old, so you don't have to be so concerned about disappointing me."</p><p>This came about at a time when the French conglomerate Vivendi was forced to sell its stake in Activision, and Berkshire Hathaway was in the mix to buy it. That didn't happen, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-completes-buyback-from-vivendi/1100-6415550/" data-ref-id="1100-6415550">Activision ultimately bought itself back from Vivendi</a>.</p><p>During one of his weekly Friday lunches with Munger, Kotick asked for advice on how to structure a buyback from Vivendi. It was at this time that Munger reportedly said he wanted to fund the buyback. When he got up to go to the bathroom, Activision's Brian Kelly said to Kotick that if Munger--an adept investor--wanted to buy the stake, then he and Kotick should want that as well. And that's eventually what happened.</p><p>"He didn't like the business [of video games]," Kotick said of Munger. "He thought it was a step removed from gambling. He's like, 'You know, you're preying off people's addictions.' And I was like, 'I'm not. I'm actually giving them joy and fun, and if you ever tried a video game, you'd see that.' He always had this... little bit of an aversion."</p><p>Of course, Berkshire did not buy Nintendo. As for Munger, he passed away in 2023 at the age of 99. Berkshire Hathaway currently has more than <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-does-berkshire-hathaway-own/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$325 billion in cash</a> and could theoretically try to buy pretty much any company on the open market, but it has not signaled any intent to buy a video game company.</p><h3><strong>Microsoft also tried to buy Nintendo</strong></h3><p>More than 20 years ago, Microsoft tried to buy Nintendo. Then-CEO Steve Ballmer sent staff to Japan to broach the idea, and the team apparently got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-tried-to-acquire-nintendo-square-and-midway-years-ago/1100-6485939/" data-ref-id="1100-6485939">laughed out of the room.</a></p><p>Berkshire did make a very big investment in the video game space in 2022, when it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/investing/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-activision-blizzard-microsoft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought almost 15 million shares of Activision Blizzard</a> just before Microsoft announced its intention to buy the company. Berkshire paid an average of about $66.50 per share, and that price surged tremendously after Microsoft announced its plans to buy Activision Blizzard. The deal was ultimately approved at $95 per share, so Berkshire no doubt made a very big profit on the investment.</p><h3><strong>Game Pass issues</strong></h3><p>Also in the interview, Kotick discussed Microsoft's blockbuster $75.4 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard, saying he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella "got the deal done in three days." Of course, it took more than a year for regulatory approval, but the framework was apparently decided in just 72 hours. The only disagreement Kotick and Nadella had around the deal focused on Microsoft's vision for Game Pass.</p><p>Kotick mentioned how World of Warcraft has been successful with its $15/month subscription cost, and that's just for one game. "Why would I put that into a Game Pass?" Kotick said. "I said to these guys, 'Why trade our flexible business models where you can do what's actually in the best interest of the customer.' I didn't believe in that. But the beauty if you're Microsoft... you can take that bet."</p><p>Kotick is not the only higher-up who has questioned the economic realities of Game Pass, as companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-is-worried-by-ps-plus-xbox-game-pass-and-/1100-6470836/" data-ref-id="1100-6470836">Devolver Digital have spoken critically of the service since day one.</a> Take-Two's Strauss Zelnick has also discussed why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">launching new games in Game Pass makes no sense for the company</a>. There are examples, too, of Game Pass actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/descenders-publisher-saw-descenders-xbox-one-sales/1100-6469046/" data-ref-id="1100-6469046">helping to drive game sales outside the subscription</a>, and Doom creator John Romero just recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-doesnt-hurt-game-companies-says-doom-co-creator/1100-6529136/" data-ref-id="1100-6529136">Game Pass doesn't hurt companies</a>.</p><p>Microsoft itself previously acknowledged that Game Pass can, in some cases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-does-decrease-base-game-sales-microsoft-says/1100-6511473/" data-ref-id="1100-6511473">cannibalize game sales</a>--but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">not in every case</a>.</p>

The Monk class will join Tibia's four original classes--Sorcerer, Paladin, Druid, and Knight--which launched alongside the top-down 2D MMO in 1997.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed in a <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=newsarchive&amp;id=8214" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> and teaser video, the Monk will be a melee fighter that can also provide a support role by healing allies. CipSoft said the Monk can be "played in a very special way" but wanted to make sure it fit seamlessly into the world of Tibia and existed in harmony with the game's existing four classes. The team also knew it wanted to introduce a new melee class that could also heal, but didn't want it to encroach on secondary roles like debuffing filled by Paladin and Sorcerers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMzXYOz6o7I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DMzXYOz6o7I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"In fact, one of our main goals was to ensure that the new vocation holds a unique position without undermining the value of others or rendering them obsolete," CipSoft said. "We are very happy about the arrival of the Monk and hope you are just as eager to experience what it is like when they spring into action."</p><p dir="ltr">The Monk will feature a few unique mechanics, such as the Harmony, Virtue, and Serene systems. Using specific attacks will build up Harmony that can then be consumed to heavily boost the Monk's power, while Virtues are powerful buffs the Monk can choose between. Monks in a Serene state will be considerably more powerful, but can only be achieved while playing solo or when there are six or fewer monsters nearby. CipSoft said the Serene system is to ensure that Monks are strong in specific scenarios when Serene, but won't surpass the damage of other classes or the Knight's ability to tank when not in a Serene state.</p><p dir="ltr">CipSoft said it will be rolling out five blogs in the coming days and weeks to dive into the design and development of the Monk. As for when the Monk will be playable, CipSoft said it will officially arrive later this year, with the chance to test the new class starting on February 25.</p><p dir="ltr">Tibia is free-to-play, with the option to pay and upgrade to a premium subscription that grants various perks like an XP boost, access to more areas, the ability to purchase homes, and other benefits.</p>

midseason updates include more game modes, limited-time events, and quality-of-life updates across all modes.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start of Season 2, Activision teased that a melee-focused set of new weapons would be revealed for the midseason update. There is also a St. Patrick's Day: Clover Craze holiday event, and more details should arrive closer to the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 is themed around ninjas, and multiple dataminers suggest that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-tmnt-crossover-could-be-coming/1100-6529089/">TMNT-themed crossover is planned</a> for the midseason update. This is rumored to have an event and limited-time game mode themed around the turtles. Rumored operator bundles for the skateboarding, pizza-eating Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fit the theme of this midseason update, as we have a set of teased melee weapons and the return of Call of Duty's Grind skatepark map.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual katanas were teased in promos for the launch of Season 2, with the additional melee weapons rumored to be a pair of sais, nunchucks, a bo staff, and a skateboard.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty previously had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-tmnts-shredder-with-a-gun-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-warzone-2/1100-6512543/">TMNT collab with the Shredder operator bundle</a> introduced in 2022's Modern Warfare 2, but the crossover felt odd without mention of the turtles themselves.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4442456-bo6-season-02-announcement-011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442456" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4442456-bo6-season-02-announcement-011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442456"></a><figcaption>Season 2's Grind map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4442456-bo6-season-02-announcement-011.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6_multiplayer">Black Ops 6 multiplayer</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 2 Reloaded includes two more multiplayer maps: Bullet and Grind. Bullet is a new map that takes place on a moving bullet train, and this will be available in 6v6 playlists as well as 2v2 Gunfight. Grind is the 6v6 skatepark map originally from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also adds a new perk. The Hunter's Instinct is an Enforcer perk in slot two, which, when equipped, will mark the nearest enemy whenever the player eliminates someone.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Zombies">Zombies</h2><p dir="ltr">Players shouldn't expect a new Zombies map. The Tomb arrived with the launch of Season 2, so the midseason update will likely be focused on quality-of-life updates for the map. However, there could be special limited-time modes themed around the upcoming holiday or the rumored TMNT event, similar to the Squid Game mode in Zombies for Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Directed Mode also arrives for The Tomb, which is the guided mode that helps players complete the main story quest. Completing the quest in Directed Mode won't allow players to earn all the unique rewards, but anyone looking to complete the story quest for the rewards can use our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-the-tomb-story-easter-egg-guide/2900-6181/">full guide for The Tomb main Easter egg quest</a> here.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Activision hasn't included many midseason announcements for battle royale. However, the update will add a new perk in slot one called Low Profile, which enables players to move more quickly while crouched and prone, as well as move slightly faster when downed.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of Season 2 of Warzone is dedicated to game improvements and anti-cheat updates, and the developer previously confirmed some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-dev-confirms-plans-to-scale-back-warzone-content-as-it-looks-to-improve-game/1100-6528901/">new content planned for Season 2 was shifted</a> in order to focus on game updates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-players-wont-be-missing-out-if-they-largely-ignore-one-protagonist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has assured that Assassin's Creed Shadows players who largely ignore one of the dual protagonists won't be "missing out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Jonathan Dumont told <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a> said Assassin's Creed Shadows won't force players to play as both the stealthy Naoe and the brutish Yasuke in equal measure when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month">it arrives March 20</a>, nor will it lock off certain parts of the game to those who prefer one over the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think you're missing out on things too much," Dumont said. "I think it's more on your preference to [say], 'Okay, I'll see how the game will adapt a little bit to the character if you choose one over the other.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They get individual introductions and then they get their own questline also. Let's say [for] Naoe, a personal questline cannot be played by Yasuke and those are two distinct things. But the core of the game can be pick your character and the game adapts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe has a play style reminiscent of the original Assassin's Creed games or, ironically, the most recent Assassin's Creed Mirage, which prioritises stealth and encourages full combat only as a last resort.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a stark difference to Yasuke who emulates the more aggressive elements of the role-playing game Assassin's Creed entries, meaning Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. He charges head on into battle instead of sticking to the shadows like Naoe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're not imposing players try to split the time," Dumont said. "If you prefer one character for any reason, you can play maybe, I don't know, I'm not going to put a percentage, but quite a bit of the game using one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But if you want to balance it out... I play quite a bit balanced out and what happens is, I play with one for three, four, five hours, and then I switch, and then I just play two, three hours. Usually I play stealth and then I [say], 'All right, let me destroy some camps and stuff all right for a while.' And then I just change like that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot rests on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows as not only the long-awaited Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</a> following recent flops and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes">investor frustration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however, with the development team having to apologize on separate occasions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed Shadows' depictions of Japan</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">using a historical recreation group's flag without permission</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design, and combined with the two delays, fans are growing increasingly impatient as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GTA 6’s parent company has stated they are “not worried” about the game influencing violent behaviour in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Violence in video games has been a controversial subject in the industry for years, with the GTA series often being the poster boy for such campaigns. The popular series will receive a brand new instalment this fall, with Rockstar finally releasing GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year</a>. Many wonder if new allegations related to violence will pop up again, but Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, doesn’t seem to be worried about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/10/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-take-two-interactive-chairman-and-ceo-strauss-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-publisher-claps-back-against-tv-media-inciting-disproven-violent-video-game-rhetoric/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a>), Zelnick was asked whether he had concerns about GTA 6’s violence impacting the real world. He responded that he was “not worried.” Zelnick added, “To be clear: entertainment doesn’t create behaviour; entertainment reflects behaviour.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CEO explained that entertainment allows people to express and engage with feelings as it tells stories. “The notion [that] entertainment creates behaviour has been tested and disproved over and over again.” Therefore, he isn’t concerned about GTA 6 influencing people to commit violence against others in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelnick also discussed TV shows and movies with “very realistic-looking” violence, which doesn’t influence wrong behaviour; hence, he’s “not worried about photorealistic video games” inciting such behaviour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping sell more consoles</a>. Also, the parent company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-stock-hits-all-time-high-after-gta-6-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stocks rose to an all-time high</a> when they reconfirmed the fall 2025 release window. Do you think GTA 6 will influence violent behaviour in the real world?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said that Activision offered world-famous skateboarder Tony Hawk $300k to lend his name and likeness to the first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game--an offer that came at a low point for him financially.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick claimed that Hawk was living in his car at the time, going through his second divorce.

And that was the explosion of the business in some ways," Kotick explained.</p><p>In 2019, Hawk said that Activision offered him a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/tony-hawk-activision-offered-him-500000-in-royalties-but-he-said-no.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$500k buyout for any future royalties</a>, but he turned that down. Hawk's decision paid off, as he revealed that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/bk8osb/til_tony_hawk_got_4_million_dollars_on_one_of_his/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he received four million in royalty checks</a> after Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 was released.</p><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was released in 1999 for the original PlayStation. It was then later remade for modern platforms in 2020 as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. The last mainline entry in the series was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-hes-no-longer-working-with-activisi/1100-6457017/" data-ref-id="1100-6457017">marking the end of Hawk's contract with Activision</a>.</p><p>While remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/" data-ref-id="1100-6523189">reportedly not in the works</a>, Hawk <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">confirmed that the series will continue on</a>.</p>

This is according to posts on LinkedIn from recently laid off staff and confirmed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails">reporting from <em>Game Developer</em></a> and<em> <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/">80.lvl</a></em>. According to reports, employees were notified via emails sent out at 5 AM local time, while the layoffs affect a number of different teams within the the game engine software company. According to <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451/11">a message posted in the Unity forums</a>, one of the casualties in the layoffs was the entire Behavior department which built tools that assisted in NPC scripting. It’s not clear at this point how many employees were impacted.</p><p>Unity has been on shaky ground for the last two years, undergoing several rounds of layoffs amid other upheavals. In January 2024, Unity eliminated 25 percent of its workforce or around 1,800 employees. Before that in November 2023, Unity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/28/23980250/unity-confirms-layoffs">closed several office locations and cut 265 jobs</a>.</p><p>Before that was one of the events that likely contributed to all the layoffs: the company’s disastrous deployment of its Runtime fee. The fee, which initially intended to charge developers a small fee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">for every download</a> of a Unity game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23872330/unity-developers-react-new-pricing-model">was roundly rejected by prominent indie developers</a>. Several voiced their concerns on social media, while others threatened and, in the case of a collective of mobile developers, actually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/15/23875396/unity-mobile-developers-ad-monetization-tos-changes">enacted a boycott of the software</a>.</p><div><p>The fallout led to Unity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23882768/unity-new-pricing-model-update">revamping the runtime fee</a> and resulted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">CEO John Riccitiello retiring</a> less than a month after the runtime announcement. <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Unity for comment.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Why else would most bosses allow five characters to enter if not for five different vocations?”</p><p>There’s no specific release date for the Monk class yet, though it will be available to test starting on February 25. ClipSoft plans to release new blogs with more details about the class in the coming weeks.</p><p>“All in all, we see the addition of a new vocation as an opportunity to rekindle the sense of discovery that was always part of <em>Tibia</em>,” said ClipSoft. “A chance to learn the intricacies of a new vocation, experiment with new strategies, and adapt to new team compositions.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More layoffs are happening at Unity. According to a post on its forums by Shanee Nishry, Unity has let go the team working on Unity Behavior along with other staff.</p>



<p>In her post, <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nishry says</a> that the entire was included in the latest round of layoffs with support ending immediately. </p>



<p>“Thank you for your love and support for our project,” Nishry said. “Unfortunately we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer.</p>



<p>“I’ve reached out to leadership to ask if they can open source the project, but there is no guarantee.”</p>



<p>Nishry, who has been with Unity for five years, closed saying she wished Behavior could’ve been brought to the finish line. For those unaware, Behavior <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.behavior@1.0/manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was a tool in development</a> for “authoring behaviors used to control non-player characters (NPCs) or objects.”</p>



<p>As far as other teams including in the layoffs, they seem to spread across the company with another senior software developer, Coline Turquin, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294738324894691329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirming that she was</a> also “part of the recent layoffs”. Other employees have also taken to social media to reveal that they were let go by the company.</p>



<p>As of writing, Unity has yet to make an official statement on the layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Unity for comment and clarification regarding how many people were let go in this latest wave. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. In 2024, the company let <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-laying-off-25-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go roughly 1,800 people</a>. Those layoffs cost Unity <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-cost-unity-205-million-to-make-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around $205 million</a>.</p>

                <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has commented on the long wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI </a>and spoke out against the idea that artificial intelligence technologies will surpass the "creative genius" that is only possible from humans. In an interview, Zelnick said the wait for GTA 6 has been so long in part because developer Rockstar Games is seeking "perfection."</p><p>"What Rockstar Games puts into all of their titles is a desire for creative perfection, which is why it takes a long time and why it's complex. We don't claim success until it occurs," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2POQ_toFtgc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>.</p><p>GTA 5 was released all the way back in 2013 and has been released across three generations of console platforms, in addition to PC. In total, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">sold more than 210 million copies</a>. Zelnick said GTA 5 has been the "standard bearer" at Take-Two and the video game industry overall in terms of sales success.</p><p>"Grand Theft Auto 6? What can I say? There is enormous anticipation inside our company and in the marketplace as a whole. We couldn't be more excited," he said.</p><p>After years of development, GTA 6 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">set for release in Fall 2025 across PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Zelnick recently admitted the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">could be delayed</a>, but for now, it remains on track for release this year. Before this, Zelnick said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-gta-6-news-is-frustrating-fans-take-two-boss-admits/1100-6528571/" data-ref-id="1100-6528571">understands that fans are frustrated over the long wait for GTA 6. </a></p><p>As for his comments on AI, Zelnick said Take-Two's teams have been using digital tools since the earliest days of video game development, going on to say that the video game industry is known to be an innovator in this area. He said he expects that to continue with new AI technologies, but he also made it clear that AI cannot replace a human when it comes to creativity.</p><p>"The genius is human. The tools may be digital, but the creative genius is human," he said. "We believe in protecting and paying human beings. We believe we ought to pay for their work if it's replicated by AI after the work is done. We don't think it's the right thing to do to ask someone to perform once, use their work over and over again, and not pay for it. We don't think that's right."</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said artificial intelligence as a term makes no sense because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">machines do not learn--humans do.</a> "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever," he said. "I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment."</p><p>In other news, Zelnick recently discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-launch-could-help-improve-console-sales-significantly-take-two-boss-says/1100-6529348/" data-ref-id="1100-6529348">a big game like GTA 6 could help lift console sales. </a></p>

			<p>A new era of online multiplayer PvP battles will be coming on March 4, when War Robots: Frontiers releases and is set to redefine the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steel-hunters-is-wargamings-new-mech-themed-hero-shooter/">tactical mech warfare genre</a>. For those who want to play this game, it will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One <a href="https://warrobotsfrontiers.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for free</a>. To celebrate the announcement of the release date, you can check out the brand new cinematic trailer that was released.</p>
<p><iframe title="War Robots: Frontiers | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWLV7KZFSH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In War Robots: Frontiers, players will get the opportunity to be in the cockpit of their mechs and experience piloting a War Robot. War Robots is already a massive franchise, with over 270 million fans across the globe. War Robots: Frontiers is said to be a huge step for the franchise, a game that has been built from the ground up for both PC and console in Unreal Engine 5. It will be a game that is ideal for those who like competitive play.</p>
<p>Its also been developed to be relatively accurate and authentic, where every step the mech takes will reverberate with authentic weight. Every shot that is fired from your mech will have realistic recoil. Being developed in Unreal Engine 5 means that this game will give players a highly realistic and dynamic battlefield to fight on, where every single move and shot made by the mechs will have realistic movement and help you feel as if you are actually in the mech.</p>
<p>Customization will be a major feature of War Robots: Frontiers, where players can design their mechs in any way they want to, from the chassis, core, weapons, and skill upgrades to create a mech that fits your playstyle and the way you want to tackle combat. By having this much customization, you can choose whether your mech is a huge chunk of steel with firepower, or you can streamline it so that it has agile defenses and the ability to outplay the opponent.</p>
<p>If you're new to the War Robots franchise, this game is aiming to be highly accessible for the newer generations and new players. This includes the ability to play the game by utilizing prebuilt mechs so that you can get used to the look and feel of the game before being overwhelmed by building your own mech. Of course, for those who prefer to build from the ground up, you'll be able to customize it as much as you need to in order to make it battlefield-ready.</p>
<p>The game will also have cross-platform online play, so you can play with your friends on PC and console. There will be multiple game modes available, including ranked modes for those who prefer a dedicated challenge.</p>
<p>War Robots: Frontiers will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 4.</p>

According to <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451/11">a message posted in the Unity forums</a>, one of the casualties in the layoffs was the entire Behavior department which built tools that assisted in NPC scripting. It’s not clear at this point how many employees were impacted.</p><p>Unity has been on shaky ground for the last two years, undergoing several rounds of layoffs amid other upheavals. In January 2024, Unity eliminated 25 percent of its workforce or around 1,800 employees. Before that in November 2023, Unity <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/28/23980250/unity-confirms-layoffs">closed several office locations and cut 265 jobs</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610165/unity-layoffs-2025-runtime-fee">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTExODI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272699/unity-6-game-engine-release">Unity attempts to turn things around with its latest game engine release</a></h2><div><p><cite>Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Unity hasn’t had the easiest go of things as of late, but as part of its efforts to get back in the good graces of game developers, the company has released Unity 6 globally.

Unity charges developers on a per-user basis, but in September 2023, the company announced a new pricing scheme that charged developers per install of their games after a certain threshold.

Instead of the runtime fee, Unity will return to a per-seat subscription model.</p><p>Last year, Unity caused a stir within the game development community with a controversial update to its pricing model. Instead of charging developers a set monthly rate based on the number of users utilizing the software, it would implement a pay-per-download scheme that charged developers every time their game was downloaded. That meant instead of paying a flat, predictable rate to Unity, payouts could fluctuate, resulting in potentially higher fees.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242937/unity-runtime-fee-cancelled-subscription-pricing">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjQ1OTQ=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180241/major-nelson-larry-hryb-unity-community-xbox">Major Nelson is joining Unity</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Larry Hryb, aka “Major Nelson,” has his next job.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> features an absolutely dreadful spider monster - a spider that, going by preview encounters and trailers, strives for the point on the Venn diagram between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> and the demon arachnid from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a>. The spider monster is called the Lala Barina. If I saw "Lala Barina" out of context I would assume I was reading about a successor to Suzuki's subcompact automobile the Holden Barina, whose brave and sturdy outline once graced the roads of Oceania. I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.</p><!--more-->

<p>The good news is that the Lala Barina isn't just an absolute bastard spider. It's a teacher. This is the impression given by Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and director Yuya Tokuda, who have been talking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/521156/monster-hunter-wilds-interview-preview">Polygon</a> about the game's newly newcomer-friendly design. "Looking back at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> and Monster Hunter Rise, we focused on where first-time players would drop out from the game," Tsujimoto told the site. "From there, we analyzed that player data and looked into how much we can address - that was our homework for Monster Hunter Wilds."</p>
<p>The fruits of this analysis come across throughout in the addition of handholds like the Seikret, a rideable lizard who'll guide you towards your prey. But they're especially apparent in the game's first few hours, which are sort of one big tutorial. While learning the ropes, you'll tangle with the toadlike Chatacabra, the bovine Doshaguma (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo">alas! My beloved</a>), the Brute Wyvern Quematrice, the Rompompolo - a T-Rex crossed with a mosquito - and our lovely friend the Lala Barina. </p>
<p>Should you find these creatures appalling, you may rejoice in the knowledge that they are there to subtly inculcate the basics of Monster Hunting. "At the beginning of the game, you'll first fight Chatacabra, which teaches the players how to avoid big attacks," Tokuda explained to Polygon. "For Quematrice, the next monster that you fight, it uses its long tail. It has a very wide area attack, so it teaches you to dodge. Next is Lala Barina, which uses a lot of tricky movements; it moves out of sight of players, so it teaches them how to control their camera." The Lala Barina harbours other lessons for new players: its many status effects result from a rich diet of forest mushrooms. Perhaps you'll learn about those mushrooms while it's kicking your arse.

</p><p>You know, it all reminds me of how Halo: Combat Evolved taught us the basics of camera control. Halo did it by having a guy hold up a flashlight for you to look at while securely lodged in a cryopod. Seems a bit gentle by comparison. Perhaps Capcom could shore up the association by having the Lala Barina wield some glowsticks. This would also usefully prevent it from using some of its limbs to murder you. </p>
<p>I'm also reminded of Bloodborne, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/souls-devs-fromsoftware-also-want-bloodborne-on-pc-even-if-the-games-own-director-cant-admit-it">which will surely release on PC one of these days</a>: there's a boss in that game, Father Gascoigne, who has a terrifying launch attack that opens with him dragging his blade across the terrain in a cacophony of sparks. That move always used to paralyse me till I realised that the theatrical wind-up exists to teach you how to parry. Yes, this seems closer to the Wilds experience.</p>
<p>I'm writing this article partly because Wilds is making a big deal of tying the simulated ecology into the "gamier" elements, and I really like the idea that certain boss anatomies and behaviours are elaborate pedagogic devices. Perhaps building on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/animal-well-review">my Animal Well review</a> from last year, I think there is much to say about how digital interfaces may become bestial and how beasts may come to resemble HUD elements and how all that connects to older traditions of animal symbolism and heraldry. If you're less enthused about such topics than you are bothered about having to fight a schoolmasterly tarantula, the buried lede, I guess, is that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia">Monster Hunter Wilds has an arachophobia mode</a>.</p>
