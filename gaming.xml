		<p>Transformers: Reactivate has been in production since 2019, when Certain Affinity developed the game under a different name, Transformers: Rise. Splash Damage re-announced the game at The Game Awards in 2022 but since then, there has been radio silence, with just a leaked video of an old build showing us what the game was like.</p>
<p>Splash Damage have now announced they are cancelling the game and there will be redundancies as they “refocus on other projects”.&nbsp; Why the game has been cancelled is unclear, although it’s obviously had a rocky development path.&nbsp; Hasbro have said they really want to move in to video games themselves so maybe they pulled the plug and have another game with their own studio waiting in the wings.</p>


<p>Transformers: Reactivate was set in the future where Earth has already fallen and the Autobots are our last hope, fighting a new enemy called The Legion, “the greatest threat the Autobots have ever faced.” This explained the generic robots enemies in the trailer and not a hint of a Decepticon. Apart from that leaked information suggested the game was a free-to-play multiplayer PvE game, perhaps similar to Destiny.</p>
<p>Transformers games should not be that hard to get right, you already have the classes, you have the combat, and most of all you have over a thousand characters to choose.&nbsp; The Cybertron games got it right, as did Devestation, but since then attempts at Transformers games have been fair at best.&nbsp;The most recent Transformers game, Galactic Trials, is downright awful and should be avoided like the plague.</p>
<p>Clearly I should never have championed the game on our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/30/our-most-wanted-games-of-2024-15-to-11/"> Most Wanted of 2025 list!</a></p>

			<p>The new year has just begun, and unfortunately, there has already been some bad news. Splash Damage has <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a> that they have made the decision to end development on Transformers: Reactivate. Along with this means that there will also be a number of staff being made redundant, as they are reshuffling their studio and refocusing on other projects within the studio. Transformers: Reactivate was <a href="https://wccftech.com/transformers-mmo-by-certain-affinity-moved-to-splash-damage-report/">first announced in December 2022</a>, with minimal news coming out about it after the initial announcement.</p>
<p>The title was set to be a 1-4 player online action game that would be on PC and consoles, where you would have to reassemble the Autobots that were left in pieces in the debris. It was created in collaboration with Hasbro, Inc. The cinematic trailer for this title seemed promising, and had a lot of Transformers fans excited. Splash Damage is the studio behind Dirty Bomb, Gears Tactics, and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.</p>
<p>The full announcement from Splash Damage reads as the following:</p>
<p><i>Today, we have some very difficult news to share, the decision has been made to end the development of Transformers: Reactivate.</i></p>
<p><em>This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy.</em></p>
<p><em>This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people. We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on Transformers for their dedication and passion.</em></p>
<p><em>Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout, and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going.</em></p>
<p><em>While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We're now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your compassion and understanding.</em></p>
<p>While they will no longer be working on this title, they announced in March 2023 that they are creating a new project called "Project Astrid" alongside streamers Shroud and Sacriel. The game is set to be an open-world survival game. Hopefully, those who were working on Transformers: Reactivate will be given the option to stay at the company, working on Project Astrid.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Splash Damage has announced that upcoming online multiplayer action game&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, and that a number of roles at the studio may now be "at risk of redundancy".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media platform X, Splash Damage says that as well as canceling&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, the studio will be "scaling down to refocus [its] efforts on other projects", which is why some staff may be laid off.</p>

<p>The studio doesn't specify which staff members or which departments are most at risk, but it does say that "having to say goodbye" to employees "hurts even more" than not being able to release&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-shooting.jpg?itok=CfmFSIbA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-shooting.jpg?itok=vLiSwSQW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</em>has been, well, deactivated.</figcaption></figure><p>The cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. The game was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-at-game-awards-2022" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards opening ceremony back in 2022</a>, but since then, Splash Damage has been pretty quiet about its development.</p>

<p>Outside of the (admittedly rather evocative) announcement trailer, Splash Damage didn't reveal much about&nbsp;<em>Reactivate</em>, save that it would be an online-focused action game for 1-4 players and that it would come to PC and consoles.</p>

<p>Following the initial reveal, however, Splash Damage did announce that it had purchased <i>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</i>development partner Bulkhead. As far as we know, Bulkhead remains a Splash Damage subsidiary despite the cancellation.</p>

<p>At some point, Splash Damage planned to hold a closed beta for the game, but it looks like that test never materialized either, at least for public-facing signups.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-hand.jpg?itok=KeBPR9Sq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-hand.jpg?itok=zOYj60Ie 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unfortunately, Splash Damage won't get to realize its vision for the multiplayer-focused&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Between this cancellation and the <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17512/transformers-galactic-trials" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">underwhelming release</a> of Outright Games'&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-galactic-trials-announcement" rel="nofollow">action-racing roguelite</a>&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Galactic Trials</em>, it seems that&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>fans are having a pretty bad couple of years when it comes to video game adaptations of the property.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like Splash Damage is shutting down entirely as a result of this cancellation, so we'll have to wait and see what the studio does next. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>As someone who believes in the <em>ideal</em> of the trim, tidy PC interior, I do applaud the intent behind MSI’s Project Zero X. Currently on show at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a>, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.</p>
<p>The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a <em>one hundred</em> percent chance I will ruin it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I can’t remember if I’ve ever confessed this before, but I absolutely fucking suck at cable management. Just, abysmal. I can’t get them straight. I can’t get them bending where I want them. I can’t figure out what to do with the slack except stuff it under the PSU shroud like a bundle of old Christmas lights that just barely fit back in their box. I almost considered begging Liam (RPS in peace) not to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-tidy-cables-reassemble-pc-case">shoot that video</a> of me bumbling through the process because I knew it would out me as some kind of hardware fraud, a Frank Abagnale with zipties. Remember, it’s not imposter syndrome if you’re genuinely an imposter.</p>
<p>Point being, it doesn’t matter what MSI have done with the Project Zero X case, even if they have gone to such ginnard-concealing lengths that it’s somehow got the GPU outputs pointing out of the side. If I try to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-build-a-pc">build a PC</a> with this, it will be full of stray cables, and its entire purpose will be undermined. I don’t know how. But I’ll find a way.</p><p>Still, for less deficient PC builders, this could make for quite the statement piece. Provided, anyway, that the still-traditional blend of glass and metal remains within the boundaries of Your Kinda Thing. Opinions on chassis designs can of course vary, even in the relatively tiny sample size of the current RPS team: per a meeting this morning where I brought up the Project Zero X, it turns out Graham wants to see as little of his PC’s insides as possible, Edwin dislikes anything painted black or with lights, and Nic wishes his was made out of wood. Maybe not the case for us lot, then.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
This is a quiet month for video game releases, as January tends to be, but there’s at least one approaching asteroid in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers-2">Space Engineers 2</a>. Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-25-favourite-space-games-of-all-time">your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game</a> - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-engineers-diary-part-one-wolves">a seven-part diary series</a> featuring many a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wastes-of-space-a-space-engineers-diary-part-two-the-vengabus-cometh">starfaring Vengabus</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wastes-of-space-a-space-engineers-diary-part-five-spidergeddon">Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider</a>.</p>
<p>It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/">Steam early access</a> on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As you may have cunningly deduced using your advanced simian brain, the sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers">Space Engineers</a> is once again about engineering in space. It’s a first-person sandbox crafting and exploration game set in the mysterious Almagest star system, many centuries and lightyears from now.</p>
<p>Some trivia: the original Amalgest was a 2nd-century astronomical treatise on the motions of the stars and planets, written by Claudius Ptolemy. I have not read the Amalgest, but I do not believe it makes mention of "a 25cm unified grid building system", or indeed "magboots with camera stabilisation". You will encounter both of these things in the first alpha build of Space Engineers 2, which introduces a Creative mode together with refined building tools, including an undo/redo function and a new blueprint system with grid-snapping and partial copy-paste.
</p>
<p>
The new VRAGE3 engine promises "a visual revolution thanks to ray tracing, global illumination, tessellated terrain, parallax mapping, sleek armor edges, and enhanced lighting". Here's the announcement trailer so you can watch it all sparking and spurting away.</p>

<p>As per <a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2/#current">the Space Engineers 2 early access roadmap</a>, the first update after the alpha launch will add a user-generated content workshop. After that, they’re planning an update that makes unspecified improvements and refinements to play mechanics and the interface. Then comes an update with proper modding support, including a mod hub and editor. 
</p><p>
And then, the Good stuff: walkable planets with bodies of water, multiplayer, factions of non-player characters, survival mode, and a story campaign. The campaign is the tale of two brothers who’ve arrived in the Amalgest system after several thousand years in cryosleep. It’ll be broken into missions. They're also planning a sandbox campaign option with no story backbone, in which you progress simply by building ships and wrangling with the factions.
</p>
<p>
In the video below, Keen Software’s CEO Marek Rosa goes over the details of the roadmap, while fielding questions from the Space Engineers community. Amongst other things, he stresses the importance of making the simulation more intuitive – for example, by adding a little of creative mode’s simplicity to survival mode by means of new “backpack building” and “projection building” systems. He also talks up the swoleness of the engine, which supports grander feats such as instantly duplicating entire hand-assembled battlecruisers, but also lends itself to little flourishes such as blocks that fracture believably when you blast them.

<p>
As for the original Space Engineers, it’s not going anywhere. Keen Software plan to maintain it alongside development of the new game. No <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>-2-style rugpull here.
</p>
<p>
I confess, I’m writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers-2">Space Engineers 2</a> partly because some of you fine people mentioned it in the comments for my article on Shiro’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spacecraft-is-aiming-for-the-gap-between-starfield-satisfactory-and-eve-online">SpaceCraft</a>, which appears to place more emphasis on galactic exploration and relatively contained, automatable acts of resource extraction and production. I think I like the sound of Space Engineers 2 a shade more than SpaceCraft, in that going by trailers, you can physically walk around asteroids in three dimensions, using the aforesaid magboots. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yes-you-can-spacewalk-in-starfield-and-yes-i-am-trying-to-build-an-asteroid-outpost">I wish I could have done that in Starfield</a>. Ptolemy would have been ecstatic, I'm sure.

<p>Developer Splash Damage has announced that the online co-op game Transformers: Reactivate has been cancelled just over two years after it was first announced. Alongside the game’s cancellation, the studio is also set to lay off an unknown number of developers.</p>



<p>The studio made the announcement in a post on social media on Wednesday while saying they are going to “refocus” on other projects.</p>



<p>“Today, we have some very difficult news to share, the decision has been made to end development of Transformers: Reactivate,” the statement reads. “This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy.”</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that the “decision did not come lightly”, and that it’s a “difficult” time for everyone at the studio. They then went on to thank Hasbro for their support before talking about the short term future.</p>



<p>“While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more,” they said. “We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Splash Damage for clarification on the number of roles that will be impacted by the layoffs. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>Last year saw <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 15,000 known jobs</a> lost in the games industry. In just the first eight days of 2025, there have been a least four known layoffs, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-gaming-layoffs-of-2025-have-happened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netmarble F&amp;C</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-down-answered/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2-server-status-is-counter-strike-2-down-answered.1077192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-down-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With more than a million people playing Counter-Strike 2 on any given day, server status is an important factor to monitor. While it doesn’t happen often, CS2 has been down in the past due to a variety of reasons.</p>



<p>There’s nothing more frustrating (other than a costly missed smoke) than not being able to play CS2 at all. Here’s all the tools you need to be able to check on CS2’s server status and see if it’s down.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-cs2-server-status">How to Check CS2 Server Status</h2>



<p>There are a number of third-party websites that can relay Steam and Counter-Strike 2 server information to you. <a href="https://www.csgodatabase.com/csgo-steam-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSGO Database</a> appears to be the most complete by our judgment. It provides the status of CS2 services like the API, player inventories and the matchmaking scheduler, as well as the status of all the regional servers. Additionally, CSGO Database provides current metrics for online players, active servers, and the total number of players searching for a match.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: CSGO Database</figcaption></figure>



<p>If there are any issues affecting server availability, <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/counter-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DownDetector</a> might provide some more insight. This website tracks the number of problems reported with CS2’s servers, showing spikes in reports over the past 24 hours and a “live outage” report. There’s also an option to switch to one of dozens of other countries. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cs2-down">Why is CS2 Down?</h2>



<p>CS2 is subject to regular maintenance like any other persistent online multiplayer game. Problems with Steam servers routinely happen on Tuesdays when servers are taken down for maintenance. CS2 itself will go down for a small amount of time when new updates go live, and many players attempt to sign in right away after these updates, so the number of reported outages will spike.</p>



<p>On rare occasions, a larger issue that needs to be addressed by the developers will force CS2 down for a long time. In that case, Valve will typically post directly to <a href="https://x.com/CounterStrike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@CounterStrike on X</a> informing players of what’s going on.</p>



<p>What’s the longest that Counter-Strike has ever been down for you? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you want to unlock free daily cases and rewards in CS2,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

Splash Damage has announced it's cancelling the development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/transformers-reactivate">Transformers: Reactivate</a>, and that it'll be "scaling down" the studio as result, leaving roles "at risk of redundancy".
</p>
<p>
Transformers: Reactivate was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brink-developer-splash-damage-developing-transformers-reactivate">unveiled for PC and consoles</a> at The Game Awards back in 2022, promising online action for one to four players featuring some of the franchise's most iconic characters. However, little has been heard about the game since its reveal two years ago, and now Splash Damage has confirmed development has ceased.
</p>
<p>
"Today, we have some very difficult news to share," the company wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485">statement on social media</a>. "The decision has been made to end development of Transformers: Reactivate. This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy."

"This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people. We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on Transformers for their dedication and passion." Splash Damage, which is based in the UK, did not specify the reason for the game's cancellation, nor did it reveal how many jobs are at risk following today's news.

"Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout," it continued, "and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going."
</p>
<p>
"While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We're now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future."

<p>
"Thank you for your compassion and understanding."

			<p>Smite 2 has been in Alpha for a little while now, with new Gods being added pretty consistently to the game. At the moment, there are only two modes available, with players having the choice between playing Arena or Conquest. However, the MOBA is now set to enter Open Beta, allowing any who are interested to start playing it as of January 14. So, for those interested, you won't have long to wait.&nbsp; The game has been progressing at a steady rate, with most of the team at Hi-Rez swapping working on Smite to Smite 2. For those who haven't had access to Smite 2, there was a confirmed skeleton crew to be working on Smite just for small updates.</p>
<p>However, as they rearranged the team working on Smite, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/">led to layoffs</a> at the company that was not disclosed in the statement that Stewart Chisam wrote, but that the changes were "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was originally released in 2014, with its successor announced 12 months ago. This came after Hi-Rez celebrated 10 years of Smite, and now they are working on a new and improved that comes with multiple new Gods and plans to keep the game in action late into the 2030s.</p>
<p>At the moment, those who have wanted to play Smite 2 will have had to get a key for the Alpha via Smite 2 streams or purchase <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Founder's Pack on Steam</a>, which would give them extra bonuses in addition to access to the game as it develops.</p>
<p>With the release of the Free to Play Open Beta, it means that all of the pre-existing players and those who are just joining will get access to a ton of new content that will become available during this period specifically.</p>
<p>This includes five new Gods that will be added to the game, including Aladdin. Along with the variety of Gods in the game, there will also be three new game modes to jump into. These are Joust, Duel, and Assault, offering plenty of options for players who don't get on with the Conquest and Arena game modes that were already in the game. You can check out the Aladdin gameplay in the video below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/finspan-wingspan-creators-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>studio Stonemaier Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>family. As you've probably already guessed, the game expands the card-based engine-building gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>into the world of marine life.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which follows on from&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/embrace-your-inner-dracologist-with-wyrmspan" rel="nofollow">dragon-based successor&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em></a>, has you playing as a marine researcher who must observe aquatic life over three zones: the Sunlight Zone, the Twilight Zone, and the Midnight Zone.</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>'s dive sites will help you with a key aspect of your research, from growing your fish collection to discovering new eggs and even hatching eggs to create schools of fish. If you've played&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, you'll probably be familiar with the basic idea here, albeit with a marine twist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=yFRfN_Xc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=n-viEVPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>takes the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>formula to new depths, as it were.</figcaption></figure><p>Players will compete with one another to assemble vast arrays of marine life, with the winner being the player that gains the most points. You can score points through "fish, eggs, young, schools, and achievements", according to Stonemaier.</p>

<p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>designer Elizabeth Hargrave says that while she knew fish were often requested by fans of her game, she "didn't feel like [she] had the bandwidth to do them justice", but that she's "absolutely delighted"&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will soon be out there in the world.</p>

<p>Hargrave goes on to say that she hopes&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>"will inspire people to connect with the marine world and conservation in the same way that&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>has made people birders".</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which also shows off the game's beautiful board and fish card artwork, right here.</p>




<p><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will support up to five players of ages 10 and up, and a game should take you somewhere between 45 and 60 minutes to complete, which is roughly in keeping with&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>'s duration.</p>

<p>Notably, the game will also offer a solo play mode created by Automa Factory, the studio that also worked on solo play modes for Stonemaier titles like&nbsp;<em>Scythe&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tapestry</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>when it launches on January 22nd to <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/finspan/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">buy direct from Stonemaier</a>, followed by a wider retail release in February.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a bold claim onstage at CES earlier this week when he was introducing the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">next-generation RTX 50-series GPUs</a>. “The RTX 5070, 4090 performance at $549,” said Huang. It’s a claim that’s been echoed on YouTube, TikTok, and social media networks and has generated a debate over the RTX 50 series and DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation. </p><p>So, can a $549 RTX 5070 really deliver the same level of performance as a $1,5999 RTX 4090? The answer is yes and no, and it all comes down to a “fake frames” argument about DLSS Frame Generation that might not even be a big problem for a lot of PC gamers.</p><p>Nvidia’s big RTX 5070 claim is all based on its latest generation of DLSS. “Impossible without artificial intelligence,” admits Huang after promising that the RTX 5070 can deliver RTX 4090 levels of performance. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 has a new Multi Frame Generation technique</a> that can generate up to three additional frames per every traditionally rendered frame.</p><p>Some PC gamers have long argued that this technique, which Nvidia introduced originally with DLSS 3, is simply “fake frames” and not reflective of the true performance of GPUs that have been using rasterization for decades.</p><p>“Using neural rendering and DLSS 4 we can reach performance levels [on an RTX 5070] that were only possible with an RTX 4090,” explains Lars Weinand, a senior technical product manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “This does not mean that the RTX 5070 can beat an RTX 4090 in every single way and in every single configuration.”</p><p>When Nvidia says performance levels, it means frame rates: how many still images it can send to your screen that add up to a moving image — rather than whether that moving image looks the same quality. Nvidia has already shown what DLSS 4 is capable of in games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, boosting frame rates from DLSS 3.5 at 142fps to 243fps — a big leap from the 27fps without DLSS enabled. </p><div><figcaption><em>The DLSS 4 boost to frame rates.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>“In games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>Alan Wake 2,</em> you can match performance numbers [on an RTX 5070] using DLSS 4 compared to an RTX 4090 using only DLSS 3.5 Frame Generation,” says Weinand. “This is what the claim is based on, you see performance levels that were only before possible with an RTX 4090, but of course, that doesn’t mean that in every single configuration and graphics setting that you might pick that you will have the similar performance.”</p><p>As expected, you’re simply not going to see RTX 4090 levels of pure rasterization performance on an RTX 5070. It’s really all down to seeing a difference in games that support DLSS 4. As a result, Nvidia’s claim has reignited the “fake frames” debate. This all started when Nvidia first announced DLSS 3 Frame Generation, which works by using an algorithm to insert an additional frame after two successive images in order to smooth out movement in games and increase frame rates.</p><p>In DLSS 3, Nvidia generates a new image using Frame Generation every time a new image is rendered, allowing the GPU to use its full power to render regular frames and DLSS to utilize dedicated Tensor cores to boost frame rates and image quality.</p><p>With DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Nvidia is now able to generate up to three additional frames per every traditionally rendered frame. That means frame rates can be up to 8x more than traditional rendering. Nvidia has also switched to a new transformer model for DLSS 4, which it says will make its frame generation model 40 percent faster and use 30 percent less VRAM.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s still a lot to learn about DLSS 4, but during a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/jensen-says-dlss-4-predicts-the-future-to-increase-framerates-without-introducing-latency">Q&amp;A session at CES</a>, Huang said that DLSS 4 “predicts the future” rather than “interpolating the past.” That means the extra two frames that are generated by DLSS 4 won’t add a huge amount of latency to the experience.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-dlss-4-on-nvidias-new-geforce-rtx-5080"><em>Digital Foundry</em>&nbsp;found</a>&nbsp;that DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation has smoother frame times despite adding two additional frames compared to the existing Frame Generation. It also found that there is around an additional 6ms for the Multi Frame Generation on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">the RTX 5080</a>, on top of the existing Frame Generation found on the RTX 40 series.</p><p>“The latency is very small that we’re adding with Multi Frame Generation,” says Weinand. “With the GPU pacing that we’re doing, we make sure that frames are being displayed at a very even pace.”</p><p>Input latency, or the way a game feels, is very important in many games, and the results of DLSS 4 will depend on your input frame rate. DLSS 4 doesn’t appear to solve the issue of a 27fps game still feeling like slow once DLSS Super Resolution is involved, even if Multi Frame Generation can more than 8x the frame rate to 243fps. That’s been one of the main drawbacks of DLSS Frame Generation so far — that although a game can look visually smoother thanks to the additional frames, it still feels slower than if it were actually rendering at high frame rates. A lot of people might not even notice the input latency, but if you’re familiar with the feeling of dropping from 240fps to 60fps or even 30fps, then you probably will.</p><p>I think the “fake frames” debate really only matters when these technologies are impacting latency and image quality or the game still feels slow despite the extra generated frames. More games are starting to get full ray-tracing support to make them look dramatically different, but it’s difficult to play them without DLSS Frame Generation on even the best GPUs. There’s a tradeoff here where people might not mind “fake frames” if they’re getting far better visuals.</p><p>So much of modern gaming is already “fake,” and it has been for years. Rendering itself is all about the tricks, shortcuts, and optimizations that developers use to produce something that looks like reality. DLSS 4 gives developers yet another tool to achieve image quality, lighting effects, or gameplay that we wouldn’t have thought was possible until recently.</p><p>For years, we’ve been playing games on consoles that aren’t at native resolution, with developers using a variety of different rendering techniques to dynamically adjust resolution, image quality, and more. Nvidia is making it clear with DLSS 4 that the future of PC gaming will involve AI-powered rendering techniques, and it’s something both Sony and AMD are leaning into with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324317/amd-playstation-ai-work-better-graphics-project-amethyst">PlayStation partnership</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025">AMD’s latest FSR 4 upscaling</a>. Some PC gamers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOItZa2oqVc">might not like</a> “fake frames,” but it’s clear they’re very much here to stay.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite is nothing short of sensational. It’s the world’s most popular battle royale game, and since 2024, it has become a titanic title of epic proportions, featuring many ‘smaller’ games within its ecosystem. There’s a racing game, a Guitar Hero-style game, and an infinite suite of UGC for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>On the subject of ‘players’, how many people play Fortnite? Is the Fortnite player count as strong as it was a couple of years ago? In this short guide, I’m diving into that very topic and answering the question.</p>



<p>Read on to find out how many people are playing Fortnite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-player-count-confirmed">Fortnite Player Count Confirmed</h2>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, a whopping 1.81 million people were playing Fortnite</strong>, with a 24-hour peak of 2.45 million users. That number is typical for Fortnite, which remains one of the most-played games in the world, even almost a decade after it first hit the market. </p>



<p>On <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite.gg</a>, users can see exactly how many people play Fortnite and find out statistics such as gain percentage and average rates, plus player peaks – it’s very interesting stuff.</p>



<p>The site also lists various other stats, which I’ll cover now.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-played-fortnite-map">What is the Most Played Fortnite Map?</h3>



<p><strong>‘Battle Royale’ is the most-played Fortnite map</strong>, boasting an all-time peak of 6.53 million players.</p>



<h3 id="h-who-is-the-top-fortnite-creator">Who is the Top Fortnite Creator?</h3>



<p><strong>Epic is the top Fortnite creator</strong>, boasting control of some of the most popular maps ever made in the Fortnite world. Epic has accrued 959 billion minutes played. Behind Epic sits ‘bullseye’, with 25.6 billion minutes played.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-played-fortnite-genre">What is the Most Played Fortnite Genre?</h3>



<p><strong>Most players prefer PvP</strong> – there are 65,787 PvP maps in the Fortnite universe, and at the time of writing, 410,000 players were dedicating their time to PvP. </p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-all-time-highest-fortnite-player-count">What is the All-Time Highest Fortnite Player Count?</h3>



<p><strong>The most players ever in Fortnite at the same time was 14,343,880</strong>, and that number was recorded in December 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fortnite-dying">Is Fortnite Dying?</h2>



<p>It seems bizarre to suggest that Fortnite is dying when you look at how many people play the game, but here we are. There are always those who will oppose the game and suggest it’s ‘dead’ or ‘dying’, regardless of how many people play Fortnite. That’s just a fact of life.</p>



<p>The reality is, Fortnite is only becoming more powerful over time. It’s still the world’s most popular game, and it drives competitive and creative ecosystems like no other game ever made.</p>



<p>It’s not dying, and it probably won’t for many years to come.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Player Count – How Many People Play Marvel Rivals?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-player-count-%E2%80%93-how-many-people-play-marvel-rivals.1077144/</guid>

<p>Marvel Rivals is a showstopper of a game. It was released by NetEase on December 6, 2024, skyrocketing up the charts and becoming known as a powerhouse title that quickly pulled in more than 20 million players – in just a few weeks. As we all know, time impacts the popularity of a game like nothing else, so what does the Marvel Rivals player count look like now?</p>



<p>I’ve taken a look at how many people play Marvel Rivals, breaking down the player data that we can see to determine the health of the game.</p>



<p>Is Marvel Rivals already dying, or is the player count soaring? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed">Marvel Rivals Player Count Confirmed</h2>



<p>It’s not possible to get accurate Marvel Rivals player count data from all the platforms it’s available on, but we can get a representative figure from Steam and simply extrapolate from there.</p>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, 231,346 people were playing Marvel Rivals on PC</strong>, and the 24-hour peak sat at 437,541 users. Amazingly, more users flooded Marvel Rivals in January than in December, with the game gaining momentum as 2025 kicked off.</p>



<p>This might only be data for PC gamers, but it’s a solid indication that the game is performing very strongly on all platforms, given that it’s free to play and highly accessible.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-already-dead">Is Marvel Rivals Already Dead?</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals has suffered slightly with some teething issues, particularly some concerns regarding network stability, unbalanced heroes, and of course, cheaters. However, none of these topics have been powerful enough to prevent the game from growing, such is proven by the Marvel Rivals player count.</p>



<p>This is a solid and substantial alternative to hero shooters like Overwatch, and it’s already proving to be a thorn in the side of those supporting Valve’s Deadlock, which is yet to be released. As there’s a fantastic roster of characters that gamers love and find familiar, the fanbase for the title was ready and waiting on the day the game was released.</p>



<p>If you haven’t played Marvel Rivals, you’re missing out. As the player count proves, it’s a success with gamers worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plaion-koch-media-ceo-stepping-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ceo-of-plaion-formerly-koch-media-to-step-down-after-31-years.1077084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plaion-koch-media-ceo-stepping-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Klemens Kundratitz, the CEO and co-founder of Plaion (formerly known as Koch Media), will step down from his role after 31 years and take an advisory role with parent company Embracer Group.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Kundratitz has decided that it's time to "take a step back and spend more time with his family", and so he's handing over the CEO reins to Phil Rogers, an exec who's "leading the creation of the new Middle-earth &amp; Friends operating unit".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Middle-earth &amp; Friends is one of the three companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">into which Embracer Group will be splitting</a>&nbsp;during this year, alongside tabletop division Asmodee and indie label Coffee Stain &amp; Friends.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plaion-koch-media-ceo-klemens-kundratitz-kingdom-come-deliverance.jpg?itok=NU5JGk3e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plaion-koch-media-ceo-klemens-kundratitz-kingdom-come-deliverance.jpg?itok=EbZDFiuL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Through its various divisions, Plaion has published a number of games, including&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Kundratitz, who co-founded Plaion as Koch Media alongside Franz Koch back in 1994, says he's "delighted" to be handing over CEO duties to Rogers, and that he believes Rogers will continue Plaion's "excellent momentum".</p>

<p>For his part, Rogers says he's "excited" to start building Middle-earth &amp; Friends as Plaion's new CEO, and that Kundratitz has built an "incredible legacy" over the course of his 31 years with the company.</p>

<p>Though you might not recognize Plaion's name, you'll probably know at least one of the publishing labels under its stewardship, namely Deep Silver, Ravenscourt, and Prime Matter.</p>

<p>Through Deep Silver, Plaion has published games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/payday-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Payday 3</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-island-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead Island 2</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metro-exodus" rel="nofollow"><em>Metro Exodus</em></a>, while the Prime Matter label is responsible for the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a>&nbsp;</em>(whose developer Warhorse Studios is also a subsidiary of Plaion) and 2023's&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-remake-plaion-koch-media-ceo.jpg?itok=1865tiQI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-remake-plaion-koch-media-ceo.jpg?itok=gCCB_aF9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many pies in which Plaion has its fingers.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Kundratitz himself, while he's stepping back from CEO duties with Plaion, he's not leaving Embracer entirely. He'll now serve as a "strategic advisor" for the group, which, given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow">recent financial woes</a>, I'm sure will be appreciated.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that Kundratitz's departure will have a material effect on Embracer or its companies from a public-facing perspective, but we'll have to wait and see whether anything changes as a result of this management shift. Stay tuned.</p>

Like the first beta test, these won’t require PS Plus or Game Pass Core subscriptions to play online, either. Capcom said its running the additional betas to give more players a chance to try the game who might have missed the first test back in November.</p><p>But while the publisher said it learned a lot from that weekend in terms of player feedback and complaints, don’t expect anything different this time around. “Please bear in mind that these improvements, including performance, game balance, weapon mechanics, known issues and more will not be reflected in the OBT 2 build,” the company stated this week. </p><p>Those improvements, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlined by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>director Yuya Tokuda in a previous video</a></span>, will eventually include monsters moving to new areas less frequently, and making “hitstop” more noticeable so smacking enemies with giant swords and axes feels more satisfying. The team announced several balance tweaks to weapons as well. It’s unclear why these couldn’t be added to the game for the new betas, which would no doubt have given Capcom even more time to gauge community feedback ahead of the game’s full release. That is, after all, what betas are supposed to be for.</p><p>Instead, fans will have to wait until February 28 to see the changes in action. At that point, anyone who participated in one of the betas will get their bonus rewards like a decorative in-game pendant and a starter item pack of meat, traps, and other monster hunting necessities.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next Pokemon Presents date has seemingly been leaked, and it comes from an unexpected source. </p>



<p>A keen-eyed <a href="https://x.com/mattyoukhana_/status/1876988464878567879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">user on Twitter</a> spotted metadata from Niantic that hints at the next Pokemon Presents taking place on February 27, 2025. In the data it shows a title of “Pokemon Presents 2025 x GO Tour: Unova Timed Research”. </p>



<p>The leaked date shouldn’t come as a surprise. Since 2021, there has been a Pokemon Presents on February 27 every year to coincide with Pokemon Day. If we are looking at when each of the last four events were announced, they usually didn’t come until just days prior. That means fans shouldn’t expect an official announcement on the next Pokemon Presents until around February 20 or so. </p>







<p>As far as what to expect during the showcase, it’s clear based on the title that a new timed research event for Pokemon Go will be shown. Also, with Pokemon Legends Z-A scheduled to launch this year, it could be assumed that the game will be shown in some way.  Elsewhere, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket is likely to see a solid presence after it’s successful launch late last year. There’s also a good chance The Pokemon Company has a surprise or two up its sleeve in honor of the 29th Anniversary of Pokemon’s 1996 launch.</p>



<p>Whatever The Pokemon Company has in store for fans, Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the broadcast.</p>



<p>What do you think we see during the Pokemon Presents on Pokemon Day 2025? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

                <p>Next month, Capcom will bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to players just over seven years since the last mainline game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review-a-very-ice-ti/1900-6417288/" data-ref-id="1900-6417288">Monster Hunter: World</a>, debuted in 2018. There was an open beta for players in October, and now Capcom has announced that a second open beta in February. The news was accompanied by the following video, which features Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto using the create-a-character function to place himself in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXWAYmEQKso" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of content, the new beta will be very similar to the one from last year. Players will still be able to use the character creator, try out the story trial, and complete the Slay Doshaguma quest. However, this version of the demo will also include Gypceros, a monster from the previous games who was absent in the first demo.</p><p>According to Tsujimoto, characters created in the first beta can be carried over to the second beta and to the final version of the game as well. However, game progress will not be transferable. The second open beta will be held over two weekends on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It will also be cross-platform, and the beta is open to all players regardless of whether they have Game Pass or PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Players who take part in the new beta will get bonus in-game rewards including a charm for a weapon and an item pack. The second beta will take place from February 6 at at 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET until February 9 at the same time. Then the beta will have another weekend preview on February 13-16, presumably during the same hours as the previous event.</p><p>Tsujimoto noted that the team has implemented changes based on feedback to the first beta test, which attracted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-begins-with-almost-500000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6527527/" data-ref-id="1100-6527527">almost 500,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. Unfortunately, those changes will not be in the next beta. Instead, Capcom will likely wait until the game's February 28 release date to implement those improvements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/freedom-wars-remastered-review-abductor-slayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In September of last year, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">announced</a>. The circles I frequent online were quite enthusiastic about this, despite me having never heard of the game. I mean, I didn't even own a <a href="https://techraptor.net/platform/playstation-vita" rel="nofollow">PS Vita</a>, it seemed like a completely obscure title. Still, the excitement from my friends piqued my interest, so I had to see what <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was all about.</p>

<p>It seemed like a weird choice to revive a dormant IP exclusive to the PS Vita, but I'm glad I took the chance to review it. Turns out, <em>Freedom Wars </em><em>Remastered</em> is a quirky and competent take on the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/monster-hunter" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter</a> </em>formula, and that makes for an addicting game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=BxiFgXLe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=2Nmk-fdF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I guess I'll take that as a compliment?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Freedom Wars Remastered,</em> a Decade After the Original</h2>

<p>As <em>Freedom Wars</em> is a remaster of a PS Vita title from 2014, you might expect it to look a bit dated visually. The smaller screen of a Vita means lower resolution, so obviously graphics aren't going to be on par with that of consoles.</p>

<p>Still, developer Dimps Corporation makes a commendable effort to revitalize <em>Freedom Wars</em> with this remaster. With upgraded textures and running a higher resolution, <em>Freedom Wars</em> <em>Remastered</em> looks very good considering its origins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=AD2jGueH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=1iW1Ohiw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The squad's here!</figcaption></figure><p>Supposedly, it can run on 4k resolution. I couldn't find any way to tweak graphics on the PS5 version of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>, so I'll just have to take the developer's word for it. I presume PC versions will have more options to adjust visuals. At the very least, I can say <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> runs at 60 FPS, so it's a smooth ride.</p>

<p>Really, the only issue is some animations look a little janky, especially during dialogue. There's a lot of talking in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered, </em>and facial animations are super rudimentary. It's nothing that'll detract from the experience; in fact, it's usually the only <em>visual </em>reminder that this was once a PS Vita game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=nxl8UtQJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=8fGmfn3e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's satisfying to drag down a big ol' monster!</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting For the Cause in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>To put it simply, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> takes the <em>Monster Hunter</em> formula and gives it a gratifying hook (as if <em>Monster Hunter </em>wasn't already addicting). Not only are you acquiring new materials to upgrade equipment, but you also have a million-year prison sentence. As a sinner, you're tasked with working off that sentence by taking on various operations.</p>

<p>Your player character's prison sentence literally looms over your head, and just about every action you do either contributes to or diminishes said sentence. Stand around in one place too long? The game will give you a few decades to think about your ungodly crime.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5K79MwUD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5slMXScb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just a drop in the bucket.</figcaption></figure><p>And so, that's where these operations come in. Completing various missions, ranging from extermination of "Abductors" (<em>Freedom Wars' </em>version of monsters), rescuing citizens, and donating valuable resources to the cause, all help diminish that prison term.</p>

<p>Watching the prison sentence deteriorate over the course of the campaign and into the endgame is a very satisfying feeling, even if it's an arbitrary number. It's a way to catalog your rank among other players and track your progress. Having this little way to measure your efforts encouraged me to do "just one more mission."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=viEelOT3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=35ppx2Ns 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We got Rathalos at home.</figcaption></figure><p>This progress is also tracked via online leaderboards. It's a multiplayer game with other sinners, and each sinner belongs to a Panopticon. Think of a Panopticon as your home base. You choose this at the beginning of the game when you're customizing your character, and each Panopticon represents a prefecture of Japan.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this will change once the public has hands on it, but the original version of <em>Freedom Wars</em> split Panopticons as cities around the globe. Though, as far as I know, the only choice now is Japan's prefectures, so I went with Hokkaido.</p>

<p>The leaderboard tallies your contribution both within the Panopticon and against other prefectures, so it's again, a very neat little measure to see how everyone's progressing and incentivizes some friendly competition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=PnRJ97GW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=3xdoBSgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, guns are the best option!</figcaption></figure><h2>On the Hunt in<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>It's in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s combat that many players will find some sort of familiarity with. I don't like to draw comparisons to other games if I can help it, but it's hard to ignore the fact that<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em> plays a great deal like <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>The whole routine of fighting giant monsters (Abductors), severing parts, upgrading your equipment from said parts, and going back into the fray is the general gameplay loop here. Though, on its own, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> is a competent action game, even if it's a bit light on game mechanics.</p>

<p>There are several different weapon types to choose from, each with its own skillset, as well as firearms. You can equip yourself with two different weapons at once, so that gives room for some versatility. You're also given several AI companions if you're playing solo, as well as your own customizable Accessory -- this is a robot companion that helps you out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=4jYnJyuJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=1BcP709u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once they're on the ground, it's time to lay on the hurt.</figcaption></figure><p>To top it all off, you have a thorn, which makes <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s gameplay quite enjoyable. By shooting a thorn onto a wall or enemy, you can launch yourself to that location and pull off some cool air attacks. It's especially useful against Abductors so you can sever parts that are higher up.</p>

<p>Thorns are super fun to use, launching yourself around gargantuan foes like you're from <em>Attack on Titan</em>. It adds just a bit of extra oomph to the gameplay, though the rest of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> could do with either new weapons, a few new attacks, or just something else to help it stand out.</p>

<p>Enemy variety, too, is just a bit repetitive. Most enemies come in the form of Abductors, and they increase in power as you progress through the campaign. The thing is, most of them follow the same template of being bipeds, quadrupeds, and the like, and they don't look or act all that different as time goes on.</p>

<p>My thoughts on <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story are conflicted. On one hand, I really like its premise and setting, but on the other, the way the story is told is not all that great. The setting is, you're in this resource war, as presumably the world's resources are sparse in that day and age.</p>

<p>As such, Sinners are required to gather resources. Regular civilians are kidnapped by rival Panopticons' Abductors, and Sinners have to go save them. Meanwhile, there are various factions working within and outside of your Panopticon with different agendas and motives, most of which remain vague throughout the duration.</p>

There are some post-game activities, but as I understand it, the story was supposed to continue in a sequel that never was. It leads to some mysteries that are never solved, which is a shame.</p>

<p><em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> also presents its story in a sloppy way. The start of the game is front-loaded with a ton of dialogue, so it's super slow-going at first and really could do better with its pacing. On top of that, walking around your Panopticon to continue the story is pretty sluggish and doesn't make for exciting gameplay.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1OD00IBWxM" rel="nofollow">a few enhancements</a> that returning players will enjoy. Apparently, upgrading weapons has become a more seamless experience. They've added subtle improvements to combat overall, and even a new difficulty mode. These are additions that I initially took for granted, but when I learned about how <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> changed for the better, I was very appreciative of these tweaks.</p>

<p>Despite some problems with <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story and the lack of depth in its gameplay, I still had a lot of fun with this title. Seeing your sentence diminish as time goes on is a gratifying feeling. Moreover, once it launches for players worldwide, I imagine the conflict amongst other Panopticons will lead to some exciting rivalries.</p>

<p>Who knows, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> might even lead to the long-awaited sequel. I'd absolutely love to see <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s formula expanded upon. More depth in its gameplay and a more developed story in a sequel would make it a strong rival to <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>The update will represent the first major free content drop since the game's launch back in September, and it's officially coming to all platforms simultaneously on January 23rd, so you'll have to split your time <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date" rel="nofollow">between this and&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em></a>.</p>

<p>New features you can look forward to in the Nightmares Unleashed update include improvements to the Key system, new minibosses to take down, and alternate Master Nightmare encounter patterns to keep you on your toes.</p>

<p>New activities can also be found throughout&nbsp;<em>Ravenswatch</em>, including Blood Rituals, which allow you to get your hands on Keys by battling a new enemy and halting the ritual. Other new events include Locked Chests, for which you'll need Keys, and the Sacrificial Idol, which lets you give up health for damage.</p>

<p>New NPCs have also been added in the form of the Refugees, a small group of unfortunate souls who will ask for your help if they encounter you. Passtech says they either represent "a glimmer of hope in your journey, or a bad decision around the corner".</p>

            <p>The more I tell you about <a href="https://neal.fun/stimulation-clicker/">Stimulation Clicker</a>, the less funny it will be, so let's keep this brief. It's an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more "stimulation" you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer's processor. After 30 minutes, I was huffing and hooting like a drunken horse to a soundtrack of disintegrating laptop fans.</p><!--more-->
<p>Stimulation Clicker angles forward and backward through the history of the internet. On the one hand, it's a merciless piece of trolling that tramples all over nerve endings worn to the hilt by the web 3.0 era of hyper-velocity enshittification. On the other, it's a testament to the expressive power of HTML, a reminder of those glory days 20 years ago when every website was a wishing well full of elusive or hidden moving parts and connections, including digital will-o'-the-wisps called "pop ups" that, back then, were a source of wonder and curiosity. You'd even click on them, occasionally! Awwwwww. I miss the internet being good.</p>
<p>Thanks to reader jamhandy for spotting Stimulation Clicker and chucking it into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-26">the latest Maw liveblog</a>. I'm reviewing an open world game at the minute, and this was exactly the change of pace I was looking for, though I do now have a bit of a complex about owls and the Welsh. The creator is <a href="https://neal.fun/">Neal Agarwal</a>, whose other works include the alchemical monstrosity that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/infinite-craft-is-a-browser-game-in-which-you-can-craft-anything-from-god-to-minecraft">Infinite Craft</a>.</p>
<p>For a more involved and narrative-led take on the above, mushy sentiments about the lost enchantment of webpages, play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-amazing-surprising-browser-game-shows-the-internet-can-still-be-magical">corru.observer</a>, which Alice0 (RPS in peace) called "one of the most surprising and delightful games I've played all year, a sprawling, shape-shifting sci-fi story which is still unfolding through updates". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
