			<p>Robot Entertainment’s Orcs have a death wish. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/orcs-must-die-deathtrap">Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</a> is the fourth entry in the Orcs Must Die! franchise, and, alongside a wily exclamation mark, it brings with it the surety that you will be seeing off green-skinned hordes in a carefully cultivated range of violent and creative ways. This time, you can do it with even more of your friends. The formula remains as strong as ever, but beyond the increased multiplayer options, it feels exceedingly familiar.</p>
<p><iframe title="Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y720yo-w24Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/orcs-must-die">Orcs Must Die!</a> began life as one of the darlings of Xbox Live Arcade, bringing together third-person action and tower defence in a crazy, colourful way. You’re tasked with protecting the rift, a magical portal that the Orcs are inexplicably drawn towards without any care for their own safety. They’re so focused on the task at hand that you can lay down knee-high barriers that will blindly force them to take a different route towards the rift, and if you’re smart about it, you can also pop myriad traps and horrible contraptions in their way so that they, you know… die. Oh… wait, Die!</p>


<p>That formula remains largely unchanged in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap. The levels have been stretched out to accommodate up to four players, though if you’re playing on your own, they’re still approachable. There’s now a broader range of ways to kill the Orcs, though the classic spike traps and wall-mounted arrow launchers are as effective and iconic as ever, which makes them surprisingly hard to leave behind.</p>


<p>There’s six different War Mages to choose from at the outset, each of which has their own unique look, individual abilities and weaponry to fight in addition to their traps. The strange thing is, I don’t think that all of these hero characters have been given the same love and attention. The giant war mage bear, Kalos, looks fantastic, plays well, has weaponry that feels as though it’s making some impact and his special abilities prove genuinely useful during a mission by healing you and your team. Mac, meanwhile, not only looks rough – they’re part android with a massive wrench – but their special ability just lets you float really high. There’s also a cat called Sophie who speaks in a standard human voice and without any attempt at cat puns.</p>
<p>It’s a real shame that there isn’t more variety to the hero characters, especially when a team of four different players can use up the entire roster in one sitting. I understand that these are not easy or simple things to create, balance or design, but when the game itself has shifted to a multiplayer focus, I was left wanting more, particularly when some of those that are included just aren’t as much fun to play as. Still with Kalos and Vaan, I had my favourites.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of opportunities for progression in Deathtrap, from character-specific upgrades to an overarching skill tree that covers all of your War Mages. These start out minimal – we’re talking 5% on average – but these build and grow into some serious buffs. There are plenty of other ways to change your fate too, and your possibilities. Alongside expanding your choice of traps, there’s also the Thread Shop. Threads appear following each wave, and they bring a range of buffs or debuffs that might make things harder for you, or easier for you on each run.</p>
<p>I particularly like weighing up the pros and cons of these, and discussing it with my teammates became a key part of our planning and progression. Early on in one run I essentially gave up being able to lay traps in order to gain extra barricades, but it was a short-term gain, and we avoided that Thread for every following run until we could plan and compensate. Other, more useful Threads increase the damage of different traps or the effectiveness of your War Mage’s abilities, and it’s fun to stack these together.</p>
<p>Finishing one successful mission lets you gamble some of the Skulls you’ve earned and carry them, and your Threads, forward, building your run in a Roguelike style. It’s effective and enjoyable, though losing out by gambling can be crushing when it feels as though there’s so many places to spend your Skulls.</p>

<p>I disliked the size of the castle hub that serves as your base, and it’s not characterful enough to earn the time you spend wandering between the different upgrade merchants. If you compare it with Monster Hunter – arguably one of the best series to showcase progressively-expanding central hubs – Deathtrap’s castle feels lifeless in comparison. It could have been much more focused. Or just a menu.</p>
<p>For all of these minor complaints, Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap still feels like a lot of fun to play, especially with a team of four like-minded friends. It’s collaborative, amusing and action-packed, and it still retains much of the series most enjoyable aspects, like yeeting an orc across a map right into a pit of lava, skewering them with multiple pointy things at the same time, and then sending them back around to do it all again.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has responded to a report that claims fresh content for 2023's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> is on the way, following investment from Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF).
</p>
<p>
The report, published by French financial newspaper <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626">Les Echoes</a>, states that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot secured PIF funding during a meeting last month in Saudi Arabia (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101">j0nathan</a>).
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer today, a Ubisoft spokesperson declined to offer more detail, but did not offer a denial.
</p>
<p>
"We'll decline to comment," a Ubisoft spokesperson said. "We are focused on finishing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and excited for players to get to play it on 20th March."

<p>
The PIF is an initiative designed as a way to diversify the country's revenues via investment in foreign companies, with a large arm focused on the video games industry. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-sets-sights-on-acquiring-a-bigger-stake-in-nintendo">PIF holds a notable stake in a swathe of gaming companies</a>, including Grand Theft Auto publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Nintendo, EA, Embracer, Nexon and Capcom.
</p>
<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">recently been seeking investment</a>, as the company discusses its future with Chinese stakeholder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">explores sale options</a>.</p>
<p>
Additional content for Assassin's Creed Mirage is something of a surprise, considering Ubisoft's upcoming push for the long-awaited Shadows.
</p>
<p>
Mirage, set in ninth-century Baghdad, was designed as a smaller project similar in scope to the Assassin's Creed series' earliest entries, and something of a palate cleanser after a trilogy of enormous Assassin's Creed epics.
</p>
<p>
Released in late 2023, Mirage was primarily developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux, a team which is now building Claws of Awaji, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">first 10-hour expansion for Assassin's Creed Shadows that anyone who pre-orders the game will now get for free</a>.
</p>
<p>
But DLC for Mirage could tie into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">Ubisoft's plans for a more cohesive overall storyline for the series</a>, found within its Animus Hub. This will launch alongside Shadows, and serve as a primary home for ongoing story content and free rewards. (Eurogamer recently got to take a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animus-hub-revealed-ubisofts-new-assassins-creed-start-screen-and-modern-day-story-wrapper-thats-definitely-not-just-another-launcher">deep dive into Assassin's Creed's new Animus Hub</a>, and everything we know so far that it'll contain.)
</p><p>
Shadows looks to tell a completely new story, with a modern day now set in the "near future". Could fresh DLC for Mirage be used to tie up some dangling plot threads, perhaps - particularly what happened next in the series' modern day, following the ending of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>?
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">hands-on with Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which our Katharine described as the series' "biggest shake-up of the series in years".

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth now has the highest all-time player peak on Steam compared to all single-player games from the series. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sets-highest-steam-peak-for-series-single-player-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has amassed over 40,000 players on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2909400/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. This record is more than double the prequel, as Final Fantasy 7 Remake still sits at a peak of around 14,000. Final Fantasy 16 also lags behind, with the game’s peak ending at over 27,000 players. The only game with a higher player count is Final Fantasy 14, sitting at 95,000 players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reviews for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam have also been favourable. Out of all the reviews, 77.4% are positive, and 22.6% are negative; overall, reviews for the PC port have been ‘mostly positive’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Surprisingly, even though Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second game of the FF VII remake trilogy, it has still managed to pull in more concurrent players than the previous instalment. The sequel follows the journey of Cloud, Tifa, and the gang as they start exploring the planet on Chocobos after escaping from Midgar. They are chasing the fallen hero, Sephiroth; however, he will not make the journey easy for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, developers have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-developers-have-already-written-part-3s-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already finished writing the story</a> for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3. Additionally, Part 3 will not be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-release-on-a-wide-range-of-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive to PlayStation 6</a>.

<p>The announcement came from Ubisoft, who said that some graphical content will be censored in Japan in order to comply with the Japanese rating board CERO.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1882611785775174070/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> posted to X (formerly Twitter), and translated via <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/translator/l/ja/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deepl</a>, Ubisoft Japan said, “In order to comply with the regulations of the reviewing authorities, the Japanese version of “Assassin’s Creed Shadows” (CERO:Z) will differ in some of the game’s expressions.</p>



<p>“The game settings have been changed so that the player cannot amputate the head and limbs of enemies at any time during play. The expression of the cut surface of the body has been changed,” it continued.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s decision comes following the Japanese rating board CERO’s ‘Z’ rating, which although means that the game cannot be sold to anyone over 18, CERO still determined that the game was too violent to be sold in Japan. Ubisoft’s change means that the game can now be sold in Japan, but still have the CERO Z rating.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Japan has imposed such strict rules on games either. In 2023, CERO banned the Dead Space Remake due to violence and also banned The Callisto Protocol in 2022. On the other hand, Stellar Blade passed with a CERO D rating, meaning the game  is not suitable for those under the game of 17. </p>



<p>Following two delays, Assassin’s Creed Shadows officially launches March 20, 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s decision to censor the game in Japan? Do you agree with CERO’s rating on the game? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>"Part of releasing the game in Early Access means we do take on the risk of negative early reviews and feedback," the post reads. "Everyone has different expectations for an Early Access game.</p>
<p>"All the feedback about the lack of keybinding and sensitivity controls, FPS drops etc. is extremely reasonable. And, receiving large quantities of the same actionable requests actually helps us determine how to prioritise future updates."</p>

<p>Then, last week, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/519703537657053480?l=english">new patch</a> was released to add a rework of medkits as suggested by the game's community.</p>
<p>Now, players will start each run of the roguelike with a medkit and these will auto-refill on the launch of a run. This should make the game a little easier to get going with.</p>
<p>Other changes include reducing enemy aggro distance, increasing the time between waves of enemies in Crown Fights, and bug fixes.</p>
<p>While reaction to the game has been mixed, it's clear Heart Machine is listening and acting directly upon community suggestions.</p>
<p>"We made Hyper Light Breaker with Early Access in mind to have it grow and evolve with our community, and today's patch represents that as we made some pretty big changes, including a rework on Medkits, thanks to your feedback," said Michael Clark, lead producer on Hyper Light Breaker.</p>
<p>An early access roadmap is also planned for later this week, to firm up the studio's ongoing plans for the game.</p>
<p>"Hyper Light Breaker is really, really punishing," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-breaker-offers-loot-lore-and-the-tiniest-touch-of-fortnite">Christian Donlan on Hyper Light Breaker's release</a>. "It's punishing in a way that I understand, because it's probably balanced for multiplayer and because this is probably a small team who can't endlessly feed new stuff into the procedural maw, and so they need players to take their time with what's there. But it makes for an uninviting introduction if you're a fan of the series and you love these games for their lonely beauty."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that is now available for download addresses one of the most annoying visual issues of the game.</p>
<p>The Foliage Draw Distance—Shadow Quality mod, a tweaked configuration file that can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/48?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, attempts, and mostly succeeds, to address the foliage and vegetation pop-in issues that plague the game even at the highest settings. The modder found a combination of adjustments that brings significant changes in draw distance, LODs, and shadow quality, resulting in considerably reduced pop-in issues. The latest version of the modded configuration file also addresses foliage and shadow flickering issues that some were experiencing.</p>

<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Foliage Draw Distance modded configuration file is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/">mods</a> that have been released for the game since launch, although the vast majority of interesting changes are currently brought by the Cheat Engine tables that many are working on. One of these tables, which can be downloaded <a href="https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?p=389449&amp;sid=103496c0fdf0aa02aa984d2114e57dcd#p389449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, allows the user to add Sephiroth and Zack to the party. While both characters work well in battle, there are still some issues, such as their equipment and Materia being locked, and their inability to gain experience points and level up. If you want to test out how the two characters play outside the sequences where they are supposed to be playable and don't want to mess around with Cheat Engine, you can use the modded save file uploaded to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/39?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> by Esuramods.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_caps_(game)">Pogs</a> are something I never consciously think about until something reminds me of Pogs, at which time I am instantly very excited about Pogs. The latest reminder being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snow-town-geek-store">Snow Town Geek Store</a>, a shopkeeping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> brimming with 2000's non-tude. Like the 2000's themselves, it feels both alive with promise and liable to turn bad at any moment. But I do very much enjoy both its energy and soundtrack, based on what little information is currently available. A tray-tray for you, the discerning tray-tray viewer:</p>

<p>"Here's the deal," begins the description. I think I could probably write several hundred words on what a deliberate and powerful choice it is to begin a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3225880/Snow_Town_Geek_Store/">Steam description</a> with the words "Here's the deal". But I'll save that for another time in which we are both dead and so neither of us has to listen to me. The description:</p>
<p>"It's the noughties, you work in a store of geek goods: games, mp3s, DVDs with movies and anime, gum, Cheetos, cigarettes, beer... Develop your store, communicate with customers (be friends, quarrel, cheat or flatter), get involved in shady dealings and earn your mom a trip to Hawaii."</p>
<p>The actual feature list has corresponding emojis which I can't recreate in this joyless husk of a content management system, but here are the features nonetheless:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Order your favorite childhood goodies and put them on sale</li>
<li>Choices really matter - chat with customers, bargain, count the change and cheat!</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your character's condition so you don't mess up (hunger, cold, rest - that's it)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Play pogs with your friends to build up your collection and play mini-games on the computer</li>
<li>Go out for a smoke and a piss, there's a lot of interesting things going on outside</li>
<li>Mom didn't teach you to ignore strange men? Then break the law to raise money faster.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I'm into this. Puns like having a Half Life 2 CD called "Whole Life 2" are obviously not a good use of gag real estate but, as I said, I like the energy. Developer Perelesoq previously made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1568970/Torn_Away">Torn Away</a>, which won a whole bunch of awards for storytelling and the like. Snow Town Geek Store is out in "2025". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A modding group has doubled down on its plans to port GTA: Vice City content into GTA 4's engine, despite publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> stepping in to apparently try and shut the enterprise down.</p>
<p>The project - known as GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition - ports the missions, side missions, cutscenes and world from Vice City into the GTA 4 engine. It was created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@revteamhq">Revolution Team</a>, and initially required players own a legitimate copy of GTA 4 in order to play.</p>
<p>But the group has now switched its plans, after the YouTube channel charting its progress was suddenly taken down - something Revolution Team has blamed Take-Two for. Now, the project has been released and can work on its own - without requiring players buy GTA 4 first - in response to what the group has called Take-Two's "cruel move".</p>

</figure>
<p>"Friends, [you] probably already know that just two days before the release, Take-Two Interactive deleted our YouTube channel without any warning or attempt to contact us," reads a statement published by Revolution Team. "A huge amount of effort and time was invested into the channel, including hundreds of hours of streams dedicated to the mod's development."</p><p>"Additionally, we lost connection with our international audience, which was a significant part of our community. The teaser trailer for GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition gained over 100,000 views and 1500 comments in less than a day. Unfortunately, the channel was removed without any possibility of recovery."</p>
<p>The days since the channel's removal have been "emotionally tough", Revolution Team continued.</p>
<p>"The most important thing now is that we released the project on the promised date," the statement adds. "It's unclear how long it will remain publicly available or whether there will be demands to take it down. We are not opposed to reuploads, but we cannot openly encourage you to do so. Do as you see fit."</p>
<p>Revolution Team's initial plan to release the project with the requirement players needed the original GTA 4 game was designed to be a mark of "respect to the publisher", it said. "However, over the past two days, we have completely rebuilt the project, and it is now available as a standalone 'installation-ready package'."</p>
<p>Footage of the mod in action has since been released on YouTube, and you can check it out below.</p>

            <p>
Skies of Arcadia has been given a fresh trademark by Sega, raising fan hopes for some kind of revival. 
</p>
<p>
Fresh trademarks for the beloved Dreamcast and GameCube RPG - including for the game's original Japanese title Eternal Arcadia - were filed on 16th January and made public on 24th January, <a href="https://finalweapon.net/2025/01/26/sega-files-new-trademark-for-skies-of-arcadia/">Final Weapon</a> reported.
</p>
<p>
The future of Skies of Arcadia as a series has long been dormant, after Sega ditched plans for a PC port and a full-blown sequel. But fans of the game have never quite given up hope - and Sega is currently busy reviving many of its other past franchises.
</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Skies of Arcadia was originally released on Dreamcast back in 2000 - making this year its 25th anniversary. Hey, that would be a good time to launch some kind of remaster or remake! Its enhanced GameCube port Skies of Arcadia: Legends launched two years later.
</p><p>
Neither of the game's releases sadly set tills ringing, but the colourful air pirate RPG has maintained a core fanbase ever since, and Sega has occaisonally referenced the game in other titles - such as hero Vyse being a playable character in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a>.
</p>
<p>Many of the game's original development team have now been scattered to the winds but, back in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-on-skies-of-arcadia-dev-hasnt-given-up-hope-of-a-sequel">Skies of Arcadia developer Kenji Hiruta made a push for Sega to bring back the RPG via a fresh entry</a>.</p>
<p>
Sega is currently going back to its roots to revive a swathe of classic franchises, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Crazy Taxi</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-new-virtua-fighter-sonic-racing-and-like-a-dragon">Virtua Fighter and Sonic Racing</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Here's hoping this trademark isn't just leading to another Sonic Racing cameo.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/putting-the-mega-drive-back-into-sega-how-the-company-wants-to-return-to-creating-video-game-rock-roll-compared-to-nintendos-pop-music">Eurogamer sat down with Sega president Shuji Utsumi to hear more of the company's plans</a>, and how the company wants to return to creating video game "rock &amp; roll", compared to Nintendo's "pop music".

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> has surpassed 40,000 concurrent players on Steam, setting the series' highest peak on the platform for a single-player game.</p>
<p>The second part of the remake trilogy was released last week, 23rd January, and over the weekend it set a peak concurrent player count of 40,564 (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2909400/charts/">SteamDB</a>).</p>
<p>For comparison, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> (the first part) set a concurrent peak of 13,803, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> (released last year) reached 27,508.</p>

<p>The series' highest peak overall remains <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, which boasted 95,150 concurrent players after its popular Endwalker expansion was released.</p>
<p>This peak for Rebirth is positive news, considering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> previously admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">sales of the PS5 version "did not meet expectations"</a>, leading to the company's multiplatform strategy.</p>
<p>Previously, PC versions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-pc-barebones-port">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-16-is-highly-demanding-on-pc-and-these-are-the-best-settings">Final Fantasy 16</a> were somewhat criticised for their performance, though Rebirth has been praised by comparison. It's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-verified-for-steam-deck-handheld">Steam Deck verified</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, a PC release allows for fan-made mods. Director Naoki Hamaguchi asked players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-asks-pc-players-to-avoid-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods">not to install "offensive or inappropriate" mods</a> in a previous interview.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/i-respect-mods-they-breathe-life-into-the-pc-market-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-naoki-hamaguchi-reveals-a-more-personal-perspective-on-mods/">Automaton</a>, he admitted to using mods himself as a PC player and acknowledged how they can "breathe life" into games.</p>
<p>Referring to the previous interview, he said: "I wasn't trying to tell people not to use mods. It was more about being mindful. Both creators and users alike should ensure mods don’t detract from the intended game experience."</p>
<p>"I respect the modding community," he continued. "Mods have played a significant role in the rise of the PC market. Look at series like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls – even years after release, new mods breathe life into these games, making players want to come back to them."</p>
<p>As for the final game in the trilogy, series producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed the story - written by creative director Tetsuya Nomura - has been completed and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">he's "very satisfied with it"</a>.</p>
<p>The PC version of Rebirth includes an option to speed up cutscenes, which the developers would like to add back to the PS5 version, within the limits of the console's capabilities.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Could we perhaps chart the entire course of technological innovation as a story of things not fitting in other things quite as well as some reckless genius had hoped? Something to ponder on, perhaps, as we behold the Steam Brick. As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/one-mad-modder-has-massacred-the-steam-deck-folding-it-into-a-steam-brick-with-no-screen-no-controller-and-absolutely-no-sense/?ut">PC Gamer</a>, one <a href="https://crastinator-pro.github.io/steam-brick/">Crastinator-pro</a> has documented their journey to transform the Steam Deck into a controller-less, screen-less creature of ineffable bricktitude. Why? Because the Deck didn't fit in their backpack.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“I am not a smart man," begins the disclaimer, before Crastinator-pro documents the process of transferring the innards of Valve's handheld into a custom case, played with a separate controller through a pair of AR glasses. The post is "not a guide, more of a 'how I did it'," they point out.</p>
<p>Their "first hurdle" was finding out whether the Deck would even boot without a screen or peripherals. Tutorials helped them disconnect everything from the motherboard excluding the fan, resulting in….(and I'm making space here out of fear my paraphrasing might rob the next part of its deserved sweet triumph):</p>
<p>"Success! In this state the Deck will boot output display over USB and accept peripherals via an external dock."</p>
<p>What follows is a lot of work that you're better off reading the full Github post for, but after tearing things down to a more compact internal frame, Crastinator-pro 3D printed a custom case in Overture Polycarbonate Pro -  "which should be heat-resistant enough not to melt while the deck attempts to run <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>". The result is an attractive, ungodly brick with the following stats:</p>
<p>"About a 3rd of the size of the Deck, and about 4 times smaller than the Deck’s OEM case. As a bonus, it’s also 24% lighter!"</p>
<p>"Why remove the screen? It wouldn’t have made the build larger!" is one of the listed FAQs. "Keeping the screen would have significantly complicated the build, as you’d need something to keep in in place," writes Crastinator-pro. "More importantly – the brick was built to be tossed in a bag as-is. No case, no screen protector, just throw it in a backpack or suitcase and don’t worry about it!"</p><p>I was immediately curious about Crastinator-pro's backpack, seemingly so precious that it warranted this diversion instead of just a simple replacement, but I realise now that this was the wrong question. I also understand the true weight behind his assertion that he is "not a smart man". The stifling prison of earthly intellect alone is not enough to inspire such works. Only sweet whispers from the ether could bestow the Blakean visions needed to conceive such a magnificent brick.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"While the team has no plans for official in game mod support we respect the creativity of the modding community and welcome their creations," Hamaguchi said previously. Speaking to Automaton, he followed up:</p>
<p>“As someone who plays games on PC, I sometimes use mods myself. I’m aware that mods have come to be accepted by the community and that they bring enjoyment to many players – I see it as a positive thing myself. I wasn’t trying to tell people not to use mods. It was more about being mindful. Both creators and users alike should ensure mods don’t detract from the intended game experience.”</p><p>“There are mods that could shock some players, so I encourage users to research what they’re installing and for creators to be mindful of their audience," he continued. “Mods have played a significant role in the rise of the PC market. Look at series like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a> or The Elder Scrolls – even years after release, new mods breathe life into these games, making players want to come back to them.”</p>
<p>“Volunteer communities often move faster than the companies that produced the source material, which creates an exciting atmosphere,” he finished. “I think It’s a fascinating market.”</p>
<p>I do often find it interesting how Nexus Mods can act as a window into player's wishlists for additional or alternative features closely following a game's release. Rebirth's Nexus Mods presence is currently mostly graphics mods like reshades or engine tweaks - which makes sense considering the issues <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-performance-best-settings">some are having</a> with the port.</p>
<p>There's, uh, also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/52">goth makeup</a> for Tifa. A secret <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/10/faq-do-you-know-what-health-goth-means.html">Health Goth</a> revival?</p>
<p>The developers of dino-em-up Code Violet recently drew attention by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dino-crisis-esque-horror-code-violet-wont-be-coming-to-pc-because-the-risk-of-vulgar-mods-isnt-worth-the-extra-money">announcing their game </a>won't be coming to PC because they don't want anyone "modding vulgar versions of the main character". Since then, they've also expressed <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1882873965187846185">concerns over piracy</a> as a major factor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Last of Us Part I patch 1.1.4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1888930/view/503940938959159952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was released on PC</a> last Friday. It fixes a few issues and adds support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-1-announced-frame-generation-on-dlss-xess-upscaling-solutions-improved-image-quality-40-game-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR 3.1 Super Resolution</a> and Frame Generation. AMD FSR 3.0 was added to the game back in March 2024, and this new patch updates it to the latest version (ahead of the planned <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-support-to-feature-in-all-titles-compatible-with-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR 4</a>, which will, however, be exclusive to the new Radeon graphics cards).</p>
<p>As a reminder, FSR 3.1's main improvements are improved temporal stability, which causes less flickering and/or shimmering and fuzziness around moving objects, a reduction in ghosting, and better detail preservation. The big addition, though, is frame generation, which will undoubtedly provide a frame rate boost in The Last of Us Part I.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Super Resolution</em></li>
<li><em>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Frame Generation</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>[Hometown]&nbsp;Fixed rendering issue that could appear on TVs when using NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR</em></li>
<li><em>[The University]&nbsp;Fixed issue that could occur when interacting with a generator while enemies were still present</em></li>
<li><em>[Bus Depot] Fixed issue where Joel's flashlight would turn on when inspecting certain artifacts despite being in direct sunlight</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Fixed Text to Speech issue where "M" key was not being read when assigned to a function</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Naughty Dog is about to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC</a> in just over two months. Hopefully, the game will include all the features that were added to The Last of Us Part I with patches, such as AMD FSR 3.1. Fans are also hoping for better day-one optimization across the board since that was one of the main criticisms levied against the port made by Iron Galaxy and Nixxes Software. People also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-i-pc-patch-1-0-1-5-crashes-issues-remain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced a lot of crashes and other issues</a>, like huge shared loading times, early on.</p>

It spans over 250 km in main roads and features the most famous tourist landmarks, as well as legendary car enthusiast spots, mixed together to create one cohesive and stunning world. From the recreation of the Himeji Castle to our Guntama’s own Daikoku parking area, whether you’re a racing fan or just want to drive through Japanese roads—you’ll always find something exciting to do!</p><p>You will follow the story of Touma, a Polish driver who dreams of making a name for himself on the local street racing scene. With some help from his Japanese friends, he dives deep into the competition but quickly learns that fierce rivals are standing in his way. Will he manage to reach the top? Drama, <a title="Genres > Action [2,444 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, and even love await the players. The story in <em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master</em> is told through in-game events and a manga (Japanese comic book), meticulously drawn by our internal art team. Each time the player takes part in an event, pages of the comic book will lead them in or build up the narrative for what’s next to come.</p><p>There can’t be a racing game, without beautiful and fast cars! The players will find fully licensed Nissan, Mazda, Subaru cars at their disposal and we’re not done with our announcements yet! Stay tuned for more information in the future.</p><p>Each car can be upgraded, both mechanically and visually. From installing a new ECU to adding that over-the-top bōsōzoku exhaust—it’s all in the game! Tuning a car is simple and clear and if the players really want to push their cars to the limit, the most advanced parts will unlock fine tuning—every single car in the game can be adjusted to be a grip or drift beast or an all ‘rounder if that’s the desired preference.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master</em> is a simcade racer, with a solid simulation backbone and arcade layers added on top for a fun and enjoyable experience. Expect each car to behave differently on the street, to feel the weight of it when going into a corner or trying to break at a high speed. Driving physics were very important for us from the beginning and we believe we found a perfect balance between fun and challenge coming from driving a car in real life.</p><p>We also have good news for sim racers and car enthusiasts—we’re constantly adding presets for driving wheels and the plethora of sim driving hardware available on the market to the game. We’re also building a robust key binding feature, where you will be able to set-up basically anything you have hooked up to your PC, for any hardware that we just didn’t have the man-capacity to create a plug and play preset to. It will be available at player’s disposal on the day of the game’s launch. If you’re a controller or a keyboard player, don’t fret, the game will be as enjoyable on them as playing on a steering wheel!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>The Last Corner: Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="JDM: Japanese Drift Master | The Last Corner" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3gZDF4vnb_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/endless-legend-2-revealed-at-amplified-25/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>On Thursday, Amplitude Studios revealed the eagerly awaited ENDLESS Legend 2 at Amplified 25. This is a long-awaited return to an award-winning fantasy strategy series that takes place in the <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/endless-space-2-review/">ENDLESS Universe</a>. This time, players will be taken to a mysterious world called Saiadha, where they'll discover new, unique factions that carry out specific playstyles and a detailed story to go along with it. ENDLESS Legend 2 is set to release in Early Access on PC in early 2025. There isn't a specific date for this just yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5rvxUoYFDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Saiadha is an oceanic world with a constantly changing landscape thanks to tumultuous seasons that cause dramatic tidefalls that cause significant changes to the landscape around you. However, the water will come down as the seasons cycle, and the environment can be explored. The landscape may also provide as an obstacle during this time, thanks to the terrain changes made by the water. This will mean players will have to be strategic in their gameplay in order to contend with the dramatic shifts, as well as uncovering the secrets of this world, and the threats that come along with it.</p>
<p>Players' choices will matter in this game and can lead to detrimental consequences depending on the decisions made. You'll be able to conquer new territories, gain experience, and form long-lasting bonds with allies, as well as points of contention with rivals. When the game launches in Early Access, there will be four unique factions for players to play with, as well as two more being added when the game fully releases.</p>
<p>For those who are eager to get into ENDLESS Legend 2, you can sign up for the Insiders Program, which allows a select group of players to try out ENDLESS Legend 2 before the game officially releases in Early Access. This will allow the players to provide feedback to the developers about what changes need to be made. It's important to note that when you sign up to the Insiders Program, you will be under NDA, and will require a Steam link with Amplifiers, which is the <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/959-endless-legend-2-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community platform</a> that Amplitude Studios uses.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that you'll be accepted for the program, but it does mean that you will be considered for future testing opportunities should they arrive.</p>
<p>Will you be playing ENDLESS Legend 2 when it releases?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ex-blizzard-vets-announce-legacy-steel-and-sorcery-early-access-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After working on World of Warcraft for 14 years, some of the developers have jumped ship to create their own game with a brand new fantasy setting of their own. This title is Legacy: Steel and Sorcery, a game that was one of the top games during <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-sorcery-pvpve-extraction-arpg-gets-alpha-demo-for-steam-next-fest/">Steam Next Fest</a> last year. For those who have already tried it out during Steam Next Fest and enjoyed it, you won't have to wait much longer. The game is set to release in<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344320/Legacy_Steel__Sorcery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Early Access</a> on February 12, 2025.</p>
<p>The title combines class-core multiplayer RPG progression and crafting with MMO PvP to create an Extraction title that stands out from the crowd. It also uses a 3rd person perspective, so you'll be able to see your character in full glory when taking part in the action. The game takes place in a high fantasy world full of ogres, rogues, magicians, and warriors.&nbsp; It's been said that this title has been in development long before the Extraction genre took off, but it will still be able to stand on its own two feet as something unique and enjoyed by those who play it.</p>
<p>Although it's a multiplayer game, you have the option to play solo or play as a group of three and create your own parties, where you will then explore the expansive world of Mithrigarde. While there will be a lot of combat along the way, your main task in Legacy: Steel and Sorcery is to get your hands on forgotten treasures, scavenge for supplies, and get back to base without losing any of it. Of course, it won't be as easy as it sounds, as there are tons of monsters to fight off and other teams to fight off to be able to get back with your treasure.</p>
<p>There will be the classic traits of an MMO PVP game, such as looting, battle, leveling, exploring, and, of course, PvP combat. If this game sounds like something you're interested in, make sure to check out the trailer below to get a glimpse of the fantasy action you could get into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legacy: Steel and Sorcery - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TKQaN0YNOE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Founding players will be able to help provide beneficial feedback to the developers and have helped come up with new classes, maps, and game modes that will be added at a later date. This includes a Wizard and Paladin class.</p>
<p>When the game releases in Early Access on February 12, 2025, the game will cost those who want to purchase it a reasonable $24.99.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Legacy: Steel and Sorcery?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redeption-2-breaks-steam-concurrent/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-2-hits-new-concurrent-record-on-steam-thanks-to-15-sale.1092378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redeption-2-breaks-steam-concurrent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has topped a new record on Steam thanks to Rockstar Games’ sale, where the game is just $15.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Red Dead Redemption 2 currently sits with a peak concurrent player count of 86,717 according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1174180/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, topping its previous record of 77,655 in November 2023.</p>



<p>Its success comes from the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/rockstarpublishersale2025?snr=1_4_4__118&amp;tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Games Steam sale</a>, where you can save up to 80% off on Rockstar Games. Red Dead Redemption 2 seems to be one of the better deals at a 75% discount and for a game considered as a masterpiece (and still very much holds up today, may I add).</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 first released in October 2018 on consoles, and released one year later for PC on November 5, 2019.</p>



<p>The western-themed action-adventure would go on to win over 175 game awards and by June 2024 has sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-millions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">67 million units worldwide</a>.</p>



<p>As for what’s next with Rockstar Games, everyone is waiting for an update on the highly anticipated GTA 6, which will undoubtedly be The Game of the Year, no matter which year it launches. At the time of writing, the game is still slated to launch in 2025, but Rockstar Games’ lack of update has understandably got gamers, and the industry as a whole, wondering if a delay is imminent.</p>



<p>Its delay and lack of updates even resulted in one developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching ‘Grand Taking Ages’ on Steam</a> as a parody.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Red Dead Redemption 2 for just $15? Or are you waiting for that all-important GTA 6 update? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Coca-Cola has partnered with Xbox to give away a selection of super bright controllers "representing the most popular flavours in the brand's portfolio", such as orange, lemon, exotic, fruit twist, grape, and lemon-elderflower.</p>
<p>As well as Fanta-inspired Xbox Series X console bundles and wireless controllers, there's also hundreds of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions up for grabs, too, although you should probably note that they can only be redeemed by new members and not existing ones, I'm afraid.</p>

            <p>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep - the Witcher anime heading to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> next month - will take place in the middle of the live-action show, specifically between episodes 5 and 6, and it includes a scene that was cut from Henry Cavill's first season.</p>
<p>As detailed in this month's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/sfx/">SFX magazine</a> and shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/the-upcoming-the-witcher-anime-movie-features-a-new-version-of-a-scene-cut-from-the-henry-cavills-first-season/">GamesRadar+</a>, writer Mike Ostrowski and co-writer Rae Benjamin call it "a period of not being together [with Yennefer], or a period of trouble, but still on each other's minds".</p>

<p>The writers say they do not interfere with the live-action show's chronology or timeline, but the anime does include a "fun little scene" that was reportedly cut from the main Netflix series.</p>
<p>What, exactly, that scene entails? We're going to have to wait until the show debuts on 11th February, unfortunately - the writers wouldn't say more. But as we know Anya Chalotra reprises her role as Yennefer in the anime, the writers tease that we'll see more of Geralt and Yennefer's relationship in Sirens of the Deep.</p>
<p>"Geralt cannot let Yennefer go, even though he's trying his best," Ostrowski added. "She haunts him. Even if he wanted to be rid of her, he can't."</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us recently, two and a half years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcement</a>, CD Projekt finally gave it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big reveal treatment</a> late in 2024, confirming Ciri to be the focus this time around. And now Doug Cockle - voice of former series protagonist Geralt of Rivia both in the games and the anime - has had his say, calling the switch to a new main character, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">"really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
