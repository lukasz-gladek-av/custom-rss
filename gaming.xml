            <p>Final Fantasy developer Square Enix has reportedly linked up with Tencent to develop a mobile version of its fan-favourite MMO, Final Fantasy 14.</p>
<p>Further to the strategic agreement both companies signed back in 2018, <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-is-in-development.237/">Exputer</a> believes the companies are now working on a mobile port of Final Fantasy 14.</p>
<p>It's not clear if the mobile game will be exclusive to one mobile manufacturer, or available on all devices.</p>

<p>"We are in ongoing communications with Tencent, and there are some projects that are underway but I will refrain from commenting on any details at present, including in terms of any output over the next three years," Square Enix's president, Yosuke Matsuda, <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/docs/210618/page04.html">said</a> back in 2021.</p>
<p>Neither company have formerly confirmed what these projects are, but it's thought the Final Fantasy game is in development after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">an unannounced Nier mobile game was shelved</a> last year.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi recently said he's reluctant to work on a Final Fantasy game again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creator-would-prefer-to-keep-enjoying-final-fantasy-14-as-a-player-than-work-on-the-series-again">as he's having too much fun playing Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>"If I take on the Final Fantasy brand again, I don't know if I'll be able to genuinely enjoy Final Fantasy 14 as much," he said.</p>
<p>Talking of Final Fantasy 14, director and producer Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida recently offered his "sincere apologies" for the issues identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published shortly after the expansion went live for early access players last weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-apologises-for-issues-identified-in-the-early-access-build-of-dawntrail">Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues</a>, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-lead-says-snowdrop-engine-still-needs-to-be-improved-a-lot-for-an-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tom Clancy's XDefiant, Ubisoft San Francisco's first game as lead studio since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a>, launched this May, around three years after the original announcement.</p>
<p>The free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game immediately registered strong player counts, becoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-is-reportedly-the-fastest-ubisoft-game-to-reach-1-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft's fastest game to reach one million players</a>. Last week, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-registered-11-million-players-in-five-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that XDefiant had hosted 11 million players over its first five weeks.</p>
<p>Despite the large fan base, the game has some issues, especially bugs. When a fellow player <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1809020713954914444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> to XDefiant Executive Producer Mark Rubin that the game might have been rushed, the developer replied with a lengthy explanation that the engine (Ubisoft Massive's Snowdrop) wasn't envisioned for that genre and, therefore, still needs a lot of improvement.</p>
<p><em>Rushed out? No. What we have is an engine that has only ever been an MMO. And so all of the infrastructure for an FPS has had to be built up from the ground floor. Even Call of Duty started on ID tech, which was a shooter engine. Apex Legends started on a shooter engine. But for us, we are working on developing all new tech in an engine that was designed for something else. That being said, the engine is really great, but it does require a lot of work, and with that work comes a lot of bugs that other engines have already worked out. We're not a shooter that's been out for 20 years. If you like what we are trying to do, stick around, and you'll see things improve and new features get added. But if the game isn't for you, that's ok; you can move on.</em></p>
<p><em>It's not that it's outdated. It's more just that it wasn't made to do first-person shooters, so there is a lot to do and to improve.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Snowdrop was devised for Tom Clancy's The Division. Later, its incredible potential convinced Ubisoft to use it in many other games, such as Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle and its sequel, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, and The Settlers: New Allies, among others. XDefiant is not the first game powered by Snowdrop to launch, as Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched in December 2023. However, that game was a single player title with optional co-op, whereas a competitive multiplayer shooter has far different needs.</p>
<p>How long will Ubisoft San Francisco need to iron out Snowdrop's kinks remains to be seen. Meanwhile, XDefiant launched Season 1 earlier this week, launching the GS Kommando faction from Rainbow Six, three new maps (Clubhouse, Daytona, Rockefeller), three new weapons available through the free Battle Pass tier, two new modes (Capture the Flag and Bomb, the latter of which is coming later in the season), and Ranked Play.</p>

            <p>Construct 'n' destruct sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/besiege">Besiege</a> recently got a splashy expansion in The Splintered Sea, which Nic enjoyed a lot in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/besiege-splintered-sea-review">his review</a> while calling it compact, small and brisk. Apparently Nic wasn't alone in this opinion: its developers now say they're working on a free update that will expand the expansion and make its campaign 50% longer.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update will add five new levels to The Splintered Sea and will release on July 22nd.
</p>
<p>One of the levels will feature a tentacle beast that can rip apart your vessels, as seen in one of the previous Splintered Sea trailers. Another will challenge your steering, by having you build a small ship you need to guide through a series of closing gates. Apparently another will feature a battle against a swarm of sharks.
</p>
<p>"We’ve also been experimenting with the idea of adding additional challenges to levels that, while not required for completion, can offer a much greater test of your ability," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/346010/view/4237406000171593409">the announcement</a>. The offered example is a series of crates the player can choose to smash through while still completing a level within the time limit.
</p>
<p>It's nice to see Spiderling Studios taking feedback onboard and working to make the expansion more substantial - particualrly because it wasn't at all bad in the first place, and it would have been easy to leave it as it was. Aside from those dinkonyms above, Nic already referred to it as "an awesome and incredibly complex and worthwhile thing."</p>

<p>While the Descendants themselves steal the show, with their unique abilities and appearances, it’s the weapons that will help push you to new heights. If your primary rifle is weak, you won’t be able to push end-game content. Well, here is where to get new weapons in The First Descendant!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-new-guns-in-the-first-descendant">How to Get New Guns in The First Descendant</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to acquire new weapons in The First Descendant. You can unlock powerful guns via the game’s battle pass, earn them by completing missions and defeating bosses out in the world, and by purchasing guns and other equipment from Deslin on Albion.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Deslin is the easiest way to acquire new weapons in the game. He sits just down the staircase leading to the left-hand (when looking at the map) portion of Albion. You can’t miss him, as he’s marked with an icon of two crossed rifles and his odd appearance. He wears modified welding goggles and a pilot’s cap.</p>



<p>While the weapons he sells prove inexpensive and readily available, you’ll likely visit him to buy Reactors. You’re more likely to unlock new weapons by completing missions out in the world. They’re bite-size content that rewards you after a few minutes of combat.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-improve-your-weapons-in-the-first-descendant">How to Improve Your Weapons in The First Descendant</h2>



<p>The First Descendant features a system in which the more you use a weapon, the more powerful it can become.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/weapon-proficiency-first-descendant-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The first time you unlock a new weapon and explore the game’s equipment and inventory system, you’ll note your gun has an orange bar beneath its stats. This bar indicates its Weapon Proficiency level, and you can’t click it or hover over it, making it a mystery. So, what does Weapon Proficiency do in The First Descendant?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-weapon-proficiency-in-the-first-descendant">What is Weapon Proficiency in The First Descendant?</h2>



<p>The game’s Weapon Proficiency system directly affects how powerful your weapon will become as you progress through the game. It’s your skill level with each unique weapon in the game, and the higher the level, the more top-tier Modules you can equip to your gun in The First Descendant.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a way to increase your power level further upon unlocking one of the game’s best weapons—or a favorite weapon that you don’t want to let go of—to push end-game content. </p>



<p>So, why do you need more Modules on your weapon? Think of Modules in The First Descendant like Gems in an RPG. They alter the effects and affixes of your gun with additional damage, better accuracy, and improved critical hit rate chances. Some even add elemental damage to your bullets, like Fire.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-increase-your-weapon-proficiency">How to Increase Your Weapon Proficiency</h2>



<p>There’s only one way to increase your Weapon Proficiency in The First Descendant. You must equip and use the gun in the field. The more you use a weapon, the more Proficiency XP you earn.</p>



<p>Once you complete a mission out in the game’s various zones, you’ll receive a summary of how much Proficiency XP you earned during the quest.</p>



<p>It’s best to occasionally swap weapons to ensure none fall behind the curve!</p>



<hr>



<p>While you’re grinding Proficiency XP, why not take a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into the game’s story</a>?

			<p>Coffee Stain's first-person open world factory building game Satisfactory finally has a 1.0 launch date, over four years after its debut in early access (<a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-massive-hit-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally on the Epic Games Store</a>).</p>
<p>The Swedish development team, also known for the Goat Simulator franchise, <a href="https://x.com/SatisfactoryAF/status/1809241796146331846" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a September 10 PC release date. They also detailed several key changes that will be introduced with the launch version, starting with many changes to the resource modes available on the world map.</p>
<p>According to Coffee Stain, most node reductions have been made in the Northern Forest to encourage expansion from there as players progress into the later stages of the game. At the same time, nodes have been scattered throughout the map, placed where it makes geographical sense to achieve a more even resource distribution. The main materials addressed are Caterium, Sulfur, and Quartz.</p>
<p>In addition, Iron, Copper, and Limestone nodes and water Geysers have been spread across the map to help with basic resource income wherever you build a factory. Coal has also seen changes, with a number of them added in close proximity to The Abyss while also being removed in a few spots around the map.</p>
<p><iframe title="Satisfactory Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/febekpSoEbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Changes to recipe costs will be made in Satisfactory 1.0 to foster smoother transitions between phases and levels, especially in the later stages of the game. Requirements are generally being relaxed; for example, Programmable Splitters will use AI Limiters and Geothermal Generators will use Highspeed Connectors, whereas both used to be made through Supercomputers.</p>
<p>Critically, Coffee Stain claims to have made major optimization strides when it comes to stuttering and memory requirements, especially for textures. The game, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5s-lumen-completely-transforms-the-visuals-of-satisfactory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgraded to Unreal Engine 5 last year</a> with great visual benefits, has now been brought up to version 5.3 of Epic's engine. VRAM, NVIDIA DLSS/ AMD FSR, shadow rendering, level streaming, and actors in the world have all been optimized. Moreover, foliage will no longer be destroyed by vehicles as players drive through it, which not only saves a ton of computing power but also looks a lot better, according to the developers. Last but not least, dedicated servers won't be considered experimental anymore and have had a ton of bugs fixed.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights of Satisfactory Update 1.0. More detailed notes will be published closer to the September 10 launch.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has revealed BLEACH Rebirth of Souls for PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. A release date has not been confirmed. The upcoming game will feature an original story for BLEACH, instead of adapting a story from previous arcs. BLEACH Rebirth of Souls is designed as an arena fighter, with characters from the series clashing in combat. Each character possesses unique abilities for use in battle, where a single strike can end a fight.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0XoOx8kTEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In&nbsp;BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, the more dire the circumstances, the greater character’s power can grow. In the middle of each conflict, the momentum can shift as characters can unleash powerful attacks the closer they get to being defeated. This state reveals new shapes and swords to allow&nbsp; players to snatch triumph from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Bleach game we appeared to have reviewed was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección</a>, way back in 2011. At the time, Dan said,<em> “The story also hasn’t been handled particularly well. Having just a wall of text at the start of a level is actually quite deflating, and rather than pumping up the player for a bit of carnage it has the opposite effect. If the story had been fleshed out then the score would have been a fair bit higher. Overall it’s a fun game, but also a real missed opportunity.”</em></p>

The mod also enhances RT reflections by adding more reflective surfaces to the game. Unfortunately, things aren't perfect all the time, as the mod doesn't feature any denoiser, resulting in worse image quality at resolutions lower than 4K, and not every sequence in the game looks good, which is not surprising at all, considering the game wasn't built with path tracing in mind.</p>

<p>Despite a setting and premise that's markedly different from the rest of the series, Resident Evil Village manages to be among the best entries in CAPCOM's survival horror series. This is thanks to an excellent story, polished presentation, and solid core mechanics, as Nathan highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">review</a>.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Village is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The game launched late last year for certain <a href="https://wccftech.com/m2-ipad-pro-can-run-resident-evil-village-at-max-visual-settings/">iPhone and iPad models.</a></p>

		<p>Hot off the release of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, NIS America has revealed that The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II is coming in early 2025 for PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch. Both Agnes Claudel and Van Arkride return as the main characters, with the game location remaining as the Claudel Republic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trails through Daybreak II -  Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sI7TgkoXqMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II says, <em>“One day, a shocking series of murders set the wheels of fate into motion once again. Chaos looming on the horizon, the spriggan Van Arkride receives an unexpected visitor. Who is behind the murders, and what is their goal? Time may be the only key to unlocking the secrets lurking beneath the shadows… “</em></p>

<p>In our The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak review, Miguel said, <em>“The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak is the spark that this series needed, and an incredible new chapter for such an iconic franchise. The shift in tone for the story and the addictive dual-mode combat had me hooked from beginning to end. If you play any game in this series, make it this one.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-reportedly-in-development-by-tencent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-is-in-development.237/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to leaker Kurakasis</a>, Final Fantasy XIV Mobile is in development. This is reportedly part of the strategic partnership <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-tencent-form-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> by Square Enix and Tencent around six years ago.</p>
<p>Back then, the press release explained:</p>
<p><em>Square Enix Group will be accelerating these business development efforts to enhance its content services worldwide through this strategic alliance with Tencent Group. Outcomes of this newly created alliance include the establishment of a joint-venture company, co-development of AAA titles based on new intellectual properties, the licensing of existing intellectual properties, and more.</em></p>
<p>So far, no game project borne out of this partnership made it to market. An unannounced Nier mobile game was canceled in December 2023 (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-axes-square-enix-nier-mobile-game-it-hunts-new-hit-sources-2024-02-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as reported by Reuters</a>) as the developers failed to find the right monetization model for such a high-cost project.</p>
<p>Needless to say, a full port of the gargantuan Final Fantasy XIV MMORPG may prove to be even more problematic in that regard. To this day, it is one of the few games in the genre that mandates a subscription to play; such a business model is unlikely to find success in the mobile space.</p>
<p>We'll have to see if this project, unlike Nier's, ever sees the light of day. Meanwhile, Square Enix has just released the fifth Final Fantasy XIV expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-launches-on-july-2-says-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dawntrail</a>. Following the end of the previous 10-year-long storyline, adventurers are now headed to a brand new continent, Tural, inspired by real-life Southeast Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>So far, the reception has been a bit worse than expected. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2649240/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Dawntrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Steam</a>, only 63% of the 2,147 user reviews published to date are positive. On the other hand, Final Fantasy XIV Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/e2da42164b4e6c9967ebb2e41d6321a515d36909" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the game registered a record number of players not seen since the re-launch of A Realm Reborn in 2013. Yoshida-san also outlined some of the planned job adjustments coming in future updates for Monk, Astrologian, Viper, Black Mage, Tank, Samurai, Red Mage, and Pictomancer.</p>
<p>In other news, Naoki Yoshida recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> about the possibility of Final Fantasy XIV launching on the next Nintendo console. He said that could happen, but it may be years before such a release takes place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/2010s-bioshock-2-insane/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While we wait for 2K and Cloud Chamber's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioShock 4</a>, a stunning new graphical showcase of 2010's BioShock 2 has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC2Ttbm8m8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a>.</p>
<p>Created by German YouTuber 'Digital Dreams', this new showcase shows 2K's Bioshock 2 running in 8K resolution at 60FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU combined with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950x CPU. For this showcase, the YouTuber used '<a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CompleteRT</a>' Ray Tracing ReShade shader that adds Ray Traced Diffuse Illumination as well as Ray Traced Reflections. "<em>One of the most advanced&nbsp;<strong>Screen space Ray Tracing</strong> Shaders, lets you add [Global illumination], [Ambient Occlusion], Matte, and Glossy Reflections to your favorite games using Reshade</em>", the description of this Ray Tracing shader reads.</p>
<p>As expected on this setup, the game runs on the highest-possible settings, and the results are pretty spectacular, especially for a 14-year-old title - Rapture has never looked this great. Check out the new BioShock 2 showcase below and judge for yourself:</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Bioshock 2 - CompleteRT -  ultra Settings BeyondallLimits - ULTRA GRAPHICS SHOWCASE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tC2Ttbm8m8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Released in 2010 for PC and the available consoles at that time, the PS3 and Xbox 360, BioShock 2 is considered a worthy sequel to 2007's BioShock. Some even consider the sequel better than the 2007 original due to the improved gameplay and combat. "BioShock represented a watershed moment in the gaming industry when it illustrated that games, like feature films, can be viewed as art - both in art design and in the rich depth of the narrative," Christoph Hartmann, then president of 2K said in 2010. “Most importantly, the media are stating what we’ve known all along; that whether or not you’ve played the original, BioShock 2 is a worthy successor to one of the best games of all time that should not be missed.”</p>
<p>As said, 2K and developer Cloud Chamber are currently actively working on BioShock 4 with Cloud Chamber r<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecently looking for numerous new team players in order to ramp up development on the game</a>. Meanwhile, the creator of the original BioShock, Ken Levine, is currently working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judas</a> with his studio <span>Ghost Story Games.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[COD League Viewership Drops 29% in 2024]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cod-league-viewership-drop-2024/</link>

<p>The Call of Duty League’s ‘regular season’ has now wrapped up and players are preparing to make it big on the stage at COD Champs in Texas later this month. It has been a tough year for many involved, with some teams putting up an abysmal performance that saw loss-streak records broken dramatically, and for others, it has been a jubilant season filled with success. </p>



<p>However, despite the ups and downs, the drama and the clutch moments, viewership for the Call of Duty League has dropped around 29% since 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-way-down">On The Way Down</h2>



<p>In a string of <a href="https://escharts.com/news/cdl-2024-regular-season-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statistics revealed by escharts.com</a>, it was highlighted that viewership during this year’s CDL regular season tanked by almost a third. The average viewer count dropped by 28.5% while the peak viewer count saw a decline of 26.8% – the airtime remained almost the same, though.</p>



<p>It might seem bizarre to some, but the COD League’s official channel barely managed to retain the strongest market share in terms of viewership. On YouTube, the CDL channel pulled in just 38.6% of viewers, with Scump’s iconic ‘watch parties’ grabbing a whopping 36.8% of the market. At the start of the season, an exclusivity deal threatened the watch parties hosted by Seth ‘Scump’ Abner and other personalities, such as ZooMaa – without them, this year’s viewer count would have collapsed in on itself.</p>



<p>This season’s peak came during the Stage 3 Major between Atlanta FaZe and OpTic Texas, which is considered the El Classico of Call of Duty. In a dramatic showdown, OpTic Texas secured its first trophy in more than 800 days, beating FaZe while a peak count of 335,170 users watched on. The team would later decimate Toronto Ultra to snag the trophy.</p>



<p>With that drop in mind, we now look to COD Champs, which is set to run from July 18 – 21. There’s a $2.2 million prize pool on the line but with viewership going the way it is, how much of an audience will be there to see this season’s champion crowned? </p>
