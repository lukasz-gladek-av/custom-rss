                <p> There were more souls-likes than I could muster the interest in at Summer Game Fest 2025. I've never been one to enjoy the genre in most cases anyway, and seeing how many games were leaning into gameplay loops of dodge-roll showdowns with gigantic, spongey bosses had me checked out at times during the various showcases over the past week. But I played one game that borrows from the genre and didn't turn me away. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/end-of-abyss/" data-ref-id="5000-681505">End of Abyss</a> takes a few touchstones from games like Dark Souls, ties it in with a Little-Nightmares-in-space aesthetic, and brings it all together in a cleverly creepy twin-stick shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">End of Abyss comes from Section 9 Interactive, a new studio created in part by former Tarsier Studio developers, the team behind Little Nightmares and its sequel. The Little Nightmares influence can definitely be felt in End of Abyss. Though the enemy and world design are much different, trading the stuff of childhood night terrors for coldly blue-tinted isolation akin to a sci-fi horror story, there's something about it that feels familiar. Maybe it's the nameless, voiceless character being chased by fleshy monsters. Or maybe it's their brightly colored jacket--here a lime green as opposed to Little Nightmare's yellow raincoat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eot8qV7CuTA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eot8qV7CuTA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, the protagonist in End of Abyss can defend themselves, unlike those in Tarsier's games. Using a pistol with unlimited ammo, or other found weapons like a shotgun I discovered in my play session, the game's twin-stick shooting felt well-implemented. It wasn't very sticky, which I liked, as it gave it an anxiety-inducing effect. Missing shots meant the enemies were able to close the distance and caused me to dodge them, either out of the room so I could create a bottleneck in a doorway, or just catch my breath. Some enemies grew long, giraffe-like necks, which they swung at me with sneakily far reach. Others came in packs of several small bugs that would jump on me, causing me to shake them off and book it, or try to knife them on their approach.</p><p dir="ltr">The souls-like inspirations can be felt in a few ways some players will be familiar with. For one, the map feels circular in that satisfying way From Software and its lineage utilize a lot. Exploring every space felt key, as it allowed me to find hidden caches of weapon or suit upgrade materials, but just as important, I could unlock passageways that helped me loop back around to earlier areas.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the enemies respawn when you save at a mysterious type of pod--not to be confused with a traditional bonfire--these shortcuts helped evade the same sequence of enemies each time I came back to the area to save or upgrade my character. There are no corpse runs, but the game will punish you for failing to save manually, so these shortcuts back to a safe haven will be vital for survival.</p><p dir="ltr">I got to take on a huge boss monster too, which, despite its sizeable health bar, didn't prove too tricky given my abundance of shotgun ammo I'd crafted by then, but I expect this was a kindness afforded to me in the demo only, and in the full game, I'd have to scramble a bit more. The boss battle felt soulsy too, where each hit devastated me, so I could only afford to mess up very few times. I'm hoping the game can strike a nice balance between being challenging yet not brutal, and co-creator Mattias Ottvall told me that's the team's vision as well.</p><p dir="ltr">From what I've played so far, the game's best attribute is its atmosphere. There is a chilling stillness to the world. Enemies often stand around, or even seem to lie in wait, until you approach them, sometimes sneak-attacking from behind a doorway or out of a shadow. This leaves you alone much of the time, unsure of what's around each corner. Your scanner device, which can locate secret caches or puzzle areas, echoes through the ghostly halls of the alien world. I suspect the game won't care to answer many questions about where and when the game takes place, and I'm perfectly happy to go along for that ride into the unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly a horror game, Ottvall told me, but the game has inched closer to that identity during development because its small team featured mostly artwork-focused developers. The mechanics of the game naturally shifted to adapt to the art-driven game. That was an interesting wrinkle for me to learn, as it suggests that the game may have looked quite different if the balance between gameplay designers and world designers was skewed the other way. Instead, we got the icy-blue End of Abyss you can see in the trailer above, which is definitely more up my alley than a demanding combat-first game the devs may have once been targeting.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who loves Little Nightmares, enjoys twin-stick shooters, and doesn't care for souls-likes, I feel what I saw so far is enough of those first two elements to allow me not to get frustrated by its third element. End of Abyss seems to be the start of an intriguing new studio. It's coming to Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege X</a> is now available on all platforms (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Amazon Luna). The sizable update improves graphics and adds new content, but also brings free access to the game, allowing newcomers to join with a selection of operators and play Unranked, Quick Match, and Dual Front modes without paying. Certain features like Ranked playlists, Siege Cup, additional operators, and cosmetics require payment to unlock.</p>
<p>Two of the available options are the Elite Edition, which grants access to all game modes, including Ranked playlists and Siege Cup, and 16 additional operators for $19.99, and the Ultimate Edition, which also unlocks all game modes, the Ranked playlists and the Siege Cup, but adds immediate access to 52 Operators and the Disruptor Pack for a price of $39.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X: Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BI9fgQY0d5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Rainbow Six Siege X, players will experience the brand-new permanent 6v6 mode, Dual Front. For the first time, Dual Front mixes Attackers and Defenders to seize enemy sectors while defending their own. During matches, players can respawn, change their selected operator, and complete time-limited Neutral Sector assignments. Siege X also introduces significant upgrades and overhauls to the graphics, gameplay, and audio.</p>
<p>At launch, five modernized 5v5 maps received upgrades to lighting, shadows, and resolution: Clubhouse, Chalet, Border, Bank, and Kafe. Three new 5v5 maps will be modernized each season thereafter.</p>
<p>The gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege X is deeper thanks to new destructible items, including gas pipes, metal detectors, and fire extinguishers. Players can interact with these items strategically to outplay their opponents. Rappel navigation and momentum movement have also been improved, providing more fluid controls. Players can now sprint horizontally along walls on rappel and maneuver around building corners.</p>
<p>The audio propagation and reverberation have been overhauled, making the game sound more realistic than before. This enables players to gather critical intelligence through audio cues, allowing them to pinpoint the location and type of rooms where enemy players are on the map. Lastly, Ubisoft Montréal has added a new onboarding experience that will help new players build their skills and confidence.</p>

                <p>Funcom's Dune: Awakening is finally out on PC, but you might be wondering if it's also headed to consoles. Now that the game has launched on PC, Funcom re-affirmed that Awakening is, indeed, headed to console platforms, but not until 2026.</p><p>There is no specific 2026 release date, however, nor is there a set of confirmed console platforms, but Xbox and PlayStation systems seem like a safe bet. Whether or not Switch 2 may be in the mix, too, is unknown.</p><p>Awakening blasted off on Steam to big results, as the $50 game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently the No. 1 best-selling game</a> and is inside Steam's top 10 most-played games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clocking more than 135,000 concurrent players.</a></p><p>Funcom highlighted the fact that Awakening is available on PC as part of a "classic business model" where you "buy once and own it." This is the full 1.0 launch, not early access, and there are no subscription fees or microtransactions.</p><p>There is a $25 season pass that includes a range of content, including the sandworm, hiroptera, kulon, and Muad'Dib creatures, which are available now. The three other DLC packs in the season pass are coming later this year and in 2026.</p><p>Awakening is a multiplayer survival game set on the planet of Arrakis, based on the work of author Frank Herbert and most recently brought to life in the Dune films from Denis Villeneuve. Players can choose to align with Atreides or Harkonnen and then take part in missions that "influence the shared world."</p><p>As for the movie series, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/denis-villeneuve-dune-3-plans-1236119697/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Villeneuve is coming back to make a third Dune movie.</a></p>

However, like the Arctis Nova 5, the Arctis Nova 3 Wireless does not support simultaneous playback from both devices. Instead, you can swap between the two connections on the fly. That said, by connecting to your mobile device via Bluetooth, you can modify the headset's selected EQ preset in the Arctis mobile app, even while listening to your console or PC over 2.4Ghz.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond slightly different platform compatibilities, the Nova 3X Wireless and Nova 3P Wireless are otherwise identical. They both sport the same lightweight design and flexible headbands as other Arctis Nova headsets, and feature detachable microphones, custom-tuned neodymium magnetic drivers, and up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge. They also support fast-charging, which can recharge up to nine hours of battery after just 15 minutes. Both are available for $110.</p></div>                      </div><p>We haven't tested the Arctis Nova 3, but several other Arctis models landed on our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset/1100-6525389/" data-ref-id="1100-6525389">best gaming headsets</a>, including the premium <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0CD99Q59P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7</a>, so we’re optimistic about the Nova 3's performance. There are plenty of other fantastic SteelSeries headsets to check out, including the budget-friendly wired Arctis Nova 1. Its audio quality and wired connection aren’t ideal for all situations, but it’s hard to beat its low price.</p><p>We've compiled a list of all the headsets in SteelSeries' Arctis Nova line below. Most of these headsets are available in a variety of models, and those with the “X” classification add Xbox support along with support for platforms like PS5, Switch, and PC. So if you’re worried about using your headset across multiple devices (or are specifically looking for Xbox support), these are the ones to get. Those with a "P", meanwhile, are built for PlayStation and lack Xbox support.</p><h2>All SteelSeries Arctis Headsets</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWF9BCJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wired (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC)</a> -- $195 (<del>$280</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B09ZWCYQTX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC)</a> -- $301 (<del>$380</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless (Xbox, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC)</a> -- $300</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P</a> -- $147 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7</a> -- $153 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0CD99Q59P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X</a> -- $200</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D2YBQQ1P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5</a> -- $108 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D2YBKD62?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5P</a> -- $120 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X</a> -- $123 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F94KTF6C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless (PlayStation, Switch, PC)</a> -- $110</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F9548L67?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3X Wireless (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC)</a> -- $110</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWMYHCT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 (Wired)</a> -- $78 (<del>$100</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0B8Q4CR52?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 (Wired)</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

		<p>Brother, I am exhausted. Apologies this is late. I'm writing this on the floor of LAX, crossing my fingers the slight delay on my flight does not become a big delay. (I think it'll be OK.) I'm glad I made time for half of Summer Game Fest, despite a family wedding overlapping, and you'll hear about what I played, saw, and, uh, <em>experienced</em> while in Los Angeles. It was, of course, ominous to get a push notification saying "Trump has sent in the National Guard to Los Angeles" when my flight was landing in Los Angeles. It only became more distressing when the protests themselves were being felt—and having consequences on—Summer Game Fest itself. And that's all without talking about how some dipshits shot me with a paintball gun while I walked home to my hotel. (It was very scary and my arm started bleeding but I'm alright.)</p><p>-pk, who will try to unwind on his flight with the new <em>Predator</em> film</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The upcoming schedule for Remap</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Steam Next Fest</em> – Sad to be missing this, but I'll be downloading a whole bunch of demos to check out this week, I'm sure. Cado and Janet will hold this down.

Like every fest before it, there are hundreds (probably thousands) of great games to check out free demos for, most of them indies, too. We’re doing our best to wade through these demos and check out games we’re excited for, ones to watch, and ones we had never heard of before playing during Steam Next Fest.</p><p>Below, we have a selection of the best Steam Next Fest demos we’ve played so far, and as the week rolls on, we’ll continue to update it with new games we want to surface to our readers. The current Steam Next Fest started yesterday, Monday, June 9, and will run through Monday, June 16, so keep this page bookmarked as we’ll be updating it daily with demos you need to check out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> is due to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on August 8, 2025, and in the lead up to its launch, developer Hangar 13 is doing everything it can to showcase how improved this prequel entry to the series is since we last checked in with the Mafia franchise.</p>
<p>The latest of those efforts is a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwkvXUiG8do">developer diary video</a>, "<em>Art Meets Technology,</em>" which digs into how much better looking Mafia: The Old Country is compared to the rest of the series thanks to the new technologies available in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"<em>It allows us to tell that story in a way that we just wouldn't be able to, with other technologies,</em>" said art director Steve Noake. He continued, "<em>F</em><em>rom Metahuman, to Nanite, to Lumen. These are all different technologies which we are pushing to the max, to be honest. It's allowing us to grasp the intricacies of a performance, it's allowing us to automate some parts of the process, to be able to get to a point where we can really start to put our human thumbprints on some of these assets.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Breaking Omertà: &quot;Art Meets Technology&quot; | Mafia: The Old Country" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwkvXUiG8do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lead character artist Ivan Rylka added that there's a "<em>notable improvement</em>" in what's possible with Unreal Engine 5 versus what Hangar 13 was capable of doing prior to UE5, and confidently claimed "<em>I have no hesitation that this will be the best looking Mafia game in the franchise.</em>"</p>
<p>It's clear that Hangar 13 is putting in every effort to make Mafia: The Old Country look and feel as good as possible. It'll be interesting to see if it's more than just looks by the time it arrives this coming August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/684438/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-xbox-showcase-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350352/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a> was one of several games that Xbox showed off in its games showcase over the weekend. And during its Summer Game Fest-adjacent in-person preview event, I got the chance to play it for myself. I’ve never played <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> before and was skeptical that the game’s generic dark aesthetic, which feels straight out of 2012, could capture my interest. But after a short hands-on demo and an interview with the game’s developers, I’m less wary and powerfully intrigued. </p><p>Despite the “4” in the title, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> represents a soft reset for the franchise. You play as Yakumo, a ninja of the Raven Clan, who must save Tokyo from corruption. The game feels like a hack-and-slash beat ‘em up with extreme emphasis on the hacking and slashing. Yakumo uses a number of weapons and abilities at his disposal, including swords, throwing knives, and an ability that briefly transforms him into a demonic raven for an extra burst of power. </p><p>My time with the demo was short, consisting of Yakumo ninja-flipping through ruined city streets, fighting packs of cybernetic demons. In combat, you can string together attacks, producing visually impressive combos. One of the things that I most appreciated about the combat system was that it included one of my favorite moves in any action game — an air recovery ability. If you’re hit into the air, you can quickly tap a button to right yourself and get back into the fight rather than get knocked away. Whoever at Team Ninja / PlatinumGames is a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> fan, I see you.</p><p>Also, along the way, I encountered a number of Yakumo’s allies (including one voiced by Brandon “<a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Garrus_Vakarian">Garrus Vakarian</a>” Keener, whose voice I’d know anywhere) who introduced me to the world, giving me power-ups and combat advice.</p><p>This game is bloody, cartoonishly so. Once I’ve whittled down my enemies’ health, I can dismember them in a number of increasingly brutal ways. It was so over the top that it veered into absurd territory, and I found myself laughing out loud in an otherwise quiet demo room. I wondered if the tension between the hardcore seriousness of Yakumo and his friends versus the goofy violence was intentional, but according to the developers, the game is working as intended.</p><p>“<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> has always been known as a very violent game, but we didn’t want to just make it grotesque,” says Yuji Nakao, game producer and director at PlatinumGames, speaking through a translator. “Because if we did that, you’d get tired of it.”</p><p>Team Ninja partnered with PlatinumGames to develop the title, and the inclusion of the studio that made <em>Bayonetta</em> informs a bit of that tonal dissonance. <em>Bayonetta </em>is campy and fun, and I can see elements of that camp in <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>.</p><p>“When we were working with PlatinumGames,” says Masakazu Hirayama, the producer and director at Team Ninja. “We wanted to bring their unique style approach to the action genre and inject that into the series.”</p><p>Unless you count ports, remasters, or spinoffs, it’s been more than 12 years since the last original title in the <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> series. In that time, a new crop of gamers, who are probably more familiar with <em>Bayonetta</em>, have come up. Meanwhile, there’s still an older generation running around with memories of Ryu Hayabusa and <em>Ninja Gaiden Black</em>. The result of the partnership between PlatinumGames and Team Ninja is a game that has elements that’ll appeal to different generations of players.</p><p>“<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> is about having a very diverse tool set that allows you to feel like that ultimate super ninja,” says Hirayama. “And I think you’ll see that the new protagonist and his new tool set opens up a lot of new possibilities.”</p><p>The new game may not seem like the most exciting of titles if you’re not a long-time fan of the series. But my skepticism of the game was slashed away in the face of an over-the-top gorefest that seems to take itself seriously but is hiding a soft, goofy center that wound up being really fun to play. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> comes out on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on October 21st.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When these pesky flying headaches spawn, they zoom in from the edge of the map, slowing down momentarily to launch a barrage of lasers in your direction, then speed off into the sunset. If you’re quick enough, when they slow down, you can hit them with a high-powered weapon, likely a support weapon, to take one down.</p><p>While they’re speedy, Stingrays don’t have much in the way of armor. The moment they stop, swap to your heavy weapon and unleash hell. Even if all you have is your primary, you can still take one down, but it’ll take longer and likely a more concerted effort from the team.</p><h2 id="h80"><a id="2"></a>Best weapons to use against Interlopers</h2><figure id="" data-id="09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-recommend-id="image://09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Recoilless Rifle in Helldivers 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Recoilless Rifle in Helldivers 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Arrowhead Game Studios / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-recommend-id="image://09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Recoilless Rifle in Helldivers 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As previously mentioned, your primary weapon would suffice in a pinch, but you’ll want to rely on your heavy support weapon more often than not.

Once fired, the rocket continues chasing its target until it either hits or the enemy disappears off the map.</li><li><strong>EAT-17 Expendable Anti-Tank</strong>: Like the GR-8 Recoilless Rifle, a single shot will bring down a Stingray, so long as you can land said shot. As this isn’t a lock-on weapon, you must manually aim and fire, which causes all manner of headaches mid-combat.</li></ul><p>Now’s the time to stop the Illuminate, soldier! <em>Helldivers 2</em> is available now on PS5 and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>IO Interactive has announced "key partners" for its upcoming James Bond game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a>, and they include a series of well-known global brands. In a statement on social media, the studio said it's partnered with Aston Martin, Coca-Cola, Orlebar Brown, HermanMillerGaming, Jaguar, Range Rover Defender, Omega, Nvidia, and Leica.</p><p>The James Bond movie series is known for its product placement, and 007: First Light will have some, too. The reveal trailer showed an Aston Martin DBS and some flashy Omega watches. A Triumph motorcycle was in the trailer, too, but Triumph is not listed as a partner. A Range Rover Defender was in the trailer, too. Walther, the gun company that makes Bond's iconic PPK, is not listed as a partner.</p><p>The financial terms of the deals to include these brands in First Light are unknown. Revenue from product placement in the Bond movies is substantial, coming in at <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/485031/james-bonds-recordshattering-product-placement-by-numbers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported millions of dollars.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4510755-screenshot2025-06-10at1.39.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510755" data-ratio="0.52256770310933" data-width="997" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4510755-screenshot2025-06-10at1.39.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510755"></a><figcaption>A scene from the First Light trailer showing a case of Omega watches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4510755-screenshot2025-06-10at1.39.07pm.png"></figure><p>First Light launches in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC. It tells an origin story for James Bond, focusing on a 26-year-old Bond who joins MI6 and rises through the ranks to earn his 00 status. We don't know who's playing Bond in the game, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/who-plays-james-bond-in-007-first-light-fans-believe-theyve-worked-it-out/1100-6532125/" data-ref-id="1100-6532125">fans believe they have worked it out.</a></p><p>IO has high hopes for the game, as the studio has said it aims to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">create a trilogy of games. </a>While fans have to wait to play First Light, IO's Hitman game just added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen's LeChiffre from Casino Royale as its latest elusive target.</a></p><p>As for the James Bond movie series, a 24th film is in the works now, with Harry Potter's David Heyman and Spider-Man's Amy Pascal signed on to produce. As of yet, however, there is no word on who will direct or, crucially, who will play Bond himself. Series stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">no longer involved with the creative decisions for the James Bond series. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Carry Case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8139320c8ea3/review-nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-2-cases-to-carry-and-protect-your-console">carry cases</a>, many people swear by 'official' options, and with good reason; when Nintendo is tasked with making a case for its own console, you'd assume the company would produce a decent product.</p>
<p>That's certainly true of the official Nintendo Switch 2 Carry Case ($39.99 / £20.99), which is one of the two options currently being offered by Nintendo itself (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-gives-us-a-closer-look-at-switch-2s-all-in-one-carrying-case">the second is a larger, all-in-one option that costs a bit more</a>).</p>
<p>Described by Nintendo as "stylish and sturdy", this case is certainly robust enough to prevent your shiny new console from bumps and scratches on the road, but it's not in the same league as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">Genki Sleeper Case</a> with its "virtually indestructible" shell.</p>
<p>It also loses out to Genki's offering by only having space for six Game Cards inside (the Sleeper Case has 18 slots), although the official NS2 case has a small compartment for storing items like the Joy-Con 2 wrist straps, which is a bonus.</p>

<p>It's also smaller than the Genki Sleeper Case, and provides a snugger fit for your Switch 2, thanks to the fact that Nintendo isn't expecting you to have an additional case (like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Genki Attack Vector</a>) installed. Oh, and the zipper mechanism is <em>much</em> easier to use, too, but it doesn't provide water resistance, like on Genki's case.</p>
<p>While Nintendo claims this is a stylish option, I'd argue it's rather understated—which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as many people don't want to broadcast that they're carrying a game console around with them. The front of the case has the Switch 2 logo, while Nintendo's iconic logo is found on the back. The only other design element of note is the blue and orange zipper handles, which mimic the colour accents of the left and right Joy-Con 2 controllers.</p>
<p>You also get a screen protector bundled with this case, the installation of which is totally optional. I don't tend to bother with screen protectors as I'm super careful with my tech, but it's a handy bonus item if you find you don't feel comfortable without having one fitted.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there's not a lot more to add here. This is a slimline, strong and reasonably attractive case which won't totally break the bank, and I'd imagine Nintendo will sell plenty of them—but if you're looking for something that provides best-in-class protection, you might want to seek out alternative options.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-switch-2-pro-controller-is-pro-enough-for-me.1214844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The new $84.99 Pro Controller for the Switch 2 may not be your idea of a pro-grade controller — perhaps not by a long shot. But it’s certainly more of one than Nintendo’s $69.99 last-gen controller. It has two extra buttons embedded into its grips (one on each side), which can be programmed on a per-game basis, a 3.5mm headphone jack for listening to games or GameChat chatter, and a more premium look and feel. It’s no <a href="http://l/">DualSense Edge</a>, but it’s pro enough for me.</p><p>I like that Nintendo kept almost everything the same from its predecessor, except the semi-transparent smoke black shell that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/6/14825944/nintendo-thank-you-message-switch-pro-controller">hid a secret message</a>: the Fisher Price-sized face buttons, the snappy directional pad, and the compact form factor are all here. I don’t want to generalize, but its size might be perfect for the same crowd who yearns for small phones, those who typically experience hand pain from using the controllers that Sony or Microsoft put out. It has the other trappings that made the last-gen Pro controller worth buying, like Amiibo NFC support and motion controls.</p><p>In terms of what’s new in the Switch 2-edition of the Pro Controller, I hope you weren’t holding your breath for eight years waiting for Hall effect or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR</a> joysticks because they aren’t here. Instead, we have drift-prone potentiometer joysticks again, albeit some of the smoothest and quietest ones that I’ve ever used. There’s so little resistance required to move them, yet they don’t easily register unintentional inputs. We’ll see how well they fare over time. For what it’s worth, my original Pro Controller from 2017 is still kicking.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->84</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Small and comfortable to use</li><li>Great rear button implementation</li><li>Audio via 3.5mm jack…finally</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>No drift-proof joysticks</li></ul></div></div></div><p>This controller, like the Switch 2’s right Joy-Con, features a dedicated GameChat button. This button launches the namesake feature, which is free for all Switch 2 owners to use through March 31st, 2026, when it will be gated behind the Nintendo Switch Online paywall. The good news for this controller is, whether you want to use GameChat now or ever, you can reprogram the “C” button to do whatever you’d like it to do. You won’t lose out on GameChat functionality, as there’s a dedicated home menu option for the feature.</p><p>The new controller offers some conveniences not found in the predecessor, which may tempt you into upgrading. As mentioned, the Switch 2 Pro Controller has a 3.5mm headphone jack, from which it can output game and GameChat audio to wired headphones or a headset. The ability to stream audio wirelessly from the console to the controller is a big deal for Nintendo, even though it already figured it out in the Wii U Gamepad. <strong>Note</strong>: the LED player indicator has been moved to the top of the Switch 2 Pro Controller to make room for the 3.5mm jack. </p><p>Another, albeit smaller, feature is the ability to wake up the Switch 2 console from sleep with the new Pro Controller. This seems like a sneaky way for Nintendo to bait players into upgrading their last-gen controllers. Wake from sleep is a basic feature, one that shouldn’t be limited to this controller. It’s handy if you typically play your Switch while it’s docked to your TV. Wake from sleep wasn’t utilized in most third-party controllers during the original Switch era, but 8BitDo figured out a way to enable it by shaking some of its controllers. So, it’s always possible that there will soon be cheaper solutions that figure a way around this annoying issue.</p><div><div><p id="yes-your-dualsense-can-work-on-a-switch-2"><h2>Yes, your DualSense can work on a Switch 2</h2></p></div><p>If you buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Adapter-Controller-USB-Wireless/dp/B09ZQN76PC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">8BitDo USB Adapter 2</a>, update it via the <a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/firmware-updater.html">company’s app</a>, and plug it into your Switch 2, you can wirelessly connect a DualSense, a new Xbox controller, or a number of <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/usb-wireless-adapter-2/#:~:text=PS5%2C%20PS4%2C%20PS4%20Pro%2C%20PS3%20controllers">older models</a> to it. It’s a cheaper alternative to buying a new controller that gets you 75 percent of the functionality of a Switch Pro controller. There’s rumble, gyroscopic controls in games that support it (on DualSense, not the Xbox controller), and remappable controls. You’ll only be missing out on Amiibo support, 3.5mm audio passthrough, and the wake to sleep feature.</p></div><p>Both this controller and the new Joy-Con 2 feature what Nintendo calls HD Rumble 2, an improved version of the tactile rumble introduced with the original Switch. I already thought HD Rumble was nifty in some use cases, and my opinion hasn’t changed as I’ve played <em>Mario Kart World</em> and Switch 2 Edition of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. HD Rumble seemed novel, if not a bit gimmicky, until the introduction of the DualSense and its brilliant haptics in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537067/astros-playroom-ps5-dualsense-hands-on-preview"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a> and in several other titles since. The new Switch 2 haptics aren’t on the same level, at least in the launch games.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The GL and GR buttons are arguably my favorite implementation of rear paddles in a controller. While most companies put them on the backside of the gamepad, a place where I rarely rest my fingers, these are curved, wrapping around the grips where my middle fingers naturally rest. Pressing them requires essentially no effort — you don’t even need to arch your fingers to tap the buttons. It’s easy enough to press them in with the meat of my second knuckle by applying some downward pressure. It rules.</p><p>If any of the aforementioned additions sound appealing to you, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is probably worth its cost. Yes, I wish it had more futureproof joysticks, and perhaps another feature or two to justify its tariff-boosted price (it was originally $79.99). It’s very likely that third-party controller manufacturers like 8BitDo, GameSir, GuliKit, and others will make options with most, if not all, of the same features at a lower price – so while the Switch 2 Pro Controller is the best option right now, that might not always be the case. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/eve-frontier-wants-to-fully-hand-the-galaxy-over-to-the-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EVE Online has a decades-long reputation at this point for being a sprawling, ruthless, libertine space sandbox full of crime, war, betrayal, and player-built empires. And from its conception, EVE Frontier is really all of those things dialed up even further. Blending its space MMO heritage with elements of the survival crafting genre and employing the blockchain to – so the devs say – give even more control to players, it's certainly a thought-provoking prospect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let me get this out of the way first: Frontier is, yes, a blockchain game. It also features a cryptocurrency token that can be bought with real money and spent on in-game purchases. (EVE Online has had the ability to buy its subscription token, PLEX, with real money and sell it for in-game money for a while now, so that specific aspect isn't new.) I am highly skeptical, personally, of these kinds of rotating Silicon Valley hype words, and nothing CCP has said to me so far has made me less so, as a rule.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">EVE Frontier - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But I do believe, based on the conversations I've had with these devs, that they are genuinely interested in the tech primarily on the basis of the gameplay features it might enable. I asked a lot of hard questions, and don't think they're trying to drum up investment capital by invoking magic words or cash in on some kind of crypto rug-pull. Their faith in this tech might be misplaced, in my opinion. But I think their desire to leverage it is generally in good faith.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I do believe, based on the conversations I've had with these devs, that they are genuinely interested in the tech primarily on the basis of the gameplay features it might enable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">CEO Hilmar Pétursson told me that the intent with putting Frontier on the chain was that if, for instance, a meteor were to hit their offices in Reykjavik, the universe they, and we, created could persist without them. It also opens the door for CCP to step back from being active administrators some day and simply be another organization within the decentralized EVE Frontier ecosystem. On the topic of environmental concerns, I was assured repeatedly that using "proof of stake" verification, it was possible to run Frontier's blockchain elements using about the same amount of energy as the traditional EVE Online servers that have been up for years. I don't know enough about the tech involved to independently verify this, but it's what I was told.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the day, it is what it is. So let's move on to how Frontier actually plays.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>A DARK FOREST</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While EVE Online started with large areas of high security space populated by NPC factions with their own laws and police, Frontier is exactly what it says in the name: an entirely fresh canvas of wild space with no rules but the ones we make and enforce as players. We're still controlling spaceships in third person, making jumps between star systems to collect resources and craft industrial stations, consumables, and equipment, and shooting at NPC baddies or other players with lasers and rockets. It feels very familiar, moment-to-moment, as a long-time EVE player. One big exception is that combat is a bit more intuitive and complex now with obstacles like asteroids being able to block weapon fire realistically based on their precise shapes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone starts out in your own dark corner of the galaxy with a single ship and a home base, beginning a journey to tame the stellar wilderness from square one. When I asked the devs if they thought players would eventually build their own permanent civilizations, maybe up to and including something like EVE Online's Concord, they told me the potential is definitely there. But there is a certain level of added attrition in Frontier, partly in the form of terrifying, wandering world bosses that take the shape of rogue AI – hulking, almost Lovecraftian metallic beasts in the black with unknown motives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Frontier also aims to be a moddable MMO, which might sound like a strange prospect. Initially, much of what you build in the 3D world will be restricted to remixing premade assets. You won't be able to import your own meshes from Blender, for instance, though that restriction may not last forever. But we were shown a lot of ways players could push the boundaries of the genre and their own imaginations.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>HIGHWAY TO SPACE HELL</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One way this manifests is in the gate network, which will be entirely player-built. You could set up your own interstellar highway connecting what will initially be isolated star systems, and even charge in-game resources or crypto tokens to use them. Of course, there's nothing necessarily stopping another player from building their own bypass right next to yours with lower tolls or even for free. You also don't have to ask for resources at all. You could make other players solve a riddle or follow you on social media to use your gates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously I can imagine many dystopian permutations of this kind of libertarian space sandbox. More than anything, it kind of reminds me of Minecraft anarchy servers like the infamous 2b2t. And when I asked Pétursson if CCP's lawyers thought he was crazy, he very matter-of-factly confirmed that they do. But CCP is trusting that the players will be the ones to self-police the worst excesses.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If McDonalds were to come in and try to establish a stargate network that required you to watch a commercial for their new combo meal every five jumps, they would also need to provide their own around-the-clock security or anti-corpo player federations could simply come in and blow it all up. To what extent these brands might find it's worth hiring mercenaries in a video game to protect their ad buys remains to be seen. And there is something fascinating about that, I have to admit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The one thing CCP will not ever allow modification of, the bedrock upon which this universe sits, is its laws of physics.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The one thing CCP will not ever allow modification of, the bedrock upon which this universe sits, is its laws of physics. A ship still has mass and will behave like something with mass would, even if you make it look like pregnant Sonic the Hedgehog. And anything you build will still ultimately require a supply chain that can be traced back to mining matter from black hole clusters. If you want to use your real-world riches to buy a bunch of tokens and bootstrap an in-game empire, you'll still need to buy those finite resources from players who took the time to gather them, at market rates. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. There's no way of bypassing that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>SEE YOU ON THE FRONTIER</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">EVE Frontier is, if nothing else, an intriguing experiment in the making. It could be an absolute trash fire, and I remain actively wary of its blockchain and cryptocurrency elements. But I did have fun playing the small bit of it we got access to, and it is an enticing invitation to settle and develop fresh empires in a blank slate galaxy with no major NPC factions to work around. But if you don't want to take my word for it, you can try it out yourself with one of Frontier's paid Founder packages right now.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Siege X update also "modernizes" the Clubhouse, Chalet, Border, Bank, and Kafe maps with new lighting, shadows, and resolution updates, with Ubisoft planning these "modernization" updates for three 5v5 maps with each new season going ahead.</p><p>What's more, Siege X adds the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dual-front-brings-fast-paced-6v6-action-to-rainbow-six-siege/1100-6530104/" data-ref-id="1100-6530104">Dual Front 6v6 mode</a>, which is a respawning mode that challenges players to seize enemy territories. It is available only for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI9fgQY0d5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BI9fgQY0d5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Beyond this, the game gets an anti-cheat boost with the introduction of R6 ShieldGuard, which is described as a "multifaceted approach to anti-cheat."</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege and the Siege X update are available for free, but players have to pay to unlock things like additional operators and Ranked playlists. Players can alternatively buy the Elite edition ($20) or the Ultimate edition ($40) to get access to even more content.</p><p>All of this is arriving alongside the newest seasonal update, Operation Daybreak, the centerpiece of which is a remaster for the operator Clash. The soldier's CCE shield is now deployable, meaning she can place it strategically. The Operation Daybreak season also makes balance changes, including electricity no longer dealing damage and limb damage being reduced. The Jackal, Sledge, Thunderbird, Jäger, and Blackbeard operators have all received balance updates, too.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege originally launched in 2015 and has been steadily supported and evolved over time with consistent updates. It's reached 85 million players prior to the Siege X update.</p>

<p>Plus a new graphics option</p>

<figure><a title="Fast Fusion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b22559981516/fast-fusion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Shin'en Multimedia</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shin'en Multimedia's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> has proven to be a big hit with Nintendo Switch 2 owners, earning a coveted score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">9/10</a> from yours truly.</p>
<p>The company isn't quite done with the game, however, and we can reveal that the first upcoming content update will contain a remade track from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. You might be able to recognise it from the image above, but for those unaware, the track is <strong>Alpine Trust.</strong></p>
<p>Shin'en has confirmed that it will boast revamped visuals and gameplay elements. It's also confirmed that this is just "one of the courses" in the upcoming update, but the total number is unknown for now.</p><p><figure data-videoid="NK1xJVeVTDM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5b9621qpvyjz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In addition to the new tracks, Shin'en will be adding in a new graphics mode simply dubbed 'PURE'. In response to fan feedback regarding the slightly 'blurry' visuals, this will remove anti-aliasing and reprojection from the image, producing a much cleaner presentation.</p>
<p>There's no specific release date for the new content, but we suspect this will be launching sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>For now, Fast Fusion is well worth checking out if you're a fan of racing series like <strong>WipEout</strong> and <strong>F-Zero</strong>. It builds upon what Fast RMX accomplished on the Switch 1 with much-improved visuals, a new jump mechanic, and a Fusion feature in which you can combine two vehicles into something completely new.</p>
