While some of the more harmless examples include regular remake/remaster suspects like upscaled character portraits looking weird, there are far more egregious alterations here, like this image of a wrecked wanzer (a mech in the <em>Front Mission</em> universe), which in the original on the left clearly had legs and guns, but in the remake on the right is now...a crashed Eschercopter:</p><figure><figcaption>Front Mission 3 / RPGSite</figcaption></figure><p>Or this briefing screen, which in the original (left) was clearly illustrating a wireframe schematic, but in the remake (right) is now a maze you see printed on the back of a family restaurant's menu:</p><figure><figcaption>Front Mission 3 / RPGSite</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering about the rest of the game, a trailer was posted earlier today showing extensive gameplay footage, and nearly every comment is complaining about how certain animations or sound effects have been cut (or replaced with worse versions).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FRONT MISSION 3: Remake || 15-minutes Gameplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBb9-DJ8I-c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This sucks!

<p>Shoot some hoops this August</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo surprised us with an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-confirms-the-release-date-for-drag-x-drive-on-switch-2">update about the release date</a> of the 3-on-3 sports game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, confirming it would be arriving on the Switch 2 this August.</p>
<p>Adding to this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/drag-x-drive-switch-2-eshop-price-revealed">was a price reveal</a> and now in another update, we've got what appears to be the game's estimated file size. According to Nintendo's official store listing it will require a download of 1.7GB.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it's nowhere near the size of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a> game and is instead closer to the file size of Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> eShop title.</p>
<p>Once again, pre-orders are live for $19.99 (or your regional equivalent) and you can pre-load the title, so you'll be able to play it as soon as it launches.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 comes loaded with a total of 256GB storage, which is a huge step up on the Switch's internal space, but if you are running out of space, you can always <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2">expand your storage with a microSD Express card</a>.</p>

Crossbow locked. Field-ready. Strategic genius with a mean uppercut.</li><li>Widowmaker as Baroness: Striking for Cobra with brains, bullets, and betrayal, this femme fatale is lethal. Cold, calculated, always in control and couture.</li><li>Reaper as Cobra Commander: Unhinged ambition in a chilling new form, schemes sharpened by madness. The face of terror. The voice of chaos. Commands Cobra.</li><li>Doomfist as Destro: Not just muscle for Cobra, but a mastermind in metal, made of profits, power, and pure strength. Brawler. Steel-plated menace. Built for punching.</li></ul><p>Players can also earn signature voice lines, a weapon charm, and sprays inspired by G.I. Joe by completing special in-game special ops challenges in either Quick Play, Competitive, or Stadium. The Overwatch 2 x G.I.

Oddly enough, you're not actually catching these fish. These just mark the area where you'll be reeling in Pals and other in-game items.</p><p dir="ltr">You have the potential to catch both new and existing Pals in the game. To get started, you'll need a fishing rod and some bait. Then, head to the water and cast your line near a school of fish. A minigame will occur once a "fish" takes the bait. This game is similar to fishing in Stardew Valley, where you have a fishing meter and need to keep a green bar near the fish to successfully reel them in.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can also catch even more Pals by building and placing fishing ponds inside your base. We'll cover details on the fishing ponds below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808"></a><figcaption>Fishing in Palworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_craft_fishing_rods">How to craft fishing rods</h2><p dir="ltr">There are various fishing rods that you can craft at various levels, and here we'll break down the requirements for each.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Beginner_Fishing_Set">Beginner Fishing Set</h3><p dir="ltr">Available at technology level 15, the beginner fishing set costs 2 points to unlock.

There are several bait types you can use: Simple Bait, High Quality Bait, Deluxe Bait, and Alluring Bait.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Simple_bait">Simple bait</h3><p dir="ltr">Simple Bait is unlocked when you purchase the beginner fishing set. This is the most basic bait type for fishing for Pals. This is a decent starting point for fishing, but it won't be very effective in luring Pals to bite.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">2 Pal Fluids</li><li dir="ltr">4 Berries</li><li dir="ltr">2 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="High_Quality_Bait">High Quality Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">High Quality Bait is available at technology level 22, and it can be unlocked for 1 point. This bait lures in Pals, and it's improved quality to make catching them more readily.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 Pal Fluids</li><li dir="ltr">4 Tomatoes</li><li dir="ltr">3 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deluxe_Bait">Deluxe Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">The Deluxe bait is available at technology level 38, and it can be unlocked for 2 points. This bait lures in Pals and also enlarges the size of the bar in the fishing minigame.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">4 High Quality Pal Oil</li><li dir="ltr">4 Onion</li><li dir="ltr">3 Carrot</li><li dir="ltr">4 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Alluring_Bait">Alluring Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">The Alluring bait is available at technology level 52, and it can be unlocked for 2 points. This bait has several benefits, as it lures in Pals, improves the minigame, and increases the number of items obtained from earning. This includes Pals and salvage items.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">10 High Quality Pal Oil</li><li dir="ltr">1 Cavern Mushroom</li><li dir="ltr">3 Carrots</li><li dir="ltr">5 Flour</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you've unlocked a bait type, it can then be crafted at the High Quality Workbench.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810"></a><figcaption>Fishing pond at base</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_use_fishing_ponds">How to use fishing ponds</h2><p dir="ltr">You can build fishing ponds at your base so your Pals can fish, too. You'll need to craft some bait to place here and assign a Pal to fish for you. Not every Pal can fish, but you should have quite a few options by the time you're high enough level to unlock them. You'll need to assign someone who can use their hands, which means you'll need a handiwork Pal like Anubis, Lyleen, or Katress.</p><p dir="ltr">These ponds have the potential to catch new and existing aquatic Pals, as well as in-game items such as gold and gems. These items can be collected from the cooler sitting next to your fishing Pal.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fishing_pond">Fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">The first Fishing Pond is found at technology level 31, and it can be unlocked for 3 points.</p><p dir="ltr">To build, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">40 Wood</li><li dir="ltr">5 Cement</li><li dir="ltr">10 Pal Fluids</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Large_fishing_pond">Large fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">This larger pond makes it possible to catch even larger Pals than the standard pond.

Just place an aquatic Pal in your party and make sure you've crafted a saddle for them. Use your fishing pole to reel in various items, such as Pal Souls, Gold, and gems.</p><p dir="ltr">Salvage spots in the sea are marked by floating bits of wood and barrels. You'll obviously need a fishing pole equipped, but bait isn't necessary. You simply need to interact with the floating junk to start a minigame. This is different from the fishing minigame, and instead, you'll see a ring that requires you to stop a spinning marker inside a highlighted green area.</p><p dir="ltr">Palworld's <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1937709560053285318" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> for the update state you can also salvage a new metal from the sea to use in upgrading your weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Personally, I haven't caught any metal yet. It's likely you'll need the update's new Powerful Fishing Magnet.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Powerful_Fishing_Magnet">Powerful Fishing Magnet</h3><p dir="ltr">This new item is described as a high-powered magnet for advanced salvage operations. It's likely a magnet that will pull the new metal type and other high-end items from the sea.</p><p dir="ltr">The Powerful Fishing Magnet is available at technology level 61, and it costs 3 points to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following material:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 Hexolite</li></ul><p>For more Palworld guides, make sure to check out how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-change-a-pals-gender-and-passive-skills-in-palworld/1100-6532740/" data-ref-id="1100-6532740">change a Pal's gender and passive skills</a>, how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-transfer-pals-to-different-worlds-in-palworld/1100-6530261/">move Pals to different worlds</a>, and how to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-upgrade-palworld-schematics-to-better-rarities/1100-6530263/"> upgrade your schematics</a>.</p>

Capcom has said the livestream will last about 40 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the start times for different time zones:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">6 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">11 PM BST</li><li dir="ltr">8 AM (June 27)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What to expect</h2><p dir="ltr">While there is always a small chance for surprises, Capcom has announced the four games that will be featured in the livestream. Those games are Monster Hunter Wilds, Resident Evil Requiem, Pragmata, and Street Fighter 6.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was announced during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Games Fest 2025</a>, and now Capcom is planning to show off more of it during the stream. Some outlets, including GameSpot, got to see an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/">extended demo of Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which could be shown here to the public. It's also possible that Capcom has even more to show, since Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 26, 2026</p><p dir="ltr">Pragmata got a new trailer at Summer Game Fest along with a 2026 release window. GameSpot played a hands-on demo of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pragmata-hands-on-juggling-gunplay-and-puzzles-gets-surprisingly-tense/1100-6532386/">puzzle-shooter</a> at Summer Games Fest, and it seems possible Capcom could show off more gameplay here. Considering Pragmata got its 2026 release window just a few weeks ago, it seems unlikely that a more specific date will be announced during the Capcom Spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds, which currently has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc-is-seeing-fewer-players-than-world-as-negative-reviews-continue/1100-6532587/">overwhelmingly negative reviews</a> on Steam due to ongoing performance issues, will likely see announcements of new content updates, including potential upcoming events or new monsters. While there will most likely be a Monster Hunter Wilds expansion announced at some point in the future, it is probably too soon for that to be revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom recently announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-6-adds-sagat-c-viper-and-two-more-characters/1100-6532220/" data-ref-id="1100-6532220">DLC fighters coming in Year 3</a> of Street Fighter 6--Sagat, C. Viper, Ingrid, and Alex--but Sagat, the first character to be released, doesn't have a release date just yet. There will likely also be other updates, like new cosmetics and perhaps a showcase of the new fighter.</p><p dir="ltr">With the showcase running for about 40 minutes, it seems like there won't be much time for additional announcements. However, Capcom has unveiled a classic game collection or two at past showcases, so never say never.</p>

Improved textures and lighting, as well as an audio experience that’s been completely remastered from the ground up, are just the start of what was outlined for players on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S. Nintendo Switch, however, was left out of the lineup entirely.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dying Light: Retouched - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to Techland to ask about a potential Dying Light: Retouched update for Nintendo Switch and if it’s something players can look forward to in the future. A representative for the studio tells us it’s not in the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Dying Light: Retouched Update is not coming to Nintendo Switch,” Techland explained in an email exchange.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dying Light first arrived for Nintendo’s original hybrid gaming platform <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-nintendo-switch-platinum-edition"><u>in 2021 as an all-encompassing Platinum Edition bundle</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you plug the world’s best-reviewed webcams into the Nintendo Switch 2 today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">they won’t work, while many comparatively ancient webcams do</a>. Why? That’s been a mystery for the nearly three weeks since the handheld launched. Now, two companies say they’ve figured it out and are pledging to update the firmware on their cameras.</p><p>Here’s a possibly oversimplified answer: today’s more powerful webcams advertise many different modes that they support to any device you connect via USB — but <em>that’s a problem</em> because the Nintendo Switch 2 appears to be choosing modes it can’t properly play.</p><p>In the case of Elgato, which will update its non-working Facecam MK.2 and Facecam Neo, the solve was adding an additional low-resolution 480p mode, <a href="https://x.com/JFest/status/1937966174429712886">with Elgato general manager Julian Fest speculating</a> that the Switch can only reliably support “very low resolution” cameras in order to put <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TZZ1akN8V8">multiple facecams on screen</a>.</p><p>But low resolution by itself isn’t the answer — as you’d probably expect, given that Nintendo’s own official Switch 2 camera is a 1080p camera that genuinely broadcasts a 1080p mode (we checked), and given it’s far from the only 1080p or higher camera that works with Nintendo’s new Switch.</p><p>Accessory company Ugreen tells <em>The Verge</em> that the technical details of making a camera work with the console are far more nuanced than resolution, or frame rate, or whether you have the enhanced bandwidth of USB 3 or the far slower USB 2.</p><p>Nor is it enough for the camera to support a single compatible UVC (USB Video Class) mode. Instead, Ugreen spokesperson Gabrielle Wang explains by email, the camera needs to <em>avoid</em> advertising modes or protocols that the Switch might not recognize, or that it might attempt to use but fail, after you plug it into the console.</p><p>Ugreen says three different conditions <em>all simultaneously </em>need to be met for a camera to work with the Switch 2:</p><div><ul><li><span>“The camera must not use the HID protocol.”</span></li><li><span>“The camera must be configured for Isochronous transfer mode.” (<a href="https://www.regami.solutions/post/isochronous-isoc-vs-bulk-choosing-right-transfer-mode-usb-cameras">As opposed to Bulk</a>, which can be more resource intensive.)</span></li><li><span>“The USB endpoint descriptors must not include unsupported low frame rate settings (below 30 fps).” More on that one in a sec.</span></li></ul></div><p>Unfortunately, you’re not likely to find any of those “specs” on a camera’s box or in its marketing materials, but but they are things you can check with a connected PC and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/usbview">a tool like USBView</a> — and in so doing, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXg6qfvBkS5nhfzY6-ABoEp1RraYqh6s2VvPpLfByi4/edit?tab=t.8dlf1ievxdr9">we can see</a> the camera incompatibility situation is more nuanced than a single factor.</p><p>Elgato’s Facecam MK.2, for instance, already advertises isochronous modes to connected devices as far as I can tell, and it doesn’t advertise an HID interface. In fact, it appears to already offer a 480p mode as well.</p><p>But Elgato’s camera may have broken Ugreen’s third theoretical rule — it tells connected devices like the Switch 2 that it’s capable of running as low as 5 fps at a variety of different resolutions, according to the USB Device Descriptors I’ve viewed. Ugreen says that the Switch 2 may prioritize lower settings, “but if the camera hardware cannot actually output at such low frame rates, it will cause a failure.”</p><p>It wouldn’t be surprising if Ugreen had an easier time figuring this out: though none of Elgato’s webcams worked with the Switch 2 at launch, Ugreen had the benefit of discovering that some of its models did, while others did not.</p><p>Ugreen says its CM826 / 55512, CM797 / 45644, and CM825 / 75330 cameras will have updates by the end of June, while the CM678 / 15728, CM778 / 35626, CM717 / 25442, CM825 / 55721, and CM831 / 65381 already work.</p><p>But I wonder if this should solely be the responsibility of camera companies — PCs, for example, don’t generally have this same trouble picking from a webcam’s list of supported video modes. Perhaps Nintendo will address the webcam compatibility situation, globally, with an update of its own.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t have a comment for our story.</p><div><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andru-marino">Andru Marino</a> contributed to this story.</em></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato]]></content:encoded>

                <p>When Epic first revealed and launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s popular new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-blitz-royale-mode-comes-with-a-free-skin/1100-6532511/" data-ref-id="1100-6532511">Blitz Royale mode</a> on June 17, it came with an expiration date of July 15. But it didn't take long for the company to deliver an extension.. Blitz Royale has consistently been Fortnite's most popular mode in the week since it launched, and on Wednesday, Epic updated the Fortnite API with <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1937960260406296938" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four additional weeks of Blitz Royale</a>. The new end date is apparently August 12.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1937963962600939740" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Leakers believe</a> they already know the themes Epic will give to each of the additional weeks: Jujutsu Kaisen, Mortal Kombat, and Dragon Ball. Blitz Royale is currently having Avatar Week, which will be followed by Boss Week next Tuesday, and then TMNT Week after that. Each of these weeks will feature weapons and items related to the theme--for the current Avatar week, for example, the loot pool is full of the bending scrolls that were in standard Battle Royale during Chapter 5 Season 2, and TMNT week will bring back each of the turtles' melee weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. </p><p>Blitz Royale is a quicker and smaller version of Fortnite's battle royale, with 32 players on a tiny map, and rounds that last under five minutes. It's a faster and furiouser version of Fortnite, and it caught on immediately. If Blitz Royale continues pulling in tons of players, it's very likely that Epic will make it a permanent mode eventually. This initial launch period may be about seeing how Blitz Royale affects the overall Fortnite ecosystem. Since all seems to be going well on that front, we expect it won't stay away long if it actually does leave on August 12.</p><p>As it is, Blitz Royale will definitely need some overhauls. For one thing, the initial storm circle is the same in every round, always cutting off the northern part of the island. Secondly, Blitz Royale deserves its own fresh map, because the current Blitz map is just a smaller version of the Reload Venture island, and that in turn was just a smaller version of the Chapter 1 OG island. We've already wasted enough of our lives fighting over Pleasant Park and Retail Row, thank you very much.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-1-gets-free-audio-and-visual-enhancements-this-week-but-they-wont-be-coming-to-switch</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's a big year for Dying Light; the open-world zombie series is celebrating its tenth anniversary, and developer Techland is marking the occasion with a variety of projects. That includes a newly detailed audio and visual refresh for the series' debut instalment, which arrives in a free update - titled Dying Light: Retouched - this Thursday, 26th June.
</p>
<p>
"One of the best things about working with your own engine is that the people building it are just next door," Techland <a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26">explains on its blog</a>. "Over the past couple of years, we've added a lot, customised a lot, and learned how to squeeze more from the tech we already have. One day, someone just started applying those learnings to some old assets - and it just clicked that we could do that across the whole game."
</p>
<p>
As such, players can expect increased texture resolution and quality, as well as improved lighting and physics-based rendering. Techland also promises a new 8K Ultra shadow quality ("a lot of surfaces that previously looked rather flat now really pop out and get depth!", it writes), and there's an increased maximum level-of-detail option for those with hardware to support it, meaning Dying Light's most detailed assets can now be seen much further away.

<p>
As far as audio goes, original composer Paweł Blaszczak has remastered Dying Light's soundtrack for the update, while new tracks and ambient sounds have been "woven in" throughout. That's alongside "seriously juiced up... hit reaction audio in combat", which is said to sound "more satisfying [and] more impactful."
</p>
<p>
Techland does, however, take great pains to stress that Dying Light's Retouched update is all about "enhancements" and is "not a complete overhaul or remaster." Additionally, the "level of changes" players can expect will "vary by platform".
</p>
<p>
Dying Light: Retouched launches Thursday, 26th June for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Notably absent from that list is the original Switch, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-dying-light-on-switch-another-mobile-miracle">received an impressive port of Dying Light back in 2021</a>, and Techland has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-retouched-update-isnt-coming-to-nintendo-switch-as-techland-denies-plans-for-switch-2-port">confirmed to IGN</a> the update is "not coming" to Nintendo's platform. Don't expect a version of Dying Light for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> either, as Techland says it has "no plans [to release one] at this moment."
</p>
<p>
Instead, it's apparently all-hands-on-deck for the studio's upcoming 18-hour standalone adventure, Dying Light: The Beast, which launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 22nd August. And there's more planned for the series beyond that; Techland <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-teases-multiple-unannounced-dying-light-projects-including-board-games-and-a-webcomic">previously revealed it's working on "multiple unannounced projects"</a> that "go beyond video games", including board games, a webcomic series, merchandise, and "more".

The list of titles on the chopping block includes heavy hitters like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hades/hades-review-the-highs-and-lows-of-repetition">Hades</a>, the Monument Valley series, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/deaths-door/deaths-door-review-reaping-the-rewards">Death’s Door</a>.</p><p>On July 15, 22 titles, which require a Netflix subscription to play, will exit the service. Some games, such as Hades, were only available on mobile devices through Netflix, so it’s unclear if they’ll become available on other mobile storefronts. Although July 15 is the removal date, some titles will disappear before then (such as Hades, exiting on July 1). Here’s the full list of games making their exit:</p><ul><li>Battleship</li><li>Braid, Anniversary Edition</li><li>Carmen Sandiego</li><li>CoComelon: Play with JJ</li><li>Death’s Door</li><li>Diner Out: Merge Cafe</li><li>Dumb Ways to Die</li><li>Ghost Detective</li><li>Hades (available only on iOS)</li><li>Katana Zero</li><li>LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed</li><li>Ludo King</li><li>Monument Valley</li><li>Monument Valley 2</li><li>Monument Valley 3</li><li>Rainbow Six: SMOL</li><li>Raji: An Ancient Epic</li><li>SpongeBob: Bubble Pop F.U.N.</li><li>TED Tumblewords</li><li>The Case of the Golden Idol</li><li>The Rise of the Golden Idol</li><li>Vineyard Valley</li></ul><p>Netflix’s entire mobile library consists of 114 games, which means roughly 20 percent of its library is disappearing. While this isn't the first time games have been delisted from the mobile library, these removals come as some question Netflix Games' long-term future.</p><p>Last October, Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-has-closed-its-aaa-gaming-studio-133014946.html">shut down its triple-A game development studio</a> in Southern California, leading to the departures of several high-profile talents only a few months after the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-games-engagement-tripled-in-the-last-year-in-part-thanks-to-gta">expressed optimism</a> about its games division. In January, the company <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-abandons-release-plans-for-6-games-including-tales-of-the-shire-dont-starve-together-and-compass-point-west/">canceled plans </a>to bring previously announced titles to the service, including Thirsty Suitors, Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, and Don't Starve Together.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> is, by most measures, an authentically promising-looking game. You get to build your own Jurassic Park, a dream we’ve all had at some point or another while succumbing to our own hubris. This time around, the series is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simulating 75 dinosaur species</a> across generations, with traits both beneficial and pernicious getting passed on to dino-youths. There are “distinct female, male, and juvenile variants” with “unique social needs” and “brand new behaviors.” All that painstaking effort, and yet developer Frontier was planning to take the easy way out with non-prehistoric park partners – until recently.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this month, prospective players noticed an AI disclosure on <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em>’s Steam page. "Scientists' avatars are created using generative AI," it read. This led to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of negative comments</a> across multiple Steam threads, the kind of storm some developers would opt to try to wait out. As of this week, however, Frontier is singing a different tune: “Thanks for your feedback on this topic,” reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/?ctp=16#c599656262950498876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post on the game’s Steam forum</a>. “We have opted to remove the use of generative AI for scientist portraits within <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em>.”</p><p>Confusingly, some have suggested that <em>Jurassic World Evolution 2</em> also used AI for scientist portraits, though the game’s Steam page includes no such disclosure. Then again, the game came out in 2021, before Valve began requiring developers to take this specific tack where AI is concerned. Aftermath reached out to Frontier for more information but did not receive a response as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, this is a more or less optimal outcome compared to, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ark-aquatica-ai-trailer-snail-games-studio-wildcard-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple companies on another dinosaur-themed game playing hot potato with accountability</a> for hacky use of AI that serves no one, least of all the people pouring their blood, sweat, and tears into the rest of the video game.</p><p>"Good,” one Steam user replied to the devs’ post about removing generative AI from the game, “I'm sure you can afford an artist to create them for you. It's not like <em>Jurassic Park</em> is a small IP."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety"><h3>Roblox Accused Of Allowing Sexual Exploitation In Four Separate Lawsuits</h3></a><p>All four — and more reportedly incoming, lawyers say — are filed by the same law firm</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/jurassic-world-evolution-3-ai-removed]]></content:encoded>

Although Nintendo became widely known in the early '80s for arcade hits like Donkey Kong, the company's first foray into gaming came in the early '70s with lightgun games. Since the launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1985, Nintendo has remained a major player in gaming.</p><p>The Nintendo Museum already has exhibits that celebrate the history of Nintendo's video games, as well as a selection of minigames that visitors are allowed to play. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">GameSpot's two-day visit to the museum in 2024</a>, Dan Ryckert noted that it "is light on text, descriptions, placards, and other traditional elements of a museum." He added that the room with fully-functional giant controllers from the Famicom, SNES, N64, and Wii Remotes was his favorite.</p><p>Nintendo Museum also has a large selection of exclusive merchandise. In response to demand from around the world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-museum-puts-limits-on-gift-store-merch-to-discourage-scalpers/1100-6526911/" data-ref-id="1100-6526911">Nintendo Museum added limits to the merch that visitors can buy</a> in order to discourage scalpers. The museum still requires visitors to register for tickets, and <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405685819670914" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo also noted</a> that anyone who wishes to change their reservation for September should cancel their old reservation and reapply by the end of June.</p>

<h2>A clear improvement</h2>
<p>As you can see in the included charts, SteamOS showed noticeable frame rate improvements in four of the five games tested. Only <em>Borderlands 3</em> showed comparable performance across both operating systems, with Windows eking out ever-so-slightly higher frame rates in that game's benchmarks.</p>


<p>For the other four tested games, the stock Lenovo Windows drivers were sometimes significantly worse than those included with SteamOS. When playing <em>Returnal</em> at "High" graphics presets and 1920×1200 resolution, for instance, changing from Lenovo's Windows drivers to SteamOS meant the difference between a hard-to-take 18 FPS average and a downright decent 33 FPS average.</p>
<p>Sideloading the updated Asus drivers showed a noticeable improvement in Windows performance across all tested games and even brought <em>Homeworld 3</em>'s "Low" graphics benchmark test to practical parity with SteamOS. In all other cases, though, even these updated drivers resulted in benchmark frame rates anywhere from 8 percent to 36 percent lower than those same benchmarks on SteamOS.</p>
<p>These results might seem a bit counterintuitive, considering that games running on SteamOS must go through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/valves-upcoming-steam-deck-will-be-based-on-arch-linux-not-debian/">a Proton translation layer</a> for every native Windows instruction in a game's code. But Valve has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">put in consistent work</a> over the years to make Proton as efficient and cross-compatible as possible; not to mention its <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-improving-mesa-graphics-drivers-on-linux-for-a-secret-game/">continued work on Linux's Mesa graphics drivers</a> seems to be paying dividends for SteamOS graphics performance.</p>
<p>Running SteamOS also means eliminating a lot of operating system overhead that the more generalist Windows uses by default. Microsoft seems aware of this issue for gamers and has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">recently announced</a> that the upcoming "Xbox Experience for Handheld" will "minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks" to allow for "more [and] higher framerates" in games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dbrand-admits-it-had-a-%E2%80%98spectacularly-terrible-response%E2%80%99-to-killswitch-joy-con-grip-detachment-complaints.1228482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Dbrand will send replacement Killswitch Joy-Con Grips for the Switch 2 to buyers after admitting it had a “spectacularly terrible response” to complaints that the controllers could detach from the console if held a certain way while the grips were on. The company is currently working on tweaks to the grips as well.</p><p>A few days ago, some owners of the case noticed that the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers could pop off if you had the case and grips on <em>and</em> held the console primarily by a Joy-Con. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lgav3g/i_love_my_killswitch_2_buttttttt/">short video</a> helps illustrate the issue.</p><p>On Sunday, Dbrand posted a more than 4,000-word response <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">on Reddit</a> titled “Killswitch Joy-Con Detachment Update” where it said that “nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this.” Dbrand argued that the detachment only happened when all three of the following conditions were met:</p><div><blockquote><p>You are specifically holding onto the console from only the Joy-Cons, in such a way that your fingers are making no supportive contact with the main console, <strong>and</strong></p><p>you are holding the Switch 2 with only one hand, <strong>and</strong></p><p>your Switch 2 is held more parallel to the ground than not.</p></blockquote></div><p>Part of the issue is that the Killswitch case’s Joy-Con grips wrap around the inner part of the Joy-Con, creating a small lip. “By adding those lips, particularly the ones on the interior face of the Joy-Cons, we filled the ‘air gap’ between the Joy-Cons and the Main Case,” Dbrand said. This means that it’s easier for the Joy-Con to create leverage against the main tablet part of the console so that detachment can occur “when held under a very specific set of conditions.”</p><p>In some “particularly severe instances of detachment” highlighted on Reddit by Dbrand, the company also believed the Joy-Con grips had “an inner attachment lip that’s <em>a hair thicker</em> than desired.” Dbrand said that it had adjusted its tolerance guidelines for mass production to “filter out any Joy-Cons that cross that ‘lip is 0.12mm too thick’ threshold.”</p><p>For users who were worried that they were having issues, Dbrand asked them to reach out to support and “describe the regular use scenario that is resulting in detachment” and the company would get them replacement grips in July.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz7c2yd/">More</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz7z9l8/">than</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz9czxr/">one</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/mz7lxrw/">commenter</a> pointed out that Dbrand’s post echoed Steve Jobs and Apple’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/25/iphone.problems.response/index.html">famous response</a> to iPhone 4 antenna issues caused by a way people could hold their phones. And yesterday, Dbrand published a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">new post</a> where it said it would “try out a new communication strategy where we both say fewer words and devote less of them to blaming you” and offered to send everyone, “whether or not you’re experiencing this issue,” a replacement set of Joy-Con Grips.</p><p>“As easy as it is to boil our original post down to <em>‘you’re holding it wrong</em>,’ what we’re sober to now is the point that <em>you should be allowed to hold it however the fuck you want, without detachment occurring</em>,” Dbrand said. “We get it. Please continue dunking on us for the next six to eight months for reincarnating Steve Jobs.”</p><p>Dbrand is working on two new versions of the grips: one with “an even <em>thinner retaining</em> lip compared to the ‘good’ stock we’ve already shipped” and one with a new retaining lip design that the company says “fully resolves the detachment issue.” However, that second option won’t be ready for a “mass production trial” until July 10th, and “at that point,” Dbrand will be able to tell if it will be using the first or second options for replacements.</p><p>Dbrand says to expect its next update on July 10th.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/693121/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-joy-con-case-replacement-detachment]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's taken a while to get it sorted, but developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has finally managed to fix Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's wonky A-Life system as part of the post-apocalyptic shooter's latest massive update - meaning players can now expect a bit more life to their wasteland adventure as NPCs live their simulated lives and pursue their own goals. Oh, and official modding tools are here too, but you'll need to clear some considerable space to install them.
</p>
<p>
Starting with A-Life, it's been the beating heart (or possibly the brain) of the Stalker series since its debut in 2007, creating a more dynamic, and more emergent, post-apocalyptic landscape by simulating NPCs - stalkers, bandits, mutants, and more - that move around the world, hunt, fight, and interact even when offscreen. Stalker 2's version of A-Life was supposed to take things even further, but like much of the game at launch, was pretty broken.
</p>
<p>
GSC <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam">previously explained</a> much of Stalker 2's A-Life weirdness was down to optimisation hurdles, with the studio ultimately having to significantly reduce the size of the area around players that A-Life worked in order improve performance. Some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-receives-first-major-patch-including-a-life-fixes">initial fixes arrived shortly after release</a>, but it's only now, some seven months later, the system is finally working as intended.

<p>
As per the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399?l=english">latest patch notes</a>, today's huge 1.5 update - AKA the Guns &amp; Looting update - now simulates life for all characters, and not just those in the player's view. NPCs will "continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end", and can be encountered resting or interacting in different locations. Additionally, players can meet the same stalkers after some time.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more besides A-Life, though; patch 1.5 introduces new features (players can now experience the Water Electric Tornado anomaly out in the Zone, for instance, and acquire the Kora handgun and Three-Line Rifle), as well as AI and combat improvements, balance adjustments and bug fixes, plus various quality of life additions. That's alongside the release of official modding tools for Stalker 2, which are <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-zone-kit">currently available via the Epic Games Store</a>. Interested parties might want to brace themselves, however; you'll need somewhere in the region of 700GB harddrive space to install them.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer, if you're wondering, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">gave Stalker 2 three stars</a>, calling it a "mess of bugs and jank that nonetheless stays faithful to the open world survival shooter of yesteryear."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>You might find it kind of sad to put a hard-earned gadget into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches. So, I wasted no time testing cases on the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and it didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best.</p><p>I tried several types of cases on the Switch 2. I tested flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I also tried slim cases that have one job: to protect the console when it isn’t in use.</p><div><h2>What I look for in a Switch 2 case</h2><section><p>We use each Switch 2 case as it was designed to be used. We follow the instructions included to get the best fit and protection, noting along the way when a feature works better than expected, or worse. We don’t perform drop tests (I’m using my personal, and thus treasured, Switch 2 unit), but we try our best to find weak points in each case.</p></section><section><p>Installing a case should be easy, not cumbersome. Given the Switch 2’s hybrid design, a multi-step process for attaching a case is expected, but it should be easy to achieve a successful installation every time with little effort.</p></section><section><p>Since a lot of tech cases are made before said technology is even publicly available, I’m watching like a hawk to make sure the cases that I try actually fit the Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference isn’t good enough for me or you.</p></section><section><p>Some cases come with compromises, such as not allowing the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers to be detached. Others block the kickstand, and/or prevent the console from fitting into its original dock for playing on a TV. Compromises are fine as long as you know what they are beforehand. I think most people want to access the Switch 2’s unique features, so I’ve focused mostly on picks that retain them, although I may include some picks that limit them.</p></section></div><p>I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for slim zip-up/clasp cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables or cartridge storage.</p><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><a href="#the-best-switch-2-case-for-both-handheld-and-docked-play">The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play</a></li><li><a href="#the-best-slim-protective-switch-2-cases">The best slim, protective Switch 2 cases</a></li><li><a href="#the-best-form-fitting-shells-for-the-switch-2-in-handheld-mode">The best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode</a></li><li><a href="#what-s-coming-next">What’s coming next?</a></li></ul></nav></div><p>As for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the <strong>Dbrand Killswitch</strong> is the best model overall. I published a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review">full review of the Killswitch</a>, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.</p><div><p id="the-best-switch-2-case-for-both-handheld-and-docked-play"><h2>The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->60</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Very secure fit</li><li>Makes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)</li><li>Clever dock adapter</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Chunky dock adapter</li><li>Not the most affordable case</li><li>Front protection only comes in the $80 tier</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The least expensive Killswitch tier <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">costs $59.95</a> and includes a rear cover for the console and a small piece to adhere to its kickstand for a matching style, plus Joy-Con 2 grips, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes a skin for your hardware. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Switch 2 console case makes it impossible to fit into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into it, essentially acting as a USB-C extender. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><cite>Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent travel cover that protects the front of your console during transit, or just for safekeeping when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.</p><p>I couldn’t post this without addressing the controversy surrounding the Killswitch’s design, specifically that it allows the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without pressing their release buttons. If you hold your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion is likely to detach. This could obviously cause serious damage to the console. Dbrand insisted in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">lengthy Reddit post</a> that most players don’t (and shouldn’t) hold their consoles this way. I <em>can</em> easily replicate the issue, though I didn’t notice it during my testing, mainly because I’m a worrywart who’s perhaps unnecessarily gentle with tech. However, I could see this being a more pressing issue if you have, say, a younger kid who roughhouses with technology. Either way, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">Dbrand later confirmed on Reddit</a> that all buyers are getting improved Joy-Con 2 covers that should fix the issue.</p><div><p id="runner-up"><h3>Runner-up</h3></p></div><p><strong>Genki’s Attack Vector</strong> case is similar in some ways to the Killswitch, as it consists of three pieces: one that goes around the console, and two pieces that wrap around each of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector">$49.99 kit</a> improves on the Killswitch with swappable modular grips that come in three sizes to let you customize how the Joy-Con 2 fits in your hand. It follows a small, medium, and large model, with the smallest adding some minor ergonomic benefits, and the largest being what large-handed folks will likely gravitate toward to make the Switch 2 comfier to hold. Its large, palm-filling grip feels as good to use as the Killswitch, but it’s a very close race and I’d be smitten to use either.</p><p>However, one notable downside with the Attack Vector is that the Joy-Con 2 sleeves can be pulled off with relative ease, unlike Dbrand’s. Their fit is accurate, technically, and they won’t fall off during normal use. But they’re not as secure as I want them to be.</p><p>Also, Genki advertises that you can keep the Attack Vector on when you insert your console into the Switch 2 dock, but its launch unit doesn’t work as intended. Genki addressed complaints on forums that the case doesn’t fit the console perfectly, and is working on a fix that it expects to finish in July. It will ship a replacement middle piece to all who have already purchased the case, and those who buy the case going forward will receive the fixed product.</p><div><p id="the-best-slim-protective-switch-2-cases"><h2>The best slim, protective Switch 2 cases</h2></p></div><p><strong>Power A’s slim zip-up case </strong>for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried. </p><p>At just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F69R7LLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$19.99</a> (half the cost of <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-2-carrying-case-screen-protector-multi%2F6625926.p%3FskuId%3D6625926" rel="sponsored">Nintendo’s official carrying case</a>), protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).</p><p>This case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the ones listed below.</p><p>For $10 more ($29.99), <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680463/belkin-nintendo-switch-2-charging-case-battery">Belkin’s slim case</a></strong> is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell prevents accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.</p><p>Belkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.</p><div><p id="runners-up"><h3>Runners-up</h3></p></div><p>JSAUX makes a relatively slim zip-up Switch 2 case that absolutely pops with color. Expressiveness is its main appeal, as this <strong><a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-Protective-2/dp/B0F2F38LZK?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$25.99 case</a></strong> slouches on other features you might want. Once it’s opened, all there is to see is a velcro strap that secures your Switch 2. Underneath it is a fabric tray stitched into the case that can hold 12 game cartridges. Like the Belkin and PowerA cases, this one prevents accidental pressing on the Joy-Con 2 sticks through its shell. It’s a little too light on features to recommend broadly, and it’s thicker than the other models.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Genki’s $42.99 Sleeper Case</a></strong> is a <em>very </em>tough soft case. Its wool-wrapped shell doesn’t have nearly as much give as other slim cases. Plus, its screen guard can carry up to 18 cartridges. However, I dislike how much the Switch 2 moves around when you shake the case (the fit is snug if you have the company’s Attack Vector case equipped). Notably, Genki’s Neil Trachy, who handles marketing and media relations, shared with <em>The Verge</em> that a production error may impact how well its zipper works in the long run, and that a free fix is coming in July for all who’ve already purchased one. The fix will be implemented for all future purchasers of the case. </p><p>“Our Sleeper Case was upgraded to a waterproof zipper last minute and unbeknownst to our production team, the adhesives used were not binding well to the zipper. [...] While the case is still rock solid, the weak point will be the glue that holds it all in place.”</p><div><p id="the-best-form-fitting-shells-for-the-switch-2-in-handheld-mode"><h2>The best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode</h2></p></div><p>The <strong>Killswitch</strong> is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.</p><p>If you don’t <em>ever </em>plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Protective-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0DMV31N3F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><strong>$29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor</strong></a> is a suitable option. It fits around every nook and port of the Switch 2, with openings for its speakers and air intake. It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its original dock.</p><div><p id="what-s-coming-next"><h2>What’s coming next?</h2></p></div><p>This case features many of the qualities that I like about the Dbrand Killswitch for a lot less ($29.99 versus $59.99), even one-upping it by being able to fit into the Switch 2’s original dock without the need for an adapter. I look forward to testing it when it launches.</p><p>I intend to keep this post updated as frequently as I’m able to test new cases.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/reviews/691319/best-switch-2-cases]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">All your weapons here are plasma rifles, if you think about it.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Crisol: Theater of Idols aims to blend Bioshock with Resident Evil-style gameplay in a horror FPS influenced by classical Spanish folklore. I crawled through abandoned streets, popping zombie-like enemies with guns that used my blood for bullets, ducking in and out of derelict storefronts looking for the ever-reliable genre staple bolt cutters, and dodging powerful enemies along the way. While Crisol showed more to set itself apart from stalwarts in the genre during my hands-on demo, its weapon designs and distinct aesthetic in particular left me interested to see more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring a horrific, reimagined version of Spain called Hispania, Crisol’s world and character designs blew me away – especially the guns. Here, your blood is your health <em><strong>and</strong></em> your ammo, so reloading each gun triggers a spine-tingling reaction like when your handgun’s handle bristles with little needles, drawing blood from your hand, or when needles stick out of the base of your double-barrelled shotgun’s barrel, waiting to trade health for survival.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This push-and-pull forces you to keep tabs on both to keep yourself from wasting either and landing yourself in a sticky situation. You can pick up healing syringes to help restore ammo, but Crisol also encourages you to drain the blood from dead bystanders, killed by your mysterious foes, to heal and reload.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Crisol also encourages you to drain the blood from dead bystanders, killed by your mysterious foes, to heal and reload.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The gun designs themselves are cool too; gilded with red accents, they add a gothic pop of color that stands out, but doesn’t clash with the environments I saw in my short demo. The environments, on the other hand, didn’t have nearly as much character to them. While the trailer promises some pretty cool-looking set pieces, the dark streets of Hispania I wandered didn’t offer much deviation from the norm. That’s surprising considering just how well-designed the enemies and guns are.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crisol: Theater of Idols Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Crisol doesn’t waste any time throwing you into the action. Within seconds of picking up the controller, lurching, puppet-like enemies stumbled towards me. Low light revealed unsettling details in their mask-like faces as they approached, eventually collapsing under my gunfire. Each enemy I encountered (or at least each one I was able to kill) reacted based on which part of their body I shot; crawling headless after I kneecapped them, and popped their heads. Both of the blood-soaked firearms I tried have an older feel to them, more like the oomph of the original BioShock than the punchy crack of the guns found in most contemporary shooters, though Crisol’s trailer (and weapon wheel) promise a seemingly diverse arsenal of sanguine shooters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After making my way through a few city blocks, absorbing blood from dead bodies and popping zombie-like critters blocking my path, I came across a locked gate with a winch. Locked by a padlock with a chain – classic! Like clockwork, I set out looking for the bolt cutters I’d found in half a dozen survival horror games before. But before I could start looking, some kind of gigantic, arcane cyborg – a towering mass of blood-soaked bones and clanking machinery with a mask of a woman’s face crying blood – picked me up and tossed me around.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/03-1750729005759.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The beast chased me down the street to the window (conveniently) of the hardware store, but couldn’t touch me once I dove in. Safe for now, I grabbed the bolt cutters from the back storeroom and every coin in the cash register and set out to snip the chains that kept me from safety. But the beast was back at my heels practically the moment my feet hit the dirt road, hurling threats my way as it hunted me down.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I hope Crisol doubles down on these two different kinds of survival horror to produce layers of tension between the blood-for-bullets combat and high-stakes stealth in the full release.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Crouching to minimize the noise I made, I found a shortcut through a fish store, making a bunch of noise at one end before cutting through the store, snipping the chains, and cranking away at the winch to open the gate in front of me. I heard the creature thudding towards me, and just pushed away in the quick-time event faster, hoping I could squeeze through instead of running back to cover. The gate opened with just enough time to spare; I rushed out of the courtyard to safety, the gate snapping shut before my assailant could catch me.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/07-1750729018828.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This puzzle-like stealth section, though very simple, added a lot to my demo. I can see the ways this could evolve into a tense blend of stealth and shooting if I eventually need to dodge bigger enemies at the same time as popping the smaller, stoppable ones with my sanguine arsenal. I hope Crisol doubles down on these two different kinds of survival horror to produce layers of tension between the blood-for-bullets combat and high-stakes stealth in the full release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I enjoyed my demo well enough, I felt like I hadn’t seen anything new beyond the Bloodborne-like, health-for-ammo trade-off and some really cool weapon and enemy designs. I’m sure puzzles and progression will begin to differentiate themselves from Resident Evil as the game gets more complex. But I didn’t get to see much of that in this demo, which was clearly very early in the campaign. Still, I have a feeling Crisol: Theater of Idols will be worth checking out for its distinct take on survival horror with a Spanish flair.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/crisol-theater-of-idols-is-a-horror-fps-influenced-by-spanish-folklore]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From February to May, personal injury law firm Anapol Weiss <a href="https://www.anapolweiss.com/roblox-lawsuit-attorneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed four separate lawsuits</a> on behalf of children who were allegedly exploited by adults on the platform. The law firm said it’s “investigating hundreds of similar cases” and plans to file additional lawsuits in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p>The most recent lawsuit was filed in May in the Superior Court of California on behalf of a 16-year-old girl who, according to the filing, met a “serial predator who was on an FBI watch list for previously targeting children on <em>Roblox</em>” in the game. Throughout the 82-page complaint, the law firm details claims of exploitation and abuse in <em>Roblox, including </em>Bloomberg’s extensive reporting into <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Roblo</em>x’s “pedophile problem”</a> andHindenburg Research’s 2024 report that accused the platform of inflating metrics and called it a “<a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pedophile hellscape</a>.” <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2024/Roblox-Refutes-Misleading-Claims-in-Hindenburg-Report-2024-IsPnj4offj/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox called</a> Hindenburg Research’s report “misleading” and disputed several claims made in the Bloomberg report, with a spokesperson telling the outlet, "The long-term growth and longevity of Roblox depends on our ability to provide a safe and civil experience for our users." <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/roblox-rolls-out-more-child-safety-tools-on-its-game-platform?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox continues to roll out safety tools</a> as pressure mounts from outside groups.</p><p>In the complaint filed in May, Anapol Weiss alleges that the alleged predator, who is not named, “engaged in innocent conversation but gradually escalated to sexual topics and explicit exchanges.” He convinced the girl to move their conversations off <em>Roblox</em>, and eventually to meet in person, where the complaint says he sexually assaulted the girl and forced her from Indiana to Georgia. The girl escaped to a police department, according to the complaint.</p><p>“Plaintiff has suffered unimaginable harm,” Anapol Weiss wrote. “Her innocence has been snatched from her forever. Tragically, what happened to her is far from an isolated event. Indeed, Plaintiff is just one of countless children whose lives have been devastated as a result of Roblox’s gross negligence and defectively designed app.”</p><p>The firm’s three other lawsuits — two filed in April 2025, in California and Texas, and another filed in February in New Jersey — make similar claims. The three previous lawsuits also name Discord as a defendant for its alleged role in allowing child abuse to proliferate on its platform.</p><p>Roblox maintains that it’s committed to the safety of children on its platform. <em>Roblox</em> itself is more popular than ever, reaching n<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ew concurrent player records</a> consistently over the past several weeks. The platform is an essential app for many children, a place where they’re able to be social and creative. But court dockets over the past year paint an alarming picture of the app’s underbelly, revealing a deep, and, seemingly, systemic issue. Since January, United States police have arrested at least a half dozen people who allegedly used <em>Roblox</em> to find and exploit children, including <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ord.185914/gov.uscourts.ord.185914.9.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coercing minors into making pornography</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/air-force-member-charged-sexual-exploitation-nine-year-old-child-long-island" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying children for</a> sexually explicit photos, according to court documents reviewed by Aftermath.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-fights-protect-children-online-subpoenas-roblox-child" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier subpoenaed Roblox</a> for information about how the game is used by kids age 16 or younger, as well as for documents showing how Roblox protects children from “mature content.” The attorney general's office, via the subpoena, is also looking for communications to and from Florida users reporting abuse and communication with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, among other things. “We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing—if any—to avoid interactions with predators,” Uthmeier wrote in a news release.&nbsp;</p><p>In a similar move, <a href="https://www.njoag.gov/ag-platkin-sues-messaging-app-discord-for-unlawful-practices-that-expose-nj-kids-to-child-predators-and-violent-sexual-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin announced in April</a> that he’s suing Discord over “for deceptive and unconscionable business practices that misled parents about the efficacy of its safety controls and obscured the risks children faced when using the application.”</p><p>Alongside the new safety initiatives, in May Roblox hired former Lego Group executive Dr. Elizabeth Milovidov <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/05/roblox-head-of-parental-advocacy-dr-elizabeth-milovidov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as the company’s parental advocacy lead</a>, a role designed to help Roblox “empower families to help children use technology safely and responsibly.” The latest safety updates allow parents to block people and specific games on a child’s <em>Roblox</em> friends lists; previously, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/roblox-parental-controls-friend-blocking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Mashable</a>, parents had to block an entire game rating or maturity level, not on a game by game basis.
