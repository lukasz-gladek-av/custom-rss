			<p>It used to be something of a marvel to see fully fledged PC and console games being ported across to Nintendo’s consoles, whether we look as far back as the Wii, or consider the number of “impossible” ports to the original Nintendo Switch. With the dawn of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though, these kinds of ports are almost expected. Given that the earlier Two Point titles made the jump to the original Switch, how does <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> fare on the newer console?</p>

<p>Two Point Museum is another charming take on the management sim, filled with irreverent humour and bucket loads of puns to bring a wry smile to your face. At its core you’re still doing similar tasks to Two Point Hospital, creating rooms and a flow for patrons to follow, managing your staff, and just trying to make as much money as possible, but there’s a very different theme to Two Point Museum and a much more obviously creative endeavour behind constructing your museum.</p>


<p>But before you can place attractions in your museum and build and theme exhibits around them, you first need to acquire them, sending your experts out to various locations to dig up new and unusual fossils, to catch different rare fish, to… hunt ghosts and haunted mannequins? These aren’t your standard history museums, that’s for sure!</p>


<p>With this Switch 2 version arriving almost eight months after the original release, there’s already been a bunch of updates and DLC that are thankfully represented in this port. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/08/two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-review/">Fantasy Finds DLC</a> is available separately, but there’s also the Digiverse collaborations with smaller and indie games like Dredge and Vampire Survivors which are already in this game. We still want to see DLC that adds more levels and locations to build in, and we’ll always dream about added features like multiple floors, but this is in lockstep with the game on other platforms.</p>
<p>But the most important factor is how the game plays, and for me, this Switch 2 release is a very enjoyable rendition of this game… with some caveats. The game fundamentally looks great, the chunky art style helping to minimise the impact of lower texture detail and reduced floor reflections and other effects, and it’s being rendered at a high enough resolution that it looks nice and smooth on the Switch 2’s screen when playing handheld, and even on larger screens. That’s pretty great, but the caveat is that the frame rate can and does suffer as your museum grows.</p>

<p>Even by the time you’ve reached the end of the first museum’s first mission, you start to feel the CPU limitations of the Switch 2. There’s some noticeable little stutters and hitches as you load into object picking menus and snap to a room to modify, but more fundamentally, it’s just the game needing to simulate a couple hundred guests and staff as they amble around your museums, and while viewing from a stationary camera is fine, you start to feel the stutter when panning around. It’s dependent on the simulation speed, so pausing the action makes camera movement nice and smooth again, with frame rate struggles getting a little worse as you speed things up.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting here that the Switch 2 version deliberately keeps the guest count in check. It defaults to a 200 guest limit (which can easily be stuffed into a basic museum space) with an option to bump that up to 300, but the PC game defaults to 400 guests with a range from 200 to having no limit at all.</p>

<p>And to me, I think that’s totally fine. This isn’t a genre where you need twitch reactions, and regardless of the frame rate, I’m someone that makes many building and room modifications while the simulation is paused. Maybe at the start as I’m slapping down a quick room blueprint in a basically empty space, but as soon as I’m having to overhaul an active area, and when guest satisfaction is an evolving metric, it’s best to do this when paused.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game does feel a little bit glitchier on Switch 2 than I remember from playing on PC. We’ve had a couple of game crashes on this console and a soft lock that needed us to restart, and that can be a tad inconvenient depending on when the last autosave was. There were also some weird problems, like one of the Bandage Box healing chairs just repeatedly catching fire five or six times in just a matter of minutes, we’ve got a ghost stuck outside of their room that nobody cares about, some visual effects like fire and smoke are just rendering as grey squares, and there’s some missing tooltips that make getting around the menus a bit confusing at times. Most of the issues we found are highlighted for a post release patch, but it’s a shame they’re here on day one.</p>

<p>I do also think that playing with a gamepad feels a bit clunky at times. They’re generally OK to understand and there’s plenty of tooltips, but the way that buttons are context sensitive as you get into a room’s menu always has me pausing to think about what button I need to press.</p>
<p>That’s not a problem on PC, of course, when you’re clicking around the UI with a mouse. Hey, wait a minute, the Switch 2 has that mouse mode, doesn’t it? Sadly, Two Point Museum doesn’t have Joy-Con mouse mode support at launch, and while the team have said they’re looking into it, they’re rather non-committal about the possibility.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>Universities and hospitals: they’re well-known money spinners (assuming you ignore socialised healthcare) and make perfect sense for a management sim. What doesn’t strike me as such a lucrative institution is a museum. I went to a lot of them as a child specifically because it was a cheap day out, and as I rocket closer towards middle age, I finally appreciate my parents’ mentality.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s not the theme I expected from the third Two Point game before it was announced, and my initial reaction was one more of confusion and minor pessimism than anything else, partly for the reasons previously mentioned. More fool me, though, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> may well be the most balanced and well-rounded of the lot.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159799/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’re the curator of a museum, or rather several museums, and it’s your job to pull in the punters, make the staff do their job, and secure new exhibits to make it all worth everyone’s while. You’ll not be making it an affordable day out, either; your museums are a <em>business</em> first and foremost, and that means staff can take one short break every month or so, and keyrings from the gift shop will cost patrons 50 quid a pop.</p>
<p>So far, so similar to previous entries, but one of the big changes this time around is exhibits and, more specifically, how to get them. You’ll have to send your staff through a helicopter-shaped rabbit hole where they set off to explore wherever it is you’ve told them to go, in the hope that they’ll not return dead (or worse, with a poor-quality exhibit).</p>
<p>Despite never really seeing where your staff members go on these expeditions, Two Point Museum still manages to instil a sense of exploration, all whilst safely hovering aloft your roofless enterprise.</p>
<p>This goes doubly so when staff encounter a random dilemma during such a trip, where a situation demands your expert decision-making. They might find what appears to be an oasis in the desert, and you have to decide if they should pursue it or stay on course.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159792/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As this is a Two Point game, your natural reaction and sensible thinking have to go out the window in these instances. That oasis? Actually a spa with a full staff wondering why they get so few customers. I’ll be honest, even though the game makes a foreboding sound whenever a dilemma occurs, I was absolutely thrilled each and every time, because it’s genuinely impossible to know what the outcome might be the first time around. Two Point Museum operates on a twisted, almost uncanny logic that continually delights and surprises.</p>
<p>The type of museum you run makes a substantial difference as well. The game will bounce you around the different museums available to you in order to progress, and each (initially) plays very differently from one another.</p>
<p>Depending on what you’re trying to discover, you’ll have to send your staff out to dig up dinosaur bones, catch fish to put in the aquariums you probably should have already built, dive deep into the bowels of an old technology centre, or, you know, dip into the netherworld to extract ghosts for children to gawk at. You can even take your helicopter into space. Amazing.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159791/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some exhibits you can simply plonk down, others require you to find their constituent parts, some need to be put in their own special rooms (think fish and ghosts), and some need to be kept in a specific level of humidity, temperature, or both.</p>
<p>Did I mention plants? I don’t think I did. These aren’t your garden variety botanicals, though; the plants people want to see are man-eaters, although in fairness the guests they eat don’t seem to die, only come out…changed. Some guests even demand this as their idea of a perfect museum visit. Why not dive headfirst into a gaping, vegetative maw so you can seemingly have your genetics altered to look like a clown? That’s a Batman story we haven’t yet seen.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep guests happy, as not only will they pay a frankly staggering amount to gain entry, but also will freely dump sometimes hundreds into your appropriately-positioned donation stands. How much they donate is based on an exhibit’s ‘buzz’, how much detail your information stands divulge (which can be increased by destroying and analysing an exhibit in a special room), how entertained they are, and several other factors besides.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159797/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And you’ll need to satisfy those, as donations make up a substantial part of your income. Entry tickets are a one-time thing, but donations can just keep coming and coming, and it’s never dissatisfying to see your stands bursting with golden coins to collect.</p>
<p>If all this seems a bit hard to get a grip on, then that’s reassuring, because the game is absolutely <em>rammed</em> with mechanics and twists on the basics. It eases you in, though, which is absolutely necessary, even if it can feel a touch basic at first. New mechanics and themes are drip-fed to you as you progress, meaning you don't get a chance to get bored doing the same thing time and time again.</p>
<p>It’s a meaty game too, easily demanding upwards of 50 hours for the base game, and the Fantasy Finds DLC will no doubt take that further still. Although it will be available on Switch 2, it sadly wasn’t live during our time pre-release. Further expanding what’s on offer is the Digiverse map of expeditions, which was released recently on other platforms as well. This map expands the exhibits you can acquire to include those from other games (currently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>), with the promise of more to come.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159793/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tantalising stuff! And that’s not just my opinion, either. Bands of thieves and vandals, some of whom are from competing museums, are desperate to come in and either damage your hard-won treasures or take them for themselves. This is one of the trickier mechanics to master at first, as suddenly your security guards have more to do than empty the giant buckets of cash your guests have filled up.</p>
<p>Two Point Museum is a game that just keeps on giving. Every time you think you’ve got all the mechanics under your belt, the game tosses you another, like portals opening up and letting malevolent spirits in to harass your guests, or whoops! Now you have to tackle marketing campaigns!</p>
<p>The customisation is similarly excellent. You can freely build and modify not only each room in a museum, but each and every building as well (with one or two exceptions, of course). The floors, walls, partitions, dividers, and even the colour of individual decorations, it’s all up to you how it looks. Does it make a difference to how the game plays? Not even slightly, but I still caught myself spending cumulative hours fiddling around with floor tiles and decorative items’ positioning.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159795/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And to top it all off, Two Point Museum continues the trend of an excellent soundtrack interspersed with properly chuckle-worthy chatter from its resident DJs, wonderfully clear and vibrant visuals, and really fantastically executed controls for the genre.</p>
<p>One thing is notably missing on Switch 2, though, and that’s mouse mode. It seems like an obvious inclusion, but sadly it’s not included here at launch. We did speak to the developers recently, who confirmed that they are considering it, but right now it’s controller or nothing.</p>
<p>Visually, it’s a big step up over Switch 1’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/two_point_campus">Campus</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/two_point_hospital">Hospital</a>, although the game is capped at 30fps. It’s a very smooth 30fps in the early stages of each museum, but unfortunately it does struggle a bit as things get more hectic, and it seems to be the same in both docked and handheld for the most part. It’s not a dealbreaker per se, but given the leap to much more powerful hardware, I was hoping that it might be a little more consistent than it is, given that the game runs far better on other systems like the Steam Deck and Xbox Series S.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159794/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It just feels like there’s performance that’s been left on the table in its current state. I also experienced a few graphical anomalies, such as dust clouds being made entirely out of 2D squares, and one particular sandy floor texture going absolutely bananas and flashing terribly unless the camera was stock still.</p>
<p>I have faith that these little issues can be ironed out in updates — and a little more optimisation to get some more stability wouldn’t go amiss either — even if they don’t do anything to spoil the game.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Two Point Museum might be the best Two Point game to date. It’s smart, funny, good-looking, and packs in more mechanics than you can shake a stick at, all without feeling overwhelming or too much to handle.</p>
<p>It’s got some performance-based blemishes on Switch 2, and the lack of a mouse mode at launch feels like an obvious omission. Still, the final package is an incredibly entertaining one that fans of management sims would be mad to skip.</p></section>

			<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved, the remake of the first entry in the Halo series announced last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/">after months of rumors and speculation</a>, is set to introduce significant visual improvements over both the original and the Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster, judging from some early comparison videos shared online.</p>



<p>Following the game's announcement at this year's Halo WCC, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> shared two comparison videos on YouTube, comparing the current available footage of the remake with a recreation of similar sequences in the original and the Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster. Needless to say, the differences are massive between the modern remake and the other two versions of the game, offering an unprecedented level of fidelity that will make the iconic first entry in the series shine.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it's clear how, in terms of ambiance and atmosphere, Halo: Campaign Evolved won't try to mimic the original and will instead offer a different take. In this case, which will be better will be up to player's preference.</p>

<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">feature more than the updated visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5 </a>showcased in the comparison videos above. The remake of the first entry in the Halo series will also come with three new bonus missions set before the events of the campaign, four-player co-op, some gameplay tweaks, including the introduction of sprinting, and more. As the name implies, however, the multiplayer mode of the original Halo won't be remade.</p>



<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will also mark the series' debut on PlayStation consoles, further compounding Xbox's current multiplatform strategy, which saw the launch of former exclusives on other platforms. The remake will also launch on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p>

<p>It's another entry in the list of add-ons in the works for Euro Truck Sim 2, which also includes a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-is-pining-for-the-fjords-with-a-nordic-expansion">Nordic map expansion</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-years-after-teasing-buses-were-coming-to-euro-truck-simulator-2-they-finally-arrive">coaches</a>, and a number of reworks to existing areas. The latter includes a <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/10/project-uk-rework.html">UK revamp</a> announced just the other week, which should ensure that driving from Birmingham to Belfast shouldn't resemble a voyage from 2013 to 5.</p>

<p>"Drivers will be able to tackle narrow routes lined with stone walls and hedgerows, travel on untamed coastal stretches battered by the Atlantic winds, and roll through small villages and towns steeped in charm and tradition," SCS wrote in their Ireland expansion <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/10/introducing-isle-of-ireland.html">annoucement post</a>. "From the energetic streets of Dublin and Belfast to the peaceful rhythm of the countryside, making a delivery without pausing to admire the view will be a challenge in itself!"</p><p>In terms of landmarks to admire in between cargo hauls, expect the likes of the Rock of Cashel, Ben Bulben, Belfast’s Samson and Goliath cranes, and the Giant’s Causeway. "Haul through farmland, cross windswept landscapes where folklore feels close at hand, and navigate into vibrant city centres where modern life and centuries of history stand side by side," the devs say. "Ferry ports such as Rosslare will also play an important role, opening the way to connections across the Irish Sea and beyond."</p>
<p>As is usually the case with Truck Sim expansions, there's no release date for Isle of Ireland yet. "Everything shown so far is still very much a work in progress" according to SCS. Given the Nordic Horizons expansion sounded like it was being loosely aimed at 2026 in its 2024 reveal, maybe we'll be headed to Ireland in 2027.</p>
<p>Until then, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3851260/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2__Isle_of_Ireland/">wishlist it on Steam</a> and stare wistfully at the screenshots. Maybe scroll from Malin Head to Mizen Head on Google Maps to help limit any ire the wait engenders in you.</p>

              <p><span>The news that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>is coming to PlayStation 5</span></a><span> next year sounds like fan fiction to anyone who grew up in the heated console wars of yesteryear. Oh, there are definitely people still fighting this made-up war and extended marketing campaign, but as console exclusivity increasingly becomes a thing of the past and systems do mostly the same things as one another, anyone with a lick of sense knows that there’s nothing to even fight about anymore. </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, Xbox’s longest-running franchise, was one of the last big names to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><span>make the jump to PlayStation</span></a><span>, and now that it has, people are finally catching up to the rest of us in realizing that the war is over. That includes Funko Pop store GameStop, and…</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-autism-tylenol-press-conference-reaction-jokes-2000627950"><span>the Trump Administration</span></a><span>?</span></p> <p><span>GameStop started with a mock-up of a statement declaring the console wars over. Sure, that’s the kind of thing a company makes for social media when trying to capitalize on something in the news. The store notes that now that the </span><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved </span></i><span>remake is coming to PlayStation 5, there’s nothing to fight about anymore, so you can take your Sony Ponies back to the stable and power down your Xbots.&nbsp;</span></p>

The official White House account quote-tweeted the post with an AI image of Trump saluting while dressed in </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>protagonist Master Chief’s Spartan armor and holding an Energy Sword, all in front of the White House, which notably doesn’t show where the</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/26/politics/white-house-east-wing-history"><span> newly demolished East Wing would be</span></a><span>. Have AI-generation models been fed information about the president’s ongoing personal project of putting a ballroom where something else once was? Will they generate images of the White House as it stands now by default? Or did whoever put this prompt in say specifically to block the view? The bigger question is what happened to the other 10 states no longer represented on the American flag, which only has 40 stars on it?</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 2025 HP Laptop Is Practically Free After Amazon’s Huge 73% Limited-Time Discount, $200 Worth of Accessories Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-2025-hp-laptop-is-practically-free-after-amazons-huge-73-limited-time-discount-200-worth-of-accessories-included-2000639087</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2025-hp-laptop-is-practically-free-after-amazon%E2%80%99s-huge-73-limited-time-discount-200-worth-of-accessories-included.1335667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When a fully loaded brand-new HP laptop falls into Chromebook pricing territory, chances are it’s a deal you’re going to want to jump on. But you don’t have long to grab this one at Amazon, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5018/">this Intel-powered laptop that normally sells for $1,300 is only going to be marked down to just $351 for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p>Take a look at how many full-PC laptop features you get for a Chromebook price: An Intel N150 processor and graphics, 14-inch HD display, 720p Wide Vision HD webcam with dual-array integrated digital microphones, 128GB of SSD storage and a 256GB Micro SD card for more, and a Wi-Fi 6 connection for fast internet. Maybe not&nbsp;<em>quite</em> a $1,300 laptop if we’re being fair, but absolutely a great deal for $351.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5018/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All the Ports You Need</h2>
<p>On top of the 256GB Micro SD card that comes free as part of the accessories bundle, this HP laptop has all of the expansion options you need. That multi-format SD card reader may come with a 256GB card, but you can use it for any sized card you want for reliable file storage. There’s a USB-C port, two USB-A ports, and an HDMI port for external monitors or other connections. The Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth connections give you all the wireless options you need.</p>
<p>Also included in the $199 accessories bundle is Windows 11 Professional (preinstalled), a 128GB USB thumb drive, wireless mouse, cleaning kit, and a 7-port USB hub with both USB-A and USB-C cords for even further expansion possibilities. With the 15th Gen Intel N150 processor able to cook up to 3.6GHz in maximum speed, you don’t have to be shy about using as many of those ports as you want at the same time.</p>



<h2>Made to Go</h2>
<p>A lower price tag usually suggests a larger, heavier laptop, but that’s not the case with this 14-inch HP model. This one’s only 0.71 inches thick with the lid closed, and a very economical 12.76 inches by 8.86 inches in size. The overall weight clocks in at just 3.24 pounds, so it’s tailor made to easily slide in and out of your backpack. The 7.5-hour battery life just adds to the remote work appeal.</p>
<p>There are other laptops out there in the $350 price neighborhood, and definitely more than a few Chromebooks, but this 14-inch HP laptop and all of its built-in features stand out as being a lot of laptop for the price. Add in the free additions of Windows 11 Pro with Copilot and the rest of the $199 accessories bundle, and you’ve got a deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5018/">But it’s only here for a limited time, so head to Amazon now before this $351 HP laptop offer vanishes.</a></p>

                <p>Almost a week after high-profile Twitch streamer Emiru was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/streamer-emiru-disputes-twitchs-account-of-assault-response-at-twitchcon/1100-6535557/" data-ref-id="1100-6535557">assaulted during a TwitchCon meet-and-greet</a>, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has posted a statement apologizing to the streamer and acknowledging the multiple failures that allowed the incident to happen.</p><p>While Twitch posted a statement about the assault shortly after it happened, the company's version of events was strongly disputed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/streamer-emiru-disputes-twitchs-account-of-assault-response-at-twitchcon/1100-6535557/" data-ref-id="1100-6535557">Emiru's own statement about the incident</a>. Clancy has also been called out for his comments on the assault during an <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a> with Taylor Lorenz, where he seemed to put the onus back on creators to "control [their] community."</p><p>Clancy has now posted a personal statement on the <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1981825064904667169" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch X account</a>, apologizing directly to Emiru and taking responsibility for the incident. "It shouldn’t have happened and we take that very seriously," Clancy said in the statement. "We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologize to Emiru for all that took place."</p><p>The statement continues to outline the next steps Twitch will be taking, including a "complete analysis" of the incident involving Emiru, as well as other issues that have been brought up in the wake of TwitchCon 2025. The other issues mentioned in the post include handling of IRL streaming at TwitchCon, as well as issues around accessibility at the event.</p><p>"You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously," the statement concludes. Reactions to the post have been mixed, with some commenters pointing out that Twitch has made similar promises around improving security at TwitchCon in the past. The post was also sent out late on a Friday afternoon, a notoriously <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/friday-news-dump/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strategic timeslot</a> for companies sharing bad news they want to move on from quickly.</p><p>Emiru has said that she will not be attending TwitchCon again in the future and has strongly urged other creators to reconsider their attendance.</p>

                <p>During the Halo World Championships, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-announced-for-2026-features-new-prequel-missions-and-sprint-but-no-multiplayer/1100-6535695/" data-ref-id="1100-6535695">confirmed the long-rumored remake</a> of the first Halo, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. It also happens to be the very <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">first Halo game to arrive on PlayStation 5</a>, or any PlayStation platform. Now, Microsoft and Halo Studios have confirmed that all Halo games going forward will be on PlayStation as well as Xbox consoles and PC.</p><p>Following the official announcement of Campaign Evolved, Halo Studios community director Brian Jarrard <a href="https://youtu.be/OrvqXfY_7tU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">appeared on stage</a> at the Halo World Championships and wore a PlayStation T-shirt while sharing the news about the franchise's multi-platform future.</p><p>"It's a huge deal," said Jarrard. "It's a long time coming. We're just super excited to be able to welcome even more players now into the franchise we love, to fall in love with Halo the same way we all did 24 years ago. As a community guy, I know the Halo community is super excited to welcome in their friends as well. It's just going to mean more Halo for everyone. It's really a new era. Halo is on PlayStation going forward, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved."</p><p>This shift isn't surprising given Xbox president Sarah Bond recently suggested that the concept of exclusive games "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-games-are-antiquated-xbox-president-says/1100-6535625/" data-ref-id="1100-6535625">is antiquated for most people</a>." The number of Xbox games making the leap to PlayStation has greatly increased over the last two years, including another signature Xbox franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-launch-times-revealed-for-franchises-debut-on-ps5/1100-6534232/" data-ref-id="1100-6534232">Gears of War</a>.

The 25th anniversary of the franchise is next year, and Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch in 2026 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

			<p>Stray, the cat adventure game developed by BlueTwelve and published by Annapurna Interactive, will reportedly headline the PlayStation Plus Essential games lineup for November 2025.</p>



<p>Earlier today, known leaker billbil-kun, who <span>has proven extremely reliable regarding PlayStation Plus game lineup leaks in the past, revealed in a new report posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-connait-le-titre-phare-des-jeux-mensuels-de-novembre-2025-60690" target="_blank">Dealabs</a>&nbsp;that the game that made headlines when it was launched in July 2022 for being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8mOAV0KJLE">widely appreciated by cats as much as by their owners </a>will be available to all PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscribers</span> starting from November 4.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Stray's joining the PlayStation Plus library next month would be its return to the service rather than its debut. At launch, the game was made available as part of the PlayStation Plus Extra library and was available to subscribers for around one year. The game's departure from the PlayStation subscription service <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/stray-xbox-release-date/">coincided with the end of its one-year console exclusivity.</a></p>



<p>Although Stray's addition to the PlayStation Plus subscription service may be disappointing for some users, especially after<a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/"> this month's addition of the excellent Alan Wake 2</a>, there could still be some surprises waiting in the wings. Two more titles will be part of November's lineup, which is expected to be revealed in full later this week, on October 29.</p>



<p>For those who never had the chance to try out the game before, however, Stray will be an excellent addition to the PlayStation Plus library, as the game features some great visuals, a richly-realized world, fun platforming, and more. You can learn more about it by checking out <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/stray-genre-curious-cat/">Nathan Birch's review of the PlayStation 5 version.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-airpods-pro-2-aren%E2%80%99t-the-new-kid-on-the-block-anymore-so-they%E2%80%99re-priced-to-move-to-almost-nothing.1335634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Until just a few short weeks ago, the AirPods Pro 2 were Apple’s end-all, be-all wireless earbuds, with thousands of glowing reviews and millions of units sold. Now that the AirPods Pro 3 are officially on the market, the Pro 2 earbuds might have just morphed into something even better — a terrific buying opportunity, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">if this Amazon deal taking 32% off their price is any indication.</a></p>
<p>It’s not like the quality of the AirPods Pro 2 have taken a sudden turn for the worse. They still have the H2 chip at their core to create incredibly efficient noise cancellation, spatial audio with head motion detection, and the world’s first hearing test and FDA-cleared hearing aid features in consumer wireless earbuds. The only thing that’s changed in the couple of months since they were supplanted at the top of the Apple food chain is the price, which just got a lot more friendly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Breakthrough Tech</h2>
<p>The H2 chip was a massive game-changer not just for the AirPods, but for the entire wireless earbud market. It literally doubled the noise cancellation power of the original AirPods Pro, and did so by increasing the number of times it analyzed external sounds to an incredible 48,000 per second. With that kind of noise-cancelling power, you can completely tune out the outside world and enjoy you playlists, podcasts, and audio books — a true luxury when you’re on a long flight or stuck in a crowded environment.</p>
<p>It’s also easy to let enough of the world back in to keep yourself aware of your surroundings by switching the AirPods Pro 2 into adaptive transparency mode, which is a wise personal-safety suggestion when you’re a pedestrian in a heavily trafficked area, or on a run or walk while alone.</p>



<h2>The Perfect Fit</h2>
<p>Another innovative feature of the AirPods Pro 2 is the fit test, accessible in the Bluetooth settings of your iPhone or iPad. By playing different tones to determine the quality of the seal between your ear and the AirPods, you discover which of the four different sizes of silicon tips is the right one for you to enjoy your AirPods Pro 2 to the fullest.</p>
<p>One area where the fit of the AirPods Pro 2 just dramatically improved is your budget, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">thanks to this 32% off Amazon deal that makes the AirPods Pro 2 a truly outstanding buy at just $170.</a> Perhaps we should be thanking the AirPods Pro 3 for dropping in time to make their legendary predecessors one of the better pre-Black Friday tech deals that we’ve seen.</p>

            <p>The cat's out the bag! Or so it seems, at least. Per a reliable and oft-cited leaker, Annapurna's delightful cat-based game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stray">Stray</a>, will be added to the PS Plus Essential Tier next month.</p>
<p>The information comes courtesy of Billbil-kun over on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-connait-le-titre-phare-des-jeux-mensuels-de-novembre-2025-60690">Dealabs</a>, who notes that the gaame will be added to the PS Plus library for all tiers (that's Essential, Extra and Premium) on November 4. It will be joined by two other games that have not yet been revealed, nor hinted at by Billbil-kun.
</p>
<p>The kitty caper - which is available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-finally-releases-on-switch-in-november">and Switch</a> - is a third-person adventure game that Eurogamer recommended when it four two years ago.

<p>In her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-review-fantastic-cat-exploration-through-a-dystopian-cybercity">Stray review</a>, Lottie said, "Stray captures the essence of being a cat, while delivering a deeper journey through a dying cybercity.
</p>
<p>"It's by doing this - looking at the world through feline eyes - that Stray creates a journey filled with such a sense of exploration, on top of the chance to indulge in as much cat-truction as you like. While doing so, though, it also crafts a touching story about the human desires of those who, at a glance, lack humanity - be it to reunite with a loved one, protect a community or reach the outside world. The result is a wonderful mix: a game about the longing for freedom, clever climbing mechanics, and every cat’s eternal desire to knock items off shelves."</p>
<p>If you're keen for more from the feline franchise, we also know that Annapurna Pictures' animation arm (which produced DNEG Animation' Nimona), is planning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-cat-adventure-stray-is-being-turned-into-an-animated-movie">a "respectful" animated adaptation</a> of the fan-favourite cat adventure.

<p>"Nintendo has continually dominated with outstanding games"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="9d804492cc0a7"><a title="Halo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9d804492cc0a7/halo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/introducing-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo Waypoint</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Xbox has been making headlines recently with the news that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> would be making its way to the PS5 in addition to Xbox Series X|S. Halo had always seemed like the last bastion of exclusivity for Microsoft's platform, and now that it's going multi-platform in 2026, it really seems like all bets are off.</p>
<p>To really drive the point home, Xbox president Sarah Bond recently said that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/xbox-boss-believes-sonys-strategy-of-console-exclusives-is-antiquated">console exclusives is an "antiquated" concept</a>, noting that the "biggest games in the world are available everywhere". This statement comes as the brand continues to push its "This is an Xbox" marketing campaign to promote gaming across multiple devices.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees, of course, and ex-Blizzard president Mike Ybarra is seemingly quite against the idea. In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1981454023380107544">he simply said</a> "Someone go tell Nintendo that exclusives are antiquated".</p>
<p>When another user challenged this statement, Ybarra <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1981461659060490395">doubled down</a> and explained that Nintendo has thrived on console exclusivity, deeming the company's strategy of "risk and return" a big success:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo has continually dominated with outstanding games. Sure some platforms flopped, but they always took risk and came back very strong.</p>
<p>"It is the opposite of antiquated. It is risk and return."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Xbox has recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">reiterated its support for the Switch 2</a>, with CEO of Microsoft Gaming Phil Spencer stating that "if there are people who want to play our games on the PlayStation 5 or the Nintendo Switch 2, we would love for them to play our games on those platforms".</p>
<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved has not been confirmed for the Switch 2 at the time of writing, but we know Nintendo likes to keep these kind of announcements to itself in Direct presentations. That's not to say it <em>will</em> happen, but we honestly wouldn't be surprised at this point.</p>

            <p>I know it all. All of the witty insights, all of the arcane knowledge, and all of the random blather. I know all of the words. Or at least I will if I decide to use one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>'s early mods, which ditches the skill restrictions to give you access to every dialogue line in the game. It's just one among a nice crop of tweaks thus far, as the Order of Adjustment dig their mitts into the RPG's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-beginners-guide">early access</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Of the 28 or so mods which have popped up over the game's first weekend in the hands of folks who paid extra, it's the latest to arrive that's caught my eye. Veteran modder Kassent has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/31">ditched the skill requirements</a> which lock away certain dialogue lines if, for example, you've not invested enough points into engineering to be able to dish out some accurate yacking about machines.</p>
<p>Obviously, it's not the kind of thing I'd remotely recommend enabling for your first playthrough, since it'll get in the way of you roleplaying anything other than the galaxy's smartiest pants, but as someone who's used these sorts of mods in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> to seek out the elusive last few bits of chatter I might have missed in multiple conventional runs, I'll likely give it a whirl down the line. After all, if a game's got good words, which this one definitely does, it's nice to take 'em all in.</p>
<p>If you're looking for mods that might be useful right out of the box, there's a solid selection of those building up too. As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-mods-are-flowing-offering-quicker-movement-more-blood-and-a-pedicure">Bloodlines 2 last week</a>, modder Caites is behind a lot of the early tweaks. Thus far, they've done stuff like aid combat-averse cowards by making The Incognito's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-how-to-get-all-companions">crew of companions</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/9">tougher</a>, make it <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/11">easier to get</a> whichever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-best-perks">perk</a>/flaw loadout you like, and have even found time to give the VATS-esque tactical time dilation mechanic <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/6">a boost</a> I'm not sure it needed. Also in the 'make things easier' bucket are modder Goldenchrome's option of more than the usual two <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/4">skill points per level up</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/24">range boosting</a> of the neon outlines around grabbable or intertactable stuff.</p><p>Finally, if you're a weirdo and decide not to play in the default first-person perspective, here's a mod which pushes the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/25">third-person camera a bit closer</a> to your character, potentially making it a bit easier to hit the thing you're shooting at.</p>
<p>Most of these Outer Worlds 2 mods are installed via simple file placement, but it's worth noting that <a href="https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS?tab=MIT-1-ov-file">UE4SS</a> is required to get Kassent's dialogue unlocker working. If you're still on the fence about the game ahead of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date">full launch</a> this week, consider taking a gander at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">my review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everybody loves a surprise, especially one that saves money. Amazon’s limited-time 43%-off deal on the newest model of their Fire TV Stick HD is already a stellar offer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">Smash that button and the Fire TV Stick HD is all yours for a record-low price of just $20&nbsp;— nearly half off its regular $35 price.</a></p>
<p>This is the latest and greatest version of Amazon’s streaming stick, and we can say that with total confidence because we have over 42,000 Amazon reviewers backing us up on it. Their average rating for the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD is a spectacular 4.7 stars, with kudos being handed out for the quality, ease of setup, ease of use, and overall value for the price. Assuming most of those reviews were lauding the Fire TV Stick HD’s value for its original $35 price, that value now basically doubles.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Even the Smart TVs Benefit</h2>
<p>With virtually all new TVs now being manufactured with built-in streaming ability, you might think the streaming stick and other external streaming devices are on their way to the ash heap of history, next to the VCR, the 8-track, and a long list of other once-cutting-edge technology. We’d never bet against progress, but as long as the Fire TV Stick HD has such a clean, intuitive interface and user experience as compared to many of those Smart TVs, it won’t be going anywhere.</p>
<p>Everything about the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD is about ease. The installation is totally plug-and-play, just plug it into your TV’s HDMI port and it’s up and running. There’s no external power source since it runs off the power of your TV, and no complicated setup steps of any kind. It’s perfect for first-time streamers or anyone who goes crosseyed when they look at the home screen of their Smart TV.</p>



<h2>More Than Streaming</h2>
<p>The name says TV Stick, but since this is an Amazon device, you know it can do far more. Voice commands for Alexa work for streaming and also for smart home devices like your thermostat, lights, smart camera, and more. The Fire TV Stick HD is also able to play your favorite music streaming services like Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, and others, and its included remote can also control your compatible TV and home theater devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5/?tag=kotaku01-20">The tiny $20 price tag that pops up on the Fire TV Stick HD when you stack Amazon’s 43% off deal</a>&nbsp;is a sensational price for a top-line streaming stick that brings effortless and easy to navigate streaming to your TV, but also to any TV with an HDMI port. What could be more portable than a pocket-sized streaming stick that requires no cords and no external power source? The best sub-$20 streaming device is just a click away at Amazon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-unloads-ideapad-slim-3-i7-1tb-ssd-laptop-stock-now-2200-cheaper-on-amazon-2000639229</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-unloads-ideapad-slim-3-i7-1tb-ssd-laptop-stock-now-2-200-cheaper-on-amazon.1335604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lenovo’s official website rarely offers meaningful discounts, and finding premium laptops marked down more than 20% feels like winning a small lottery. The real clearance action happens on Amazon, where manufacturers quietly offload inventory at prices that make you question if there’s a typo. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/">Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 with an Intel Core i7-13620H processor, 40GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB PCIe SSD has crashed to an all-time low of $799 on Amazon</a>, down from its typical $2,999 price tag. That’s a staggering <strong>$2,200 discount and a massive 73% savings</strong> that transforms a high-end business laptop into something accessible for students.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Hardware at Budget Pricing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-13620H is the 13th generation Intel processor which is a hybrid model that comes with 10 cores: <strong>6 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores</strong>. The processor has the efficiency cores perform simple tasks in the background so that actual tough tasks requiring processing are attended by the performance cores for both speed and smooth functioning when using the CPU. The performance cores operate at a speed of 2.4 GHz, boosting to 4.9 GHz when additional processing is needed for activities such as video processing or calculations involving numerous formulas in a Microsoft Office sheet.</p>
<p>The 16 threads through its 10 cores allow it to run multiple apps at once without causing the system to come to a standstill. Open your Chrome browser with 30 tabs, use your Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Slack, Spotify and other apps running in the background, and still, it will respond better than budget-friendly systems that only come with a dual-core or quad-core processor. The <strong>24MB cache helps it access frequently used resources</strong> without having to wait for the system’s storage for that access.</p>



<p>Memory configuration makes a substantial difference in real-world performance, and <strong>40GB DDR5 RAM puts this laptop in workstation territory</strong>. DDR5 represents the newest memory standard with significantly higher bandwidth than DDR4 and allows faster data transfer between RAM and the processor. This capacity handles memory-intensive workflows like running multiple virtual machines for software development, editing 4K video footage with effects layers, working with large datasets in Excel or data analysis software or keeping dozens of browser tabs active without performance degradation</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD has more than enough storage for operating systems and files, besides offering <strong>read transfers at a rate of 3,500 MB/sec and write transfers at a rate of 3,000 MB/sec</strong> on average for PCIe v3.x speeds. This results in Windows launching in a few seconds, applications launching almost instantly, and the time for file transfers being dramatically faster than hard drives or SATA SSDs.</p>



<p>The <strong>display has a 15.3-inch screen with a resolution of 1920×1200 pixels</strong>. The added vertical resolution (when compared to 1920×1080 Full HD) is beneficial for professionals like programmers or document writers, where every pixel matters. The display employs an IPS display type that boasts excellent viewing angles and color accuracy regardless of the angle, and its 300-nit luminance helps it remain visible in brightly lit environs or near windows.</p>
<p>Connectivity also features contemporary standards, so that Wi-Fi 6 enables faster wireless throughput than its predecessor, Wi-Fi 5. The Bluetooth 5.2 standard takes care of wireless peripherals such as computer mice and headphones for greater range and lower latency. Connect options include requirements for everyday use, such as <strong>two USB-A jacks for connecting legacy accessories, a USB-C port that can provide Power Delivery for faster charging</strong>&nbsp;along with DisplayPort output for computer displays, an HDMI 1.4 output for presentations, a headphone jack, and access through SD-card slots that benefit photographers for camera transfers.</p>
<p>At $799 with a 4.5-star rating from nearly 1,000 buyers, this deal delivers specifications that typically cost $1,500-2,000 even on sale.</p>

Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of a Halo game on a PlayStation console would have been outrageous before, say, a few years ago, when Microsoft’s multiplatform push began (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-has-reportedly-pushed-xbox-studios-to-deliver-a-30-profit-margin-allegedly-leading-to-all-those-layoffs-canceled-projects-price-rises-and-the-end-of-exclusives">reportedly in part due to a need to make an increased profit margin from Xbox studios</a>). Perhaps that’s what prompted U.S. video game shop GameStop to tweet a statement declaring the consoles wars over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Someone somewhere within the bowels of the White House saw that tweet and decided it would be a good one to jump on. The tweet in question shows the U.S. president as Halo protagonist Master Chief — clearly generated by AI — holding an Energy Sword and saluting in front of the White House and the American Flag.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Power to the Players <a href="https://t.co/GqNu0qdgmw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/GqNu0qdgmw</a> <a href="https://t.co/4Hw6G7i7aW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4Hw6G7i7aW</a></p>— The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">But look closely at that flag and you’ll see the mistake — there are 40 stars when there should be 50. Has Trump, as Master Chief, teased plans to scrub 10 states from the U.S. map? Did the AI powering the creation of this image hint at generative AI’s endgame? Should we be worried?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Trump claiming a key role in ending the console wars? Is the White House making a play for the gamer crowd here? It’s hard to say what this image is trying to achieve, but it has gone well and truly viral, with 9.3 million views at the time of this article’s publication. IGN has asked Microsoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an especially odd “collab” from the White House when you consider Trump’s prior comments on video games. In 2019, Trump suggested one way to prevent future mass shootings in America was to take a firm stance against violent video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We must stop the glorification of violence in our society,” he said. “This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this and it has to begin immediately.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps, in Trump’s mind, Halo doesn’t count.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Trump administration has form when it comes to using AI images to promote the President. In May, Trump sparked a backlash from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, was released as Catholics mourned the death of Pope Francis and prepared to choose the next pontiff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The White House has also released AI images of Trump as Superman and as a Star Wars Jedi. And last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">The Pokémon Company formally responded to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security</a> as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Halo: Campaign Evolved, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-xbox-exclusive-but-in-truth-the-ps5-version-comes-as-no-surprise"><u>why it’s the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-made-it-right-and-they-are-breaking-it-for-no-reason-one-of-the-key-members-of-the-original-halo-dev-team-doesnt-sound-thrilled-with-microsofts-halo-campaign-evolved">thoughts from some members of the original Halo development team at Bungie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>RV There Yet, the first release from indie studio Nuggets Entertainment, has passed 1.3m sales.</p>
<p>The co-operative RV adventure game released on the 21st October to almost immediate interest from the friend-focused crowd, quickly gaining thousands upon thousands of concurrent players. This figure steadily climbed throughout last week, eventually hitting a peak of 100,002 roadtrip enjoyers.</p>
<p>The developers originally announced passing the 1m sale milestone on social media, <a href="https://x.com/RVThereYetGame/status/1982121374002168034">with an MS Paint illustration to mark the occasion</a> on the 25th of October. One day later on Sunday. 26th October, community manager Jace Varlet noted in a video posted to the Nuggets Entertainment YouTube channel the figure had since reached 1,288,515 sales</p>

<p>That same video addresses the presence of some bugs, as well as the absence of some features due to the game jam origins of RV There Yet. Key Binding is coming, as are additional localisation support, as well as achievements and controller support.</p><p>If this origin story for a hit co-operative indie game sounds familiar, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Peak also was the product of a game jam</a>. Indeed, it appears RV There Yet continues a recent trend of smaller scope, passionately made indie projects from small-yet-skilled studios. Let's not forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a>, Content Warning, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>.</p>
<p>Varlet concludes the video by noting more content is likely coming in the future for RV There Yet, though Nuggets Entertainment is also working on first-person farming game Among The Wild which looks mighty whimsical. Let us know if you're having fun with RV There Yet below!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-game-of-the-year-%E2%80%98votes%E2%80%99-from-phil-spencer-and-naoki-hamaguchi.1335574/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The likelihood of a roleplaying game once again getting most Game of the Year prizes after 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 is very high thanks to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The game has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scored many nominations from the Golden Joystick Awards 2025</a>, with the winners due to be announced in a week from today.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the surprising sleeper hit of the year has received two endorsements from industry figures like Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer and Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Famitsu</a>, Spencer mentioned various games as his personal 2025 highlights, but ultimately picked Sandfall Interactive's debut title out of the bunch.</p>



<p><em>Excluding our games… I love the game I'm playing now, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that's very good. Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was also good. Also, although it is a game for PlayStation 5 and PC, my friend director Kojima's Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The Game of the Year is probably Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></p>



<p>While not exclusive to Microsoft's platforms, the game was available on its subscription service, Game Pass, from day one. As such, one could think Spencer might be slightly biased in his choice, but he's far from the only one who thinks Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 deserves such recognition. Hamaguchi-san <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-directors-goty-pick-and-not-just-because-it-features-jrpg-inspired-combat-it-gets-all-of-the-elements-in-it-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Gamesradar the same thing</a>, although he was also careful to highlight how its merits go beyond the advancements made to turn-based combat:   </p>



<p><em>It's a really great game and would deserve Game of the Year. I'd like to see them get that. What makes that game so good is the fact it gets all of the elements in it right, and it balances them all at such a high level of quality. The setting, the world, the characters, and the storyline, those are all really well done as well, in addition to the gameplay. And I think it all comes together, and that's why it's such a well-regarded game, why the fans like it so much, why it sold as well as it had.</em></p>



<p>As you may remember, there was a bit of a controversy with Square Enix. A few years ago, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida famously excused the game's lack of a turn-based combat option <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the statement that it did not mix well with realistic graphics</a>. Following the smashing success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, some Final Fantasy fans have been hoping that Square Enix might change its stance in the future, but for now, there have been no such announcements. It will ultimately be up to the producers of the next mainline installments to choose what's best.</p>



<p>In other Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 news, one of the biggest Hollywood stars of the past couple of years has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollywood-star-glen-powell-loves-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently expressed interest in being part of the film adaptation</a>. By the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have our own TGS 2025 interview with Naoki Hamaguch</a>i about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Part 3, in case you missed it earlier.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In further evidence that the Vampire game series is as cursed as its toothy goreguzzlers, the developers of troubled battle royale offshoot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt</a> have announced that it’s shutting down for good – mere days after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Bloodlines 2</a>, the long-delayed (yet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">apparently still okay-ish</a>) mainline sequel finally released.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This might not be surprising if you’ve followed Bloodhunt since its own launch in 2022, with low player counts leading to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-battle-royale-is-ending-development-after-last-years-launch">end of active development</a> just a year later. Devs Sharkmob said at the time that its servers will remain online as long as an "active player base and community" continued to exist, but <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026">today’s blog post</a> confirms those servers will beep their last on April 28th 2026. I guess that’s still a decent chunk of time to get any last Winner Winner Human Dinners in, though the announcement timing is curious – is the Bloodlines 2 timing a coincidence, or were Sharkmob hoping for a bump in interest-by-association that never materialised?</p>
<p>Either way, and as the post states, "the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable." Bloodhunt has also been taken off sale immediately, and existing players can no longer buy tokens – Bloodhunt’s in-game currency – through its shop. Any tokens left in your leather trenchcoat’s tattered pockets will still be good for virtual purchases until the server shutdown, mind.</p>
<p>We never reviewed Bloodhunt, and Alice B’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-preview">2021 preview</a> was based on too embryonic a build to judge the multiplayer experiment’s chances. I do remember playing a bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-system-requirements-pc-performance-and-the-best-settings-to-use">for hardware reasons</a>, but wasn’t terribly compelled: the inclusion of the 'masquerade' dynamic, wherein you’re encouraged to hide your vampiric powers and/or murders from the eyes of an ignorant public, might have made for a better battle royale twist if the game’s rendition of Prague wasn’t so empty. Which, unlike the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-devs-provide-workarounds-for-high-priority-bugs-including-seattles-populace-disappearing">accidental abandonment of Bloodline 2's Seattle</a>, wasn’t the result of bugs. And I know I bring up this god damned game every time I write about BRs, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> was already doing highly agile last-man-standery at much higher technical and presentational calibres.</p><p>Thus, Bloodhunt’s slow undeath is finally set for an end. At least Bloodlines 2 seems to be doing, again, okay-ish, peaking at a respectable #3 in the Steam Top Sellers charts last week and already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-mods-are-flowing-offering-quicker-movement-more-blood-and-a-pedicure">siring an active modding community</a>.</p>

            <p>Happy this week all! Good news, James has returned from India and appears none the worse for his voyages. I was hoping he'd come back with a top-to-bottom report on Indian game development, but no, it turns out the smirking jackanapes was merely "on holiday".

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-jackery-1-500w-portable-power-station-drops-50-off-amazon-preps-you-for-winter-outages.1335562/</guid>

              <p>Winter storms knock out power without warning and leave homes dark and cold for hours (or even days). Having backup power stops being a luxury and becomes essential when your heating system shuts down, your refrigerator starts warming up and your phones need charging to stay connected with emergency services. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> portable (1500W) power station addresses exactly this scenario with enough capacity to run critical appliances during outages. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/">it’s hit an all-time low of $419 on Amazon, slashed from its regular $839 price</a>. This <strong>50% discount makes serious emergency preparedness accessible</strong> without the commitment and installation costs of whole-home generators.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Covers the Essentials</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,070Wh energy storage allows for actual use time</strong>&nbsp;and that’s important during emergency situations. This model will support a contemporary refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours, thereby preserving food during a power outage. Use it to heat a room for 4 to 5 hours when set to low output for a space heater, or use it to power LED lights, allowing them to keep shining for several days. The <strong>pure sine wave AC has a 1,500W continuous power</strong> output and comes with 3,000W surges that can handle motor startups for refrigerators or furnace fans.</p>
<p>The emergency charge feature through the Jackery app allows for a <strong>quick recharge to full power in only 1 hour</strong>. Normal portable chargers can only recharge to full power in 6 to 8 hours and gaps exist during multi-day power outage situations. This particular power bank will reach 100% power in 60 minutes only when emergency mode is enabled, although it comes optimized for 1.7-hour recharge for better battery longevity.</p>



<p>The chemistry used in the energy storage system – <strong>LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate) – has a significantly longer lifespa</strong>n than that used in standard lithium-ion batteries that are found inside low-cost energy stations. This type of battery retains more than 70% of its original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles, meaning that it will last for more than 10 years. Standard lithium-ion batteries normally depreciate to 80% after 500 to 1,000 charge cycles.</p>
<p>The port options include both contemporary and traditional devices: The<strong> two USB-C ports support a total output of 100W Power Delivery</strong> for fast charging of laptops, tablets, or smartphones without requiring additional wall chargers. The <strong>USB-A port is for traditional laptops</strong>, and functions at standard rates. The <strong>three AC plug options</strong> allow for the simultaneous use of several appliances, such as a lamp, computer charger, and phone, at the same time. The <strong>DC car port option</strong> supports 12V-powered appliances such as portable coolers or tire pumps.</p>



<p>This time, the <strong>bundle comes with a 16-foot extension cord</strong> that is specifically made for use when connecting solar panels. The placement of the solar panels (sold separately) has to be carried out while exposing them to sunlight and the stations, on the other hand, need to remain either under cover or in vehicles. The weight – 23.8 pounds – is portable and make it simple to relocate from room to room.</p>
<p>With a price tag of $419 and a rating of 4.7 stars from buyers, it is an incredible bargain for a true emergency-power solution that works when it matters.</p>

            <p>Almost half of the 1,448,270 signatures amassed by the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Destroying Videogames</a> EU citizens' initiative have now been verified, according to the campaigners' latest update. Meanwhile, the group are working to "secure expert backing" which doesn't rely on "expensive consulting firms" for their effort to push EU lawmakers to look into the issue of publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Out of 1,448,270 signatures, 689,035 are already verified, and 15 countries have met their thresholds," reads this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1og0kb3/stop_killing_games_announcement/">latest update post</a> from organiser Moritz Katzner. "We are still missing the two largest countries - Germany and France—but based on our current progress, we are confident we have surpassed the required thresholds." Getting over the signature verification hurdle was something the campaigners had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">expressed concerns about previously</a>. There were fears that removing the fakes would result in the initiative falling short of the numbers needed to push for government action. Those worries were somewhat abated last month, with the group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-fakery-concerns-stop-destroying-videogames-campaign-claim-around-97-of-their-signatures-are-valid-so-far">citing positive "early reports"</a> regarding the validity of their signature totals.</p>
<p>In his post, Katzner went on to claim that the European Commission's <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/consultations/commission-launches-open-consultation-forthcoming-digital-fairness-act">Digital Fairness Act</a> received a "record-breaking number of submissions" during its feedback phase. That act, which is the brainchild of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, has been <a href="https://www.digital-fairness-act.com/">in the works since last September</a> and will aim to protect consumers against the likes of "deceptive or manipulative interface design, misleading marketing by social media influencers, addictive design of digital products and unfair personalisation practices, especially where consumer vulnerabilities are exploited for commercial purposes".</p>
<p>As for what the campaigners are currently up to, Katzner wrote that along with taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">meetings with politicians and governments</a>, they're "actively working to secure expert backing" for their initiative from developers in the industry. "Having politicians, lobbyists, and developers in our ranks is invaluable, but we must credibly address the tough questions - without relying on expensive consulting firms," the organiser explained.</p><p>"Our fight is not against a united CEO front," he added. "It’s against a handful of companies holding our favourite games hostage. That’s why we said 'enough' - and why so many of you did too. Let’s not just talk about developers but with them, big and small, who are already resisting these awful practices. We can’t undo past damage, but we can stop what’s coming. If we allow these few bad actors to dictate the future, we will continue to lose ground on issues that should never have arisen."</p>
<p>We'll see just how much support from within the games industry the Stop Destroying Videogames lot can get on board, while they wait for the rest of their initiative's signatures to be checked. Then, it'll be up to politicians and bodies to debate whether and how any action is taken in response to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible">this and similar campaigns across the globe</a>.</p>

<p>As spotted by our friends over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-we-are-making-now-is-a-nintendo-game-metroid-prime-producer-kensuke-tanabe-reveals-creative-tensions-with-retro-in-new-book">IGN</a>, the book highlights some of the clashes that occurred between the North American studio and Nintendo itself during the development of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>.</p>
<p>Tanabe explains that while "Nintendo retained the final decision-making authority", there were "many instances early on where our approaches to the specifications did not align, leading to disagreements."</p>
<p>He says that Retro would often push back on key decisions, telling Nintendo that "this is how Western studios approach and think about game development." Tanabe countered this by explaining to Retro that "the game we are making now is a Nintendo game, and this is Retro’s first time working on one. I’ve been working on Nintendo games my whole career, so I believe I have the most experience in making Nintendo games. So please trust me first."</p>
<p>Tanabe reveals that these disagreements would often result in day-long meetings ending in a stalemate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One day, during a video conference about the Meta Ridley battle, our discussions kept clashing, and we couldn’t find common ground. Time slipped away, and by the time the meeting (which had started in the morning) finally ended, the sun was setting. Many Nintendo developers have learned from Mr. Miyamoto that the appearance of enemy characters should be designed based on functionality… this had not yet been articulated quite so concisely. As a result, it took time for us to convey the concept clearly to Retro."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that this was Retro's first game, it's remarkable that its staff felt bold enough to challenge Nintendo – but it would seem that this willingness to dig in is what helped make the three Prime games so memorable.</p>
<p>One example of stubbornness paying off is related to the game's Morph Ball transformation, which shifts the player's perspective to third-person. However, even then, a compromise was still reached.</p>
<p>"The transition animation for shifting from first-person Morph Ball mode was proposed by Retro," says Tanabe. "However, Retro also suggested a skip feature to reduce morphing time, but Mr. Miyamoto directed that it should be unskippable, as it was one of the opportunities to view Samus in third-person. Retro also proposed the mechanic of rolling through half-pipes in Morph Ball mode. Initially, Nintendo was skeptical, questioning whether it would actually be fun. However, Retro responded, ‘Please try it first before deciding.’"</p>
<p>Ultimately, Retro and Nintendo were able to produce a game which is now regarded as one of the best ever made, and Tanabe is keen to acknowledge the contribution of both parties.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has finally unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the campaign portion of Bungie’s beloved Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo fans have spent most of the weekend debating the changes Halo Studios has made for this upcoming 2026 shooter, from the addition of sprint to the more pristine art style. But what do the developers of Halo: Combat Evolved itself make of the remake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jaime Griesemer is one of the key developers behind Halo. He was most involved with designing Halo’s famous ‘30 seconds of fun’ gameplay loop and designed much of the campaign itself. Now creative director at Highwire Games (Six Days in Fallujah), <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981927318752039135" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griesemer took to X / Twitter</a> to deliver an early verdict on gameplay footage coming out of Microsoft’s Halo: Campaign Evolved reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He did not sound impressed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters," Griesemer said. "I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s unpack this a bit. Griesemer is criticizing a key part of the iconic campaign mission, The Silent Cartographer: the first encounter with two Hunters. In the original Halo, this fight is meant to be played with Master Chief on-foot (players soon discovered it was possible to brute force a Warthog into the arena). But in Microsoft’s remake, players can freely take their Warthog up to the Hunters and ride roughshod over their hapless victims. I imagine the Hunters, with their dying breaths, gurgling: “no fair!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Oh, and that WooHoo Jump? <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982314253072953402" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griesemer explained</a>: “There’s a ramp that is supposed to have a bunch of jackals at the landing spot. Your gunner would always say ‘Woohoo!’ When you got airborne.”)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Griesemer’s tweet, viewed 2.3 million times, has sparked a reaction online, with some fans insisting the level layout change ruins the gameplay flow, others saying this change and others like it will make the game more fun. As for Griesemer, in a subsequent tweet, he explained that if Microsoft is going to change Halo’s crates to be dynamic, then they should have also redesigned the encounters that use them as permanent cover."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982259703137829074" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He continued</a>: “Most people forced the Warthog through BECAUSE of the Hunters. The introduction of the Hunters was supposed to be intimidating and difficult, but in the light so you can understand them. Then you meet them in an enclosed dark area and they are even harder. But then you get Rockets and Vehicles and turn the tables. It’s a three act play of enemy design and you want to throw it in a blender. Fine, it’ll go down easier but it’s not going to taste as good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981959132082274764" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And</a>: “It’s like the dance remix of a classic song that skips the intro and the bridge and just thumps the chorus over and over.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griesemer <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982317401426526649" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later offered</a> a potential explanation for this change: “On further analysis I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“Make it an option” is the biggest red flag for a dysfunctional design. We have no vision for what this is supposed to be, here’s the tools to fix it yourself.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981964024511422902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of Halo: Campaign Evolved that Griesemer has taken issue with is the addition of an optional infinite sprint button. Sprint seems to be the biggest talking point about Halo: Campaign Evolved; while you can choose not to sprint, some are saying using it destroys Halo: Combat Evolved’s classic, considered gameplay pace and thus its sense of wonder. Others say believe it’s essential for the fun factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griesemer doesn’t sound like a fan of sprinting in the Halo remake, either. In another <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982098938305171538" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, he pointed out that the player was able to sprint into The Silent Cartographer’s shaft vignette so fast that it broke the music transition. “Who is this for?” he asked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “If the world isn’t scaled to sprint, you will be able to trivially skip encounters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved’s Needler, too, has caused quite the kerfuffle. This iconic Halo weapon shoots deadly needles into an enemy, then, after a cool-sounding charge, they explode. The Needler stands out because the ammo — the needles themselves — stick out the top of the gun, so you can easily see how much ammo you have at any given moment. Still, Microsoft saw fit to add an ammo counter on the Needler, just in case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This change has drawn some ridicule online, and Griesemer is clearly not a fan. “By far the most comically unnecessary embellishment in the whole announcement,” <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982161221957660863" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. "I’m not sure it isn’t intentional satire.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982335105579548762" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then</a>: “But why would you add an ammo counter to a weapon that IS an ammo counter in the first place?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">By far the most comically unnecessary embellishment in the whole announcement. I’m not sure it isn’t intentional satire.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1982161221957660863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In response to Griesemer's original, now viral tweet on Halo: Campaign Evolved, one user accused the veteran designer of “crying” about nostalgia, to which <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982107143923990827" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he responded</a>: “Because I made it right and they are breaking it for no reason.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982116418536788417" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He continued</a>: “... I think there are dozens of changes (reload speeds, no health packs, falling damage, etc) that make the game 'slicker' but ultimately less interesting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Bungie left Halo behind to develop Destiny, Microsoft, via what was known as 343 Industries, continued the franchise with Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and 2021’s Halo: Infinite. The internet would suggest that with these games, Microsoft has struggled to recreate the Bungie “magic,” for want of a better term. Certainly Bungie’s Halo games are more fondly remembered than Microsoft’s. But why has Microsoft struggled so?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griesemer was asked this question, and in his response revealed his thoughts on the idea of remaking Halo and continuing to make new Halo games now, nearly 25 years after Combat Evolved came out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s not the early 2000s anymore,” <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982101197025919181" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. “Halo is of its time, maybe more than any other game franchise. So they are constantly trying to either take Halo out of 2001 and modernize it (which breaks it) or take players back to 2001 with nostalgia (which is impossible).”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“Keep getting them checks.” Remakes and remasters are soul-destroying and I feel for any dev working on one. They can’t win and even if they do they won’t get credit. Bad situation unless you are getting paid $$$.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981934406303703219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Probably not. But I’m not sure what the point is of a “remake” anyway. Nostalgia? A new generation of fans? Occupying an enormous art team while you figure out what to do?</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981969408525578526?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">They kept the music and the AI the same, it looks like. I’m glad I can play it on a Sony system.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1982264974878839081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One member of the original Halo team who sounds thrilled with Halo: Campaign Evolved is Marcus Lehto, who was the art director on Combat Evolved and thus heavily involved in the iconic look of Halo itself. Lehto, who recently left the now shuttered Battlefield 6 developer Ridgeline Games (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-co-creator-marcus-lehto-disappointed-ridgeline-staff-were-not-properly-credited-in-battlefield-6-says-they-built-the-foundation-of-the-game">and hit out at EA for not properly credited former staff</a>), offered a positive assessment of Halo Studios’ work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My honest impression of seeing the new Halo Campaign Evolved is this," <a href="https://x.com/game_fabricator/status/1982523556320948338" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said on X / Twitter</a>. “I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine. It's gorgeous in a way I wish we could have built it originally back in 2001. It warms my heart to see Halo CE like this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved isn’t out until 2026 (and probably near to the game’s 25th anniversary in November), so Halo Studios has time to react to some of the feedback it’s seen and make changes — if that’s what it wants to do, of course. It may stick to its guns on the likes of sprint, those rocks, and the Needler's ammo counter. Meanwhile, the Halo community continues to debate the changes, fussing over every detail and what it means for the tone, feel, and gameplay of Bungie’s seminal shooter. I suspect this will be a running theme well into 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Halo: Campaign Evolved, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-xbox-exclusive-but-in-truth-the-ps5-version-comes-as-no-surprise">why it’s the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="0d9cfe7bdc6d4"><a title="Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d9cfe7bdc6d4/legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're back with another look at the UK boxed charts and, surprising no one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has maintained its lead in the second week, with original Switch sales now starting to outpace Switch 2. Heck, with 150 million+ consoles out in the wild, we expected nothing less.</p>
<p>However, according to Chris Dring over at <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pokemon-legends-z-a-captures-no1">The Game Business</a>, sales are roughly 28% lower than that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> across Europe. Going one step further, he states that Legends: Z-A is the smallest retail launch for the 'mainline' franchise since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Let's Go, Eevee!</a> in 2018.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vzkuir&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, one potential explanation for this is that Legends: Z-A was heavily pushed for the Switch 2, which naturally has a much lower install base compared to its predecessor. Switch 2 sales for the game, in general, have been stronger than that of Switch 1 since launch on 16th October.</p>
<p>We've also got a few newcomers this week, but none of them have really made a substantial impact – at least in terms of retail sales. Digital is, of course, another story. We've got <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/jurassic_world_evolution_3">Jurassic World: Evolution 3</a> at number 5, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> at number 12, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> at number 16, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/vampire_the_masquerade_-_bloodlines_2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> at number 20, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tormented_souls_2">Tormented Souls 2</a> at number 27.</p>
<p>Good news for Nintendo, then, as Switch / Switch 2 games make up half of the top ten here, including the aforementioned Legends: Z-A, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-update-custom-search-player-movement-progression-to-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised on Friday</a>, the development teams working on Battlefield 6 (DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion) have released the patch notes for update 1.1.1.0, which is set to go live tomorrow ahead of the debut of Season 1. The update will be released at 9:00 UTC, whereas the new season will be enabled at 15:00 UTC.</p>



<p>With this update, the developers aim to address some of the biggest pain points the Battlefield 6 community lamented in the game's first few weeks. For example, the player character's core movement and animations have been refined to provide smoother landings, faster stance transitions, and improved vaulting behaviour. Bouncing issues when landing or spawning have also been reduced.</p>



<p>When it comes to shooting, players have complained about weapon dispersion, which this patch reworks to better align the accuracy and handling of each weapon with its intended design and performance over range. These changes address cases where the accuracy was inconsistent, such as when dispersion did not properly settle after sprinting. The developers believe the tweaks will bring the overall firing behavior closer to the intended balance between precision, control, and weapon power.</p>



<p>Furthermore, users had requested visibility and lighting improvements, and the developers promise this new version of Battlefield 6 will feature better exposure transitions, interior lighting, and reduced fog and smoke persistence. There's even more to patch 1.1.1.0, including improvements to audio and user interface and, of course, a long list of fixes you can read all about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2807960/view/534364965583194766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the official changelog post</a>.</p>



<p>Between this patch and the debut of Season 1, EA and the development teams are hoping to keep the momentum going. The game's launch was as successful as they wanted, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking franchise sales records</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garnering acclaim from critics</a> and fans alike. Season 1 will be pivotal, although <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">based on the hands-on by our David Carcasole</a>, there are highlights (the new Conquest maps) and downsides (the new small group modes).</p>



<p>The Battle Royale mode is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to make its debut in Battlefield 6 tomorrow</a>, although there has been no official comment yet.</p>

            <p>Screenshots for Bluepoint's cancelled live service God Of War game appear to have slipped through the titan fingers of publishers Sony. Assuming they aren't a dream woven by Morpheus (via his earthly emissaries at <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-first-look-at-cancelled-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-unveiled">MP1st</a>), they reveal a few work-in-progress environments from the abandoned project, which Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">reportedly cancelled earlier this year</a> alongside a new game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> devs Sony Bend.</p><!--more-->
<p>As you might expect, the screens are heavy on Ancient Greek architecture. Although perhaps you weren't expecting that, given that the last couple of Gowwers took place in settings from Nordic myth, with occasional, mostly unwelcome cameos from Kratos's old chums south of the Alps. MP1st's source for the screenshots claims that the game would have featured Hades, god of the underworld, playing the part of armory master. This suggests it would have taken place prior to God Of War 3. The cavern roofs and yellow sulphur pools in the snaps certainly look rather Stygian. There are also interiors with broken bridges and balconies that imply a touch of platforming. </p>



<p>The things that spring out to me the most from those screens are the pots. Such glorious pots! Pots of lime green and charcoal black and deepest terracotta, flaking away to bare pink clay. Pots with rolling, woven patterns and cute little handles and cracks that bespeak a lifetime of humble service. How I yearn to hit them with an axe and see how they fall apart. How I yearn to charge through them like piles of leaves. Quality pot smashing is six tenths of the thrill of action-RPGs, even when they aren't game-as-a-service projects in which hidden, semi-random loot is the focus. It doesn't matter how many HBO-courting father-son storylines you pack in if the urns don't break real good.</p><p>I'd say these pots are fit to be published, but uncle Sony had other ideas. They've spent much of the past few years splurging on live service games, and are now cutting back on that investment in the wake of the ill-fated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> (which they threw in the bin mere weeks after launch). Bluepoint appear to be keeping busy in the wake of the reported God Of War cancellation. Earlier this month, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-job-listing-at-bluepoint-games-fuels-speculation-over-its-next-project-but-is-bloodborne-really-likely">discovered</a> that they were advertising for a senior combat designer with a "solid understanding of combat systems and mechanics for third-person melee action experiences".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s update 1.1.1.0 is set to go live tomorrow, a day before the Season 1 launch, and it's taking a sledgehammer to one of the biggest problems players have had with the game since launch.</p>
<p>The key change in question addresses weapon dispersion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">which has been throwing off player's shots ever since the game released earlier this month</a>. For those unaware, weapon dispersion refers to bullets spreading out from where you're aiming when you look down sights. Players have been taking shots they feel <em>should</em> be hitting, only to see them miss the target, leading to frustration.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981737524255961272">According to the patch notes</a>, the patch will rework weapon dispersion as to: "better align accuracy and handling with each weapon's intended design and performance over range. These changes address cases where accuracy behaved inconsistently, such as dispersion not properly settling after sprinting, and bring overall firing behavior closer to the intended balance between precision, control, and weapon power."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-default-settings-may-be-throwing-off-your-aim-on-pc-heres-how-you-fix-it">PC players have been jumping into the in-game settings to help remedy this problem</a>, so here's hoping these tweaks leave the game in a good state when it comes to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">the shooting portion of this hugely popular FPS</a>.</p>
<p>The 1.1.1.0 update will also be improving core movement animations, improving lighting and visibility, overhauling the audio, updated the UI and HUD, and fixing a scattering of problems on some maps. There's also a massive list of smaller changes on the way, including the ability to leap uphill, and the ability to customise your parachute. Nice.</p><p>This update should hopefully place the game in a solid state ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-has-its-season-one-trailer-showing-new-weapons-maps-and-a-tactical-game-mode">Season One update</a>, which is bringing a new game mode, a new giant map, new weapons, a shiny new vehicle, and other additions to EA and Battlefield Studios' blockbuster military shooter.</p>
