Not only that, but we've also received official confirmation that zombies are back. But they're slightly different this time...</p>
<p>The zombies here are not completely mindless, but rather retain some of the attributes of their personalities when they were alive. This means you'll see zombies attempting to complete tasks like cleaning the environment, albeit in a completely deranged manner.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The showcase explains that careful observation of your enemies will allow you to either sneak around them or get the drop on them. If you're playing as Leon, you'll be able to parry attacks with a hatchet and execute brutal finishing moves while also picking up weapons dropped by the zombies. And yes, this includes a chainsaw. Grace's gameplay, meanwhile, is more akin to classic survival horror, placing emphasis on limited ammo.</p>
<p>Crafting also makes a return, and you'll actually need to extract blood from your fallen enemies to create specialised injectors. The description for one of these says "Prevents corpses from mutating", so it seems reasonable to assume that we might see some enemies similar to the Crimson Heads from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> remake.</p>
<p>The showcase also revealed three default difficulty levels for Requiem. Casual will add in auto-aiming to allow newcomers to ease into the experience, while Standard comes in both Modern and Classic forms. The latter brings back the Ink Ribbon items during Grace's gameplay, meaning your ability to save is finite. It's likely that a more difficult 'Hardcore' option will be available upon completion of the main game, but this wasn't mentioned.</p>
<p>It was also reiterated that you can change between first and third-person perspectives at any time during gameplay. Meanwhile, a Requiem Pro Controller will launch for the Switch 2 alongside the game next month, while amiibo will also arrive later in the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE">Hardware Unboxed</a> reported that Asus is winding down production of its RTX 5070 Ti, saying, Asus “explicitly told us this model is currently facing a supply shortage and, as such, they have placed the model into end-of-life status.” They added that the same applies to Asus’s 16GB RTX 5060 Ti, and mentioned how retailers in Australia have had trouble sourcing the product.</p><p>Nvidia’s director of global public relations for GeForce, Ben Berraondo, confirmed in a statement to <em>The Verge</em> that it’s still producing these GPUs: “Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability.”</p><p>Hardware Unboxed specified <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxjULwwm0m16AH8zznJZ34D2OVVGWEl3Ub">in a follow-up post</a> that this only applies to Asus, and added, “Whether or not AIBs actually receive enough supply to justify continued production is another question. Asus don’t seem to think so.” Asus did not immediately respond to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>This may not be the case for all manufacturers. For instance, PNY public relations representative Michael Farino confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that the Dual-Slot Slim (DSS) RTX 5070 Ti, <a href="https://www.pny.com/company/press-center/pny-press-releases/pny-announces-new-dual-slot-slim-models-for-nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series">which was just announced at CES</a>, is still on track to “start shipping [in] February, and will be at all the usual retail suspects,” including Best Buy, Micro Center, and Amazon.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s not surprising to see constraints hitting the more affordable versions of 50-series GPUs first. Christopher Moore, Micron’s VP of marketing, mobile and client business unit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">said to <em>Wccftech</em></a> last week that “What we’re doing now is trying to run as few pieces of silicon as possible to max out, few differentiated DIDs as possible to max out the output… We’re saying, you know, I know you used to wanna go from 12 gigabyte to 16 gigabyte, or 16 gigabyte to 24 gigabyte. Those changes actually drop our output. So we’re working with them to try and get our demand as steady as possible so that we can get our supply as steady as possible and maximize the output.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/863000/asus-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-5060-ti-supply-rumors]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lenny Kravitz has commented on the inspiration for his character in 007: First Light and has given some insight into the recording process.</p>



<p>In December 2025, IO Interactive confirmed that Lenny Kravitz would voice one of the game’s main villains, an exclusive character named Bawma. The Grammy award-winning artist is now providing some insight into his inspiration for the role and the process of recording lines for the character.</p>







<h2 id="h-lenny-kravitz-pulls-the-curtain-back-on-bawma">Lenny Kravitz Pulls The Curtain Back On Bawma</h2>



<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8M3Xc-RBv-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During an interview with IGN,</a> Kravitz explained that some of the inspiration for the character came from some of the people he grew up around.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I grew up in the Bahamas as well as New York City. There were guys that had that vibe and that were doing things in the islands that I’d known, so I had a little bit of reference,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revealed that he did not have the opportunity to record lines alongside the rest of the cast. Instead, he just had the direction from those leading the project.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I hadn’t seen any other footage or heard any other voice-overs. So it was really sort of just in the dark, you know? They know, thus the director knowing kind of what he wants, because they know the balance, they know what all the other people are doing. I didn’t get to hear that.”</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[I'm Not That Nicole Carpenter]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/nicole-carpenter-modern-newsstand-mcclatchy-mystery-byline/</link>
            <guid>1407673</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On Jan. 7, I received an email from a Royal Caribbean International communications person asking for a correction to a story. The request said that I had used an image of Royal Caribbean's Liberty of the Seas cruiseliner in a story about a death on the Carnival Horizon ship, and asked if I could replace the image given that Royal Caribbean wasn't involved. A fair ask, for sure, but not something I could help with: The story was one I didn’t write, on a website I don’t write for.</p><p>When I clicked the link included in the email, I was surprised to see the byline was indeed Nicole Carpenter. The story appeared on MSN, Microsoft’s news aggregator, but was connected with the Tri City Herald, a McClatchy publication. There was no link to see what else Nicole Carpenter had written, nor was there a contact email attached. Just a note at the bottom: "This story was reported by content partner Modern Newsstand LLC."</p><p>I am somewhat familiar with the other Nicole Carpenters of the world. I've looked at the various online profiles that come up when I've Googled myself. Besides Nicole Carpenter the reporter who covers the video game industry (me), there's Nicole Carpenter the actor, Nicole Carpenter the women's leadership advocate, Nicole Carpenter the realtor, Nicole Carpenter the beach volleyball player, Nicole Carpenter the pest control expert. It's typically me and Nicole Carpenter the actor who take up the majority of the space on Google's first page of results, at least when I search.&nbsp;</p><p>I was intrigued to learn that there was another Nicole Carpenter the journalist. But after spending the last week or so looking for her, I'm not sure whether Nicole Carpenter the other journalist is even real.&nbsp;</p><p>Modern Newsstand has no online presence, but a company of the same name is registered as an LLC in Delaware and was incorporated in 2024. I reached out to Justin Levine, who lists himself as the CEO of Modern Newsstand on LinkedIn, to tell him that I'd been contacted by a confused communications person. He responded in a LinkedIn message: "Yes, this has come to our attention. Given your success and prominence in the industry, we have advised our writer to update her byline, bio and contact info for greater distinction. We will either use a middle name or make further adjustments." I asked him to confirm that she's a real person, and he hasn't responded.</p><p>But in the days after I reached out to Levine and then to McClatchy's communications person, rather than update Nicole Carpenter’s byline, all of her stories were removed from MSN. The pages now read, "This story is unavailable," and not only has Nicole Carpenter not posted a news story since, but it seems like Modern Newsstand has stopped posting on MSN as well. I don't know if stories being removed is common with MSN-syndicated stories, because I've found other links that don't work. Some of Nicole Carpenter's stories remain on another syndication service, NewsBreak, and they're all the same as what <em>was</em> on MSN. I've reached out to Microsoft, which owns MSN, and they haven't responded.&nbsp;</p><p>While Nicole Carpenter’s MSN-syndicated stories are connected to the Tri City Herald and other McClatchy publications, none of them appear on the actual Tri City Herald website, nor does her byline show up there. I reached out to McClatchy on Jan. 7, after the Royal Caribbean communications person emailed me. On Jan. 15, I got a response from McClatchy chief revenue officer Tony Berg. Berg didn't have much information about the Modern Newsstand operation, but he confirmed that McClatchy had a deal with the company to post content, tied to its brands, to syndication platforms like MSN and NewsBreak, and that McClatchy gets paid per views on those syndication platforms. He said that McClatchy had no control over the stories. (Previously a McClatchy spokesperson, in an email acquired by Aftermath, had said the stories were "produced by Modern Newsstand but reviewed by McClatchy editors.")&nbsp;</p><p>Berg also told me that in the past week or so McClatchy had stopped working with Modern Newsstand and that it's no longer a vendor of the media company. "We have no tolerance for people that are not following policies of what our vendor agreements are, and in this case, that was not being done," Berg told me.&nbsp;</p><p>Berg didn’t say what policies Modern Newsstand didn’t adhere to. And I’m not sure whether McClatchy learned of the issue through my email or had concerns previously. I asked Berg if Modern Newsstand used artificial intelligence to write the stories, and he said he didn’t know and said I'd have to ask Modern Newsstand. Berg said McClatchy didn't remove the stories from MSN, because the company has no control over the stuff that's published there.</p><p>There seems to be a small stable of bylines under Modern Newsstand, and the majority of them have the names of other verifiable journalists. I haven’t been able to find a profile or portfolio using any of those names that list Modern Newsstand, and I didn’t receive a reply from any of the verifiable journalists who shared names with Modern Newsstand writers who I reached out to. At the same time, many of the Modern Newsstand names are ones that are at least somewhat common, making it hard to tell whether this overlap is intentional. Many Modern Newsstand stories are still available on MSN; it's largely the Nicole Carpenter ones that have gone entirely missing. No new stories were published this week, however, which makes sense, since McClatchy cut ties.&nbsp;</p><p>The stories that Nicole Carpenter and the other Modern Newsstand journalists wrote are largely about national politics. They're very short, and always based on another publication's work with no backlinks to the source. They make heavy use of quotes, which sometimes comprise the majority of the story. They're not particularly well-written or interesting, though some of them get a ton of comments on MSN and NewsBreak. I haven't noticed any egregious errors, but I did find a user on Bluesky who had reached out to McClatchy after claiming to spot an error in a Modern Newsstand story that described Kamala Harris as the president, which they thought was weird, and possibly an AI mistake. (That story is no longer available to read.) They’re not the sort of stories I'd expect to see on reputable, local newspapers and publications.</p><p>I don't know a lot about what's going on here, but I do know that these are not stories I want associated with my byline. On MuckRack, which is a website that automatically makes portfolio pages for journalists, MSN is listed under my "As seen in" section, which might cause someone to think I wrote those stories. However, some of my actual stories have also been syndicated on MSN, through Polygon.&nbsp;</p><p>At best, this is all a very weird misunderstanding, and there's simply another journalist named Nicole Carpenter who has no online presence whatsoever, and works for a very mysterious content provider. At worst, Modern Newsstand is using the names of verifiable journalists to make its work look trustworthy. Somewhere in the middle, Modern Newsstand chose random pseudonyms to publish some of its stories under, one of which happened to be the same name as mine. And if, for some reason, Modern Newsstand chose to use my name, why? I don't cover national politics, unless they relate, somehow, to the video game industry. I'm not particularly well-known outside of my own beat. It doesn't make sense. (Nicole Carpenter the other journalist, if you are real and reading this, I'm sorry I said your work isn't particularly well-written.)</p><p>While I still can’t say for sure what’s going on here, the whole strange situation feels like it highlights the ways it’s harder than ever to know what news sources to trust. And while there’s no indication that Modern Newsstand’s stories are created by AI, I definitely wondered. McClatchy itself has <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/12/23/80385841/the-mcclatchy-news-group-is-pushing-ai-their-union-is-pushing-back?ref=aftermath.site"><u>been accused of using artificial intelligence</u></a> to create curated listicles summarizing McClatchy stories, which its union is pushing back on. Earlier this month, the day I got the correction request, media publication <a href="https://www.status.news/p/mcclatchy-newspapers-ai-reporting-policy?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Status reported</u></a> on a meeting with McClatchy leadership and the union in which the company "blindsided" the journalists with "the company's desire to aggressively integrate artificial intelligence into its workflow."&nbsp;</p><p>I still have a lot of questions, so if you know anything more about Modern Newsstand, please reach out. It’s hard not to look at this whole situation and just long for a human journalist, with a byline and photo, writing an article at a real outlet. It's a bad time out there for real journalists.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>GDC Awards</strong>, similar to the<a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/"> <strong>DICE Awards</strong></a>, are an awards show voted on entirely by game developers and industry professionals. Also similar to the DICE Awards, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">every other major</a> video game-related <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">awards show for that matter</a>, is the fact that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></strong> leads the pack with the most nominations, including a nomination for <strong>Game of the Year</strong>.</p>



<p>In fact, Clair Obscur is nominated in almost every single category included in the GDC Awards. To be fair, it's not a grand list of 20+ categories; there are only <strong>nine</strong> categories included in the GDC Awards. That said, Clair Obscur has been nominated in eight of those nine categories, which is still impressive, and a sign of just how much respect and adoration people inside the industry have for the game.</p>



<p>Out of the nine categories, the only nomination Clair Obscur is missing is a nod in the Social Impact category. As for other games that got multiple nominations, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">Ghost of Yōtei</a></strong> runs just behind Clair Obscur with five nominations, while <strong>Blue Prince</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a></strong> all have four nominations. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></strong> and <strong>Dispatch</strong> both walked away with three nominations.</p>



<p>What is different about the GDC Awards compared to other shows is that it lists Honourable Mentions for each category alongside the nominees. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> didn't receive a single nomination, but it did get three honourable mentions. </p>



<p>The GDC Awards will take place on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> and will be the day after the IGF Awards, unlike previous years, where both shows would take place on the same day during GDC.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of nominees, and the honourable mentions for each category:</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-update-switch-2-difficulty-2000660271</link>
            <guid>1407640</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Almost five years after <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> brought the game to PlayStation 5, that version of the game is getting a free new update that will add a new “streamlined” mode to the game for people who just want to enjoy the story. This patch will arrive on January 22, just in time for the RPG’s launch on <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p> <p>“To celebrate <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday,” Square Enix announced on January 15. “This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage!” Now every attack can be an Omnislash and you won’t even have to spend over 500 hours <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-player-hits-level-99-in-the-first-rea-1794171766">grinding at the first reactor to make it happen</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">To celebrate Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday.</p> <p>This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage! <a href="https://t.co/XMuEdhreTP">pic.twitter.com/XMuEdhreTP</a></p> <p>— FINAL FANTASY VII (@finalfantasyvii) <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2011740264772305213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The previously teased Streamlined Progression mode is effectively a story mode for people who want to follow Cloud and his Avalanche pals in their journey through Midgar to topple Shinra without having to deal with all of the difficulty that might come from combat, and especially certain boss encounters. Instead of toggling the game to easy, players can make it so their characters are already maxed out and hitting for the most damage possible.</p>

 <p>While included at launch in the new ports, the patch will let existing players on PC and PS5 play around with the mode as well. Could it be an easy way to clear the game on hard for the Platinum trophy? Maybe! And for newcomers it’s worth noting that anyone who buys the game digitally before the end of the month will automatically get the digital version of the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> along with it.</p>

                <p>We're called GameSpot, so we clearly love to play some video games. You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900725003685?via%3Dihub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal</a> and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-reveals-hours-video-games-week.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported on by Medical Xpress</a>, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects "excessive gaming" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that "high gamers"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.</p><p>"What stood out was students gaming up to 10 hours a week all looked very similar in terms of diet, sleep, and body weight," Siervo said. "The real differences emerged in those gaming more than 10 hours a week, who showed clear divergence from the rest of the sample."</p><p>(It's worth noting that 317 students across five universities in one country is an incredibly small sample size.)</p><p>Alongside "high gamers" (10+ hours per week), the researchers split the participants into "low gamers" (0–5 hours per week) and "moderate gamers" (5–10 hours), depending on the self-reported amount of time they spent playing video games. In these categories, the researchers found that high gamers experienced a decline in diet quality and an increase in obesity when compared to low and moderate gamers. For example, according to the study, high gamers had a median body mass index (BMI) of 26.3 kg/m2 (generally considered overweight), compared to 22.2 kg/m2 and 22.8 kg/m2 (generally considered normal or healthy weight ranges) for low and moderate gamers, respectively.</p><p>Additionally, while all three groups reported generally poor sleep quality, moderate and high gamers scored worse here than low gamers, with their hours spent gaming being a significant disruptor to the quality of their sleep.</p><p>"Each additional hour of gaming per week was linked to a decline in diet quality, even after accounting for stress, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors," Siervo explained in the findings. "This study doesn't prove gaming causes these issues, but it shows a clear pattern that excessive gaming may be linked to an increase in health risk factors. Our data suggests low and moderate gaming is generally fine, but excessive gaming may crowd out healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, sleeping properly, and staying active."</p><p>It's not all bad, though. Siervo said that there's hope for young people whose college habits may carry over into their adulthood: change their behavior before the habit becomes an identity.</p><p>"Because university habits often follow people into adulthood," Siervo said. "Healthier routines such as taking breaks from gaming, avoiding playing games late at night, and choosing healthier snacks may help improve their overall well-being."</p><p>As for the rest of us? Well, the jury's still out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Remote Work Is Part of the Reason for Recent Game Delays’, Says Ex Tripwire CEO: ‘People Are Often Less Efficient and Creative at Home’]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ex-tripwire-ceo-remote-work-game-delays/</link>
            <guid>1407616</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the second chapter of my report from the long chat I had with former <strong>Tripwire Interactive</strong> CEO <strong>John Gibson</strong>, the owner and founder of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Templar Media</a></strong> shared his opinion on the recent game delays and industry-wide layoffs. Both were, in essence, caused by COVID-19: the pandemic practically cracked the door wide open for remote work, which Gibson believes makes people less efficient and creative, and also sparked a massive hiring spree and inflated salaries, which are only now being readjusted. <span>Regarding game delays, Gibson specifically mentioned&nbsp;<strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>, which he said took <strong>5 years to make</strong> (and received</span> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/killing-floor-3-review/">a mixed reception when it launched last July</a>).</p>



<p><em>The industry faced a "video game apocalypse" in 2023 and 2024 as things collapsed following the pandemic boom. Games were not always of high quality or were taking much longer to develop. For instance, the sequel to Killing Floor 2 took five years to make. I believe part of the reason for these game delays is remote work. While working from home feels great, people are often less efficient and less creative. Some of the greatest ideas in the games I have worked on came from random encounters in the hallway. Two people might have different parts of a great idea, chat in the hallway, and create a whole concept for the game. As part of this acquisition, the core team on Gate Zero is relocating to our offices in Georgia. Having everyone in the office will allow us to iterate quickly to finish the game. This business decision will result in a more entertaining and fun game for the player.</em></p>



<p><em>Another challenge was overinflated salaries during the pandemic. Companies with high COVID-era profits were overpaying for talent. For instance, an engineer might be offered a million dollars for their first year. This was unsustainable, and many of those companies eventually conducted massive layoffs. There is now a reset occurring where people must readjust their salary expectations to fair, sustainable levels.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, in the first chapter, the ex co-founder and CEO of Tripwire shared his '<strong>Entertainment First</strong>' vision for games (and movies and TV) that <strong>focus on fun instead of any specific agendas</strong>. In the full interview, you'll also learn a lot more about <strong>Gate Zero</strong>, the upcoming game based on the <strong>Bible</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie’s Latest Marathon Deep Dive Shows Off the Seven Runner Shells Classes, New Gameplay Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-deep-dive-runner-shells-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>1407613</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie</strong> has debuted its latest deep dive into <strong>Marathon</strong> with a new 'Developer Insights' video, which details all seven of the different Runner Shells, which essentially act as the classes that players will be able to choose from, each with their own abilities and skills and strengths for different playstyles.</p>



<p>The seven different Runner Shells include six that could be considered the 'main' classes players can choose from, which are: Destroyer, Assassin, Recon, Vandal, Thief, and Triage. The seventh shell, Rook, is a solo-queue-only class that lets you jump into ongoing matches, grab a bit of loot, and get out with a free loadout you don't risk at all. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev-insights-runner-shells-new-video">A blog post shared alongside the video</a> also digs into the difference between <strong>Cores </strong>and <strong>Implants</strong>. Both are mechanics that give you a boost in the middle of a match, with the difference being that Implants can be used by any Shell, whereas to use a Core, you'll have to find the Core that is made to be used with your specific Runner Shell.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon Developer Insights | Runner Shells" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFzR8bN13FA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It also digs into the buildcrafting you can do with the different Runner Shells, and how you can push each of their abilities further by leaning into different cores and implants. "<em>For example, with Vandal you can lean into a mobility build, with powerful map traversal and repositioning. Equip cores that turn your double jump into a triple jump, and implants that increase your base movement speed, jump height, and improve your heat capacity</em>," the blog post reads.</p>



<p>One thing not included in today's video is a release date or even a release window, as to when we can expect to see Marathon on shelves. Hopefully, we'll have that information sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>To say that Marathon has had a troubled development would be an understatement. The game's original <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">director was fired on misconduct allegations</a>, Bungie has suffe<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/">red several layoffs during its development</a>, press around the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/">has been consistently negative with rumors of internal issues</a>, and it went through <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">a massive plagiarism scandal</a> that only <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed the game further</a>.</p>



<p>Today's gameplay of the seven Runner Shells is honestly the best the game has ever looked, as it actually seems to be taking the shape of the kind of extraction-hero-shooter it's going for. Hopefully, it'll be able to stick the landing when it does arrive. If Bungie doesn't get a clear-cut win soon, it may be in for some even more dark days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Because </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veryimportant.lawyer/post/3lybxlwzjuc2h"><span>everyone on the internet is 12 years old</span></a><span>, the current American administration is posting through its fascist agenda with memes. Trump’s White House has previously used </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokemon</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a><span>, and even pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sabrina-carpenter-ice-video-juno-song-response-trump-2000649672"><span>Sabrina Carpenter’s music</span></a><span> to try to recruit people for ICE. Now, it’s using an AI mockup of beloved farming sim </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>to promote the return of whole milk to school lunches.</span></p> <p><span>On January 14, Trump signed a law that will </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/whole-milk-school-lunches-trump-5572176286b322d844bb76d52906e2c7"><span>return whole milk to school lunches</span></a><span>, This is overturning an Obama-era restriction on higher-fat milk options. Alright, whatever. On a list of things Trump has done in his years in office, that’s hardly the worst. But now, the White House has used this as another opportunity to use a video game’s imagery.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whole milk is back. 🥛 <a href="https://t.co/kHf51s5qwX">pic.twitter.com/kHf51s5qwX</a></p> <p>— The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/2011864079053238516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>At a glance, it might not look like much. The AI-generated image has an ugly faux-pixel-art sprite of Trump looking like he got hit in the face with a frying pan, his inventory has a bunch of the things you’d expect like a MAGA hat and a cop badge, and he’s shown saying, “We’re bringing back Whole Milk and Making America Healthy Again.” But also, if you look at the gold he’s carrying in the screenshot, the number is 45464748.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Trump is the 45th and 47th president of the United States, and has held onto the debunked claims that he won the presidency against Joe Biden in 2020. He has also publicly said he’s </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752"><span>open to a third term</span></a><span>, which would be in </span><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxii"><span>violation of the 22nd amendment</span></a><span>, but Trump doesn’t seem to think the law applies to him. Steve Bannon, the ex-chief-strategist of the Trump administration, has also said that Trump </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/president-trump-2028-steve-bannon.html"><span>will have a third term</span></a><span>, while also </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/10/steve-bannon-2028-campaign-maga"><span>reportedly planning to run himself</span></a><span>. So these numbers seem to be a thinly veiled threat that Trump wants to be president again in 2028.</span></p>

 <p><span>We’ve reached out to </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>developer Concerned Ape for comment on this story and will update it if we hear back.</span></p>

Collect and craft weapons, items, engage in tense soulslike combat against fearsome foes, upgrade their character and personal homestead, and play their part in an epic tale of bloodshed and bravery.

</section></header><section>

<p>Believe it or not, <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong> is celebrating his 35th anniversary in 2026, and Sega is clearly planning something as it dropped a nostalgia blast of a trailer celebrating the blue blur's life and times.</p>
<p>The trailer highlights the range of Sonic over the franchise's storied history, from his pixel perfect start on the Mega Drive with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, to blockbuster movies in Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy.</p>
<p>He's done everything you can think of — LEGO Sonic, the animated series <strong>Sonic X</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, and obviously tons and tons of his own video games. So 2026 should be a big year for Sega and Sonic.</p>
<p>"For over three decades, Sonic has raced through generations and inspired fans with his unmatched speed, unstoppable energy and fearless spirit" Sega says on the <a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog?tab=35th-anniversary">newly-opened 35th anniversary website</a>. "Now, it’s time to honor his incredible journey and celebrate the blue blur’s countless adventures."</p>

<p>Additionally, Sega / Atlus' brand marketing vice president Marcella Churchill shared in a press release that “This milestone is not just a reflection of our past, but also a look toward the future as we continue to innovate and grow."</p>
<p>Sega will be revealing partnerships, collectibles, fan experiences, and more throughout the year. We hope there might be a game announcement in there, too.</p>
<p>21st June 2026 will be the official day of Sonic's 35th anniversary, but we're sure we'll hear a lot about Sega's iconic character over the coming months.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-amazon-tv-show-reality-vault-shelter-2000660254</link>
            <guid>1407559</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876">which is currently in the middle of season two</a>, has been a big hit for the tech giant. Now it seems to be doubling down on the franchise with a <em>Fallout</em>-themed reality show, which is currently looking for contestants.</p> <p>While Amazon hasn’t yet put out a teaser trailer for any <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-fallout-games-3-4-5-76-bethesda-rpg-new-vegas-611408965/2"><em>Fallout</em></a> reality show, <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">it is starting to look for cast members via a casting website</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/amazon-has-greenlit-a-fallout-reality-show-where-contestants-live-in-a-vault-for-a-huge-cash-prize/"><em>VGC</em></a>. The site has a big banner image that asks people if they have what it takes to “win a big cash prize.” The reality show, which currently has a working title of “Fallout Shelter,” will force a group of people to live together in a vault and will test their skills via different activities and competitions.</p>

 <p>Here’s how the site describes the show:</p> <blockquote><p>Fallout Shelter (working title) is a new reality competition series based on the hit Amazon drama and computer game of the same name. The dwellers (contestants) live together in a top-secret vault, where they will compete in a series of games that tests the seven core attributes from the Fallout world. Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck (S.P.E.C.I.A.L). The series will not only test dwellers’ core attributes, but also their loyalty and alliances. It’s a game of power dynamics, popularity and social strategy which will ultimately result in a huge cash prize, but do you have what it takes to be the most S.P.E.C.I.A.L.?</p></blockquote> <p>The site features a series of questions for folks who are interested in being a part of the reality show, including questions that ask people to rank how smart they are or how agile they might be on a scale of one to ten. So it sounds like contestants may provide Amazon and the producers with their own S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats that could be referenced in the production.</p>

 <p>Honestly, this just sounds like Amazon trying to make a<em> Big Brother</em> knock-off, but using <em>Fallout</em> to lure in gamers who might not watch otherwise. As someone who enjoys some Survivor and <em>Big Brother</em> from time to time and who also likes <em>Fallout</em>, I’ll check this show out whenever it finally arrives. They should probably pick a different name, though, <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-cant-stop-playing-fallout-shelter-1711784648">as <em>Fallout Shelter</em> is already a thing</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2012, SYBO launched the mobile sensation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subway-surfers/" data-ref-id="5000-142654">Subway Surfers</a>. That game went on to become one of most downloaded mobile titles of all time. Now, the sequel, Subway Surfers City, is set to launch next month on mobile devices.</p><p>The announcement of the game's release date was accompanied by a cinematic trailer that shows off the world of Subway Surfers City.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-3sDXTaiEY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o-3sDXTaiEY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This endless runner takes place in Subway City across four unlockable neighborhoods: The Docks, Southline, Sunrise Blvd, and Delorean Park. New neighborhoods will be added each season, alongside additional characters, outfits, and hoverboards. Players will also be given new abilities, including a stomp move, and a bubblegum shield that can enhance jumps. There are also three new game modes:</p><p><strong>Classic Endless</strong>: The beloved fast-paced runner experience where players chase high scores and discover new paths, even on their thousandth run.</p><p><strong>City Tour</strong>: A new finite game mode where players progress through levels with distinct goals, exploring districts to find hidden stars and complete missions.</p><p><strong>Events</strong>: A rotation of finite runs and trials designed to challenge even the most advanced players’ skills.</p><p>"At its core, Subway Surfers City is the next chapter of Subway Surfers' nearly 15-year-long legacy," said SYBO CEO Mathias Gredal Nørvig in a statement. "Subway Surfers continues to experience remarkable success year after year, and we're thrilled to now provide players with an entirely new way to interact with the IP."</p><p>Subway Surfers City will be released on February 26, and interested players can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbURMT29pVVBJY0R4MnpwUi1CNnFiYTdqWG5JZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsaVlNN0lhWjZxYTUwX3BtZkNTdU5aODMxN3BYX0VXR1BsUm5TSERVQzhfZngxdzR6NW9EOTRaZlUxcTNiOV9ST1VBMUFlOHIwM2lKNDRpRWZrYUJjc3J0ckF5NUhXaEdrR2NITExDbm9melQ5a2Jsaw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsubwaysurferscity.sng.link%2FDv4d0%2Fntk1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preregister on the game's official site</a>.</p>

                <p>The boss of digital PC storefront GOG has weighed in on the conversation around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/" data-ref-id="5000-465528">Anthem</a>'s demise, saying that there may be a future in which fewer games could be developed and published if regulators demand that creators keep them alive forever.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer on January 15</a> after Anthem was laid to rest, GOG's managing director, Maciej Gołębiewski, said it's good that the discussion around game preservation is happening once again, but that the conversation gets a little tricky when talking about games that were designed as online-only experiences.</p><p>"There is a broader discussion to be had within the industry of what does an end-of-life cycle look like in games--what is a fair end-of-life cycle for a game?" he said. "Should it just be buried and killed and no one can access it any more, and people who spent five or seven years working on it cannot really look at their creation any more because the service turned off? There is a very interesting and very complicated discussion that Stop Killing Games probably kick-started out of frustration."</p><p>Referencing the lobbying group <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lobbying-group-says-stop-killing-games-petition-would-make-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create/1100-6532989/" data-ref-id="1100-6532989">Stop Killing Games</a>, which was formed in April 2024 in response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-crew/" data-ref-id="5000-183626">The Crew</a>'s delisting, Gołębiewski said regulation sounds like a good idea in the short term, but any statutes around game preservation--particularly regarding live-service games, which are becoming the norm these days--could potentially have adverse effects in the long term.</p><p>"We want to make games live forever," he said. "At the same time, if we put too many barriers on game creators and what the end-of-life cycle looks like, we might get fewer games, because people will be scared of, 'Okay, now I need to put up the funds to create it, promote it, and then upkeep it for 10 years, 20 years, because the regulator said so.' That might in turn cause there to be fewer cool games for gamers. I don't have the perfect answer yet, but it's good that the discussion is taking place."</p><p>As of January 12, developer BioWare's pretty-cool-but-ill-fated Iron Man-esque action-RPG is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-the-final-countdown-for-anthem-with-only-one-week-left-to-play/1100-6537170/" data-ref-id="1100-6537170">no longer playable</a>. With Anthem being an online-only multiplayer game, you can't boot up and fly around in the world of Coda now that publisher EA has pulled the server's plug. It's a bummer of a situation, and a blatant reminder that no game lasts forever, something <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-a-video-game-allowed-to-die/1100-6533393/" data-ref-id="1100-6533393">GameSpot examined in a July 2025 feature</a> when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-crew-is-delisted-servers-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-march-2024/1100-6519967/" data-ref-id="1100-6519967">Ubisoft took the online racer The Crew permanently off the track in March 2024</a>.</p><p>Gołębiewski's comments come as Amazon announced its 2021 MMORPG New World: Aeternum <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-big-mmo-that-started-strong-is-shutting-down/1100-6537436/" data-ref-id="1100-6537436">will get Thanos snapped from all platforms on January 31, 2027</a>. And if I can get personal for a second, this further heightens my fears that Full Circle's 2025 skating sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate/" data-ref-id="5000-514265">Skate</a> could get pulled offline forever in some future as well. Skate is still doing relatively well--with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3354750/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a consistent player count of approximately 3,500</a>, according to player tracker SteamDB--but you can't help but wonder just how long until Electronic Arts decides to hang the skateboard up.</p><p>In the end, as Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said in a July 2025 shareholders meeting about The Crew: "You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. Support for all games cannot last forever."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-delisted-go-offline-january-2027-amazon-game-studios/</link>
            <guid>1407529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After <strong>Amazon</strong> killed <strong>New World Aeternum</strong> by <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">cancelling new content for it, just as players were starting to return to the game</a>, it began putting the nails in New World's coffin today. First, by suddenly <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/">delisting the game</a></strong> as of today, <strong>January 15, 2026</strong>. Second, by announcing that the game will go <strong>offline on January 31, 2027.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect">A blog post on the official New World website</a> begins explaining the news by saying it wanted to "<em>provide transparency on where the game goes from here.</em>" Which, essentially, is nowhere. "<em></em><em>New World: Aeternum</em> will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027," reads the next line. </p>



<p>If you already have the game in your Steam library, then you'll still be able to play it for the remainder of this year, which Amazon previously promised would be the case. After December 31, 2026, though, you'll only have one more month to enjoy the MMORPG. If you don't have it in your library, then you've already missed your chance to grab it, as the purchase option has already been removed from the store page.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can still purchase microtransactions, if you want, until <strong>July 20, 2026</strong>; however, Amazon Game Studios has made it clear that <strong>refunds will not be available</strong> for Marks of Fortune microtransaction purchases. Amazon Game Studios will also still monitor the servers and release bug fixes for the remainder of the game's life.</p>



<p>New content for New World was shut down after Amazon Game Studios was hit with "<em>significant</em>" layoffs as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">Amazon's mass <strong>14,000+ company-wide</strong> layoff last year</a>. After the studio was clear that it wouldn't be making new content for New World, it was clear that the game would be shut down at some point, so this news isn't exactly surprising.</p>



<p>It is, however, still disappointing. Amazon had succeeded where others failed by being a major company not previously involved in video games, which entered the industry and actually knocked it out of the park with a successful internally-built game. New World was putting up <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-has-hit-100000-concurrent-players-regularly-since-launch-of-fresh-start-servers/">huge player numbers</a></strong>, and while it had previously fallen into a bit of a low period, just prior to the announcement that no more new content would be developed for it, players were starting to really return to the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion</em>," the blog post from Amazon Game Studios reads. "<em>We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It has been our pleasure to work on </em><em>New World: Aeternum</em> and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Replaces Its Employee Library With AI ‘Learning Experiences’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-library-ai-copilot-errors-2000660247</link>
            <guid>1407517</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, Microsoft committed over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">$100 billion of new investment</a> toward AI. Part of that technological arms race has included training LLMs on <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/12/open-ai-microsoft-harvard-libraries-train-ai-models/">millions of books</a>, including some written 600 years ago. This year, Microsoft is paying back the favor by ditching its own employee library. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/862531/microsoft-library-closure-transition-changes-notepad"><em>The Verge</em> reports</a> that the company is closing it down and slashing news subscriptions in favor of “AI-powered learning experiences.”</p> <p>The onsite collection of books was allegedly so heavy, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200204-00/?p=103394">it once was blamed</a> for cracking the underground parking lot pillars that supported it. That library, now housed in building 92, will now be closed, according to <em>The Verge</em>. The company’s roughly 220,000 employees have also reportedly lost access to checking out digital copies of business books and accessing news publications like <em>The Information</em>.</p>

 <p>Instead of learning about the world through the considered words of other human beings, they will now be engaging with a “more modern, AI-powered learning experience through the Skilling Hub,” according to an FAQ sent to staff. “The Library closed as part of Microsoft’s move toward a more modern, connected learning experience through the Skilling Hub,” it reads. “We know this change affects a space many people valued.”</p>

 <p>Contrast that with what Microsoft recently said after it was revealed that UK police had <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/uk-police-apologise-to-parliament-after-admitting-a-major-and-controversial-policy-decision-was-based-on-ai-making-stuff-up/">relied on an AI hallucination</a> when making the controversial decision to ban fans from a certain soccer match. “Copilot combines information from multiple web sources into a single response with linked citations,” a spokesperson for the company told media outlets. “It informs users they are interacting with an AI system and encourages them to review the sources.” Remember, it’s not slop, it’s a “<a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473">bicycle for the mind</a>.”</p>

 <p>It’s unclear if Copilot will be the basis for these new “AI learning experiences” that employees are now being encouraged to utilize, or what other sources of information they will use to review them now that the library is shutting down. As the science fiction writer Ray Bradbury <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131103101724/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930312&amp;slug=1689996">once told the <em>Seattle Times</em></a> in Microsoft’s own backyard, “You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.”</p>

              <p>Anyone who has ever played&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> at any point in its 17 years of existence already has a head start when it comes to playing&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>. The two games are so similar that familiarity with one mostly sets you up for the other. However, this also means it can be easier to get tripped up by the smaller details that <em>are</em> different, those aspects of the cuboid survival game that aren’t quite where you might expect them to be. So to prepare you for the transition, here are 10 things I wish I’d known before I started.</p> <hr> <h2>Don’t look for&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> on Steam</h2> <p>In a bold move, developer Hypixel has chosen not to release <em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>on Steam, nor indeed Epic or GOG. The early access game is only available to buy <a href="https://hytale.com/">via the game’s own site</a>, and then only loads through the game’s own installed loader. Why? Because of the fall of man? Or perhaps to avoid paying the 30-percent tithes? I dunno, but it’s annoying to have yet another bespoke loader to clutter up your desktop. The game’s also not yet on console, although that’s planned for the future.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Before anything else, head for the Forgotten Temple Gateway</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000660212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660212"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660212">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The smartest thing to do at the start of a new game of <em>Hytale</em> is make your way to the Forgotten Temple Gateway. This is a magic portal under a ruined temple that will teleport you to the Forgotten Temple hub, a peaceful location in which you can register all the mobs you’ve encountered so far with a central statue. (As the game develops, it’ll also be the hub for a lot of new content.) Its location is marked on your compass at the top of the screen, and it should be pretty nearby. Every creature you meet for the first time, whether hostile or ambivalent, will send a blue spark called a Memory your way. The more of these you gather, the more unlocks you’ll get via the statue, gaining access to new craftable items on your workstations.</p>

 <hr> <h2>You get sticks from trees and bushes</h2> <p>I realize, out of context, that sounds like the stupidest piece of advice ever. “What next, John? You get bear shit from woods?” But the point here is in&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> sticks are crafted from wood blocks, and that’s&nbsp;<em>not</em> the case in&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>. The ingredient, vital for crafting rudimentary tools, arrows and torches, instead falls when chopping down trees and whacking bushes. And they fall plentifully! However, given the speed with which crossbows go through arrows, you’re going to want stack after stack after stack of them, so get used to punching down every bush you walk past. And talking of which…</p>

 <hr> <h2>Trees are affected by gravity</h2> <p>“And Popes are affected by Catholicism?” Yes, cleverclogs, but if you’ve played&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> you’ll be familiar with the oddity that has blocks magically float in place if you remove those between them and the ground. Not so in <em>Hytale</em>, meaning chopping down trees for trunks, which are then crafted into wooden blocks, and then in turn into vast amounts of other items in the game, is a much faster affair. Chop down the very lowest bit of the trunk, and then rest of the tree will come cascading down around you in its various bits and blocks, complete with trunks, sticks, and the all-important sap which is used for crafting torches, candles and other lighting.</p>

 <hr> <h2>You’re going to need a BIG house for crafting tables</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000660213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660213"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660213">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>When I built my first modest log cabin, it was with the expectation that I’d have a nice little crafting table, perhaps an anvil, and with enough room for some chests and eventually whatever&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>‘s equivalent of an enchanting table might be. Oh, poor sweet summer child that I am. I have since added two entire new&nbsp;<em>wings</em> to my home to fit in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-minecraft-hypixel-crafting-workbench-quests-2000660135">ridiculous array of different workbenches</a> you need to play the game. There are a total of eight workbenches that you’ll absolutely&nbsp;<em>need</em>, and then a further four more you can add, and most have a footprint three blocks wide and two blocks high. Why it’s like this is anyone’s guess, but plan ahead when building your starter home.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Put chests directly next to workbenches</h2> <p>One of the neatest elements of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> (and it’s somewhat damning that it’s a detail this granular) is that if you store items in a chest near to a workbench, the bench will source materials from the chests while you’re crafting. In <em>Minecraft</em> you need to have everything in your on-body inventory, which requires juggling items between chests before crafting. Here, you can keep the crafting materials you need the most often in nearby storage and do far less organizational drudgery. Those chests do need to be close, though. If they’re on the other side of the room the bench won’t recognize them.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Repair Kits let you fix tools and weapons on the fly</h2> <p><em>Hytale</em> doesn’t offer&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>‘s means of fixing a weakened weapon or tool via anvils, but instead through a bespoke Repair Kit. This is a craftable item that you can keep in your inventory, and then use to restore most of a tool’s durability while you’re out and about. This is especially helpful if your pickaxe breaks when you’re 40 blocks below ground and have lost the route you took to get down there. They don’t come cheap, however. While all you need to craft a Repair Kit is two Linen Scraps, one Light Leather, and one Iron Ingot, these are all items that you’ll only get from hard work. Leather comes from slain mobs, which must then be processed on your (very slow) Tanning Rack. Linen Scraps come from fallen enemies’ clothing. And Iron Ingots are iron you’ve put through your Furnace, and at this point are a bizarrely difficult resource to find. See the next tip for more on that.</p> <hr> <h2>Iron is hard to come by</h2> <p>You might think, given&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>‘s hierarchy of metals going Copper &gt; Iron &gt; Thorium &gt; Cobalt &gt; Adamantite &gt; Mithril, that iron would be reasonable simple to find. In&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, it’s pretty much the second ore you’ll ever find after coal, and sits pretty near the surface. Not so in&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>, where iron doesn’t start showing up until you’ve gone a&nbsp;<em>long</em> way underground, and then almost always in caverns packed with very tough enemies for such an early point in the game. I imagine this is something that will be balanced out in the near future, but for now know that you want to dig until you’re seeing lava, and then spot the silver glints in the ceiling and walls in areas that aren’t packed with foes. Grab as much as you can and get out fast.</p> <hr> <h2>You don’t drop&nbsp;<em>everything</em> when you die</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000660217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660217"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660217">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In another tweak to the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>formula, <em>Hytale</em> doesn’t strip your entire inventory when you die and respawn. Instead you keep about two-thirds of what you had when you conked it, which is pretty generous in comparison. (Only cowards play&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> with “Keep Inventory” toggled on.) The rest will drop where you died, and the game will put a death marker on the compass to direct you back there to scoop it all back up.</p>

 <hr> <h2>You can build teleporters to speed up travel</h2> <p>I wish this were possible a lot earlier, given the ordeal it is to craft. <em>Hytale</em>‘s world of Orbis is enormous, and while movement is pretty swift, if you’ve been out exploring other biomes it’ll still take you a fair amount of time to return to your current home without taking the death route. But there’s a way to make Teleporters, and leave as many as six of them in the world. (That number can reach 12 if you unlock enough Memories in the Forgotten Temple.)</p> <p>The first thing you need to do is upgrade your main workbench to level 2. That requires 20 Iron, which as mentioned above is the biggest obstacle, alongside 30 Copper (easily found everywhere) and 20 Linen Scrap (kill a bunch of humanoid enemies). That done, you can then craft the Arcanist’s Workbench, but this in turn is a hefty challenge. For this you’ll need 20 Essence of the Void (kill monsters at night for these), 30 Linen Scraps, and toughest of all, 10 Thorium Ingots. This requires you to travel to the Howling Sands biome (in what’s called Zone 2), so it’s not something you’ll be doing straight away.</p>

 <p>With&nbsp;<em>that</em> done, you then need the Teleporter ingredients too! For this you need Azure Logs, Azure Kelp and some regular stone. For that you need to find the blue Azure Forest biome and chop down some of those blue, blue trees.</p> <p>So yeah, quite the fuss. But once done, you’ve got a way to leap around Orbis like a mad wizard.</p>
