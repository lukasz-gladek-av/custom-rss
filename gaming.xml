<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12de2ea9b2e6a/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since its launch in 2018, the Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) has been a lightning rod for debate among players. Fans have argued over whether its two-tier price structure constitutes good value, questioned the quality of emulation — sometimes patchy at first with certain N64 games but steadily improved — and grumbled about the erratic release schedule for retro titles.</p>
<p>Game drops often feel random, and major titles, particularly from third parties, are still missing in action, which has fueled frustration with Nintendo’s approach. The deal has been sweetened over time, with a handful of paid DLCs bundled in and retro libraries gradually expanded. Today, I reckon many would concede that, overall, there’s a fair amount of bang for buck on offer.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jhxlyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Yet, there’s still a glaring shortcoming to NSO that’s too often unacknowledged: while access to Nintendo’s eShops and online services are region-free, many of the perks and benefits of an NSO subscription are effectively gated to players in a handful of major territories that Nintendo dubs "The Americas," "Europe," "Japan," and "Hong Kong/Taiwan/South Korea."</p>
<p>To access online play, gamers residing elsewhere have no option but to purchase an NSO subscription through another region's eShop, as there's no dedicated local eShop or online service. In Singapore, where I’m based, it’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/10879w4/accessing_eshop_from_singapore/">common for players</a> to set their Nintendo accounts to a different region, usually the United States, to access the eShop, which is what I do.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fb9e8a336fb62/nintendo-switch-2-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Crucially, you’ll need an NSO subscription to unlock certain exclusive perks, from physical rewards that can be redeemed with Platinum Points to hardware accessories like NES, SNES, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Nintendo 64, and GameCube controllers. The catch is that Nintendo won’t ship these items outside of the select territories where they are officially offered.</p>
<p>I’ve paid full price for NSO for nearly six years. I love having convenient access to an expanding library of Nintendo classics. But I’m getting <em>awfully salty</em> about being region-locked out of buying NSO-exclusive retro controllers directly from Nintendo’s site and not being able to access subscriber-exclusive apps like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a>, which aren’t on local app storefronts.</p>
<p>I’m embarrassed to admit that I’ve had to resort to eBay resellers to obtain NSO controllers, a punishing workaround for paying subscribers. It’s perplexing why Nintendo doesn’t offer these products through their official retail stores (for example, on Singapore’s major ecommerce platforms like <a href="https://shopee.sg/nintendo.officialstore">Shopee</a> and <a href="https://www.lazada.sg/shop/nintendo/">Lazada</a>) or at least allow for international shipping.</p>
<p>While part of me was tickled by Nintendo’s recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/icymi-if-you-want-to-play-virtual-boy-classics-youll-need-to-buy-one-of-nintendos-accessories">announcement</a> of bringing Virtual Boy to NSO, news that a subscriber-exclusive stereoscopic 3D peripheral (ranging from $99.99 / £66.99 for the replica, or $24.99 / £16.99 for the cheaper cardboard model) is <em>required</em> has my blood boiling, both for the paywalls and because Nintendo won’t sell <em>me</em> one outright.</p>
<figure><a title="Virtual Boy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db50cc05fa632/virtual-boy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other attempts to reap the rewards of my NSO subscription have been similarly vexing. On a recent trip to the United States, I attempted to redeem some goodies with my Platinum Points and have them mailed to a US address. But Nintendo wouldn't accept my foreign bank card to pay for local shipping. The same bank card is accepted on the US eShop, however.</p>
<p>As for smartphone apps, the Nintendo Switch App only recently went live in Singapore, but other offerings like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today</a> calendar and news app, as well as the aforementioned subscriber-exclusive Nintendo Music app, are missing in action. With a bit of tech skullduggery, though, it is possible to change regions and access those apps from foreign app stores.</p>
<p>It has to be acknowledged that Nintendo's policy regarding region-locking has shifted significantly for the better since the release of the Switch, the first time a primary console has been region-free. From the NES all the way through the Wii U, Nintendo's home consoles were region-locked, a policy also carried over to the entire Nintendo 3DS line of handhelds.</p>
<p>Still, as long as Nintendo is officially selling hardware and software outside of major territories while leaving online play tethered to a foreign NSO subscription, it should at least ensure that paying customers in those places receive equal access to the service’s touted ecosystem of physical rewards, smartphone apps, and hardware accessories.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83d65460b2570/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are signs that Nintendo is beginning to address the issue by opening new eShops, with Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-to-officially-launch-eshop-in-taiwan">Taiwan reportedly</a> due to get local eShops and, in theory, online services.</p>
<p>NSO has proven its worth over the years, steadily growing into a more compelling package as more retro titles become available, new consoles join the fold, and online play improves with services like GameChat. But clearly, the experience is not equal for all, and that’s something that Nintendo has to grapple with for the sake of its most engaged players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We know that RGG Studio is working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a> and a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">Virtua Fighter</a> title, and it's a fair assumption that there's a new Like a Dragon game on the horizon. As far as what else the studio might be working on, we have an <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-rgg-studio-rgg-summit-september-2025/">RGG Summit </a>to look forward to next week, but it seems like someone at SEGA or RGG Studio jumped the gun, accidentally revealing the next Yakuza game, as the RGG website showed a brief mention of Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p>



<p>The mention was spotted on the <a href="https://ryu-ga-gotoku.com/">studio's official site</a> and posted to <a href="https://x.com/tdkumon/status/1968278220245176605">X (formerly Twitter)</a> before being shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1njba80/rgg_website_accidentally_leaked_kiwami_3/">Reddit</a>, and though it was quickly taken down, it remained cached in Google, and could be seen by searching "龍が如く 極 3" site:http://ryu-ga-gotoku.com."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 are both remakes of Yakuza 1 and Yakuza 2, so it follows that Yakuza Kiwami 3 would be a remake of Yakuza 3. If this slip-up is indeed real, then on top of expecting more looks at Stranger Than Heaven, Virtua Fighter, and the next Like a Dragon game, we can add an official Kiwami 3 reveal to the list for next week's RGG Summit and Tokyo Game Show 2025.</p>



<p>Last year, RGG Studio's series director for Yakuza, Masayoshi Yokoyama, hinted that <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-next-entry-auditions-kiwami-3-not-next-someday/">Yakuza Kiwami 3 might happen "<em>someday</em>."</a> It seems like 'someday' is coming sooner than we might've thought.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/dispatch-is-episodic-workplace-comedy-first-iterating-where-telltale-refused-to</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-is-an-episodic-workplace-comedy-first-iterating-where-telltale-refused-to-interview-with-adhoc-studios.1300422/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year at The Game Awards, we got to see the reveal of <em>Dispatch</em>, a new title from AdHoc Studio, a development company created by alumni of Telltale Games. This comedic adventure game has players take on the role of Robert Robertson, a former superhero, working at a Superhero Dispatch company with a team of villains to rehabilitate.</p>

<p>TechRaptor got to sit down last week to not only see a bit more of <em>Dispatch</em>, getting walked through an extended segment of the game, but we also had a chance to sit down with the team at AdHoc and learn more about <em>Dispatch's </em>story, episodic release, and what they learned when fans got their hands on the demo.</p>




<p>The gameplay I got to see encompassed a lot of what you'd know from your time playing the demo. Robert Robertson, as the superhero Mechaman, had his armor damaged beyond repair, forcing him to retire from superheroing. Just when he thought he was out of options, the Superhero Dispatch Network reached out with an offer: Mentor a group of villains on their road to rehabilitation by dispatching them to emergencies, and the agency will help rebuild the Mechaman armor so Robertson can return to being a hero.</p>

<p>Gameplay is a mix of the classic 'Telltale Games-style' choose your own dialogue adventure with logic puzzles in the form of assigning the right rehabilitated villains to rescue jobs that are best for them and hacking mini-games for when Robertson needs to provide additional support.</p>

<h2><em>Dispatch </em>Was Created From the Ashes of a Live-Action Project</h2>

<p>Learning more about the story of <em>Dispatch </em>and getting to see additional gameplay, it was clear that while set in the world of superheroes that the focus of the story is in the relationships that Robertson makes with those he works with, inside the dispatch office and out.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-mechaman.jpg?itok=1D2J3z2H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-mechaman.jpg?itok=Shvgc0yk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Talking on the origins of the story for <em>Dispatch</em>, it was explained that initially parts of the team that eventually became AdHoc took work with a company that was trying to make interactive live action.</p>

<p>"We were like 'Hey, we're writers and directors who have done this in the digital space, let's do it.' The goal was to make something universally appealing, so we grabbed superheroes and went with it. We worked on that for about a year and a half, and we were getting ready to shoot with actors and sets and all the real stuff you do in Hollywood, and that was March of 2020," said Nick Herman, Co-Founder at AdHoc Studios..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"All our dreams of being Hollywood directors and writers were dashed…" - Herman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These ideas continued to be worked on and were developed internally, becoming what we've seen now as <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

<p>Another inspiration for <em>Dispatch </em>that was brought up was a series of ESPN commercials set in a regular office space where the Florida Dolphins mascot might be pouring itself a coffee or filing paperwork.</p>

<p>"The visual of that you immediately get, it's boring but then this bright-colored thing is weird and evocative and is a platform for a lot of jokes," said Herman</p>

<p>For the team developing the story, the theme of superheroes was treated in the same way as they used to handle IP. It was their job to take that concept and find the gold in it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-villains.jpg?itok=zDappJOi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-villains.jpg?itok=fsnME-Tc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"There's a lot of people out here who have been doing superhero stories for a long time, a lot have great ideas, and we're not interested in competing in that realm of multiverses and universe-ending storylines," added Dennis Lenart, another Co-Founder.</p>

<p>Once the idea of <em>Dispatch </em>had been created, it was time to find the voices behind the characters. With a mix of movie stars, voice actors, and internet personalities, there's a unique blend of talent backing up these characters. AdHoc explained that it started with Aaron Paul.</p>

<p>"We knew we wanted a mixture of talent from different spheres. We started with the hardest role first: Robert, our lead. We had Aaron Paul at the top of our list. With the help and talent of our casting director Linda Lamontagne we were able to get him excited about the project," said Natalie Herman, Lead Producer.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, he connected with the material, and from there it was a lot easier to get other folks excited about the project. We looked for people who were going to bring themselves to the characters and really expand on that more than we could ever think of,"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-cast.jpg?itok=qg0kSXtr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-cast.jpg?itok=WUckPGvH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I got walked through how some of the characters evolved as they went from their early production state with table reads from the crew, to how an actor giving their take on a role allowed the character to grow and change. Robertson had originally been older, but after hearing Paul read for him they went back and not only changed the delivery of the lines but altered his look to match a younger approach.</p>

<h2><em>Dispatch </em>Is Learning From What Held Telltale Back</h2>

<p>An interesting aspect of my discussion with the AdHoc team was how honest they were about the approach to development highs and lows during their time with Telltale Games. There were strengths in the engine but that also came with a rigidity in where they didn't want to step outside a safe zone.</p>

<p>In asking how fans of Telltale Games might be surprised approaching <em>Dispatch</em>, Lenart said,, "definitely the animation, it was one of the core things from the very beginning. Working on some of the games we've worked in the past, there's sometimes you know a friend will enjoy a game and then they play it and they can't get past the graphics."</p>

<p>For <em>Dispatch </em>they wanted to create a game where they could remove that barrier to entry.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-hero-select.jpg?itok=ocAy4q1q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-hero-select.jpg?itok=sLLdu6pr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"The other shocking piece is that we tried to be deliberate with the gameplay. We wanted it to be tailored to the experience," said Nick Herman. "There are a lot of people who love Telltale Games when you can explore the world and the characters say jokes, but we wanted to switch up the formula and not have the same shackles that Telltale had. Mostly technical, but also some creative."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If you're a fan of Telltale Games you should like this if you're not averse to other kinds of gameplay"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Fan Feedback Taught AdHoc the Internet Will Have a Crush on Everyone</h2>

<p>When asked about the fan reaction, it seemed like the whole team breathed a sigh of relief. Nick Herman confirmed, "We're definitely excited that other folks are excited because this has been a thing that we've had in our life for years and thought was funny but never knew."</p>

<p>Herman added in, "That's the problem with a comedy. You hear the line read and you're excited and then two weeks later you're like, 'If I ever hear that f**king line again I'm going to kill somebody, who thought that was funny?' and you need those fresh eyes to remember the vision is still good from so long ago."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Being able to watch people play and enjoy it was really the fuel the team needed at that point in development" - Nick Herman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The team was also surprised by how into the mechanics of the game people were getting. Watching players optimize the demo taught them things about the game that they didn't know themselves, where Robertson could fail early, to then be able to maximize potential later.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-mini-games.jpg?itok=bEhprO_D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-mini-games.jpg?itok=Y-_1H_cH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It wasn't just gameplay that was shocking the development team as Derek Stratton offered up that he was shocked by the characters that fans were developing crushes on. Sonarr was one that seemed to be high on the list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"People can fall in love with anything" - Stratton</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><em>Dispatch </em>Will Be Released Episodically</h2>

<p>AdHoc Studios also announced that <em>Dispatch </em>will be releasing on October 22, 2025, for PC and PS5, or at least that's when the first two episodes will be released.</p>

<p>Starting from October 22, every week there will be two episodes released, with the <em>Dispatch </em>finale coming out with Episode 7 and 8 on November 12. Each episode is expected to take players an hour to complete, but the team at AdHoc was also surprised when the demo was released to see people exploring every possibility and taking four hours to complete it.</p>

<p>The standard edition of the game will be available for $29.99, with a Deluxe Edition also releasing for $39.99. The Deluxe Edition will come with a Digital Artbook with 100+ pages of content, and to fit with the superhero theme, this release will also come with four digital comics and six additional stories for players who want to learn more about the characters and the world of <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks as though&nbsp;one of the major announcements at next week's RGG Summit will be&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, if a now-deleted bit of text on the official Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio website is to be believed.</p>

<p>As spotted by Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1njba80/rgg_website_accidentally_leaked_kiwami_3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blubiboy98</a>, a news listing for&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>(written in Japanese kanji, of course) appeared on the RGG website and was quickly deleted, but not before it was <a href="https://x.com/Z64Gaming/status/1968275359000142163" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">screenshotted</a> by several <a href="https://x.com/tdkumon/status/1968278220245176605" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">users</a> on social media platform X.</p>

<p>With the studio's annual developer presentation due to air next week, it's almost certain that&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>will be announced during that show, assuming that this listing wasn't some kind of elaborate mistake or prank.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-leaked-rumor-yakuza-3-remastered.jpg?itok=HUtYlV92 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-leaked-rumor-yakuza-3-remastered.jpg?itok=TiHZtjaQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>could be the next game to get the&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>remake treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>It would make sense for RGG to approach <i>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</i>for the next installment in its&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>remake series; the game is now the oldest mainline&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon</em>&nbsp;title not to have been remade.</p>

<p>It's not actually the oldest game in the franchise that hasn't been remade, though; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>Ryu ga Gotoku Kenzan!</em>, a spinoff that recasts Kazuma Kiryu as legendary historical figure Miyamoto Musashi.</p>

<p>If 2023's&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon Ishin!&nbsp;</em>is anything to go by, though, that game may well get itself a reimagining for modern systems as well, and that would arguably be even more valuable than a&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>remake, since&nbsp;<em>Kenzan!&nbsp;</em>has never been released in the West.</p>

<p>Of course, it's worth bearing in mind that all of this should be taken with a pinch of salt; RGG hasn't officially confirmed the <i>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</i>remake yet, so there's still a chance (albeit a slim one) that the project will be absent from next week's summit.</p>

              <p><span>We know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, Netflix’s animated musical that has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>set the world on fire for the past few months</span></a><span>, is likely </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span> after the movie’s runaway success. However, it seems like we might not have to wait too much longer to see Huntr/x, the film’s demon-slaying K-pop group, again, as the Motion Picture Association has leaked that a short film follow-up has been rated.</span></p> <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.filmratings.com/Content/Downloads/cara_rating_bulletin.pdf"><span>document on the MPA film ratings website</span></a><span> includes a listing for something called </span><i><span>Debut: A KPop Demon Hunters Story</span></i><span>, which is rated PG for “some action/violence and scary images.” Sony is listed as the distributor, and the listing says it is a “short subject,” which is a designation given to short films rather than the feature-length movies the ratings board usually handles. The fact that it’s already been rated means that its release is probably imminent, and the title suggests it could cover the early days of Huntr/x’s K-pop career. Maybe we’ll get to see the girls meet for the first time, learn the truth about the demons preying upon humanity, and establish themselves as a dominant force in the K-pop world. If so, we might also get some new songs?</span></p> <p><span>All of this is speculation right now, but it was established back in 2023 that Sony would produce a short film based on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><a href="https://variety.com/2023/artisans/news/spider-verse-short-film-spider-within-sony-animation-1235567757/"><span>through its LENS mentorship program</span></a><span>, which was also responsible for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcGPpwFdE1Y"><i><span>The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story</span></i></a><span>, a seven-minute-long short based on the </span><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>movies. It’s unclear if </span><i><span>Debut </span></i><span>will be streaming on Netflix like the full movie or if it will be on publicly available channels like YouTube.</span></p> <p><span>If there is new music, I’ll have to update our </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><span>ranking of the movie’s original songs</span></a><span>, though it will take something really special to dethrone the song in the number one spot.</span></p>

EA and developer Full Circle are addressing those issues now, and updates and improvements will continue, with the game planned to stay in early access for a year. </p><p>Skate is a free-to-play game available in early access, meaning the experience is not up to 1.0 as of yet. Every early-access game is different, so here are some key things to know about Skate.</p>

<h2><strong>Why early access?</strong></h2><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Posting on Steam</a>, developer Full Circle said early access was the right call for Skate because the studio wanted to make the game "in partnership" with players. "Our early access launch will be a starting point from which new features, improvements, live events, and seasonal content will be added over time," the developer said.</p><h2><strong>When is 1.0?</strong></h2><p>Full Circle wasn't ready to commit to exactly how long Skate will remain in early access. However, the team said it expects Skate to reach a "full" release in about one year, meaning September 2026. That being said, Full Circle said "we don't know for certain at this time" if that will be the case.</p><p>The FAQ also states that the Skate early access launch includes the "essentials" of what's going to be in the "full" release. Whenever that comes, players can expect more challenges, features, live events, and gameplay improvements.</p><h2><strong>Will it get more expensive?</strong></h2><p>Skate is a free-to-play that makes money from microtransactions and the sale of the Founder's Pack ($25) and the Founder's Pack Deluxe ($50). Some games change price after leaving early access, but that doesn't sound like it'll be the case for Skate. Full Circle said Skate will be free in early access "and beyond."</p><p>The new Skate is the first entry in the series since 2010's Skate 3, so fans have been waiting a long time. The game is available now on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <p>Telltale's second series-slash-sequel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-wolf-among-us-2">The Wolf Among Us 2</a>, has become notoriously hard to pin down. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/telltale-announces-the-wolf-among-us-season-two-days-after-telling-fans-not-to-get-hopes-up">Originally announced in 2017</a>, the game disappeared <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-walking-dead-developer-telltale-games-reportedly-lays-off-the-majority-of-its-staff">when Telltale closed in 2018</a>, then it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/telltales-the-wolf-among-us-2-just-got-re-announced">resurrected in 2019</a> only to disappear again in 2023, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-into-2024-to-avoid-burnout-and-crunch">what sounded like burnout from crunch</a>. And we haven't heard a peep since.</p>
<p>But I had a chance to speak to the studio which was originally making the game for Telltale (then a kind of publisher but now making the game internally, it seems) to see if I could find out what was going on. That original developer was AdHoc Studio, a team formed by former Telltale staff, many of whom worked on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a> game.</p>
<p>AdHoc co-founder Nick Herman directed the first episode of The Wolf Among Us (known as "Faith"), and he told me AdHoc was working on the follow-up, The Wolf Among Us 2, for about two years. But as to why the studio stopped working on it, he said: "Look, the truth is..."</p>

<p>He was interrupted by fellow co-founder Pierre Shorette, another Telltale alumni, who asked with a smile, "Yeah why did we stop working on that, Nick?"</p>
<p>Put on the spot, Herman continued: "We wrote a season, Season Two. We think it's better than Season One - and we were on Season One. And yeah, we're really proud of it. We were doing tests. We were in cinematics and animation and stuff. And then basically they needed more time.</p><p>"They weren't... We weren't running the project. It was Telltale we were doing it in partnership with. And we couldn't wait around and do nothing, so we had to move on to Dispatch to keep the studio moving, and they needed to go their own way.</p>
<p>"We're looking forward to seeing what they do with it," Herman added. "I don't know how much of our version of the script is going to make it into what they end up making. But if one day we were able to make the thing that we wrote and were in the middle of directing, we think people would love it. So, you know, good luck."</p>
<p>"Spicy," added Shorette.</p>

<p>Dispatch - the game Herman mentioned - is the studio's self-published debut game, released in partnership with role-play mega-group Critical Role and featuring some of the actors from there in the game. Award-winning actor Laura Bailey is one of them. Bailey was actually attached to Dispatch long before it was called Dispatch - even before AdHoc was working on The Wolf Among Us 2</p><p>The project back then was, bizarrely, linked in a roundabout way with US retail giant Walmart - a company connected to Walmart anyway. And AdHoc's fledgling live-action superhero idea got quite far. It had shoot dates and everything was going ahead but then March 2020 rolled around and Covid flattened it. A blessing in disguise, Herman joked. "You're asking a bunch of game devs to shoot a TV show," he said. "It would have been a fun failure."</p>
<p>The studio moved onto The Wolf Among Us 2 after that, in a work-for-hire capacity, but when that project stalled, it returned to the superhero idea and Dispatch, as we know it now, was born.</p>

<p>Dispatch is a superhero workplace comedy formed from a recognisably Telltale cinematic choice-and-consequence mould, albeit with added mini-games, and it looks enormously promising. It stars Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul as Robert Robertson, a man who loses the use of his superpowered mech suit so needs to get a desk job dispatching misfit superheroes to fight crime. They are unruly. Many jokes ensue.</p>
<p>Notably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-episodic-gaming-former-telltale-devs-are-bringing-it-back-for-the-release-of-dispatch-and-theres-a-chance-it-might-work-this-time">Dispatch will be an episodically released game</a>, but all eight episodes will be released in quick succession over the course of a month - two a week starting 22nd October. It won't be a case of waiting months for them. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">a demo of Dispatch on Steam</a> if you fancy giving the game a go.</p>
<p>After Dispatch, AdHoc will move onto making a fully fledged game for Critical Role, set in the fantasy world of Exandria, which is where the group's acclaimed Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures have taken place.</p>

            <p>
A brand-new Dragon Quest game has been revealed - and no, I don't mean Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined.
</p>
<p>
Dragon Quest Smash/Grow is a roguelite RPG coming to mobile devices globally next year. As the title suggests, players attack to build their special moves in order to smash foes, and then use crystals dropped by defeated enemies to grow their character. As you'd expect from a roguelite, the game features random Blessings and ever-changing tactical situations.
</p>
<p>
Launching a new mobile game, however, does seem a bit of an odd choice for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>. In the past couple of years, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-shuts-down-another-final-fantasy-mobile-game">company has shut down a whole string of underperforming mobile titles</a>, including Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> battle royale The First Soldier. What's more, the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sees-game-sales-drop-but-multiplatform-strategy-continues-in-earnest">financial report in May revealed sales and profits from mobile games had dropped "sharply"</a>, likely due to the closure of these games.

<p>
Equally, the Dragon Quest series is having a bit of a moment, so it makes sense to capitalise on that with a new free-to-play mobile game. Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake has been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">massive success for Square Enix</a>, particularly in Japan, and that will be followed by Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake coming later this year.
</p>
<p>
That's in addition to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-7-is-getting-a-full-remake-and-its-not-hd-2d">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>, as revealed at last week's Nintendo Direct. It's a new version of the PS1 classic, with a streamlined story and new visual style that will be out next year.
</p>
<p>
Dragon Quest Smash/Grow is also out in 2026, but there will be a closed beta test next month, from 14th October until 21st October. You've got until 2nd October to <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/cbt/">apply for access on the game's website</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-console-review.1300374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The world came to an end in 1887. That’s a sobering line to start any game with, but here you already feel the seeping cold and unflinching hardness of Frostpunk. Launched last year on PC, this survival city builder imagines a past where a new ice age arrived, and where humanity is on the brink of extinction. It’s your task to keep the remaining people alive, and it’s fair to say that this is one of the most gruelling, most intensive and most involving survival games of all time. It is, for want of any other word, a masterpiece.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 2 - Console Date Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMyxKNAqpnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You begin Frostpunk 2 with The Wanderers, a prologue designed to get you up to speed, and one which hardens the narrative strands dangled in front of you at the start of the game’s narrative mode. Here, you get a sense of how people have survived this stricken, frozen planet, with nomadic groups returning to the hulking great furnaces that they huddle around when a whiteout comes. The need for survival, and the need for everyone to pull in the same direction, is immediately hammered home, and the hammering won’t stop the further you go.</p>


<p>Frostpunk 2 has to be the most cinematic city builder I’ve ever played. The sense of drama, emotion and gravitas shouldn’t be possible when you’re placing down structures, setting jobs and tinkering with menus, but there’s something about Frostpunk 2 that’s immediately affecting.</p>
<p>The ravening wind, the shouts of the workers as they build, the clank of extraction units pulling oil from the ground; there’s a constant soundscape at play here that brings the world to life, enhanced by the strains of the plaintive orchestral soundtrack. It feels real and imposing, and that sense of realness, of the thin line between life and death, permeates every aspect of the game.</p>

<p>Key within that are the politics and factions at work within your city. When things are going wrong, they look for someone to blame, and when things are going right, someone somewhere will still be unhappy. While it might be set in an imagined post-apocalyptic timeline, Frostpunk 2 still offers one of the most realistic takes on politics and public life we’ve seen in gaming. You might be able to pacify a couple of communities with your decisions, but there will always be an outlier, or a wrinkle provided by a new faction within them, and you have to navigate the ebb and flow of popularity, patience and penance, as you try to maintain your role as Steward of this frigid cityscape.</p>

<p>You need to maintain forward motion in Frostpunk 2, otherwise, you will, quite literally, find yourself frozen in place. Expansion and research play a significant role in preparing for the harsher moments, when temperatures drop dangerously low, and your populace huddles slightly closer to the furnaces.</p>
<p>While you begin from a single central point in New London, you must identify the weaknesses in your supply chains, whether that’s food, oil or other commodities, and then prepare expeditions to break through the frostbitten ground to clear a path that will allow you to extract the necessary natural resource from the ground.</p>
<p>That’s all dictated by time. From the tutorial’s hurried push to build enough food surplus, Frostpunk 2 sets you on a path that requires split-second action and decisiveness. Every act takes time, and just as with your political standing, you have to find the balance between pushing further out into the wilderness or cementing what you have, pushing forward with better technologies that will make what little you do have go further, rather than hitting upon a new but finite vein.</p>
<p>Playing Frostpunk 2 is clawing and claustrophobic. You feel a constant weight of expectation and tension while playing, and that sensation hasn’t been lost in its transition to console. The navigation with a controller does, in some way, enhance it. That’s down to the slightly unwieldy nature of the tool you’ve been given, and, like one of your citizens swinging a spade into the ice rather than a pickaxe, it will get you somewhere, but it’s much harder work.</p>

<p>Playing on console, the central control mechanisms of moving, building and frostbreaking, are handled quite elegantly with a touch of the right shoulder button bringing up the main interface while you cycle through the resulting menus with the D-pad. You soon become accustomed to shifting between different areas, and the readouts and resource markers are very clear and easy to parse, even on a TV at distance, letting you build an expand your cityscape with some certainty.</p>
<p>It’s the wider menus where the ice gets a little bit slushy. Pressing the Square button brings up the Extended City View, and from here you’re able to move between a variety of different sections with the analogue stick or D-pad, but choosing the particular area you need to access isn’t always handled properly, and I found myself having to back in and out having made the wrong selection again, while occasionally making additional buildings in districts didn’t register correctly.</p>
<p>That’s then compounded by some odd freezing in certain menus, which would only be slightly ironic if it wasn’t quite so frustrating. In a game where you’re fighting for survival and where every moment matters, it’s not just an annoying speedbump, it’s a block in the road. Despite how good Frostpunk 2 is, I’d currently hold off on buying the game on console until there’s confirmation that it’s been remedied with an early patch.</p>
<p>The controller implementation overall is satisfactory, but I’d like to see more development time given to it in the long run. It’s never going to match the ease of interacting with a mouse, but then there are some things that a controller simply can’t match a mouse for, and city builders and RTS games sit at the top of the pile. I hope that we might see a Switch 2 port for Frostpunk 2 at some point, but I do wonder what sacrifices would have to be made to get it running there.</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 benefits from a strong visual identity, and though there’s clearly a lot of snow, frost and a reliance on the colour white, the burgeoning lights of the city, and its glowing infrastructure really make it pop from the screen, while the detailed portraits emphasise the human element at play. Those visuals are at their best in Fidelity mode, and on the base PS5, performance is good, albeit at 30fps, with things staying steady as you sweep and spin across your city, zooming in and out to different districts and expansions.</p>
<p>You can occasionally make things skip a beat if you’ve filled the landscape and you’re shifting around at speed, but it doesn’t diminish the game in any way. You also have the option of a zippy 60fps Performance Mode, or a Balanced 40fps option if your screen supports 120Hz. This was definitely the best of both worlds, and makes everything feel considerably smoother, but I still missed the sheer glory of the Fidelity Mode, and in a city builder, it’s more than possible to live with 30fps.</p>

That date was unaffected by Supermassive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-lay-off-up-to-36-workers-delay-interstellar-horror-directive-8020">laying off up to 36 people</a> and delaying interstellar horror Directive 8020 in July.</p>

<p>As you can see above, the demo's come with a quick trailer heavy on sinister humming. The two titchy protagonists Low and Alone wind levers, climb through flaps, and otherwise platform. Oh no, this platforming has attracted the attention of a giant baby monster with grubby fingers that can reach for the duo like they're the last Bourbon cream in the cupboard (other biscuits are available). Its gaze can also turn them to stone, which is a power alll babies have, they just hide it very well.</p><p>As in the full game, you and a mate can wield the bow and wrench of Little Nightmares 3's pair, or you can play alone with an AI companion. Maybe give them the bow, I bet their aim's pretty good. 30 minutes of small nightmaring await you either way.</p>
<p>If you've not given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> series a go before, here are a couple of extracts from former RPSers Adam and Alice B about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmares-review-pc">first</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmares-2-review">second</a> games in the series respectively:</p>
<blockquote>It's a grotesque, horrid and eventually hopeful in its own morbid fashion, and despite many moments that feel like reimaginings or echoes from elsewhere, it has enough extraordinary images and sequences to stand alone. It's precisely the kind of horror game I love – grotesque but not gross, and interested in thoughtful pacing and escalation rather than jumpscares and shocks. Also, linear though it is, there are some collectibles I'd like to hunt for and the whole game is short enough that I'll happily play it again, or watch someone else playing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>These flaws are small enough that I'm happy to place Little Nightmares II up on my shelf of excellence right next to the first one. Childhood fears are such a rich vein to slice open, and Tarsier Studios do it in a very thoughtful way. Little Nightmares II is such a splendid mix of cute and creepy, beautiful and awful, that it sort of defies categorisation. A childhood terror gothic, perhaps?</blockquote>
<p>You can find Little Nightmares 3's demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392860/Little_Nightmares_III/">its Steam page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Look, it’s OK. Some games are just incredibly hard, and not everyone has the skills or patience required to conquer them. Many people are finding their limit with&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, reaching a boss that just cannot be bested or realizing their fingers just aren’t capable of the dexterity required to master the super-hard platformer. But don’t wallow! Pick yourself up and try any of these games that offer a similar experience, without being quite so brutal.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> has <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-difficulty-hollow-knight-easy-mode-2000624441">re-opened the wound of gaming difficulty discourse</a>, causing friction over the topic of how hard a game can reasonably be without offering difficulty options for less skilled players. Of course, for all the debate and discussion, one core truth always remains: developers are allowed to make their games any way they want. Some choose to do this by responding to feedback from players, but others have a fixed vision for their creation and aren’t going to be moved from that. There’s no sense fighting this, not least when the vast banquet of video games already offers so very many fantastic alternatives.</p> <p>I dearly wish I were better at <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> because it’s the so-called “metroidvania” format that so attracts me. The genre, whose name is somewhat awkwardly based on the franchises of <em>Metroid</em> and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>, generally refers to platform games in which you gain a growing number of skills and abilities which, over time, give you access to previously inaccessible areas. Along the way, regenerating enemies attempt to thwart your progress, while one-time bosses are stationed at key points. The more skills you get, the easier those earlier areas become, and the better prepared you are for the later challenges. All that’s true of <em>Silksong</em>, of course! But there are very many games that offer it all without the punishing difficulty. Here are a few worth picking up if&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> is getting you down.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-60000mah-power-bank-has-never-been-priced-lower-than-now-blackout-and-camping-charger-light-combo-2000626100</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-60-000mah-power-bank-has-never-been-priced-lower-than-now-blackout-and-camping-charger-light-combo.1300356/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When one device can address several inconveniences and annoyances while putting a pile of money back in your pocket, it’s well worth a look. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">The Anker 548 Power Bank 60,000mAh portable power station cost $250 two years ago, but right now at Amazon it’s only $80 — its lowest price ever, and a 47% reduction from its most recent retail price of $150</a>. It’ll be the best $80 you’ve spent in a long while after just one camping trip or one blackout.</p>
<p>What are those annoyances it can eliminate for you? How about when the power goes out and you reach into the junk drawer for a flashlight, only to discover it’s dead and has likely been dead for a long time, leaving you to scramble for a handful of D-cell batteries. Or when you buy a “portable” power station only to discover it might be portable if you’re a powerlifter, but otherwise it’s a ginormous device that you’d really rather not have to carry around. The Anker 548 Power Bank is the $80 solution to those woes, and many more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Truly, Amazingly Portable</h2>
<p>Unless you enjoy the workout of lugging a “portable” power station that tips the scales at 25 or more pounds, the first thing you’ll notice about the Anker 548 Power Bank is that it’s really, truly portable for everyone. It’s barely over 5 pounds, and has a built-in handle atop its compact 4.6 x 4.6 x 8.2 inch body. It’s power on the go literally anywhere you need it — ideal for stashing in your bedroom for a power outage, keeping in the car for powering devices on long trips, or occupying a very small space in your vehicle on your next outdoor adventure.</p>
<p>The built-in light at the top of the Anker 548 Power Bank is retractable so it can give you either a little glow or a full-on light source, and there’s also an SOS mode for emergencies — ideal for roadside breakdowns. The Anker 548 is also ready when you need it, even if that’s months away — after a full year without being recharged, it retains an amazing 85% of its charge.</p>



<h2>Multi-Device Power</h2>
<p>The Anker 548 Power Bank has an enormous 60,000mAh capacity, and two USB-C and two USB-A ports ready for your devices. That’s enough to fully charge a MacBook Air almost 3 times, and an iPhone 14 Pro Max 7.4 times, and a 3W LED emergency lamp will stay lit for over 42 hours. The LED Smart Display shows you all the vital stats, including the power level of the 548 Power Bank itself. Recharging the Anker 548 Power Bank is a simple USB-C operation, or you can attach it to a compatible solar panel with an XT-60 connector for clean, endlessly renewable recharging.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">the Anker 548 Power Bank massively overperforms the $80 price tag it’s carrying during this limited-time Amazon deal.</a> It’ll take just one power outage or one fun camping trek for it to easily pay for itself, and since it has a projected lifespan up to 10 times longer than most competing models, you’ll have plenty of time to reap the rewards.</p>

                <p>In real life, a skateboard is generally a quick way to get around town, but in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate/">Skate</a>, you can leave your fellow skaters in the dust by rag-dolling to your destination. With the game now out in early access on PC and console, players have begun to discover several physics-defying glitches--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-glitch-lets-you-cheat-gravity-by-clapping/1100-6534797/">like clapping being better than a parachute</a>.

This year will be no different, but the drop will feature a unique twist: Play-Doh.</p><p dir="ltr">The drop, called Secret Lair x Play-Doh: Squishful Thinking, features reprinted cards sporting artwork taken from real-life Play-Doh sculptures.

Previous Extra Life drops from Secret Lair include cards with art hand-drawn by patients from Seattle Children’s Autism Center in 2021 and 2022, two separate My Little Pony-themed drops in 2019 and 2023, and last year's drop featuring pixel art from longtime MTG artist Mike Burns.</p><p dir="ltr">Magic: The Gathering Secret Lair x Play-Doh: Squishful Thinking will be available on the Secret Lair website September 29 to November 9, both in non-foil for $40 and in rainbow foil for $50. The drop will also be available in limited quantities at MagicCon: Atlanta September 26-28.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the only drop coming to Secret Lair soon, as a new superdrop themed around the Marvel's Spider-Man set will begin on September 22. The superdrop features six drops of five cards each, and they will feature reprinted cards from MTG history with art highlighting Spider-Man and some of his most fearsome archenemies.</p>

            <p>
Netflix has released a full trailer for its forthcoming Splinter Cell animated series, ahead of its release next month.
</p>
<p>
From Derek Kolstad, writer of the John Wick franchise, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Deathwatch will of course follow series protagonist Sam Fisher - here looking a little older and more grizzled, though still with his iconic night-vision goggles.
</p>
<p>
Liev Schreiber (who's been in a tonne of films, from Scream to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/10-men-origins-wolverine">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a> and Isle of Dogs) provides the voice of Fisher, and the whole thing has been produced by Ubisoft Film &amp; Television.

<p>
The series will be available from 14th October and also stars Kirby Howell-Baptiste (Killing Eve, The Sandman) as new Splinter Cell agent Zinnia McKenna.
</p>
<p>
News of a Splinter Cell animated series came <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-reportedly-working-on-an-animated-splinter-cell-series">back in 2020</a>, so this series has been a long time coming. A separate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-movie-cancelled-after-producer-admits-they-just-couldnt-get-it-right">Splinter Cell film was cancelled last year</a> as the production team "just couldn't get it right".
</p>
<p>
October is a busy month for Netflix video game adaptations, as the fourth season of The Witcher also arrives on 30th October. It now stars Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia, instead of Henry Cavill. Check out a trailer below to see him in action.

As for new Splinter Cell games, Ubisoft announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">remake of the first game in the series back in 2021</a>, but we've heard nothing since.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hands-on-reach-%E2%80%93-impossible-vr-action-made-real.1300314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Watching the trailer for Reach, nDreams Elevation’s latest VR game, it wasn’t the visuals or the story that grabbed my attention and made me want to play the game, but that it seemed to be filled with leaps and dives that would make even me, someone who doesn’t suffer from VR motion sickness, reach for the sick bag. It honestly looked almost unplayable at points, but Elevation is a special team within nDreams that has the time to research and prototype new ways of playing in VR, so I was intrigued to see how they were advancing the format.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reach - Gameplay Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOuzzp4V9HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game is described as an action-adventure and we’ve had that sort of game in VR before, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/16/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-psvr-2/">Horizon: Call of the Mountain</a> springs to mind, but that always felt quite staid and constrained – you were either moving, climbing, or shooting, one at a time. Reach is much more like a non-VR action adventure where you are performing multiple actions at the same time, chaining together movement and actions to really live in that fantasy.</p>


<p>The first mission, which acts as a tutorial, sets our heroine clambering up city walls, shooting bad guys and running for her life. Rather cleverly, she is a stuntwoman and so the whole first mission is an elongated sequence where she is acting in a movie. Of course there’s a big set piece moment that she’s tasked with performing, to escape from a helicopter, make death defying leaps through windows, clamber around the side of buildings and try and stay on your feet as the building collapses around you. It’s quite exhilarating and reminded me of the chase sequence in the James Bond movie, Spectre.</p>


<p>Skipping ahead a few levels my demo moved deep underground to a mysterious ancient city filled with robots that are not keen on a human poking around. There’s a lot more puzzling in the sections, some of which requires you to work mechanisms to open doors, and other times just to sit and wonder how on earth you are going to reach a certain ledge or doorway. The mechanical puzzles felt satisfying as they usually involve using a weapon rather than just pulling a series switches and there’s lots of audio and visual feedback to let you know if you are getting things right.</p>
<p>The main weapon in Reach is a bow which can be upgraded to fire four different types of arrow, but while a full frontal assault on the enemy robots can work you are also encouraged to use stealth. By sneaking up behind the automatons you can go full Predator and rip their spines out, taking them down in one move and saving your precious arrows. You will also need to work tactically when there are multiple robots, taking them out in an order that will not get you caught.</p>

<p>Adding an extra layer to the platforming and puzzling is your shield, which also lets you play out your Captain America fantasies by flinging it ahead and watching it ricochet with improbable accuracy as it takes out multiple enemies. It can also slotted in to sections of walls to create an extra platform. If that wasn’t enough, yet another upgrade lets you zoom up to the ceiling like Batman using a grapple gun.</p>
<p>Adding all these tools and abilities together creates something rather special. You get to play your way, rather than in a prescribed fashion. In fact you will want to experiment as during playtesting the testers were performing moves that the team didn’t realise were possible, so they added a few extra secrets to discover if you manage to pull off some spectacular.</p>
<p>Looking at screenshot of Reach and you may not be that impressed – it’s certainly pushing the Meta Quest 2 or 3 to its limits, but missing the extra detail allowed by the power of the PSVR 2. It really is a game you have to play to be impressed by, or at least read a glowing preview about. It may not look like it’s doing anything particularly new, we’ve all played VR games with bows and clambering ledges, but it really is one of the most immersive games I have played. All the old ways of making VR comfortable that took you out of the game have been peeled away, and once you have got the hang on the controls it just feels natural.</p>

<p>It’s an odd comparison but to me it feels just as ‘real’ as Beat Saber. That’s the only other game where I have felt completely absorbed in the world and not like I”m playing a VR game. The biggest compliment I can give the game is that I was meant to play it for about 45 minutes but they eventually yanked me out of VR after an hour and a half, and it honestly felt like half that time. If you have been wanting to dust off your VR headset then Reach may just be the game to tempt you.</p>
<p><em>Reach launches on 16th October 2025 on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10012024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS VR2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFpjTDVtb2dkcTlRdjllRVR6RC01YUhJMjB4QXxBQ3Jtc0tuUHpHN3p2OFFiRnlmTzJKUWtwLUhoOG5NSFBfdk43Sm9aWEJCZGFwbFV6YmdrQ2d1aDNBc1phbExXYVpZUmExZnpOWDhuOHVDRFZDdVVSbGdYUjMxSjVFSVhoVkZIcWZUX2x1VmlzazROTkVweDhvMA&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F43Z4b5o&amp;v=N1gKZBhIABE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaQuest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa29NUEdSS3UxZjVhYmprS1luQ3pWODdYY3NuZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttVVpvZkYtNmkwSnZodm1Fcl90MGo5Z2t4ZXFSSU8wWkJHMkp1WTAwcDRWMG9TaFRldFotRUpPODlXOXNfemZEQmJ2TFYybG9ocWowQi0tOVRGV1RSTWU4dzcyZGduYmVxSklaSEt2c2EzTDk2QmQySQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3FRuyBX&amp;v=N1gKZBhIABE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and PC VR.</a> Players who pre-order from the <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/reach/9707487579328855/">Meta Horizon Store</a> or <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP2985-PPSA25045_00-0865705303155937">PlayStation Store</a> any time from now until launch will receive the Ferran cosmetic set which includes &nbsp;a Traditional Ferran outfit, Ornate Bow, &nbsp;Ferran Guard Shield, Traditional Gauntlets and Ornate Drone.</em></p>

<figure><a title="madden big patch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c10fce3ee4b2e/madden-big-patch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA Sports</em></figcaption></figure><p>EA Sports has dropped a huge new update for the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a>. The September 17th patch introduces a large number of fixes, adjustments, and other bits and bobs to a game that does a very solid job of bringing the full Madden experience to handheld - so long as you can take the frame rate hit.</p>
<p>Focusing in on highlights here, this patch (which brings the game to version 1.7) brings defensive adjustments in the midfield that should make runners a little easier to catch, whilst a new mechanic that's been brought over from EA's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ea_sports_college_football_26">College Football</a> franchise allows you to make your own default pass protection system to suit your chosen coach philosophy. Audio and visual effects, some quirky animations and other bugs also see fixes.</p>
<p>You can check out the full, and very long, patch notes over at <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-september-17-2025">EA's site</a>, but here are some highlights for your perusal:</p>

<li>Adjusted Small Agile Back hit stick animations to look more realistic and grounded.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue sometimes causing defenders to warp back to their feet when mid-lunge in tackling.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Art</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added additional NFL Player &amp; Coach Likeness Heads</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Indeed, a glance over to the game's forums in the wake of the news of this update, and players seem very happy with the laundry list of changes in the patch notes, most of which have been in response to feedback. So well played there, EA.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">8/10 review</a>, we said Madden NFL 26 is "a very solid port of one of the best outings for this franchise in recent memory. Yes, you'll need to get used to a drop in the frame rate to 40fps on Switch 2, but it's a reasonable downgrade in order to get this type of game running as well as it does on a portable machine."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wreckreation is the latest game from Three Fields Entertainment, a studio that was founded by <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the beloved Burnout series. Published by THQ Nordic, after Wreckreation was first announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">2022</a>, three years later we have a release date to look forward to, with the open-world driving sandbox arriving on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>The news was announced alongside a new trailer that showcases the bright vistas and the insane tracks that are possible for players to create in this sandbox title, as Wreckreation is as much about building your own dream tracks as it is racing them.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Wreckreation | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEMB3PehB38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>What makes building your own tracks as core to Wreckreation as the actual driving is the fact that you're not swapping from one mode to another if you want to make a change or adjustment to the road in front of you.</p>



<p>Changes to the track, your environment, like the weather or time of day, adding loops, and even adding a slew of decorations can all be done on the fly at the press of a button. With more than 50 cars, and 400 square kilometers of sandbox to run around in, there are plenty of ways you can create your own racing paradise.</p>



<p>Wreckreation will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 28, 2025, for $39.99/€39.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow</em>, a mobile roguelite RPG that features classic&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>enemies and aesthetics, and you could get a chance to try it out soon.</p>

<p>According to the game's new <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>is a game in which you'll "smash your way through hordes of monsters", using "<em>Dragon Quest</em>'s signature Coup de Grace attacks" to deal huge damage to them.</p>

<p>Each run will bestow random Blessings on you to augment certain parts of your playstyle, so you'll need to "adapt your battle strategy to match an ever-changing tactical situation", according to Square Enix. The studio says that "no quest is ever the same" in the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-smash-grow-mobile.jpg?itok=kdZ4Fpiu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-smash-grow-mobile.jpg?itok=hAneOuCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>brings the series' trademark aesthetics to the mobile roguelite RPG realm.</figcaption></figure><p>Each run of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>will see you sprinting through a linear level in which groups of enemies will attack you, and you'll need to dispatch them, collecting their crystals to gain Blessings and upgrade yourself.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>is a roguelite, it's likely that there will be some element of permanent progress as well; perhaps you'll unlock new Blessings for future runs, or maybe you'll progress through a story as each run concludes.</p>

<p>Either way, you may well get a chance to try the game out sooner than later, because a closed beta test is taking place between October 14th and October 21st. Since it's a closed beta, though, you'll need to <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/cbt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apply to enter</a>.</p>

<p>The test will require you to have either an iOS device that's equivalent to the iPhone XR or later or an Android device with a Snapdragon 855 SoC (or better, of course). There are 30,000 places available, so make sure to get your application in quickly!</p>




<p>It's all go for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>right now. During <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">last week's Nintendo Direct show</a>, Square Enix announced a full 3D remake of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII</em>, and work is apparently <a href="https://gamerant.com/dragon-quest-12-update-may-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">continuing</a> on&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XII</em>, although we still don't know too much about the game.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>is set to come to Android and iOS devices sometime next year, and the closed beta is scheduled to take place in October. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p><span>We’re a week out from the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk, and the internet is still running wild with new information, commentary, and, as the internet often does, dark jokes. That includes AI slop, and one particular brand of it became so viral that Bandai Namco, or more specifically, the company’s toy division, has released a statement about its logo being used in fake mockups of Gunpla models depicting Kirk’s assassination.</span></p> <p><span>The statement was released on the company’s </span><a href="https://x.com/BandaiCollect/status/1968140558959882612"><span>social media channels</span></a><span>, and while it doesn’t reference Kirk’s death by name, it says that it has been made aware of “AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.” The images, which </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>has verified, include a fake model of the moment Kirk was shot on September 10 at the Utah Valley University campus with a fake Bandai-branded box in the background. The full statement reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>We have recently been made aware of AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.</span></p> <p><span>We want to make it unequivocally clear: Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. strongly condemns any form of violence and does not support or endorse the use of our brand, products, or logo in any such context. These images are not created, approved, or affiliated with our company in any way.</span></p> <p><span>We are actively investigating this matter and are taking steps to report and remove any unauthorized or misleading content. The misuse of our intellectual property in a way that misrepresents our values and intentions is deeply concerning and will not be tolerated.</span></p> <p><span>We thank our community for bringing this to our attention and encourage anyone who sees similar misuses to report them to us directly.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Kirk’s death has sparked a whirlwind of controversy that has bled into various industries as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"><span>public figures have reacted to the event</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Helldivers 2 </span></i><span>has even been dragged into the entire ordeal after it was reported that a reference to the Arrowhead Game Studios game was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439"><span>engraved on the bullet casings used in the fatal shooting</span></a><span>. Naturally, this has led to a rehash of long-debated discussions on whether </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-discord-reddit-memes-2000625746"><span>violent crimes can be linked to video games</span></a><span>.</span></p>
