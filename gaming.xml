			<p>Wayfinder is a 3-player Co-Op ARPG from the game studio <a href="https://www.airshipsyndicate.com/wayfinder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airship Syndicate</a>, the creators of the iconic and beloved <a href="https://wccftech.com/darksiders-art-darksiders-4/">Darksiders</a> franchise. Today, the game launched out of Early Access and brought with it a ton of new content for players to explore. The 1.0 release includes new massive open-world areas such as The Crucible, as well as a new Wayfinder to play named Lora, who is the third Arcanist to join the roster. Additionally, there are over 5 new dungeons to explore, and the progression and loot system has been revamped to make for a more fun experience for the players.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are eight heroes in total, including Lora, each having their own abilities and playstyles, providing something for everyone. If you are intrigued by the game but don't like to play in co-op, this game is entirely playable in single-player, and you can work your way through the campaign, which will take you through Lost Zones.</p>
<p>In total, there are 13 different Lost Zone dungeons, with the dungeons being different each time you explore them. There are over 3,000 weapons, armor pieces, housing items, and other collectibles that can ensure you have a unique experience in the game, allowing players to customize their Wayfinders to their liking.</p>
<p>This includes crafting your own unique build, which can be done by using the talent trees and Wayfinder Ranks in the game. Additionally, the Echoes system has been revamped. The game has randomized loot and armor, meaning no two builds you do will ever be the same. The Wayfinders need to be unlocked, but this can be done early in the game, so you don't have to grind to unlock new characters. Below is a trailer to celebrate the launch of Wayfinder 1.0, giving players a glimpse into what they can expect in the new vibrant update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wayfinder 1.0 Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FdQcr1GYJhY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lora is known as The Vessel, and is a vessel of a primal spirit that is so terrifying it scares her allies. Lora has the ability to harness the power of the Avatar, with her abilities having alternate versions due to her passive, which is called "Channeling."</p>
<p>For those who are eager to get stuck in the game, Wayfinder is currently available on Steam and PlayStation 5, with the game set to join Xbox at a later date in the month. The game costs $24.99 and has no micro transactions to worry about.</p>
<p>With the full release of the game, Wayfinder now supports cross-play across all platforms, meaning you'll be able to team up with your friends, even if they're on PC and you're on PlayStation, for example. Additionally, you will be able to continue your adventure on any platform, regardless of whether you're playing solo or co-op. To make the game more accessible, there have been performance optimizations for low-end machines, and the game is playable on the Steam Deck, allowing you to cozy up on the couch or in bed playing Wayfinder.</p>

One after the other I was told it was seen as a beacon of hope to create a safe space for people that were burnt out by Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. The team has been disbanded by Ubisoft."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr">J'ai entendu ou lu "la meilleure prod' de ma vie" trois ou quatre fois en un week-end à propos du développement de PoP The Lost Crown.

Per the report, The Lost Crown did not meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, and executives expressed concerns that a sequel would cannibalize long-term sales of the first game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is unclear from the report exactly what the status of the members of the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team is at this time.

It's likely that team members were, as was suggested by the report, moved onto other projects such as that, but IGN has reached out to Ubisoft for further clarity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's reported fate, if true, is a tragic one given how excellent the game is. We gave it an 8/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">our review</a>, saying it "captures not only what made games such as The Sands of Time so good, but it irons out a lot of the little issues that plagued the 3D games in this series by opting for a 2D perspective – and owning it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>We've seen Ghost Face in a number of video games already, namely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-by-daylight/" data-ref-id="5000-452548">Dead By Daylight</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/among-us/" data-ref-id="5000-488791">Among Us</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. Now, the iconic killer first seen in Wes Craven's 1996 genre-defying film, Scream, is coming to a new game. On October 24, you can find Ghost Face in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hunt-showdown/" data-ref-id="5000-283965">Hunt: Showdown</a> as the western-horror extraction shooter gets its debut licensed character skin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4388986-unnamed%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388986" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4388986-unnamed%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388986"></a><figcaption>He'd ask what your favorite scary movie is, but they haven't been invented yet in the Hunt universe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4388986-unnamed%289%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Ghost Face Rampage DLC includes the character skin, two weapons, and a tool--a knife, fittingly. The weapons included in the bundle are Hush (a Frontier 73C Silencer) and Whisper (a Bornheim No. 3 Silencer). The stealthy toolset is well-imagined for the sneaky star of the Scream franchise. If only Hunt: Showdown had some sort of telephone analog so Ghost Face could call and harass other players exploring the map each round.</p><p>Like in Dead By Daylight, the character has been given a makeover to suit the world, including a 19th-century-style hat and duster jacket. The iconic mask is now made of wood rather than rubber, too. Though Hunt hasn't previously done licensed crossovers, we arguably should've seen this coming, given its ongoing Halloween event is called Harvest of Ghosts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/adidas-ultraboost-history-1-0<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been collecting sneakers for around 25 years now. In that time I've seen everything from the emergence of Dunks to...<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1bgefl6/the_nike_dunk_hype_is_finally_over_almost_every/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the return of the Dunk</a>, and everything in between. I've also owned and worn a lot of shoes in that time, but today, I want to tell you about my favourite. The story of the greatest sneaker ever made.</p><p>It is the early 2010's. Adidas, one of the world's largest sportswear companies, is in the dumps. Nike, their main competitor, has been eating their lunch for years and the company, once synonymous with everything from football to streetwear, is falling short on all fronts. An over-reliance on Adidas' heritage (and the celebrity endorsements that went along with it), coupled with the emergence of new rivals like Under Armor, had left the three stripes in a pretty bad way. </p><p>Adversity can breed innovation, though, and it was during these doldrums that AIT (Adidas Innovation Team) linked up with, of all companies, BASF. While maybe best known to consumers as the VHS Guys, BASF are actually a German chemicals company who in the late 2000's had developed a material known as Infinergy, which was notable for three things: it was soft, it could return energy if compressed, and it could withstand all kinds of conditions and temperatures.</p><p>Both companies quickly saw potential in this (<a href="https://www.sneakerfreaker.com/news/adidas-tried-stop-puma-using-boost-tech-got-shut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as did Puma, whose part in this is a whole other story</a>), with BASF eventually selling the Infinergy technology to Adidas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190716234616/https://www.adidas.com/us/blog/373504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where it was renamed "Boost"</a>. Produced as small thermoplastic polyurethane pellets--not too different in appearance from the foam balls you fill a beanbag with--Adidas' plan for Boost involved heating these pellets to form larger masses of the material, which AIT believed could be a modern and radical replacement for stuff like EVA foam as the midsole of choice for running shoes.</p><p>The technology made its debut in 2013 on a sneaker known as the Energy Boost. BASF's quaint corporate video from the time gives a scientific breakdown of how the shoe, and Boost, worked:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="New BASF foam Infinergy revolutionizes adidas running shoe" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dH2aKoby1zg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>From a technological standpoint, this was <em>revolutionary</em>. Footwear had never seen anything like this, and just a year later, wearing the second shoe to feature Boost--the adizero Adios Boost--Dennis Kimetto ran what was then the fastest marathon of <em>all time</em>. All of which was great for people making corporate videos and writing Adidas' press releases, but for all its scientific potential, Boost--which was being exclusively targeted at performance runners--wasn't quite taking off in terms of sales. </p><p>Then magic happened. In early 2015 Adidas released a third Boost shoe known then as simply the UltraBoost. Again targeted at serious runners, it featured a full Boost midsole (previous shoes hadn't quite allowed the material to run all the way along the sole) along with a second innovation: an upper that was made of not leather or mesh but Primeknit, Adidas' soft, almost sweater-like knit that felt more like a sock than a shoe.</p><figure><figcaption>Say what you will about Kanye West today, in 2015 those Triple White UltraBoost 1.0s were incredible.</figcaption></figure><p>While <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2015/01/22/adidas-ultra-boost-trainer-revolutionise-running-knitted-upper-energy-return-midsole/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed for and marketed at performance athletes</a>, this is not where the shoe's legacy would lie. Because in May 2015, back when he was actually a bonafide global superstar, Kanye West wore a pair of all-white UltraBoosts onstage at the Billboard Music Awards, and suddenly the shoe started picking up interest from a whole other demographic: sneakerheads.</p><p>The state of the serious end of the sneaker market in 2015 was much the same as it is now: people were exhausted by endless rereleases and rehashes of "classics". Into this malaise, the futuristic UltraBoost--and Adidas' NMD, released at the same time and featuring much of the same technology, only designed specifically for casual use--were something <em>new</em>. That made them <em>exciting</em>, and coupled with scarcity (Boost was expensive and Adidas hadn't been ready for sneakerheads to start blowing up demand for it, so only a single factory on the entire planet could produce the sneakers) and a prize piece of celebrity endorsement, the UltraBoost, a shoe originally designed for runners, was about to become one of the most hyped and sought-after sneakers of the decade.</p><figure><figcaption>One of the earliest colourways of the 1.0, and still one of the most revered, are the "Creams". You could wear these <em>anywhere</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>From 2015 to around 2018, the UltraBoost felt unstoppable. It was particularly triumphant in 2016, though, as Adidas was able to successfully pivot away from designing colourways for runners and start retooling the shoe to speak to sneakerheads instead. <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/5/adidas-ultraboost-history-impact-5th-anniversary-retrospective" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This 2020 retrospective on Hypebeast</a> details just how explosive demand for the UltraBoost got during 2015-16:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s pretty hard to overstate how big UltraBOOSTs were in those early days of StockX, and most were in-line, simple colorways,” says Jesse Einhorn, senior economist at StockX. “[In 2015] the aftermarket was dominated and monopolized by Jordan Brand. There just wasn’t the same kind of brand diversity and competition you see now, and the UltraBOOST really opened the door more than any other sneaker for the modern-day resell market, where you have a variety of different power players and focal points all competing for people’s attention and money.”</p><p>The proof is in the numbers. “<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/campless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Campless</a>&nbsp;[a secondary market tracking platform created by StockX founder&nbsp;<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/josh-luber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Luber</a>] data from 2014-2015 showed that adidas’ entire aftermarket share in 2014 was less than one percent. By 2015, when the UltraBOOST launched it was at 20%, and when StockX launched in 2016, over half of the secondary sneaker market was adidas” says Einhorn. “Ten of StockX’s top 100 best-selling sneakers in 2016 were UltraBOOSTS. More than 90 percent of all UltraBOOSTS on StockX sold for more than retail. There were more UltraBOOSTS than&nbsp;<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/air-jordan-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Air Jordan 1</a>s on the list in 2016.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>To give a more personal example of just how red-hot demand for the sneaker was, between 2015-17 I essentially had a second job as an UltraBoost reseller, buying second-hand shoes from runners who had been early adopters, repairing and restoring them, then reselling them to sneakerheads for $100-200 profit at a time.</p><figure><figcaption>An example of a restoration job I did on a pair of "OG" UltraBoosts, the very first colourway to release in 2015. I bought them for $40 from someone local who had used them as runners and they were beat to shit. After repainting the midsole, stripping the plastic heelcup and cage to remove scratches and blemishes, deep-cleaning the knit and repainting the UltraBoost logo on the heel, I sold them for $150.</figcaption></figure><p>I love everything about this shoe. I love the idea behind it; that it's something based on innovative technology, a shoe pushing boundaries, trying to do something new in an industry that in so many ways is shackled to the past or copying the innovations of others. I love how they look; the arrowhead knit pattern on the toebox, bubbly midsole and angular cage (the plastic on the side that the laces tied into) made them look like something from a space program, a shoe made for Mars, not Earth. It also helped that, despite their original athletic intent, more subdued colourways proved to be extremely versatile shoes, looking just as good paired with some pants at the pub as they did some shorts at the beach.</p><p>The thing that blew most people away at the time, though, was the comfort. To frame it in video game terms, wearing Boost for the first time in 2015 after decades spent walking on foam felt like the leap from <em>Super Mario World</em> to <em>Mario 64</em>. Nobody had ever walked in a shoe that comfortable before and, thanks to the diminishing returns of sneaker technology since, may never again. To wear UltraBoosts felt like walking on clouds, the midsole able to absorb even the heaviest step, so not only did they look great, but you could also wear them all day.</p><figure><figcaption>One of the more interesting early pairs was this collaboration with Danish brand Wood Wood, which led to a women's shoe with a wrapped cage (left) and a men's shoe that had alternating red and blue features on the left and right sneaker. </figcaption></figure><p>A lot is made of Kanye's involvement in the shoe's popularity in a lot of retrospectives, but I think that's a little overblown. He may have sparked sneakerheads' initial interest in the UltraBoost, but it was Adidas' subsequent laser-sharp marketing of it that <em>really</em> led to the sneaker's success. Sneakers trying to tap into to the streetwear scene normally rely on endorsements from athletes and megacelebs, big licenses and brands (see Nike's recent reliance on Travis Scott and Drake), but the UltraBoost's most sought after releases in its early days were collaborations with boutique fashion outlets, streetwear companies and even menswear websites. Shoes made with/for SNS, Hypebeast, Wood Wood, Highsnobiety, Kolor and Kith really spoke to the scene from the ground level, and made it seem like the UltraBoost was being made <em>just</em> for sneakerheads.</p><p>It helped that these insider collabs resulted in some of the UltraBoost's best designs and colourways. Most were understated, simple, dare I say it even tasteful, but there was still room for further innovation as well: a couple of the collabs had taken note that some experimental fans had started cutting the shoe's plastic cage off, so they simply shipped with their cage already gone. Other early standouts included a pair made of merino wool--procured around 40 mins from my house!--and a line based on college sports programs, with Miami's in particularly being some of the most sought after. I ended up owning a ton of UltraBoosts from this time period, ranging from OGs (the first UltraBoost colourway ever released) to Creams, Kolors (more on those in a minute) to a red pair so bright they were called "Solar Red".</p><figure><figcaption>One of the few 1.0s to elude my grasp are the Solebox collab, which shipped with the sneaker's plastic cage already removed (something the Hypebeast version also managed)</figcaption></figure><p>As incredible as the UltraBoost's run in 2015-16 had been, though, in the world of fashion nothing lasts forever. As the UltraBoost moved into the late 2010's, and Kanye's own Yeezy line of Adidas sneakers increasingly captured a lot of the public's imagination, Adidas started getting sloppy. Rather than continue to refine and release new colourways of the original UltraBoost--now known as the UltraBoost 1.0--in 2016 they had dropped the UltraBoost 2.0, UltraBoost 3 <em>and </em>UltraBoost Uncaged in quick succession, new models that retained the overall shape of the shoe but messed with its visual consistency by switching up the knit pattern. And after getting its collabs so right early on, a shift to corny tie-ins like <em>Game of Thrones</em> sapped the line of some of that hard-earned cred.</p><p>These final days of the UltraBoost's golden age still produced some good efforts from time to time--A Kind of Guise and Engineered Garments' collabs are particular faves of mine--but by 2018, with Adidas having flooded the market with derivative, less appealing UltraBoost models (they'd followed the disappointing UltraBoost 3.0 with...the even uglier UltraBoost 4.0), the writing was on the wall. The original UltraBoost had blown up in part because it was futuristic and interesting, sure, but they were also hard to find, and sneakerheads love nothing more than a shoe that's hard to find. </p><p>I remember when I finally got hold of a pair of Kolors--my all-time favourite colourway, with only a handful of pairs released worldwide--and on a trip to Sydney being repeatedly stopped in the street, and in sneaker stores, by people wanting to talk about them. Once you could just walk into a store and buy a pair of UltraBoosts, pairs that had been produced in their tens of thousands instead of hundreds, for many they became just another pair of general release shoes among countless others options.</p><figure><figcaption>My all-time favourite UB colourway, this is a collaboration with Japanese fashion label Kolor</figcaption></figure><p>Desperate to keep some kind of momentum going, in 2018 Adidas even tried re-releasing two of the most popular early colourways, the OG and Creams, but nothing could be done. <a href="https://proofculture.com/blogs/blog/adidas-ultra-boost-in-memoriam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The circle of hype had run its course, and by 2019 the UltraBoost's golden age was over</a>, with that year's complete redesign--dubbed the UltraBoost 19, and sharing no parts or designs with previous iterations--<a href="https://news.adidas.com/running/adidas-running-unveils-the-new-ultraboost-19--the-most-responsive-ultraboost-ever/s/839ffad4-69b8-4627-b902-027ced52727b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reverting the shoe to its original athletic purpose</a>. Subsequent models have only continued this trend; as they've become less interesting for collectors they've become better and better athletic shoes, culminating in the recently-released UltraBoost 5, <a href="https://believeintherun.com/shoe-reviews/adidas-ultraboost-5x-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is getting the kind of reception among runners the original UltraBoost was supposed to receive</a>.</p><p>While Adidas' shift of focus for the line has taken the UltraBoost 1.0 out of the spotlight, it's not like the shoe is <em>dead</em>. Far from it; a testament to its success is that it's been elevated (as perhaps the most contemporary member) to the ranks of an all-time shoe, a sneaker that will live forever, in a pantheon alongside other eternals like the AJ1 and Superstar. To this day Adidas still releases new 1.0 colourways, still does collabs and given the company's appetite for selling the same shoes forever (Sambas!), will probably do so for as long as there's an Adidas.</p><figure><figcaption>Another classic collab was 2016's Highsnobiety (disclaimer: I have written for the site) x UltraBoost</figcaption></figure><p>I don't want you to think this shoe's story is <em>just </em>about hype, how fickle it can be and how commoditised sneakerheads have become. I mean, it's partly about that, but there's more to it. Loads of shoes are "hyped" and are of zero interest to me, and when the UltraBoost 1.0's light faded I didn't suddenly lose interest in the shoe, like Andy dropping Woody in the trash, nor did the sneaker entirely disappear from the face of the planet. If anything its decline has been great news for me, because as their value has plummeted on the resale market I've been able to get hold of pairs that used to be out of reach for me for relative pocket change!</p><p>The UltraBoost 1.0 isn't just another shoe, and there was more to it than a few years spent as the darling of the sneaker world. The engineering behind it is fascinating. It's an accidental superstar, emerging as a fashion staple when it was supposed to be a performance running shoe. It's a rare example of a huge company--at first, anyway--dealing directly with fans in a way that felt complimentary to a culture, not exploitative of it. Then it's demise is as sad as it was predictable, when that same company inevitably couldn't help itself and squeezed something beautiful to death.</p><p>Like most products, especially ones that end up having "fans", the UltraBoost 1.0 can be admired strictly as an object, sure. But its origins and place in the market at a point in time are just as important to its story as the materials that went into it. And the UltraBoost's story was, for a shoe, one hell of a story.</p><figure><figcaption>Just some of the 1.0s I've owned over the years</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’ve been curious about <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> let’s see if we can answer your questions.</p><h2 id="h26598"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> a direct sequel?</strong></h2><p>It’s been a long while since we’ve received a game in the <em>Arkham</em> series, so you might be delighted to hear that <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> is set within that same universe.</p><p>Taking place between the events of <em>Batman: Arkham Origins</em> and <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>, it casts you as the Caped Crusader once again, as he seeks to protect Gotham City from a fresh threat known as the Rat King. This new villain has abducted a variety of officials from the city, with plans for their execution, giving Batman only a week to rescue them and enact justice once more.</p><p>Despite being part of the grander <em>Arkham</em> universe, though, you shouldn’t feel the need to have played the other games in the series. While there are plenty of references and plot points that franchise fans will no doubt pick up on, <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> remains a perfectly enjoyable standalone Gotham adventure.</p><h2 id="h26599"><a id=""></a><strong>Who developed <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>?</strong></h2><p><em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> was developed by Meta-owned developer Camouflaj, the team behind 2020's fairly well-received PSVR exclusive, <em>Iron Man VR</em>. Before getting bought by Meta to work in-house on VR games, Camouflaj also made episodic stealth game, <em>République</em>.</p><h2 id="h26600"><a id=""></a><strong>What platforms is <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> available for?</strong></h2><p><em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> is exclusively available for the Meta Quest 3 VR headset. As of this writing, Camouflaj has not revealed any plans to bring the game to competing headsets like PlayStation VR2, although given they’re owned by Meta, that seems very unlikely. It’s Meta Quest 3 or nothing if you’re interested in playing it anytime soon.</p><p>The good news is that anyone who buys a Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S before April 25, 2025 will receive <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> included with the purchase of the headset. If you’ve been VR-curious but haven’t taken the plunge yet, I’d say that’s a pretty good incentive!</p><p>That being said, the Meta Quest 3 can feel a bit pricey at $499. If you don’t mind the slight (though admittedly noticeable) downgrade in pixel count and resolution, the Meta Quest 3S retains a lot of the same technology for $299.</p><h2 id="h26601"><a id=""></a><strong>Who voices Batman in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="8f6d68257895a65b2a630fe27c8c473b" data-recommend-id="image://8f6d68257895a65b2a630fe27c8c473b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very VR screenshot of hands extending toward a blue enemy who appears to have giant birthday cake candles on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A very VR screenshot of hands extending toward a blue enemy who appears to have giant birthday cake candles on his back." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Oculus Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8f6d68257895a65b2a630fe27c8c473b" data-recommend-id="image://8f6d68257895a65b2a630fe27c8c473b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very VR screenshot of hands extending toward a blue enemy who appears to have giant birthday cake candles on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fans will be thrilled to hear that <em>Arkham Origins’</em> Roger Craig Smith returns once again to voice The Dark Knight himself. Smith, also known for voicing popular video game characters like Ezio from Assassin’s Creed and Chris Redfield from Resident Evil, is often rated as one of the best actors to bring life to Bruce Wayne and his ass-kicking detective alter ego, since the sad death of Kevin Conroy in 2022.</p><p>Other notable stars in the game include Elijah Wood as Scarecrow, Tara Strong as Harley Quinn, Troy Baker as Harvey Dent, and The Walking Dead’s Khary Payton as The Ratcatcher (not to be confused with the Rat King). All in all, it’s clearly a star-studded cast.<br></p><h2 id="h26602"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>?</strong></h2><p>Many VR games are on the shorter side, so you may be surprised to hear that <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> can take quite a while to complete. As a matter of fact, clearing the game without any side content can take <strong>8 to 10 hours</strong>. If you want to see and do everything in this VR recreation of Gotham City, you can spend up to <strong>15 hours</strong> tracking down various types of collectibles and completing unique challenges.<br></p><hr><p><em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> is available now on Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S for $49.99.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been a couple of month since Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-announced-via-playstation-listing">revealed</a> its beloved dark fantasy action-adventures Legacy of Kain: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 were poised to get the remaster treatment. And now, with the two-game bundle's December release looming, remaster developer Aspyr has detailed a few of the enhancements the spruce-ups will bring.
</p>
<p>
All this comes via a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/22/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-first-look-at-bosses-new-map-details/">post on the PlayStation Blog</a> that's mostly concerned with showing off the games' bosses, so you might want to stay clear - and clear of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsaUOvp6to">trailer</a> below - if you're new to the series or have forgotten everything in the 25-ish years since Soul Reaver 1 launched.
</p>
<p>
What we also get, though, is confirmation of remodelling, retexturing, and, in at least one case, re-sliming to enhance the original boss roster's looks, and that's on top of a "completely redesigned" model for antagonist Kain - necessary to "mitigate textural issues".

<p>
"With the increased polygon count we felt it was important to bring his look a lot closer to the Kain we got to see in the original FMVs, which was a lot more detailed and showed more-or-less what the original intent was for the character," Aspyr notes. "The original model in SR1 was especially limited so now both games have a Kain that looks consistent between the two titles."
</p><p>
Those refreshed looks were at least partly expected, of course, thanks to Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2  Remastered's announcement trailer, but Aspyr has also now confirmed a number of other new features. Both games now include a map and compass, for instance, that Aspr says "blends modern gameplay conveniences with the preservation of the explorative experience the original titles were known for."
</p>
<p>The compass "gently nudges the player in the right direction without giving away specific details of where to go", while the map is described as "more of a reference tool than a guide". Additionally, there's a collection tracker, showing whether players have found all collectibles in each area. But for long-time fans looking to get a slightly more traditional Legacy of Kain experience, Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2's remastered visuals can be switched out for those of the original, and the compass can be turned off in the settings menu.
</p>
<p>
Crystal Dynamics first hinted it was considering a Legacy of Kain revival back in 2022, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-wants-your-thoughts-on-legacy-of-kain">surveyed fans</a> asking if they'd be interested in seeing the series return. And now, some two years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-hears-legacy-of-kain-fans-loudly-and-clearly-following-huge-survey-response">100,000 people responded positively</a>, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered is set to launch for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 10th December.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/football-manager-24-will-not-be-updated-with-2024-25-season-data/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A couple of weeks ago, Sports Interactive announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/football-manager-25-has-now-been-delayed-to-march-2025/">Football Manager 25 had been delayed to March 2025</a>, pushed right back from its November release date and towards the end of the 2024/25 season. This prompted some calls from the community to update Football Manager 24 with the data from the 2024/25 football season. Sports Interactive has now responded to this request, and has had to rule out such an update.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sports Interactive said,<em> “Following the announcement of the delay of FM25, many of you have called for an official FM24 update with season 2024/25 data. This is something we have been exploring since the initial internal conversation about postponing the game’s release. Having now scoped the work that would be required, and despite a good initial response from many of our licensors, we cannot lift assets that we are using in FM25 and make them work in FM24 without recreating them in full. The same applies to many competition rules, translations, and database changes that cannot be back ported. The updated assets and data would both be required to obtain licensor approval-they cannot be separated.&nbsp;</em></p>


<p><em>This is a substantial undertaking which would take critical resources away from delivering FM25 to the highest quality, which we simply cannot compromise on. If you have pre-purchased FM25 and wish to seek a refund please contact your retailer. We sincerely thank you for your patience. We are passionately committed to delivering the best game possible when we release in March 2025.”</em></p>
<p>It is still not clear what impact this will have on the release schedule of future Football Manager games, as it is unlikely that Football Manager 26 will be ready by the end of 2025, unless that is database update only. The switch to a new engine and fundamental changes to the gameplay has already seen features stripped from Football Manager 25 including, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, which should return in future games, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. Football Manager 25 will have the official Premier League license and women’s football for the first time in its history.</p>

The remaster’s existing Performance and Fidelity modes will still be options, and each will run better due to the PS5 Pro’s beefier specs. But a new “Pro” mode will also appear in the settings that runs the game at a native 1440p upscaled to 4K using PSSR while “maintaining” a target framerate of 60fps. </p><p>This is the PS5 Pro experience as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442">architect Mark Cerny described</a></span> in the original reveal. Instead of sacrificing visual quality for smoother framerates, the new hardware can deliver the best of both worlds without compromises. But when it comes to developers actually delivering updates to their games to take advantage of the Pro, there won’t be a one-size-fits-all approach and many games could still end up forcing players to choose between fidelity and framerate, just with fewer trade-offs. </p><p>Remedy Entertainment <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://If you have a high-end PC with the right graphics card, ray tracing on Alan Wake 2 looks great, and we are happy that we can now bring ray tracing to the Pro thanks to its upgraded hardware.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://If you have a high-end PC with the right graphics card, ray tracing on Alan Wake 2 looks great, and we are happy that we can now bring ray tracing to the Pro thanks to its upgraded hardware." target="_blank">also recently revealed</a></span> the PS5 Pro modes for <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which arrives in a physical form this month, one year after release. The horror thriller is taking a different approach than <em>The Last of Us</em>, with two modes for players to choose from on the new hardware. PS5 Pro Quality will run at 30fps with ray-traced reflections and a render resolution of 2176 x 1224 scaled up to 4K. A PS5 Pro Performance mode, on the other hand, will output at 60fps with the image quality of the base PS5 quality mode scaled up to 4K and no ray tracing.</p><p>“If you have a high-end PC with the right graphics card, ray tracing on <em>Alan Wake 2</em> looks great, and we are happy that we can now bring ray tracing to the Pro thanks to its upgraded hardware,” the studio wrote in a blog post. Thanks to PSSR AI upscaling, the team said they decided to focus more on the “signal” quality of the image rendering, rather than just adding more data. The post continued, “These upgraded settings provide the Pro version of<em> Alan Wake 2</em> with a fast response rate combined with a sharper and better-quality image than was previously possible.”</p><p><em>Lies of P</em> is also taking a two-pronged approach to the PS5 Pro update. Its enhanced Quality mode will get a “30 percent” boost to framerate,  director Jiwon Choi <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-developer-details-playstation-5-pro-enhancements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-developer-details-playstation-5-pro-enhancements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a></span> today. The enhanced Performance mode, meanwhile, will now support “full native 4K resolution.” Instead of getting a single “best” mode, last year’s critically acclaimed <em>Dark Souls</em>-inspired game will basically just boost the performance of its existing ones. </p><p>“We believe that frame rate truly matters the most in a premium action RPG,” Choi said. “The precision and fluidity required for this genre are critical to the combat experience. Thanks to the PS5 Pro’s outstanding performance, we’re able to maintain an optimal frame rate at 4K, ensuring the gameplay feels as smooth and responsive as it should.”</p><p>Dozens more games, like <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </em>and <em>Diablo IV</em>, also have PS5 Pro enhancement updates on the way. According to some recent hands-on dispatches from Digital Foundry, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitalfoundry.net/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-4k-60fps-gameplay-on-ps5-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-4k-60fps-gameplay-on-ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tech is more impressive</a></span> than it may have originally seemed over livestream. But the proof will still be in the final product once it’s actually in people’s hands and running the games they actually want to play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-tcgs-twilight-of-the-republic-decks-spotlight-ahsoka-and-general-grievous<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We checked out the newest addition to the Star Wars trading card game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming Star Wars Unlimited TCG set, Twilight of the Republic, is almost here with the release slated for November 8. This is the third installment since the game premiered back in March. It’s still quite young, but there are already so many different types of decks that one can make. In fact, a two-player starter comes with every new set for anyone interested in jumping into SWU for the first time. The Twilight of the Republic starter includes a deck themed around the aggressive and heroic Ahsoka Tano and the Republic’s Clone Trooper army, as well as a deck led by the cunning and villainous General Grievous alongside the Separatist Droid army. With both decks in one package, it’s an easy way to kickstart a player’s venture into a new card game like Star Wars Unlimited with a friend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When a card game is based on an existing series, we usually see game designers attempt to match what’s on the card with how the character or object is portrayed in their respective medium. It guides the playstyle and creation of other cards in the set, and we see some of that in both SWU starter decks. For instance, the Ahsoka Tano deck includes characters from the 501st Legion that she’s a part of, like General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex. The Jedi alongside the Clone army are known for skilled and organized combat, which brings us to one of the new mechanics in this set, Coordinate. This keyword or ability activates when a player controls three or more units on their side of the field. When its requirement is fulfilled, the player can then reap the reward of the newly activated action associated with the card’s Coordinate ability. In Ahsoka Tano’s case, she can command a unit to attack with a +1 power buff as long as her side of the field has at least three units. So if you’re playing with the Ahsoka deck, part of your goal is going wide on the board with units so you can always have more than enough to fulfill the Coordinate ability across all your cards that have that special keyword. That means your opponent will try to dwindle your numbers to prevent that from happening. Thankfully, the deck does include supporting cards to reflect the need to bolster an army like Batch Brothers or Jedi Master Shaak Ti, which can create clone trooper tokens to add to the unit count.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars Unlimited: Twilight of the Republic Two-Player Starter</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the villainous side of this starter pack, we have General Grievou,s who leads the Separatist droid armies in their quest for dominance. Similar to the Ahsoka deck, the General Grievous deck has options to bolster the unit count as well with the help of Battle Droid tokens. Instead of the Coordinate ability, though, the Separatists rely on another new mechanic to the Star Wars card game: Exploit. Unlike Coordinate, Exploit does not buff or support the units already in battle. Instead, this new ability sacrifices units to play more powerful cards for a cheaper cost. For instance, if someone wants to play the Admiral Trench card, that player can defeat up to 1 unit they already control on the field to reduce his cost. Usually, this isn’t such a great trade, since you’re losing one of your units in the process, but cards like the Confederate Courier or Battle Droid Escort have a benefit from being defeated. If you combo the right cards, General Grievous can easily be joined by heavy hitters like the Separatist Super Tank or Hailfire Tank without losing too many units in the process. Of course, using the Exploit ability to its full effect means having units to sacrifice, so in a similar fashion, the General Grievous deck tries to go wide with units just like Ahsoka, but for a different purpose. Meanwhile, cards like Poggle the Lesser and Droid Deployment are a couple of notable options that can help the Separatist army stay in the fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, both decks do a pretty good job of representing the two main factions of the hotly contested Clone Wars. Both rely on large armies, and you can see how different each deck plays with the lore in mind. For a dual starter deck package, it really showcases the new mechanics well, and they both seem pretty balanced right out of the box. In the end, these are starter decks and ultimately they are a jumping-off point to making unique and stronger decks with other cards in the new set, Twilight of the Republic.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/throne-liberty-developer-ncsoft-announces-layoffs-amid-restructure/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/throne-liberty-developer-ncsoft-announces-layoffs-amid-restructure/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>NCSoft, the developers of the popular Throne &amp; Liberty, has announced a “high-intensity restructure” that will see layoffs across the company.</p>



<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20241021021500017?input=1195m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Korean outlet Yonhap</a>.</p>



<p>According to the company, the decision for a restructure and layoffs comes as <a href="https://static-brand.ncsoft.com/ncsoft/invest/result/20240805/report/2Q24_PT_ENG.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">operating profit fell 75%</a> year over year for Q2 2024. In addition, operating profit fell 66% just from Q1 to Q2.</p>



<p>“We reviewed various alternatives to overcome the current situation and discussed it intensely, but we came to the conclusion that it is difficult to overcome it with some symptomatic methods,” NCSoft co-CEOs Kim Taek-jin and Park Byung-moo said in a company-wide email as translated by Microsoft’s translation software. </p>



<p>They continued: “As a result of operating in a way that most of the manpower and functions are concentrated in the headquarters, the company’s financial performance has continued to deteriorate, and it is in danger of becoming a chronic deficit company,” and that this situation “seriously undermines NC’s original creativity and spirit of challenge.”</p>



<p>Since its launch in September, the free-to-play Throne &amp; Liberty has regularly been in the top five of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2429640/charts/#1m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">concurrent players</a> on Steam. The free-to-play MMO has averaged around 150,000 players at a given time while regularly hitting peak counts of 200,000 players at a time.</p>



<p>The week ending October 12, the game was third in weekly active users (WAU) on Steam and 15th on Xbox.</p>



<p>As far as the amount of staff being let go, that information was revealed. Insider Gaming has reached out to NCSoft to get clarification on how many people will be part of the layoffs. This is the second round of layoffs at NCSoft this year.</p>



<p>Since the start of 2024, over <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13,200 known jobs have been lost</a> in the gaming industry. The actual number, however, is around 16,000 when taking into consideration layoffs with no announced totals.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/look-back-is-a-love-letter-to-the-unglamorous-life-of-artists.1016718/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last line spoken in <em>Look Back</em>, an anime adaptation of Tatsuki Fujimoto’s one shot manga of the same name, is, “Why do you draw, Fujino?” This beautiful, heartfelt movie is the answer to its own question.</p><p>Tatsuki Fujimoto is perhaps better known for his best selling series <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, which combines stylish action with sincere character studies of its various offbeat characters. <em>Look Back</em>, which Fujimoto released during a <em>Chainsaw Man</em> hiatus, leans more on the latter than the former. It’s the story of Fujino, an elementary school student who prides herself on being good at drawing manga. She’s considered the best artist in class until Kyomoto, a student who doesn’t come to school due to social anxiety, requests a comics slot in the school newspaper and Fujino learns that this other girl is a <em>much</em> better artist than she. This kickstarts both Fujino and Kyomoto’s lifelong obsession with art, drawing and manga—as well as a life changing friendship between the two of them.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LOOK BACK | Official Trailer 2 - Tickets On Sale Now" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2aE3DtSO98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I saw the anime adaptation of <em>Look Back</em> in theaters this weekend—the movie has a limited engagement in theaters before coming to Amazon Prime on November 7. I think everyone should see this movie in any way they can, but it’s absolutely gorgeous in theaters. In particular, the sequence of Fujino skipping home triumphantly in the rain when she realizes that Kyomoto is an admirer of hers, and not a rival, is my favorite shot from any movie I’ve seen this year. It is a movie that compels the viewer to lose themselves in every frame, even in the most mundane sequences. A shot that <em>Look Back</em> returns to over and over again is Fujino hunched over her desk, drawing for hours on end, alone but engrossed in what she’s creating.</p><p>It was hard not to see myself in Fujino and Kyomoto—I was also a lonely child that devoted my life to my chosen art form (writing). Like Fujino, I’ve grown into an adult whose livelihood revolves around a trade that I started doing for fun as a child. <em>Look Back</em> manages to untangle this complicated relationship to art both in its content, and how it’s been adapted. In an interview after the screening, director Kiyotaka Oshiyama said he drew large portions of the movie himself, on top of writing the screenplay and doing the character designs. At a screening of the film in Japan he said <a href="https://www-oricon-co-jp.translate.goog/news/2329633/full/?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he had been drawing up until noon that very day</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The human labor that goes into art is seemingly on Oshiyama’s mind—in the same post-screening interview, he mentioned that he tried hard to retain the evidence that human beings worked on this film, and said that right now, creative industries are under threat from technology like generative AI. The lush, naturalistic animation of <em>Look Back</em> is a testament not just to Oshiyama’s dedication to his craft, but also the answer to the question that Kyomoto asks Fujino at the end of the film.</p><p>Why does Fujino draw? Why does <em>anyone</em> make art at all? As Fujino says, drawing manga is a pain—your back hurts, you work all day and still have more to do, and the whole process is a hassle. But drawing is what allowed Fujino to reach another person, to change their life and be changed by them. So she keeps drawing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At least once per year, we have some new kid on the block who wants to vie for the throne. They intend to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take down the likes of Battlefield</a>, and most of those titles flop. This year, we have Delta Force by Team Jade, and it’s looking more likely than ever before. First and foremost, being a free-to-play first-person shooter, Delta Force has a much better chance to succeed. But will it? Only time will tell, but interested players don’t have to wait long. Here’s when you can play Delta Force!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-delta-force-release-date">What is the Delta Force Release Date?</h2>



<p>While <span>they technically call the upcoming release date an&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-open-beta-has-a-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open beta</a>, it’s officially launching on Steam</span>. Delta Force will be available on <strong>December 4</strong>, completely free to download and play for anyone who can meet the game’s system requirements. Don’t worry; they’re not tough to meet with your current hardware, so download the game and jump into a match free to test the waters!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-coming-to-playstation-5">Is Delta Force Coming to PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p>While the PC version of Delta Force launches in early December, the console version is currently planned for sometime in Q1 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-console-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to reports</a>. Once the console release date comes to light and we receive concrete information, we’ll update you here, but you should know that Delta Force is indeed coming to PlayStation 5.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-coming-to-xbox-series-x-s">Is Delta Force Coming to Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Delta Force will launch on Xbox Series X|S alongside the PC and PlayStation 5 versions. However, like with the PlayStation version of the free-to-play first-person shooter, there’s no current release date for the Xbox edition. It’ll happen sometime between January and March in Q1 2025, early next year. </p>



<p>Will you give Delta Force a shot on December 4? Do you think it can topple Battlefield? Let us know your thoughts on the FPS in the comments below, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a> to start a thread!</p>

<p>It's been just over two years now since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/john-carmack-leaves-meta-after-a-decade-fighting-to-make-vr-a-reality/">soon-to-depart</a> CTO John Carmack told a Meta Connect audience about his vision for a super low-end VR headset that came in at $250 and 250 grams. "We're not building that headset today, but I keep trying," Carmack <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/carmack-wants-a-250-vr-headset-to-counterpoint-the-1499-quest-pro/">said at the time</a> with some exasperation.</p>
<p>On the pricing half of the equation, the recently released Quest 3S headset is nearly on target for Carmack's hopes and dreams. Meta's new $299 headset is a significant drop from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">the $499 Quest 3</a>&nbsp;and the cheapest price point for a Meta VR headset since the company raised the price of the aging Quest 2 to $400 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/meta-quest-2-vr-headset-price-jumps-100-to-399-gets-zero-new-features/">back in the summer of 2022</a>. When you account for a few years of inflation in there, the Quest 3S is close to the $250 headset Carmack envisioned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Meta must still seriously tackle the "250 grams" part of Carmack's vision. The 514g Quest 3S feels at least as unwieldy on your face as the 515g Quest 3, and both are still quite far from the "super light comforts" Carmack envisioned. Add in all the compromises Meta made so the Quest 3S could hit that lower price point, and you have a cheap, half-measure headset that we can only really recommend to the most price-conscious of VR consumers.</p>
<h2>Meta Quest 2 Plus</h2>
<p>iFixit's <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/101990/metas-quest-3s-is-just-a-revamped-quest-2-and-its-the-better-for-it">recent teardown of the Quest 3S</a> shows that the new headset is more than just a spiritual successor to the cheap <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/what-happened-to-the-virtual-reality-gaming-revolution/">and popular</a> Quest 2. On the contrary, iFixit found the Quest 3S optical stack uses the exact same parts as the Quest 2, right down to the LCD panels and fresnel lenses.</p>


<p>In 2020, the 1832×1920 per-eye resolution offered by that visual stack represented a significant upgrade from what had come before, especially at such a low price point. Today, though, that dated display technology invites direct comparisons to the 2604×2208 per-eye display on last year's Quest 3. With the displays sitting just inches from your eyes, that difference represents a very noticeable 20 percent drop in apparent clarity, down from 25 pixels per degree to a mere 20.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Going back to the 3S after a year spent in the Quest 3 is a bit like walking around in glasses that suddenly have a thin layer of Vaseline smeared on them. Everything looks quite a bit fuzzier, especially near the borders of the display, and edges of objects look distinctly more jagged than on the Quest 3. The difference is especially noticeable when trying to read small text in VR or make out fine details in the real world through the headset's array of passthrough cameras.</p>
<p>It's not quite a retreat to the days of the infamous "screen door effect" that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2014/10/multi-hour-oculus-rift-sessions-are-doing-weird-things-to-my-eyes/">plagued early Oculus-era headsets</a>, but the distinct visual downgrade makes virtual reality experiences that much less convincing and engrossing on the 3S.</p>
<h2>It’s the little things</h2>
<p>The visual downgrades on the Quest 3S extend to the field of view, which narrows from 110 horizontal degrees on the Quest 3 to a mere 97 degrees on the 3S (the vertical field of view sees a smaller reduction from 97 degrees to 93 degrees). This difference isn't as apparent as the drop in resolution between the two headsets, but it does lead to a few more "tunnel vision" moments at the margins. In a game like <em>Beat Saber</em>, for instance, I noticed many of my swings were rendered effectively invisible by the larger black void taking up much of my peripheral vision.</p>

<p>Going back to the fresnel-lens-based Quest 2 visual stack also means doing without the thinner pancake lenses introduced on the Quest 3. The result is an eyebox on the 3S that extends about an inch farther from your face than on the Quest 3. That might not sound like much, but having the lens' center of gravity farther from your face makes the headset feel a bit heavier and the fit a bit less secure as you move your head around in VR.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Then there are the compromises when it comes to fine-tuning the distance between the Quest 3S' lenses. On the Quest 3, an adjustment wheel on the bottom of the headset lets you adjust this interpupillary distance (IPD) continuously, down to the millimeter precision. On the Quest 3S, you instead manually shift the lenses into three preset grooves that are a full 5 millimeters apart. If your face's actual IPD falls in the middle of those 5 mm windows, the result can be the kind of eye strain and trouble focusing that we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/review-we-do-not-recommend-the-299-oculus-quest-2-as-your-next-vr-system/">complained about in our original Quest 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>Meta has also done away with quite a few Quest 3 creature comforts in an apparent effort to keep the Quest 3S price down. The lack of an external depth sensor, for instance, can make things like pass-through video and hand tracking feel a bit more wonky than on the Quest 3. The Quest 3S is missing a standard headphone jack, too, for those still using wired headphones. And the new headset also lacks any automatic face detection, adding the small annoyance of physically tapping the power button to return from sleep mode when you put it back on.</p>

<h2>Spend the extra money</h2>

<p>I've been comparing the Quest 3S to the Quest 3 because that's the decision consumers considering a Meta headset will face today (if they can get over <a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/accounts/account-settings-and-management/meta-accounts-on-quest/">the need for a Meta account</a> to use the headset in the first place). But Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/metas-low-end-300-quest-3s-hits-stores-oct-15/">discontinuation of the aging Quest 2</a> means millions of current Quest 2 owners will soon be faced with the prospect of upgrading or abandoning Meta's VR ecosystem for good, just as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/meta-ends-support-for-original-quest-headset-after-less-than-4-years/">original Quest owners did last year</a>.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>For those current Quest 2 owners, the Quest 3S represents the cheapest way to maintain continued access to Meta's library of VR games and apps. And that library continues to expand with everything from <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/thrasher/7693714067376780/">mind-bending indie games</a> to <a href="https://clawball.com/">quirky multiplayer arenas</a> to single-player adventures like <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/batman-arkham-shadow/"><em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em></a>, which now comes free with every Quest 3 or 3S headset.</p>
<p>But the move from a Quest 2 to a Quest 3S is relatively small, considering the four-year gap between the similarly priced headsets. Yes, you'll notice some significant improvements in the newer headset's full-color pass-through cameras and the headset's maximum frame rate (up from 90 Hz to 120 Hz). The 3S also offers a slightly more future-proofed Qualcomm XR Gen 2 processor (over the Quest 2's original XR processor) and slightly more precise&nbsp;Touch Plus controllers (which are missing the annoying tracking ring on the original Quest 2 controllers).</p>
<p>All told, though, the Quest 3S is far from the generational upgrade from the Quest 2 you might hope for. For that kind of apparent jump, you're much better off shelling out a bit more money for the full-fledged Quest 3. The improvements in form factor, field of view, IPD adjustment, and especially resolution make the higher-end set well worth the extra money. That's especially true if you can manage to track down the now-discontinued 128GB Quest 3, which is <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1776469-REG/meta_quest_899_00579_01_3_advanced_all_in_one_vr.html/">currently being closed out for just $430</a> (compared to $500 for the new 528GB version).</p>
<p>If you simply want the cheapest way to access Meta's library of virtual reality games, the Quest 3S certainly fills that hole in the market. If you want a more robust VR experience that's likely to suffice further into the future, though, the extra investment in a Quest 3 headset is probably worth it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-loot-world-order/1900-6418174/">tepid player response</a> to recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-is-reportedly-getting-barebones-support-as-rocksteady-moves-on-to-new-projects/1100-6523986/">big-budget live-service titles</a> has left many fans of the genre--this writer included--wondering which studio would be next to unveil a new live-service shooter in an era that is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-didnt-care-about-concord-until-i-played-it/1100-6524530/">already oversaturated with them</a>. After the striking failure of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/">Concord</a>, who would be brave enough to step onto the stage and attempt to sell players on their latest live-service creation?</p><p dir="ltr">Rather unexpectedly, the answer is 2K Games, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-games-unveils-new-hero-shooter-project-ethos-and-you-can-play-it-today/1100-6527220/">revealed its newest title last week</a>. Known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-ethos/">Project Ethos</a>, 2K's new free-to-play title was developed by 31st Union, which describes the game as a "third-person roguelike hero-shooter." If you're wondering what the hell that means, you're not alone, but after attending the game's hands-on preview event and getting a feel for Project Ethos, I'm pretty well-equipped to explain the game's (admittedly somewhat convoluted) premise.</p><p dir="ltr">31st Union is the first to admit that the game's concept is a little difficult to describe in a concise manner, declaring in a recent press release, "The best way to learn about Project Ethos is to play it."</p><p dir="ltr">Here's the general gist: Project Ethos is a third-person extraction hero-shooter with a hint of roguelike flavor sprinkled on top. Its "signature mode" is called Trials, which sees teams of three players select characters from the game's six-hero lineup before dropping into a 20-minute match. When joining, you can find yourself spawning in mid-match, meaning you can potentially get squashed by an enemy team with better loot shortly thereafter. Guns are exclusive to each character, so looting is focused on picking up health items, primary and secondary ammo, gadgets with useful abilities, and body shields.</p><p dir="ltr">Within the match are various timed PvE events very similar to those seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>. Completing these events rewards players with loot, including Trials Cores, which are the game's main currency. Naturally, players must keep an eye out for other enemy teams who may also arrive to take part in a timed PvE event, but it's generally pretty easy to sufficiently loot up before bumping into your first squad of enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, players continue completing events and battling other teams, both of which are a means of collecting Trials Cores. Similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a>, injured players are first downed and can be picked back up by their squadmates. If a revive doesn't happen fast enough (or the enemy is still spraying bullets), downed players will eventually bleed out, at which point their squad must locate and make use of a Respawn Beacon to bring back their fallen brethren.</p><p dir="ltr">At any point during the match, players can head for the extraction point. It's clearly marked on the map, and the earlier you show up, the more likely you are to successfully escape unscathed. As it turns out, all those Trials Cores you've collected over the course of the match have a little catch: If your squad dies before successfully extracting, you don't get to keep any of them. The longer you stay alive, the more Cores you can accumulate, but the longer you wait to hit the extraction point, the more likely you are to find it crowded with several enemy teams all duking it out. Accumulate enough Cores, and you'll soon find that a temporary bounty has been placed on your head, allowing other players to more easily hunt you down. (This is usually a good time to book it to the extraction point.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388319-evolutions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388319-evolutions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388319"></a><figcaption>Evolutions provide another layer of gameplay customization, and work wonderfully with specific Augments</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388319-evolutions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you've successfully extracted, you can visit vendor NPCs in the lobby to exchange Trials Cores for Augments. Augments are powerful, permanent perks that allow players to tailor the game's individual heroes to their own personal playstyle, and though I didn't get a chance to unlock many of them during my time with Project Ethos, I did find them interesting and unique. Augments can morph an up-close-and-personal skirmisher into a skirmisher who also excels at range, give a healer a more defensive edge, and much more.</p><p dir="ltr">The second mode 2K presented during Project Ethos previews is called Gauntlet Mode. Gauntlet is Project Ethos's competitive tournament mode, forcing multiple squads of players to face off with each other one by one. Heroes can be (temporarily) upgraded between each match, and the ultimate goal is to be the only squad standing at the end of each round. Players who bite the dust in this mode cannot be respawned by teammates, but will automatically respawn at the beginning of the next round. The first squad to snag three victories wins. There's no PvE to speak of, nor are there any Trials Cores to collect, but winners do get medals, and Gauntlet essentially functions as the game's ranked mode. We didn't get to see or hear as much about Gauntlet Mode as we did Trials Mode, so some of the details surrounding it remain unclear.</p><p>Each of the game's six heroes come with two weapons (one light, one heavy), two unique abilities, and a collection of character-exclusive Evolutions. Evolutions work a lot like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-all-legend-upgrades-and-shield-cores-explained/1100-6521025/">the Legend Upgrades seen in Apex</a>. As players take down enemies, pick up Evolution Nodes, and improve the strength of their armor, they're periodically prompted to pick one of three Evolutions (which appear to be randomly selected from the dozen or so Evolutions that are exclusive to each character). Unlike Augments, Evolutions only last for the duration of the match, but some of them are surprisingly powerful, and they seem to improve on Apex's Legend Upgrade formula quite a bit. The random selection of Evolutions to choose from keeps things fresh and prevents players from always leaning on a single specific Evolution, forcing them to try out new ability buffs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388321-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388321" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388321-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388321"></a><figcaption>Some of Project Ethos's heroes have bland designs, while others have a more unique look.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388321-prism.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The heroes themselves are both my favorite and least favorite part of Project Ethos. On one hand, these characters are undeniably fun to play once you get the hang of Project Ethos's gameplay loop. On the other hand, they look derivative, uninspired, and aren't especially eye-catching (though that could certainly change before the game launches). As someone who isn't a fan of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>-esque art styles, I found Project Ethos to be pretty underwhelming from a visual perspective. The game certainly has a few cool character designs--Prism is easily the most unusual-looking hero--but in their current state, Project Ethos's playable characters don't exactly inspire much interest or curiosity about who they are or why they're involved with Project Ethos.</p><p>Unfortunately, the heroes' abilities are not particularly unique, either. The first character to really grow on me was Breeze, a rocketeer with the ability to move quickly. But when playing her, it's impossible to ignore the similarities she shares--both physically and ability-wise--with some of Apex's titular Legends. The first issue is that Breeze is a dead-ringer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bangalore-guide-apex-legends/1100-6465107/">Apex's Bangalore</a>, to the point that they almost look like identical twins. The resemblance is so uncanny that multiple preview attendees remarked on how similar the two characters look. Even worse, Breeze's abilities are effectively Bangalore's Rolling Thunder and Smoke Bomb abilities combined with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valkyrie-guide-apex-legends/1100-6502749/">Valkyrie</a>'s Missile Swarm and VTOL Jets abilities. Breeze is the most egregious example, but she's far from the only character in the game to share striking similarities with the appearances and abilities of characters that already exist in Apex Legends, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/">Valorant</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388364-breezenbangs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388364" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388364-breezenbangs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388364"></a><figcaption>Breeze's resemblance to Apex Legends' Bangalore is hard to deny.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388364-breezenbangs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But regardless of their physical appearances and familiar-feeling abilities, Project Ethos's characters can be quite a lot of fun to play. The game's developers were clearly not afraid to make powerful heroes with powerful abilities that are fun to use. As long as you use your abilities (and your head), you can reliably gain the upper hand in conflicts with enemy teams, even if their aim is better than yours. Pushing players to think ahead and plan their moves instead of solely relying on good aim is definitely one of Project Ethos's biggest strengths.</p><p>Another of the game's major strengths is movement. Project Ethos shines when it comes to getting around the map. Sliding is actually useful, allowing players to build momentum, jump on ziplines, and hop into strange purple energy fields that will fling them into the air, similar to the Gravity Cannons of Apex Legends. Project Ethos' gunplay feels good as well. The game's weapons feel punchy and are satisfying to use, TTK feels balanced (players won't drop instantly, but you also won't find yourself wondering how the enemy is still alive after emptying three clips into them), hitboxes seem appropriately sized, maps are well-designed (if not exactly stunning), and characters have fun-to-use abilities (even though they feel a bit copy-pasted). Calling Project Ethos a roguelike might be a bit of a stretch, especially given how much <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/never-say-roguelike" rel="nofollow">the meaning of the term has changed</a> over the years, but it's certainly a fun time. <span>The bounty mechanic is especially challenging, and surviving the match despite the target on your back feels like a genuine achievement.</span></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388387-bounty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388387" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388387-bounty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388387"></a><figcaption>Bounties alert all players in a match to the location of the player who has collected the most Trials Cores.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4388387-bounty.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Overall, Project Ethos feels like a combination of Apex's movement, Overwatch's character abilities, Destiny 2's mid-match events and NPC-filled lobby, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-without-building-is-permanent-as-epic-reveals-zero-build-mode/1100-6501976/">Fortnite's Zero Build mode</a> gameplay and art style. Is it enjoyable? Yes. Is it a roguelike? That's debatable. The use of "roguelike" in Project Ethos' marketing seems more like a buzzword than an apt description of the game, which feels nothing like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac/">The Binding of Isaac</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb/">Cult of the Lamb</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/">Hades</a>, or other titles one tends to think of when they hear the word "roguelike." Fans of Fortnite and Apex Legends, however, will likely have a good time, but in a genre this crowded and competitive, I'm not sure mere enjoyability will be enough to make Project Ethos a success.</p><p dir="ltr">31st Union hasn't yet announced a release date for Project Ethos, and it's clear the developers are extremely eager for player feedback, which I think is commendable. "Live service is a conversation," one developer said during previews, while other members of the dev team walked around asking players what their thoughts on the game were. It's very clear that 2K is attempting to carefully test the waters here rather than expecting everyone to instantly fall in love with Project Ethos, and their attention to player feedback is clear. During previews, I even noticed a dev taking notes as a player shared their critiques.</p><p dir="ltr">Project Ethos isn't a groundbreaking masterpiece at this moment in time, but it's also not a lazy, sloppily assembled mess. Its biggest flaws at the moment are its lack of a distinct identity and the absence of a unique gameplay hook. Project Ethos has an interesting plot (which players can read up on by unlocking various in-game lore text) that revolves around AI taking over the world, but its bland visuals and recycled hero abilities make it feel rather unremarkable, despite its genuinely enjoyable gameplay. After five years of development, 31st Union is clearly excited to share its creation with players. But thankfully, the studio wasn't overconfident enough to stroll into the graveyard that is live-service gaming in 2024--ignoring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/">Overwatch 2's pitchfork-riddled existence</a> and stepping over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/concord-is-shutting-down-after-two-weeks-but-is-that-unprecedented/2900-5747/">Concord's still-twitching corpse</a>--to proudly announce to the world that Project Ethos is officially the Next Big Thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, 31st Union's dev team is taking a much wiser approach: They're not bothering to implement monetization and microtransactions until the game is closer to launch, they're <em>asking</em> players what they want, and perhaps most importantly, they aren't expecting anyone to take a $40 trust-fall in order to try out the game.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth remembering that the biggest threat live-service games are facing right now is the fact that although people are playing more games every year, the <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-gamers#number-of-gamers" rel="nofollow">number of people who play video games isn't rising nearly as quickly</a>. Since live-service games tend to require a fairly significant time investment, most people can only play a few titles regularly. To succeed, 2K and 31st Union will have to overcome a massive challenge: not simply convincing players to try out Project Ethos, but wooing players enough to make them want to ditch one of their current favorite titles in favor of it. In its current state, I'm not sure that's something the game can pull off, but if given enough time and attention, it could certainly earn a positive response from players once it launches.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Project Ethos isn't visually gripping, nor does it really have a unique schtick to lean on (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate-2/">Splitgate 2</a>'s portals). What it does have is a team of developers who appear to genuinely care about what their players think, and a good deal of potential. Whether that potential blossoms or withers is entirely dependent upon what the game's creators are planning next. More playtests, a beta phase, and a few character redesigns would certainly do the game some good. If 2K plans to launch Project Ethos sometime in the very near future, my opinion of it likely won't change. But if it's given a bit more time in the oven, I think there's hope for the game's future--provided the developers spend that time figuring out who exactly this game is meant for.</p>

But I also worry that the involvement of so many people may lead to it feeling less like a cohesive movie and more like a jarring series of scenes that have been awkwardly stitched together. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Just days after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-stealthy-season-14-grapple-guns-toward-an-october-release-date">stealth-focused Season 14</a>, developer Rare has yanked nearly all its new features - including the ability to crouch and don disguises - acknowledging "significant issues" arising from their addition to the game.
</p>
<p>
Rare had already been forced to disable a number of flagship new features ahead of Seasons 14's launch last week - that is, the ability to lay traps and to hang from ledges - as a result of stability concerns and a "high player impact issue" discovered during a final round of testing. As such, its  decision to now remove crouching and disguises means only a tiny fraction of Season 14's announced features are currently available to players.
</p>
<p>
Speaking in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwUlQFtY-rw">video update</a> detailing the "drastic steps" earlier today, Sea of Thieves production director Drew Stevens explained the arrival of crouching had "introduced a number of knock-on effects to the wider experience". More specifically, it had lead to the return of a number of PvP exploits Rare has previously tried to stamp out, including the ability for players to switch weapons faster than intended and to control their air movements after blasting from a canon. Rare has also identified an invincibility exploit.

<figcaption>And here's everything that was <em>supposed</em> to be in Sea of Thieves' Season 14.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylreFrrXbOo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"We're really unhappy about the quality of Season 14's launch", Stevens acknowledged in his video update, adding that Rare is "taking this situation very seriously". He went on to explain the studio's first priority is "stabilising" the player experience, and it'll begin re-enabling features once it's "confident they meet our quality bar". 
</p><p>
Crouching and disguises were temporarily disabled during emergency maintenance earlier today and the hope is to bring them back as part of a hot fix targeting "high impact issues" scheduled for next week. Stevens said that rather than rushing its release and "compounding issues further", Rare wants to ensure next week's hot fix brings "meaningful" improvements and is given "the necessary time [in] internal quality assurance".
</p>
<p>
As for traps and ledge hanging, the studio hopes to re-enable them as part of its regularly scheduled monthly update in November, which also promises "further fixes, improvements, and balancing changes". This update will see Rare trialling a new process behind-the-scenes that's intended to provide "longer time and focus for our internal testing" and allow for "additional hardening" with Insiders. If everything goes to plan, all commendations, rewards, and achievements associated with the currently disabled features should also return.
</p>
<p>
"We all understand how frustrating this has been," Stevens continued. "I know I've spoken about it before, and I'm sure you're sick of hearing it, but we know we need to do better here, and Season 14 has suffered from a lack of quality control... We're going to be all hands on deck through the next releases to get back in control of game quality".
</p>
<p>
Following today's changes, the only key Season 14 additions still currently enabled are the grappling gun and new blowdart weapon. And as to what's next for Sea of Thieves - beyond the steady reintroduction of those currently missing features - Rare hasn't yet said. Season 14 marks the end of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-bumper-2024-bringing-windy-horns-grapple-guns-a-roaming-warship-and-loads-more">2024 release roadmap it shared back in March</a>, so it's unlikely the studio will be ready to share any major future plans until the year is through.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/state-of-decay-2-final-update-38-patch-notes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Undead Labs has released the 38th and final update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/state-of-decay-2">State of Decay 2</a>, as they look to put the full team’s efforts into the sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-gets-a-big-re-reveal-with-a-new-story-trailer/">State of Decay 3</a>.</p>
<p>State of Decay 2 Update 38 puts a bow on things with a focus on fixing some long-standing issues, making some quality of life improvements, making gated and seasonal content more freely available, and even adding a batch of new cosmetics as a parting thank you.</p>


<p>Originally releasing in 2018, State of Decay 2 has now had a solid six years of support from Undead Labs. It launched on Xbox One and PC <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/17/state-of-decay-2-review/">in a pretty rough state</a> – echoing the first game – but still with plenty of appeal and charm. With the Juggernaut Edition and Xbox Series X|S enhancements, and the steady stream of updates, the game is now in a very good place, looking at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2_Juggernaut_Edition/#app_reviews_hash">the Steam reviews</a>.</p>
<p>The sequel was announced back in 2020 during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/state-of-decay-3-xbox-series-x-pc-trailer/">Xbox Series X|S summer showcase</a>, but it took four long years before we would see the game reappear, a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-gets-a-big-re-reveal-with-a-new-story-trailer/">re-reveal coming at this year’s summer showcase</a>. The third game looks to lean even further into the community side of the game, jumping ahead in time some more and featuring a larger, truly shared world.</p>

<h2>Quality of Life Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<p>Water will Slow Vehicles – Water resistance will now reduce vehicle speed while travelling through lakes and waterways. Be sure to choose the right vehicle type for the job as each handles differently. A 4×4, for example, will outperform a Sports Coupe in the water.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<p>Community Inventories – While over in the base, you can now access individual Survivors’ inventories from the Community screen, allowing you to quickly view or equip their items, transfer items between you, or store their gear (including rucksacks) into base storage. No more hunting around the base to find the Survivor you need!</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<p>Zombie spawning has been removed after certain noise events – Failed search crashes and door slams will no longer spawn new zombies. These noise events will now simply attract already existing zombies to the location.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>We’ve reduced the distance at which characters automatically attempt to climb down from ledges. Additionally, characters will no longer attempt to climb down unintentionally whilst the player is aiming, which could often lead to some frustrating moments.</li>
<li>Rucksacks can now be deposited at claimed Landmark Outposts.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The likelihood of the Blood Donor Enclave Arc appearing has been adjusted to match that of the other Arcs.</li>
<li>The Blood Donor Morale Bonus has been adjusted to +6 Community Morale, down from the previous value of +15, which was deemed too strong.</li>
<li>The following weapons can be obtained as rewards for defeating the Black Heart and killing a Jugg during the Gargantua Mutation Curveball: RTX Piranha, RTX Rampart, RTX Cyclone, RTX Cyclone Tactical, and MCX Osprey RT.</li>
<li>In response to community feedback that it was appearing too frequently, the delay and cooldown for the Bangernomics Curveball have been somewhat increased.</li>
<li>There is now a chance for new characters to receive the Blood Donor trait.</li>
<li>Prone Zombies set up to ambush now have an increased sight range from 1m to 6m, allowing them to react more quickly to approaching characters.</li>
<li>The health of the Gargantua Mutation Juggernauts has been increased for each level of Impact in the Curveball Settings.</li>
<li>The Haven Device has been rebalanced to improve it’s overall effectiveness. It will now have a noticeable presence over the course of multiple waves during a base siege.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Gameplay Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved the reliability of the automatic ladder interaction which would sometimes fail, causing the character to walk right over the ladder and fall from a height.</li>
<li>You can now build a staging area after claiming the Leeds Concrete Silos landmark. Additionally, the previous issue of the ‘Elimination of Daily Materials Cost’ stacking has been resolved.</li>
<li>Using heavy weapons now correctly grants Endurance XP as intended.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Zombie and Combat Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in which Zombies sometimes became unresponsive after getting stuck in their idle state.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which the finisher prompt appeared when a finishing move could not be executed due to lack of stamina.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which Zombies would sometimes attack and magnetically teleport towards survivors on upper levels.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a downed hostile human would remain incapacitated indefinitely.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where melee attacks missed when they should have hit.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Ferals could instantly destroy certain vehicles by attaching to and attacking specific points.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in which Blood Plague Bloaters were not appearing in Heartland Hordes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Curveball Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Radio Silence Curveball could not appear correctly in Drucker County, Cascade Falls, and Meagher Valley.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where Ignited Zombies during the Fuelling the Plague Curveball were not receiving any damage from weapons.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where Armored Zombies persisted after the Lost Platoon Curveball had expired.</li>
<li>Removed the unintended instances where the same Curveball could appear twice simultaneously.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug that caused Curveball objectives to be unpinned or removed from the Goals menu when their Optional Objective was completed.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where some Curveball effects did not update after changing Impact in the Curveball settings.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Vicious Rumours Curveball displayed incorrect values when adjusting the impact in the Curveball settings. Previously, the ‘Less Influence Received from Selling’ minor effect had major values, and vice versa, causing the curveball to reduce the influence gained from trading more than intended.</li>
<li>Resolved various issues where the Vicious Rumours Curveball did not increase the radio prices for the Independence Pack and the Locate Plague Heart radio command.</li>
<li>Adjusted Vicious Rumours to display the correct sell prices when the Curveball is active.</li>
<li>Adjusted the Curveball Stamina action effects in ‘Up and At Em’ and ‘Under the Weather’ to account for all stamina-cost actions.</li>
<li>Reimplemented the damage warning that triggers when entering the Toxic Miasma of a Black Heart.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which Curveballs appearing could cause a crash on multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mission Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resolved a crash issue that occurred when approaching the mission location for one of the ‘Mysterious Broadcast’.</li>
<li>Resolved the issue where Zombies from infestations were not spawning in taller buildings (such as the Factory Husk in Heartland), which prevented clearing the infestation and potentially blocking certain missions.</li>
<li>Resolved an exploit in Heartland where the CLEO Supply drop mission could be bypassed by leaving the site and returning to zero Zombies, which auto-completed the mission. Now, the mission will be abandoned and must be redone.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in ‘Living in a Materials World’ where the optional objective might be impossible to complete under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in ‘Builder Legacy: Useful Utilities’ where Energy Drinks now count towards completing the objective of building an item that requires power or water</li>
</ul>
<h4>UI and Settings Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reduced max curveball cards visible in the journal and introduced enhancements to the functionality, user interface, and reliability of the Curveball Journal Page, including correct presentation of different languages in the prompt bar.</li>
<li>Resolved the issue of community names being truncated on the community selection screen.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the FOV value reset after updating the Accessibility settings.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with luxury crates missing exclamation marks on certain items.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug where the vehicle UI indicated it was destroyed even after being repaired with a toolkit.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue with inconsistent appearance and function for the ‘Drop’ prompt on your character inventory when interacting with a vehicle trunk.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the Locker Icon disappeared at short distances, making it difficult to find.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the Curveballs have Awoken notification appeared every time a session was reloaded.</li>
</ul>
