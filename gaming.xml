            <p>The release dates for an upcoming expansion pack for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> have seemingly leaked via the Nintendo Store. The first part of the Crossroads Of The World collection, slated for "early March" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-post-launch-plans-include-free-multiplayer-and-age-features-and-paid-ada-lovelace">in the official roadmap</a>, is indeed listed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iz5ehp/the_release_dates_for_both_upcoming_expansions/">the leaked image</a> as due on March 4th, 2025, with the second part due on March 25th - lining up with the roadmap's "late March".</p>
<p>Specifically, March 4th brings three separate items: the Ada Lovelace, Carthage, and Great Britain packs. On the 25th of the month, they'll be joined by Simon Bolivar, Bulgaria, and Nepal.</p>
<p>The are some discrepancies on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-VII-2637632.html#dlcItems">the UK Nintendo store</a>, however, with the release dates for each of the packs from the first set also listed as 25/03/2025. </p>

<p>These are all part of a single <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3004660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII_Crossroads_of_the_World_Collection/">Steam store item</a>, released in two parts over the course of the month. The Crossroads Of The World expansion also includes the 'wonder pack', which includes the Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca natural wonders. Based on the current Steam reviews, I gather it was part of some sort of super shiny edition or other, but looking at edition versions makes my back and soul ache these days.</p>
<p>"A mostly successful effort to address major criticisms of previous Civilization games," reckoned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Greg Costikyan in his review for RPS</a>. "with some drawbacks and terrible combat UX."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, February 27, The Pokemon Company held its Pokemon Presents event for February 2025. The event coincides with Pokemon Day, a day to honor the original Japanese release of Pokemon Red and Green on February 27, 1996. </p>



<p>While nothing was confirmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for the event</a>, it should be expected that players will get a new look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A, Pokemon Go, Pokemon TCG Pocket, and, possibly, a look at Pokemon gameplay running on Nintendo Switch 2. There is also speculation of a remake of Pokemon Black and White in the works along with the next games in the “Let’s Go” series.</p>



<p>Follow along as everything is announced. Because this is a running article throughout the show, make sure you refresh starting at 9am ET/2pm GMT for everything announced.</p>



<p>And be sure to let us know your thoughts on the showcase in the comments or join the discussion further in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. It’s worth noting that everything is in the order it was shown.</p>

            <p>
Eternal Strands, the well-received action-RPG from Dragon Age boss Mike Laidlaw's Yellow Brick Games studio, has shared its latest roadmap, promising - among other things - free DLC created in collaboration with Final Fantasy concept artist Yusuki Mogi and, separately, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a> studio Grasshopper Manufacture.
</p>
<p>
Eternal Strands, if you're in need of a refresher, launched last month, inviting players to follow the adventures of Brynn - a member of a dwindling group of magic users known as the Weavers - who sets out across a fantasy kingdom ravaged by a cataclysmic magical event to uncover its mysteries and recover her people's cultural home.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, it borrows bits from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, with a bit of Monster Hunter thrown in - a mix Christian Donlan reckoned made for a "combustible and hilarious sandbox" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-strands-review">four star Eurogamer review</a>.

<p>
And now, with Eternal Strands' first month of release almost behind it, Yellow Brick Games is ready to start discussing its post-launch plans. And that begins with a "Day 30 Patch" coming in March and promising a range of enhancements. There's talk of improved character movement to reduce its "slippery" sensation, for instance, as well as improved combat responsiveness, reduced Umbral Darter presence in certain areas, bug fixes, and more.
</p>
<p>
Then it's onto the fun stuff. Sometime this "spring", Eternal Strands will receive its first free DLC. This'll see Yellow Brick teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and XVI concept artist Yusuke Mogi to design and introduce a new in-game epic, a new armour set, and new weapon skins. Eternal Strands' spring update also promises a new map and magic power, a weapon and armour dying system, Oria's tips and tricks, plus further bug fixes.
</p>

 </a>

<p>
That'll eventually lead into summer, when Eternal Strands' second free DLC update arrives. This is a collaboration with No More Heroes studio Grasshopper Manufacture, and is set to deliver currently unspecified "new content", among other things.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of March's first major patch release, Yellow Brick has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1491410/announcements/detail/506195909797741133">shared developer notes</a> outlining its key changes in more detail. Additionally, the studio is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalStrands/comments/1iuunkp/ama_with_the_devs_feb_27_11am_et/">set to hold an Eternal Strands Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> this Thursday, 27th February at 4pm GMT, where it'll be nattering about everything from the game's lore to the future features and content it has planned.

          <p>Game studio Monolith, part of Warner Bros. Games until <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure">yesterday's multi-studio shutdown</a>, had a notable track record across more than 30 years, having made <em>Blood, </em><em>No One Lives Forever</em>, <em>Shogo: Mobile Armor Division</em>, <em>F.E.A.R., </em>and, most recently, the Lord of the Rings series, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/09/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-a-shadow-of-its-own-ambition/"><em>Shadow of Mordor</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/shadow-of-war-hands-on-latest-lotr-game-will-be-hard-but-will-it-be-fun/"><em>Shadow of War</em></a>.</p>
<p>Those games, derived from J.R.R. Tolkien's fiction, had a "Nemesis System," in which the enemies that beat the player or survive a battle with them can advance in level, develop distinct strengths and weaknesses, and become an interesting subplot and motivation in the game. Monolith's next game, the now-canceled <em>Wonder Woman,</em>&nbsp;was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyA8lnp9Tzg">teased more than three years ago</a>, and said to be "powered by the Nemesis System."</p>
<p>Not only will <em>Wonder Woman</em> not be powered by the Nemesis System, but likely no other games will be, either, at least until August 2036. That's when "Nemesis characters, nemesis forts, social vendettas and followers in computer games," patent <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160279522A1/en">US2016279522A1</a>, is due to expire. Until then, any game that wants to implement gameplay involving showdowns, factions, and bitter NPC feelings toward a player must either differentiate it enough to avoid infringement, license it from Warner Brothers, or gamble on WB Games' legal attention.</p>
<p>It's bad enough that talented developers were let go. That one of their most notable innovations ends up locked up in a corporate vault, for more than a decade after they ceased to exist, is quite the sad footnote.</p>
<h2>Nobody wants to end up&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>'d</h2>

</a>That WB Games was granted this patent is eye-opening, but not necessarily shocking. For 20 years, Namco held <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/12/loading-screen-boredom-may-behind-us-thanks-to-expiring-patent/">a patent on loading screen mini-games</a>. That patent was issued despite plenty of "loading screen games" existing before 1995, including&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_loader#Cassette_tapes"><em>Invade-a-load</em></a>.

He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Of the three major gaming consoles, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">Xbox Series X</a> / S may have the most diverse controller selection, but Microsoft’s basic <strong>Xbox Wireless Controller</strong> is still the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s">best Xbox controller</a> for most people. That’s mostly because it’s the cheapest one you can buy with native support for Xbox’s built-in wireless protocol (you can also use it with PC and mobile via Bluetooth or USB-C), but it’s also just really solid overall.</p><p>It’s hard to beat the value, especially when they’re on sale for as low as $39, just a few dollars more than their all-time low, as they are in select colors at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4HLCPR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Carbon-Black%2F1361877204" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> right now. That’ll get you the basic crop of colors such as black, white, and blue. You can spend a bit more to get the awesome translucent models, which are starting at $57.50 (about $12 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DC8317V9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Carbon-Black%2F9585711722" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->39</span></p><div><p>The official Xbox Wireless Controller has a dedicated share button for saving clips and screenshots and sharing them online, Bluetooth support, and a USB-C port for charging up Microsoft’s play-and-charge rechargeable battery.</p></div></div><p>The Xbox Wireless Controller isn’t loaded with fancy features and gimmicks like newer, more expensive controllers. You can’t easily remove or replace any of its parts, for example, nor does it have back buttons, sensitivity adjustments, or built-in means for customizing and swapping button mapping configurations. But it still sets the standard for how a controller should look, feel, and work. The ergonomic shape and button layout are still the most widely emulated of any controller, perhaps ever.</p><p>Some people still scoff that it doesn’t have a rechargeable internal battery, but that’s a point in its favor. Its versatile battery bay lets you either use standard AA batteries or slot in a rechargeable pack. Some of those batteries offer much more play time than controllers with built-in batteries. You’ll never have to plug it in or dock it if you have a charged spare handy, and you won’t have to dismantle an entire controller or shell out for a replacement once they run dry</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The series started as a first-person dungeon crawler akin to other classic RPGs like Wizardry and Shin Megami Tensei, but other entries have experimented with other styles of dungeon crawling, including Fia and the Wondrous Academy's top-down Mystery Dungeon-style gameplay. Despite running for over thirty years, Fia and the Wondrous Academy is only the second Mado Monogatari game to get an English localization. The previous game in the series, Sorcery Saga: Curse of the Great Curry God, was also launched in North America on Vita in 2014 and then ported to PC in 2018. Like Fia and the Wondrous Academy, Sorcery Saga: Curse of the Great Curry God is also a top-down roguelike mystery dungeon with randomized dungeons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Striking Distance, the studio behind The Callisto Protocol, has unfortunately been struck with more layoffs, as confirmed by parent company Krafton. The information began surfacing online earlier today, with former Director of Concept Art Jesse Lee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing a post</a> on Linkedin, saying "most of the devs were laid off."</p>
<p>It was then confirmed later in the day by Krafton, where they gave a statement to PC Gamer about what had happened. Krafton has declined to put a number on the amount of layoffs that had been made but said that they were done to keep the team "agile."</p>
<p>"<em>Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile, which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development. The studio remains operational, and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time,"&nbsp;</em>said a representative.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the first round of layoffs that Striking Distance has experienced. Layoffs took place in August 2023, where 32 people lost their jobs. The Callisto Protocol was a mixed bag out of the gate, with a lot of people having <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-pc-experience-is-an-unacceptable-stutterfest/">issues with stuttering</a>, especially on PC. The game had some pretty high-end demands. However, the game was a significantly smoother experience on a console. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">Kai Tatsumoto reviewed the game</a> two years ago and gave it a 7.2.</p>
<p>With the failure of The Callisto Protocol, <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/">Glen Schofield</a> left Striking Distance in September 2023, which was just over a month after layoffs took place.</p>
<p>Striking Distance then made a top-down shooter after The Callisto Protocol, but that game also failed, with an all-time peak concurrent player count on Steam of 169. Considering how much money went into developing The Callisto Protocol, with the game costing over $<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-reportedly-cost-over-160-million-to-make/">160 million</a> to make and then not performing as well as they had hoped, this was devastating news for the company.</p>
<p>There is now news that the company is reportedly working on a new title that is being developed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-working-on-a-brand-new-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-title/">Unreal Engine 5</a>. Lead Gameplay Programmer of Striking Distance has on his LinkedIn profile that he is "leading a team of 12 gameplay engineers" to make this upcoming title.</p>
<p>So far, this year has already seen a devastating amount of layoffs across a number of companies, both big and small. Most recently, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/"> entire Marvel Rivals team</a> was laid off, as well as a significant number of staff at <a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-scales-back-team-focusing-on-lost-skies-development/">Bossa Games</a>.</p>

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s technically already Pokémon Day in Japan, and while we’re still a few hours away from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616289/pokemon-presents">this year’s big Pokémon Presents showcase</a>, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/617216/oh-yes-wait-a-minute-mr-postmon">a new animated short film</a> out that right now feels like the perfect way to get pumped up for whatever surprises Nintendo has in store.</p><p>Many of the Pokémon Company’s animated projects outside of the mainline anime have been fun explorations of what people and their pokémon get up to besides battling. But director Maho Aoki’s <em>Dragonite and the Special Delivery</em> also feels like a reminder to thank your mail carriers for all the hard work they do. Produced by CoMix Wave Films — the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/15/23678724/makoto-shinkai-suzume-interview"><em>Suzume</em></a>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113522/weathering-with-you-review-climate-change-makoto-shinkai">Weathering With You</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/7/15209584/your-name-love">Your Name</a></em> — <em>Dragonite and the Special Delivery </em>tells the story of Hana (Riko Fukumoto), a young Paldean postal worker who dreams of becoming an expert deliveryperson.</p><p>While most deliverypeople get the chance to venture out into the world, as a letter sorter, Hana’s days are usually spent behind a desk with her partner Fuecoco. But when Hana happens to find an unaddressed letter from a young boy who is trying to wish his traveling father a happy birthday, she recognizes it as an opportunity to prove that she has what it takes to become one of the postal system’s greats like a certain friendly Dragonite.</p><p>The short spotlights how it takes all kinds of specialized human and pokémon labor to keep the inter-regional postal system running smoothly. Unsurprisingly, CoMix Wave’s take on the pokémon world is a visual delight that makes all of the short’s creatures look downright majestic regardless of whether they’re ordinary or legendary monsters. The short also features a sweeping shot of Kalos’ Lumiose City and quite a few pokémon capable of Mega Evolution.</p><div><p>Those details could be a nod to the location and mechanic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">both returning in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> (and Flygon<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/twzg0f/oc_why_did_flygons_mega_evolution_have_to_be/"> finally getting its due</a>), but we won’t know for sure until tomorrow morning.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You probably have your own definition and exceptions. And as you might expect, nearly everyone at <em>Kotaku </em>has thoughts and opinions on what is and isn’t an RPG. For example, some think Elden Ring is an RPG. Others disagree strongly. And then some think the idea of categorizing games via genre is a waste of time. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,195502,195624" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is how the RPG/genre debate went among <em>Kotaku</em> staffers earlier this morning in Slack. This chat has been lightly edited and formatted. </p><hr><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> Thinking about the five best RPGS from the last decade. My current picks are</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></li><li><em>Persona 5 Royal</em></li><li><em>Disco Elysium</em></li></ul><p>Those are my locks, I think. Does anyone have any suggestions for the other two?</p><p><strong>Zachary Zwiezen: </strong><em>Witcher 3</em>?</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> Don’t think <em>Witcher 3 </em>makes the cutoff.</p><p><strong>Ken: </strong>I think it would be by a hair. It’s early 2015, right?</p><p><strong>Zack</strong>: Yeah, May 2015</p><p><strong>John Walker: </strong><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2.</em></p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> <em>Elden Ring </em>and <em>Bloodborne</em> are both contenders as well.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Soulslikes aren’t RPGs, and I will die on this hill.</p><p><strong>Ken</strong>: Damn.</p><p><strong>Zack</strong>: I say it’s an RPG! Live your life.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Then<em> all games </em>are RPGs. They’re action-adventures.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I mean EVERYTHING is basically an RPG action-adventure game these days.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> If you include <em>Elden Ring </em>then you have to include <em>Horizon Zero Dawn,</em> and that way madness lies.</p><p><strong>Caro: </strong>Soulslikes are definitely RPGs. H<em>orizon Zero Dawn</em> is an action-adventure game. </p><p><strong>John:</strong> NOOOOOOOooooooooooo!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I’m afraid so.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Welp, there you go. At least we figured this out.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> This is why every game has every tag on Steam now. [Sad face emoji]</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> What is an RPG is a blog, I think.</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> A VGchat is happening before our eyes...</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> We should do two blogs.</p><p>-Of Course, <em>Elden Ring</em> Is An RPG</p><p>And then like an hour later:</p><p>-No, <em>Elden Ring</em> Isn’t An RPG</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong> Caro: </strong>Like, <em>Dark Souls/Elden Ring</em>, etc are not even subtle, they are RPG-ass RPGs, with all kinds of stat minutiae. </p><p><strong>Ethan Gach: </strong>You have levels and stats. D&amp;D has like five elements, anything with at least 2 of them qualifies. </p><p><strong>John:</strong> So <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> counts!</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I mean, personally, I gave up on trying to actually define RPGs as every definition either cut out games that are def RPGs or included everything.</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Dialogue choices, Quests, and XP. </p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Because, yes, <em>Horizon </em>would be an RPG by that definition. It has all of that.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> It’s very simple. Everyone just asks me, and I decide.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong><em>Call of Duty </em>only has XP.</p><p><strong>Zack: </strong>New <em>Call of Duty</em> games have dialogue options...</p><p><strong>John:</strong> But given this, should Kenneth’s list not include <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>?</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> No, that’s definitely not an RPG, it’s an action-adventure.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>All adventures have action. Not all action is an adventure.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>Haha, I think Carolyn has already implemented the “You just ask me” rule, but is trying to hide it.</p><p><strong> Zack: </strong>That’s my rule with RPGs. I’ll know it when I see it, etc.</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit: </strong>Well to me an “adventure” game is <em>Monkey Island.</em></p><p><strong>John: </strong>Yes!</p><p><strong>Caro: </strong>Hence why I call these action adventures.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach: </strong>Adventure game = ZzzZzz</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Damn.</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="30865dc166199dd32cd86b610b4f08c3" data-recommend-id="image://30865dc166199dd32cd86b610b4f08c3" data-format="gif" data-width="474" data-height="379" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Columbia Pictures / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30865dc166199dd32cd86b610b4f08c3" data-recommend-id="image://30865dc166199dd32cd86b610b4f08c3" data-format="gif" data-width="474" data-height="379" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>John Walker: </strong>I was about to say that the death of “adventure” as a meaningful genre has devastated me. And now even “point and click” doesn’t mean anything, because every cunt on Steam thinks this means “game with cursor.”</p><p><strong> Caro: </strong>I think adventure games are okay these days. We got the <em>Crimson Diamond</em> last year, we’re getting <em>Kathy Rain 2</em> this year. </p><p><strong> John: </strong>Oh no, they’re great. But everyone calls EVERYTHING “adventure” now. To the point where it doesn’t mean anything.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> What would be an “action” game? Not action adventure, but just action.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> <em>Vanquish </em>is an action game.</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> Damn what if I threw a curveball and said Pokemon Legends: Arceus, like an absolute mark.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>Remember when you clicked on things governed by arbitrary logic in order to get story pellets dispensed like a rat being jerked around a maze?</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Ethan, go to your room.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I love pixel hunts and mashing every item I have onto something in the desperate hopes of moving forward.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>Zack, join him.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Every genre has bad games in it.</p><p><strong>Zack: </strong>RPG has a lot of bad games in it as it has everything in it these days. As we’ve established concretely in this discussion.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>(Also, Carolyn, don’t forget <em>Old Skies</em> comes out soon!)</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> Or what if I said <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>is one of the best RPGS of the decade like an equally huge mark.</p><p><strong>Zack: </strong>That’s an RPG!</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I mean you can make that argument! It’s not one I’d agree with but you can make it.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Oh I didn’t realize there was any debate about it.</p><p><strong>Caro: </strong>Oh I’m not saying it’s not an RPG, I’m saying it’s not a good one.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Ah, well, I agree with that. Lol. </p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>It’s an immersive open-world shooter.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> <em>Divinity Original Sin 2</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> are definitely the two best RPGs of the last decade.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>Well until May the only answer is Witcher 3.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>Proper RPGs, not any of your bloody boss-fighting bullshit action games.</p><p><strong> Zack:</strong> CRPGS is the term you are looking for grumpy man.</p><p><strong> John:</strong> Oh, because these others aren’t running on computers? </p><p><strong>Ethan</strong>: <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is an RPG.</p><p><strong>Ken: </strong>Yeah, <em>Divinity Original Sin 2</em> is one of the best of the decade. </p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Nah, <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> is way better than <em>Divinity Original Sin 2. </em></p><p><strong>John:</strong> I forgot <em>Pillars</em>! I don’t think it’s way better, but it’s bloody wonderful.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> After all that lol I ask: What actually makes an RPG an RPG?</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> It’s not an RPG if it doesn’t let me kiss a man or manage an inventory. Sometimes both.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>An RPG is a game in which I create a character by choosing class and skills (whether pre-named or otherwise) then explore a narrative by taking on quests, combating foes, and choosing my own path through the storyline. Also someone at some point says “forsooth.”</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> An RPG must do at least two of the following: let me make narrative choices, go on quests, customize my character, include some sort of skill checks, or make the numbers go up. <em>Elden Ring</em> nails all five. Also, it’s got dragons. </p><p><strong>Ken:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne </em>is on my list next to <em>Baldur’s Gate 3, Persona 5 Royal, and Disco Elysium. </em>As contentious as that game’s categorization sounds now lmao.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Live your truth. Genres are just another example of humanity trying to organize everything in its never-ending and futile struggle to control the universe.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Naturally, the personalities embodying these players are also larger-than-life warriors of the ring. The players are WWE Superstars Xavier Woods as the Julius Mortem, Kofi Kingston as Adonis Thanaformus, Bayley as Thea Kittleroo, and Chelsea Green as Tabatha.These wrestling giants will be guided by the host and Game Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan.</p>

If you’re into collectibles already or just starting to collect trading cards, you may have a big enough collection that warrants some extra care or bulk storage. Some of your cards may even have significant value or will continue to grow in value, depending on what cards you collect and how you store them. As an investment, many serious collectors go to significant lengths to protect their cards such as sleeving or even double-sleeving them. However, even if your cards aren’t worth much monetarily, they are still nostalgic and special to you; whether it be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-tcg-deals">Pokémon TCG</a>, Yu-Gi-Oh, sports cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-the-gathering-mtg-deals">MTG cards</a> (shoutout the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">new Final Fantasy collection</a>), X-Men cards, or others. That said, you should consider the right dedicated storage option for your type of collection and your budget.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Jump to:</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, just like with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-video-game-storage-ideas">video game storage</a>, there are all sorts of carefully crafted containers you can use to protect your trading cards these days. If you’re just getting into collecting now, starting to collect more, or you simply want to upgrade your storage option from the old ring binder you’ve been using since the 1990s, this (unranked) list is for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some focus on security above all else, many others are stylish and portable too, making it easy and fun to tote your cards out and about. For all of you card collectors, see our picks below of the best trading card storage options for every situation, collection size and budget. Happy collecting!</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="best-overall">1. Quiver Time Quiver Card Case</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best All-Around Pick</h3><div id="197208" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Quiver Time The Quiver Card Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Carry your cards in style! Comes with 100 Apollo transparent card sleeves.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Quiver cases are almost universally adored in the card gaming community, and it’s easy to see why. Whatever your storage needs, it’s quite possible a single quiver case will fit the bill. It’s big enough to hold over a thousand unsleeved cards, yet it’s also sturdy and portable, coming with wrist and shoulder carrying straps, a tough shell with a water-resistant faux-leather finish and a secure zip closure. So it’s just as useful whether you’re storing cards in the home or carrying them out to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the best thing about Quiver Time, though, is the stylish design and attention to detail. They come in a variety of colors to suit your preference and have all sorts of thoughtful little extras. There’s a sheath to keep the zip tabs closed, fully adjustable straps, some card sleeves and removable acrylic dividers and corner cushions to help keep your cards organized. And perhaps most thoughtful of all, 1% of the asking price goes to charity.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More TCG Accessories From Quiver Time: </h3><h2 data-cy="title2" id="bulk-collections">2. GameGenic Dungeon 1100</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for Bulk Collections</h3><div id="197209" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gamegenic Dungeon Deck Box 1100+</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The Dungeon is ideal for housing a complete card collection and good for accessories too.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve got a bigger collection of cards and want a solid and well-designed stackable box to keep them in, then look no further. Each GameGenic Dungeon can hold a thousand double-sleeved cards, or a few more if you’re happy to box them up “naked”. There’s a middle divider to keep them better organized and make it easier to search through your collection when you need to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lid goes on via a convenient magnetic mechanism which makes it simple to pop on and off but holds strongly and securely when not in use. It also allows for complete removal, making it simple to access all your cards. There’s room above the cards to keep a game board, rules or accessories, and it’s a stylish solution with a smooth exterior and a soft microfibre lining to cushion your cards.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="portability">3. Quiver Time Bolt Card Case</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Case for Portability</h3><div id="197216" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Quiver Time The Bolt Card Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>With its roomy interior, handy dividers &amp; 2 carrying straps, the Bolt Card Case gives an easy way to organize &amp; transport your cards. Also comes with 100 Apollo transparent sleeves, sized for all standard game &amp; sports cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While Quivers are fantastic all-round cases, they’re a little on the bulky side if you carry your cards around a lot. If you’re just after a case to take out to clubs and tournaments then they make a smaller option, the Bolt, for that very purpose. It holds a little more than half the capacity of its bigger sibling, but that also means it has half the weight and size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In all other respects, it offers the same high quality build and styling of the Quiver, meaning your cards are just as well-packed and protected, only on a smaller scale. And you still get a free pack of card sleeves and 1% of the price to a children's orphan-based charity as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="binder">4. VaultX Exo-Tech Zip Binder</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Binder</h3><div id="197217" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Exo-Tec® Exo-Tec® Binder</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This Exo-Tec® binder is designed to fit a variety of cards and is compatible with all standard card protector sleeves, including Vault X Card Sleeves.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Boxes are not always the best option for storing your cards, not least because it’s difficult to flip through your collection and find the cards you need. Binders make a great alternative: although they hold fewer cards, they fit nicely onto shelves or cupboards and most options contain transparent pages with pockets into which to tuck your cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This binder from VaultX not only contains 20 such pages that hold 9 cards each, but boasts a protective padded cover and heavy-duty zip to keep your cards safe and secure. The standard version is standard black, but it comes in a variety of colors, sizes, and closures, so you can be sure to find one that fits your needs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="protection">5. Casematix Graded Card Storage Box</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Protection</h3><div id="197218" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>CASEMATIX CASEMATIX Graded Card Storage Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This heavy-duty card carrying case features a hard shell plastic exterior to prevent valuable trading cards from being crushed.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on how valuable your cards are and where you take them, you might feel the need to have a super-secure option to keep them safe. And they don’t come much safer than this Casematix case, with extra-durable hard shell exterior and customisable foam inserts that you can tear to ensure a perfect fit for your most prized cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case closes with a secure mechanism that also ensures its waterproof and airtight for maximum protection. And if that’s not enough for you, it’s designed to take cards in their own protective plastic slabs and there’s also a padlock ring so you can lock things down even tighter with added layers of your own security.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="deck-box">6. VaultX Exo-Tech Side Loading Deck Box</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Deck Box</h3><div id="197219" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Exo-Tec® Exo-Tec® Side Loading Deck Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Comes in several color options! Holds 100 double-sleeved cards, or 120 single-sleeved cards, or 210 un-sleeved cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Often, it’s fine to keep your cards in whatever container or case you can rustle up at home, but what you really want is a small, sturdy, premium-build box that you can use when taking a single deck of your precious cards out and about to play. Many brands have starter packs that come with suitable deck boxes for free, but they’re often flimsy cardboard affairs, so it’s better to invest in something a bit more durable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter this excellent option from VaultX. It’s available in a variety of stylish single-color finished, made of water-resistant microfibre. The lid doesn’t clip or slide on and off, as is common, but is held in place with strong magnets, making opening and closing super convenient. And the lid also flips round and magnetizes to the bottom of the box, tidying it out of the way and offering a stable platform to access your cards. You can also mix and match lids and boxes of different colors if so desired.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="budget">7. Fageverld Trading Card Storage Box </h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Budget Option</h3><div id="197220" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fageverld Fageverld Cardboard Storage Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Each Box holds about 620 standard 20pt trading cards and contains 2 packs of 10 dividers each to help sort your trading card or sports card.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For all the fancy protective cases you can buy for trading cards, fundamentally all you actually need for them is a box of some kind. And a box can be as basic as a piece of packaging that came with some other order: four sides and a lid will keep your cards in order just as well as a golden chest. There’s no need to spend a fortune if you don’t want the style and features offered by premium brands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that doesn’t mean there’s not something to be gained by spending at least a little on a storage option. Rather than a discarded cardboard box, you could get a specialized option like this. It’s sized just right to protect trading cards, comes with some dividers to keep things organized and has a top-loading lid so it’s easy to peruse your cards. Multiples will also stack neatly on your shelves to keep your cards together. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">How to Pick the Right Storage Option for You</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who has been a collector over the years knows binders may be the easiest and most convenient way to store cards, but can harm the cards over time. So, if you have any high-value cards or potentially high-value cards, it’s recommended to store them in sleeves or penny sleeves and put them in top loaders or boxes versus binders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on your budget, size of your collection, and value of your cards, you can start with a convenient option like a D-Ring binder, and work your way up from there. Based on the categories listed in the product options above, we're confident you'll find something affordable to get you started. What you choose will be based on many factors. For example, you may collect or play with Pokémon TCG cards and you just want to turn a stack of cards into an organized storage solution like using a cute, simple <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokmon-card-binder">Pokémon card binder.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tip: look for 'Acid-Free' and 'Soft-Backed' in the descriptions while shopping around.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance has been hit with more layoffs, parent company Krafton has confirmed, amid claims "most of" its developers have lost their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Word of job cuts at Striking Distance began surfacing earlier today as employees took to social media. Former director of concept art Jesse Lee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/">wrote</a> that "most of the devs were laid off", while former cloud devops engineer Seth Spitkoski <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seth-spitkoski-b0316b68_opentowork-activity-7299777905088217091-fDCU/">said "many" had been impacted</a>.
</p>
<p>
Krafton later confirmed layoffs at the studio in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-callisto-protocol-studio-lays-off-more-employees-but-remains-operational/">statement shared with PC Gamer</a>. "Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile," the company wrote, "which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development."
</p>
<p>
"The studio remains operational," the publisher added, "and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time." Krafton did not reveal the reveal the number of staff impacted by its job cuts.
</p>
<p>
Striking Distance was founded by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield in 2019, and the California-based studio would go on to release sci-fi horror game The Callisto Protocol in 2022. However, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">disappointing sales</a>, Schofield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">parted ways with Krafton</a> in 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">32 employees were laid off</a> amid efforts to "realign the studio's priorities".
</p>
<p>
Since then, Striking Distance has released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-gets-a-roguelike-spin-off">roguelike The Callisto Protocol spin-off</a>, titled [REDACTED], but no additional projects have been announced.
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of layoffs at Krafton comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone has seen seen the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, Warner Bros. Games San Diego</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Swords</a> shut their doors, with layoffs confirmed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">Marvel Rivals' US development team</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-moba-shooter-deadlock-cuts-a-lane-spurring-reactions-from-its-playerbase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One less line of minions.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, the MOBA-meets-hero shooter mash-up from Valve, has been in a perpetual state of quiet build-up over the last year. But that hasn't stopped Valve from making massive, tectonic changes, like cutting down the number of lanes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, February 25, Valve published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/530965072572320687" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Map Rework Update for Deadlock</a>. Chief among the changes was a redesign of Deadlock's core map around three lanes, rather than four. For those who don't dabble in MOBAs, these "lanes" are the central focus of gameplay; minions spawn at each team's base and surge down them, attempting to push the battle lines into each other's territory. Players take up residence in the lanes, fighting over the killing blow on minions to accrue money and experience they can use to power up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's one big game of tug-of-war, and reducing the number of figurative ropes from four to three has pretty drastic implications. It cuts down on one source of resources and reduces the number of fronts in the ongoing battle. It also means, for the 6-on-6 battles of Deadlock, that previously "solo" lanes will more often be duo lanes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Definitely going to be missing four lanes," one commenter <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iy6ysk/map_rework_update/mes5m1t/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said on the Deadlock subreddit</a>. "I always thought that was one of the more unique aspects of Deadlock. Oh well, learn and adapt I guess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite some of the worried hyperbole over map shifts, there is a degree of trust — though not absolute or unflinching — and voicing measured feedback. "It’s just a test guys chill," said <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iy78c1/lane_changes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one commenter</a>. "If it works well it stays, if it doesn’t work then it will go away like mid urn." (A former game mechanic.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A decent amount of this trust stems from the fact that IceFrog, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/13/valve-announces-dota-2">pseudonymous developer behind Dota 2</a>, is also working on Deadlock. Dota 2 is fairly infamous for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-aftermath-of-dota-2s-game-changing-update-ign-arena-podcast">massive overhauls and game-changing updates</a>, wiith patch notes that felt like getting whiplash from spreadsheets. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iyk163/some_of_yall_didnt_play_dota_and_it_shows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old memes stretching back to the early days of Dota 2</a>, encouraging players to trust in IceFrog's changes, have already been resurfaced for modern Deadlock players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dota 2 has seen so many massive overhauls and changes and the game still thrives," a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iyk163/some_of_yall_didnt_play_dota_and_it_shows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commenter said</a>. "As long as Deadlock's core gameplay doesn't drastically change (which definitely isn't a guarantee since its currently in development) then people will play the game regardless."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Map changes aside, Valve took the wrench to a lot of Deadlock with this recent update. Soul Orbs, which are released from enemies upon death and can be shot by players to either secure their rewards or partially deny them from the enemy team, also got a hefty rework. Sprinting has been tuned, flex slots and economic considerations have been made to adjust for the new three-lane set-up, and there's the usual slew of quality-of-life and hero changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some, especially the long-time Dota players, Deadlock's update feels par for the course. (Dota 2 even <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/737004388447420792" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got its own massive overhaul just last week</a>.) While it will certainly shift the way players approach the game, part of the long-term appeal of a MOBA like Deadlock is the ways the game shifts over time, in response to both developer changes and community reactions. If handled well, it can result in years of vibrant competition. If not, well, hopefully there's a rewind button somewhere. History has shown that not all major updates are made in stone, even for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">huge games like Overwatch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With not even a week out yet in Deadlock, players will need to dig in and figure out just how the reduced lanes shifts the game, suss out the intended change, and find new ways to open up gameplay through it. On at least one positive note, players with solo lane anxiety can breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deadlock is still flagged as being in early development, and Valve warns players it's filled with "temporary art and experimental gameplay." Access is currently limited to friend invite via playtesters, and there's no release window announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
