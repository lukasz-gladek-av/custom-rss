		<p>Hitman: World of Assassination is the game that just keeps on giving. From its trilogy of main games, to the steady stream of (now repeating) Elusive Targets, and inventive additions like the Freelancer mode, there’s a ton of sneakily stoic action to be had here. All of that is now available to play in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="HITMAN World of Assassination - PS VR2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgjyUtnZlVM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is far from the first effort at translating Hitman: World of Assassination into VR, after an original PSVR exclusive port, PC VR counterpart, and last year’s restyled Meta Quest port. There’s naturally some crossover and common ground with those previous versions, but this should be by far and away the most advanced and complete rendition of Hitman in VR.</p>


<p>Compared to the PSVR version, which was limited to using DualShock 4 for controls, you now have separate hands, and compared to the PC VR version, you can now use both of those hands for actions, including dual wielding guns and manual reloading. Compared to the Quest version, Hitman on PSVR 2 looks to retain the art direction and as much fidelity of the flatscreen game as possible. In essence, it’s the best of all worlds.</p>
<p>Having not tried any of the previous VR adaptations, and sinking into this game again for a few hours, it’s almost a little surprising just how well Hitman makes the jump into VR with PSVR 2. To be fair, this is generally quite a slow and considered game series, with a few key moments of high action when you choose to strike, so the pacing works rather well for VR, while there’s a decent amount of interactivity and creative use of objects within the world already, even if it’s shy of a bespoke VR game like Half-Life: Alyx. No, you can’t grab that random watering can or a single volume from a stack of books, but there’s plenty of hammers, busts, briefcases and knives lying around for you.</p>


<p>One of the real highlights of the World of Assassination trilogy was just how busy the levels were. The main areas were quite regularly flooded with crowds of bystanders, whether it’s the guests at the Paris fashion show in the original mission of the original game, the eager motorsports fans in Hitman 2, or the busy party at the cloud-piercing skyscraper in Hitman 3. Of course, they’re not far off being mannequins with minimal AI and interactivity, and seeing them at eye-level does reveal a little more just how plain and static they really are. Things get more complex as you have staff that are on their particular patrol routes and routines, and then you have the targets who meander around the stages with their own agendas, which you have to figure out and pick apart to successfully take down with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>Right from the off, Hitman feels very natural in PSVR 2. We’re at that stage now where developers are confident enough to pull off smooth locomotion in VR, and VR gamers have found their sea legs in the current platforms. Still, the game runs you first through the basics of VR actions, from movement, to throttling, disguises, to throwing, and blasting away with guns.</p>

<p>Knocking out an unsuspecting person has that Original Series Star Trek feel to it, before you can then yank all their clothes off them like they’re a velcro-laden strippergram, and then drag them behind you to whatever large chest or locker you can find nearby.</p>
<p>You can also knock them out from a distance with thrown items. This is by far and away the best feeling part of the game, to me. There’s such a generous auto-aim that you can just flick your wrist and that wrench, apple or drinks can you’re holding will find its way straight to your target’s noggin. You can, however, take a little more care, holding the opposite trigger to display a throwing arc that your haphazard throw will then automatically follow.</p>
<p>Guns are less generous. Small firearms like pistols handle decently, and the manual reload is on a par with other VR games – press a button to ping out the spent magazine, grab a fresh clip from your Kangaroo-like ammo pouch, put it in place and then pull back the pin to cock it – and there’s a frantic feeling when trying to do this under pressure. Dual wielding is also fun, potentially with hammer in one hand and pistol in the other.</p>

<p>Where it really falls apart for me is with the two-handed weapons. Hitman might be filled with playful sandboxes, but even as you mess around within these environments, Agent 47 is cold, calculated and utterly precise. Two-handed weapons in VR are pretty rubbish for that, with none of the real-world heft and weight, giving them this weird floaty feeling. You get to be an expert marksman in games by pressing a button to steady a sniper scope’s wobble, but here I’m trying to steady my aim by touching fingers together, and even then the scope’s looking way off in the wrong direction and impossible to track fast targets. It’s partly a skill issue, to be sure, but games like this are power fantasies that do a lot of the stuff for you.</p>
<p>As always there’s certain compromises made when adapting a flat screen game for VR. In Hitman’s case, all of the cutscenes switch you to a big cinema screen view, as is pretty common, but there’s also some in-game moments that switch views or do simple fades. Whenever you vault or stash a body in a cupboard, the game quickly fades to black to transition and get the action done as quickly as possible, meanwhile, blending in at a bar shifts to a third person camera view. They’re fine, but a little jarring, and other games have kept things like vaulting more interactive.</p>

<p>Even climbing –&nbsp;something that VR games are pretty much perfect for –&nbsp;has been stripped away from you. Walk up to a ladder or a drain pipe and instead of going hand over fist, you’re bumped out to a lower view and stare up at Agent 47 posterior as it shimmies away from you. Or towards you. You can do that too.</p>
<p>After a few hours play, exploring hazily remembered levels I played half a decade ago, Hitman in PSVR 2 feels right on the cusp of VR greatness. I’m sure that many of the quirks fade into the background as you get used to them, and Hitman is a game that’s excellently suited to a VR adaptation, from its pacing and the broad interactivity of the world, to the multi-faceted environments that are often jam-packed with people.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dang. $80 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, huh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Direct</a> and subsequent information dump answered many, many burning questions we've been asking about the Nintendo Switch 2, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-confirmed-so-far">launch line-up</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-confirmed-during-nintendo-direct">release date</a>. Among those was the question of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">price</a>, not only for the system itself but also for the games and accessories we're going to need alongside it. And it's a good thing that the rest of the Direct was so enjoyable, because Nintendo needed to do some work to justify some of these prices.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Switch 2 by itself: $449.99 USD</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 with Mario Kart World bundled in: $499.99</li><li>Mario Kart World by itself: $79.99</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza: $69.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $49.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Controller pair: $89.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $34.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Strap: $12.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Wheel pair: $19.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set: $109.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector: $34.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $29.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Phew! That's a lot to dish out to play Nintendo games, even assuming most people are just going for the console, a game or two, and maybe a spare controller. Most notable in that list of prices is what's going on with the console itself. $450 isn't far off what a bunch of analysts told me the system was likely to cost when I asked them earlier this year. They predicted $400, but a few said it could likely go higher depending on various economic and technological factors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even more interesting is Mario Kart Tour. It's $80. That makes it the most expensive we've ever seen a AAA game cost without belonging to some sort of Deluxe Edition, and it's certainly the highest Nintendo's ever gone. You can buy it in a bundle with the system to get $30 taken off the game price, but the $80 price tag has a lot of Nintendo fans concerned at the rapidly rising prices of games and what this may mean for the future. Didn't we just see games start to go from $60 to $70 a few years ago? That hurt bad enough without bumping it up even higher so soon after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's happening here? Why are the Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart World priced the way they are? Will we see more game price hikes in the future? As usual, I asked expert analysts to explain it to me. Here's what they said.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Why $450?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though most of the analysts I spoke to today were the same folks who predicted a $400 price point when we chatted in January, no one seemed surprised at the $50 extra on the end of the announcement today. Collectively, the six I spoke to offered various reasons for the higher-than-expected price, largely agreeing on the fairly simple confluence of multiple factors: tariffs, manufacturing costs, and competition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and author of <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SuperJoost Playlist</a>, calls the $449.99 pricing a "strategic balancing act" on Nintendo's part that reflects a mixture of increased manufacturing costs as well as ongoing uncertainty as to whether or not, and if so, what, tariffs the Trump administration in the United States is going to levy on electronics. "Nintendo appears to be building in a buffer against these potential trade barriers while ensuring they maintain their traditional positive margin on hardware."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis wasn't surprised by the $450 price, and said it made sense given the Switch OLED's $350 price tag. But he also shared an interesting speculation in his response related to van Dreunen's point about tariffs, relating to why Nintendo didn't announce the price in the Nintendo Direct itself today. "My view is that they probably had a range of pricing for the US market in play up until the last minute due to the uncertainty on import tariffs."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, threw in another factor: Sony. "Nintendo probably factored in possible tariffs, the current inflationary climate in the world and the US$700 Sony dared to charge for the PlayStation 5 Pro last year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">James McWhirter, analyst at Omdia, also mentioned the PS5 Pro as well as the Xbox Series X, both of which he pointed out sold better than their cheaper alternatives (the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s">Xbox Series X surpassed the Series S recently in the U.S.</a>). But he also pointed out an interesting discrepancy in how the Switch 2 is being sold in Japan versus the United States. In Japan, it's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releasing a Japanese-language system</a> for 49,980 yen ($333.22), while its multi-language system runs 69,980 yen ($466.56). Why? McWhirter has a fascinating explanation as to the existance of this region-locked system, its pricing, and the discrepancy between it and the pricing of the system in the U.S.:</p><blockquote>Japan is a key market for Nintendo - our console hardware data reveals that Japan accounts for a quarter (24%) of the Nintendo Switch installed base in 2024, compared with just 2% for Xbox Series X/S and 9% for PlayStation 5.</blockquote><blockquote>If Switch 2 pricing in Japanese Yen was aligned with the U.S. Dollar price, it would dramatically weaken Nintendo's position in Japan, representing a doubling in the list price over the classic LCD Nintendo Switch model. Yet if Nintendo continued to rely on region-specific pricing that is significantly cheaper in USD terms, they would face an issue with grey imports to other territories.</blockquote><blockquote>Nintendo’s answer is to navigate this situation with two models – they are offering a substantially cheaper but price competitive 50,000 yen Nintendo Switch 2 model that only includes Japanese language support only.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, an international language model at 70,000 yen is being positioned to protect the Japanese market from grey imports from other territories – smart considering there are no other major console markets with a not insignificant number of people proficient in the Japanese language.</blockquote><h3 data-cy="title3">Mario Kart World, at a Premium</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, that covers the console itself, so why has Nintendo hiked the price of Mario Kart World into the stratosphere at $80? When I asked the analysts I spoke to, I assumed it was related to tariff concerns. Perhaps Nintendo was worried about potential tariffs but also didn't want to raise the price of the console too high, so a more expensive flagship game was their solution to offset costs?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Partially. The experts largely concluded that tariffs may have played a role, with Mat Piscatella, analyst at Circana, suggesting that the higher game pricing was a bit of future-proofing on Nintendo's part. "While pricing for a product can always be lowered over time, it's extremely difficult and painful to raise pricing on a product once it has been announced or released. This is purely my own speculation, but this pricing is most easily explained by trying to be conservative given the current chaotic market conditions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the experts also told me there was more to it than that. McWhirter told me that this was Nintendo taking advantage of a critical moment of change in the games industry to test the waters on what the market will tolerate as far as game pricing goes. And it's using its most successful game series ever on that trial run, because Nintendo knows if any game can succeed at that price, it's Mario Kart. If it doesn't work out, it can always drop the price, either directly or indirectly through methods like Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Console Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Van Dreunen said something similar, adding, "The timing aligns with the broader industry's gradual price increases for premium content, as we've seen with other publishers moving to $70 base games. Nintendo may be leapfrogging this intermediate step, calculating that the massive built-in audience for Mario Kart will tolerate a higher price point for what appears to be a significantly expanded experience compared to previous entries."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McWhirter also pointed out that not only could this higher cost for Mario Kart World be mitigating things like tariffs or manufacturing costs, it also could be helping balance out other, invisible costs. There's those pesky manfacturing costs, for one, with McWhirter noting that the 3D NAND flash memory from supplier Macronix experts suspect Nintendo is using in Switch 2 game cards is pricey.  But there's also the cost of migrating so many first-party titles to Nintendo Switch 2, and the slow build the console will see in its first three years when its blockbuster exclusives are reaching a much smaller audience than was available on the Nintendo Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other experts brought up other factors. Harding-Rolls made a compelling point about Nintendo otherwise not aggressively pursuing in-game monetization, and needing to account for inflation somehow. And he added: "Nintendo has a bit of a history of pricing games higher than other platforms when coming to the market later than other platforms - in this case PS5 and Xbox Series. I remember back in the day N64 titles being more than PS1 titles for example. Some of that is related to cost of goods, but Nintendo also likes to follow its own approach and price based on its own appreciation of value."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhys Elliott, games analyst at Alinea Analytics, said that the discrepancy in physical and digital pricing is a clear move from Nintendo to push consumers toward digital games, especially when paired with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-card-update-ahead-of-switch-2-launch">Virtual Game Card</a> announced last week.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Nintendo is charging this price because they feel they can and that people will pay.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"PlayStation and Xbox have already pushed their platforms to become digital-first, driven by strategies like multi-game subscriptions, digital-only consoles, free-to-play’s rise, and platform holders pushing consumers to digital versions via perks (like extra cosmetics and the ability to pre-load a game so it’s instantly ready to play at launch)," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So PlayStation and especially Xbox are very digital-first. But Nintendo is different, more 50-50. In the last nine months of 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204_3e.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">51% of Switch software sales were digital</a>. The number was even lower in the holiday period (43.4% digital for calendar Q4), as always. For consumers, a unique value proposition of physical games is the preowned and rental markets. But Nintendo’s reliance on physical impacts its bottom line, hence the nudging. Nintendo does not gain revenues from physical renting and resales. After all, a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe could be sold on the reseller market 100 times or rented 100 times, but Nintendo would only capture revenues from that first sale. A digital-only market means more revenue and price control for Nintendo."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I asked this question of Toto, who referred to the jump from $60 games to an $80 Mario Kart World as "quite bold." His explanation was short and sweet:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Tariffs could play a role, but I think it is much simpler: Nintendo is charging this price because they feel they can and that people will pay."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Who's Buying?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone I spoke to agreed that even though the Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart World pricing is a bit  of a shock, it's not going to affect sales of the console. At least... not at first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Based on what we're seeing across the market, sales to higher-income or more affluent households likely won't be impacted by this pricing," Piscatella told me. "And, of course, we have the price insensitive super enthusiasts that will do and pay whatever it takes to acquire the Switch 2 at launch. Therefore, because of the limited quantities that will be available during the launch year, I do not anticipate this pricing to hinder year one sales volumes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The true test will come in year two, as supply is likely to become more readily available, and the addressable market will be forced to widen. So, we'll have to see what happens over the next 9-12 months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McWhirter's response was similar, saying that Omdia's current forecast has the Nintendo Switch 2 being outpaced in sales by the original Switch by 6 million units by the end of 2028.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/image-21-1743625493880.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: Omdia</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even without considering potential tariff-related instability on hardware pricing, Omdia’s console forecast indicates that the list price of console hardware is no longer declining at the same rate it once did, even after adjusting for inflation (see figure, above)," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After four calendar years on the market, the list price of a PlayStation 5 had only fallen by 12%, compared with 21% for PlayStation 4. This could present a challenge for Nintendo if it hopes to hit a competitive $199.99 entry price point with a Lite-style revision at the same point of its cycle (2027)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Van Dreunen largely agreed as well, adding that the rising prices of other consumer electronics will likely serve to make this transition less jarring for consumers than it would be otherwise. "With the PlayStation 5 Pro at $700 and premium gaming handhelds in the $549+ range, Nintendo's pricing looks relatively reasonable by comparison," he said. Van Dreunen projected 12 - 15 million Nintendo Switch 2 units sold within the first 12 months on the market, citing backward compatibility as a significant factor that would drive adoption.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With the PlayStation 5 Pro at $700... Nintendo's pricing looks relatively reasonable by comparison.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Toto had a slightly different take. While he feels the hardware price will be acceptable for most consumers, games rising to $70 or $80 is a "much, much harder sell." Especially for a chunk of Nintendo's target audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the first year, these prices will not matter that much because there is an audience of people buying everything Nintendo offers, no matter what," he said. "What I am a bit worried about is if Nintendo will again be able to reach the mainstream audience at scale later, i.e. families that might have much tighter budgets for entertainment in today's economy. Nintendo is clearly betting on people accepting higher prices as a new normal by then."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toto's point is likely the one that will resonate the most, at least at the moment. Despite the highs of today's Nintendo Direct, one of the primary audience responses we've seen coming out of it has been concerns about how expensive it all is. Tariffs, manufacturing costs, market shifts, economics, whatever you want to call it, none of the explanations make the increasing costs of games and systems feel better on the wallet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's just hope no other publishers get any bright ideas about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto">$100 games</a> next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/03/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-confirm-a-shorter-battery-life-than-switch-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/tech-specs/">technical specifications for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, putting all the important stats and details into a nice table for you to refer to, and also revealing their all-important estimates for the new console’s battery life.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can get up to 6.5 hours of gameplay out of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its 5220mAh battery. The bad news is that when it’s pushed to its limits, you’ll get just 2 hours of play before needing to recharge. That’s potentially shorter than even the first revision of the Nintendo Switch.</p>


<p>That compares poorly to the current line up of Nintendo Switch consoles, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/nintendo-switch-oled-review-it-all-comes-down-to-the-screen/">OLED</a> and the “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/17/nintendo-new-switch-model-battery/">Better Battery Life</a>” models of the Switch 1 both able to game for 4.5 – 9 hours – they quote 5.5 hours for Breath of the Wild. It’s a closer run thing to the original Switch model, though, which was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/01/nintendo-switch-review/">quoted for around 2.5 – 6 hours of play</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s not that dissimilar to <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech/">the original LCD Steam Deck</a>, which had a 2-8 hour battery life window.</p>
<p>So why the big drop in battery life? Chances are it’s mostly down to the screen. The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with a larger 7.9″ LCD screen, which will require more power to run than the older consoles, and that’s before you consider that it’s capable of playing at 120Hz and HDR. Combine that with a more powerful Nvidia chipset that needs to push for 1080p instead of 720p, and you’ve got a recipe for shorter game times.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what kinds of game options are made available to players. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, for example, will have a 1080p 120Hz mode, but turning that down to 60Hz could help play the game for an extra hour, perhaps.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the tech specs, we get confirmation of the various details from the Nintendo Direct. The Switch 2 is larger, and a bit heavier than the original Switch. It comes with 256GB of internal storage, expandable with the new MicroSD Express card format – it will not play games from old MicroSD cards – it has two USB-C ports at top and bottom for power and accessories, and the built-in microphone is enhanced with noise cancelling. There’s now WiFi 6 built in, and there’s still support for ethernet via the dock.</p>
<p>The screen is a 1080p 120Hz HDR10 capable display, but when docked the maximum output to a TV is 4K at 60fps. 120fps is supported when playing at either 1080p or 1440p.</p>
<p>Here’s the tables</p>

<th><b>Size</b></th>
<td>Approximately 4.5 inches tall x 10.7 inches wide x .55 inches thick (with Joy-Con™ 2 controllers attached).<br>

			<p>Amid the sea of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> news, there was also the <a href="https://x.com/ShinenGames/status/1907437680037646517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of FAST Fusion, a new entry in the zero-G racing series developed by Shin'en Multimedia, which will be a launch title for the new console. Interestingly, the previous installment (FAST RMX) was also a launch title for the first Switch. Then, the independent German developer did something with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-touryst-renders-at-6k-4k-on-xbox-series-x-s-it-almost-looks-like-a-good-cgi-movie-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Touryst</a>, an action/adventure game launched in 2020 on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>With FAST Fusion, the developer returns to creating exclusive games for a new Nintendo console, and it appears that they'll take full advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2's capabilities. Here's an overview of the features confirmed by the studio:</p>
<p><strong><em>Hypersonic Speed</em></strong><br>
<em>The fastest racing game you may have ever experienced! Non stop adrenaline pumping action at 60 fps in up to 4K HDR.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Antigravity Jumps</em></strong><br>
<em>FAST Fusion vehicles are equipped with antigravity hyper jump technology. Cut corners and get ahead of your oppenents by jumping and boosting over them.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Vehicle Fusion</em></strong><br>
<em>Create hundreds of new Racing machines by fusing your favorite vehicles.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Hyper tracks</em></strong><br>
<em>Zoom through Redwood Forest, Alpine peaks, futuristic cities and many more breathtaking landscapes.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Motion Controls, HD Rumble</em></strong><br>
<em>Play with smooth motion controls, enjoy immersive HD Rumble and customize the buttons.</em></p>
<p>FAST Fusion will also support split-screen play for up to four players, the new Nintendo Switch 2 Game Share feature (both locally and online), TV Mode, Tabletop Mode, Handheld Mode, and, of course, the new Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p>

            <p>The most influential game of all time is Yu Suzuki's 1999 proto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> Gashapon 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>, according to a public poll held by BAFTA. To claim that top spot in the top five, it beat out Doom, Super Mario Bros, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a>, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</p>
<p>Minecraft hovered around the winners table laughing loudly at everyone's jokes at number six. At number 11, Tetris had to sit on a bin because all the chairs had been taken. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> paced up and down the corridor complaining that everyone had nicked its outfit idea in 18th place, tailed in 19th by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> 3. Full results below in descending order.</p>

<li>Grand Theft Auto</li>

<p>If you're wondering why Henry has come to see us - riding atop a muzzled Super Mario 64, no less - Polygon's Oli Welsh <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/550231/shenmue-bafta-most-influential-game-all-time">reckons its evidence</a> of "brigading among passionate game fans," and, yep, sounds about right. I'm not sure KCD 2 has been out long enough to influence anything outside its own DLC. Baldur's Gate 3 at 16 is also a weird one. It's that big number '3' that gives it away.</p>
<p>As for Shenmue, I can see it, even if I'm not sure it would have been my pick. I've long held that Yakuza 0 is, within a certain console tradition of RPG-tinted action adventures, the most and possibly best example of its kind ever made, and that's a lineage you can trace directly back to Shenmue, not least for Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi's own involvement in the 1999 game. Less subjectively, Shenmue's NPC and simulation elements were a big deal for the time, especially for console. "The game popularised the use of Quick Time Events (QTEs)," BAFTA say.</p>
<p>That might not be something to celebrate for some of you, but I'm just going to say it: I like QTEs. I remember first properly encountering them in Resident Evil 4 and excitedly telling a mate "it's like a cutscene, but you can die if you don't press the right buttons!". Then again, I'm also a fan of Dragon's Lair and old adventure games that killed you every five minutes in different ways like 1998's X-Files. Bring back annoying deaths as a form of collectible, I say.</p>
<p>"I am deeply honoured and grateful that Shenmue has been selected as the Most Influential Video Game of All Time," said Yu Suzuki. "At its inception, we set out to explore the question, “How real can a game become?”, aiming to portray a world and story unprecedented in scale and detail. This distinction serves as a powerful reminder that the challenge we embraced continues to resonate with and inspire so many people even today. It is truly the greatest of encouragement".</p>
<p>If you got the chance to crowbar one game on to BAFTA's list and no-one could do anything about it, what would it be? Me? I'm still waiting for the world to catch up and recognise the importance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Spot">Cool Spot</a>. Never has a game influenced so many to say, sure, I'll have a 7UP if literally nothing else is available.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed the battery life for its upcoming console, the Switch 2.</p>
<p>After a rather choc full Direct yesterday, which gave us a look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-first-dual-mouse-mode-game-is-wheelchair-basketball-drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">Mario Kart World</a>, a few more little titbits of information have started making the rounds.

<p>As shared on a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">separate spec sheet for Switch 2</a>, Nintendo's next console will house a Lithium ion battery, with a battery capacity of 5220 mAh. Meanwhile, its battery life is "Approx. 2 - 6.5 hours". Nintendo notes this is just an "estimate" life span, and adds "the battery life will depend on the games you play and usage conditions".</p>
<p>While Nintendo itself doesn't go into specifics about which games it is referring to here, it is fair to assume that playing a smaller indie game on a pleasant spring afternoon with a mild breeze blowing will see the console lasting longer in its handheld mode than if you were having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">a full blown battle in Elden Ring</a> during a 40°C heatwave.</p>
<p>Charging time for the console, meanwhile, is approximately three hours while in sleep mode.</p>
<p>To compare the upcoming Switch 2's battery life to other Switch devices, here's what <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-Long-Does-the-Battery-Charge-Last-1630015.html#:~:text=Once%20fully%20charged%2C%20the%20battery,approximately%204.5%20to%209%20hours.">Nintendo's support page states</a>:</p>
<p>Once fully charged, the battery duration for the console varies depending on model and on the software application and functions being used.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Nintendo Switch - OLED Model with a serial number that starts with "XT", the battery life is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch consoles with a serial number that starts with "XK", the battery life is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch consoles with a serial number that starts with "XA", the battery life is approximately 2.5 to 6.5 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch Lite, the battery life is approximately 3 to 7 hours.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tariffs announced by Donald Trump will drastically impact a number of industries across the world, and video games are in no way excluded. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-supply-chains-hit-with-up-to-a-46-percent-trump-tariffs/">Apple's</a> supply chain issues might not matter as much to gamers, what they likely care more about is the potential the tariffs have to raise the already high price of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo revealed its new console in an hour-long Nintendo Direct event on Wednesday, with the price of the console and the new games we'll be playing on it revealed immediately after. It'll be $449.99 USD if you want to just buy the console, or $499.99 USD to grab the bundle that includes the newly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-moves-some-switch-production-to-vietnam">2019</a>, Nintendo moved part of its hardware manufacturing out of China and into Vietnam and Cambodia. At the time, though it certainly looked like it, Nintendo stated that the move was not done as a means of avoiding tariffs during disputes between China and the United States.</p>
<p>The tariffs Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/trump-says-he-s-signing-executive-order-on-reciprocal-tariffs">announced later on Wednesday</a>, just hours after Nintendo's presentation, include a <strong>46%</strong> tariff levied against Vietnam and a <strong>49%</strong> tariff levied against Cambodia, both of which could end up impacting the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 on a global scale.</p>
<p>Trump also announced a base 10% tariff on all exporters to the United States that will go into effect this coming Saturday, April 5, 2025, while countries facing higher tariffs, like Cambodia and Vietnam, will have their tariffs go into effect on April 9, 2025. The 10% base tariff is also not being added to the ones Cambodia and Vietnam already face.</p>
<p>Unless some kind of deal is reached, including a lower tariff or an exception to certain exports to the United States, there's a very good chance the cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 could go higher than it already is.</p>

Yes, its needle drops for edgy AMV-bait songs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlEqHXRrcpc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlEqHXRrcpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Papa Roach’s “Last Resort”</a></span> are cheesy nods to a nu metal heyday that might not resonate with someone who’s never played one of Dante’s demon-slaying massacres, but those were the songs of the early 2000s that <em>Devil May Cry </em>fans were probably listening to during the original trilogy’s PS2 run. After it stopped making me existential, I appreciated how much Netflix’s spin on the series commits to the bit, even if it took me time to warm up to its busy, multi-season setup.</p><p>Most of the important parts of <em>Devil May Cry </em>are here. A younger, spryer version of Dante, played by Johnny Yong Bosch (who plays his nephew Nero in the games), finds himself in the crosshairs of two factions: a demon uprising led by a dapper White Rabbit and a demon-hunting government agency. The White Rabbit seeks to tear the barrier between the human and demon worlds down, allowing the devils of the underworld to pour into the rest of the earth, and they need one of Dante’s only family heirlooms to do it. This version of Dante was orphaned at a young age and only knows the stories his mother told him about where they came from. He’s just a simple demon hunter who doesn’t know why literal Hell is rising around him.</p><p>Longtime fans know where this all leads, but I was surprised at just how elaborate the show’s entangled web of characters became by the end of the season, given that it’s all relatively simple in the games. <em>Devil May Cry </em>is a busy show. Dante is at the center of it all, but there are large swaths of the eight episodes that focus on the supporting cast, such as fan-favorite Lady and the rest of her demon-hunting unit, and the religious zealot Vice President Baines, played by the late, great <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kevin-conroy-batman-arkham-animated-series-voice-dies-1849772983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kevin-conroy-batman-arkham-animated-series-voice-dies-1849772983">Kevin Conroy</a></span>. The first half of the show is a bit plodding as it establishes the new setup, and you only get into the meat of what matters after the show’s halfway through and plenty of characters have already fallen. By the time it reaches the second half, the show has dropped a lot of dead weight and started focusing on the stuff <em>Devil May Cry </em>fans are probably looking for. Much of this prolonged setup feels designed to lay groundwork for future seasons, which the finale unambiguously tees up, but for a series that has been known to do a lot with very little, having such a huge ensemble doesn’t do it many favors in the beginning.</p><p>Though it’s a bit bloated to start, <em>Devil May Cry </em>is still a rollicking good time even while it’s getting to the good stuff. Dante is as stylish, rambunctious, and delightful to watch wreck shop on demons as he’s ever been. The action in <em>Devil May Cry </em>is sublime, rapidly oscillating from Dante’s signature campy swagger to dramatic hyperviolence at the drop of a hat. During the early episodes, it’s always a relief when the long-winded exposition is briefly broken up by scenes of Dante facing off against a small pack of poor bastards who have no idea what the gunslinging swordsman is capable of. Then the second half of the season puts all that violence into context, lending it new dramatic weight and even making it cathartic to boot.</p><p><em>Devil May Cry</em>’s first half isn’t bad by any stretch, but the show takes more time than it should to find its footing. I’m curious to see how non-fans react to this show; Netflix’s previous game adaptations like <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners </em>and <em>Castlevania</em> have brought in people who never played those games, but <em>Devil May Cry </em>feels different, like a knowing nod and wink to the people who were playing through Dante’s demon-slaying adventures 20 years ago. Will its cheesy time capsule of edgy 2000s camp be appealing to the modern teenager? That’s not me, so I can’t say for sure. But <em>Devil May Cry </em>had me in its sights, and now that it’s cleared space for a more traditional Dante story next season, I’m down for a second round.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

All of which you may or may not find interesting; it'll depend on how into <em>the</em> <em>industry </em>you are. Some of those articles may even try to poke at the console's price, how it compares to other machines on the market, whether there is good value to be had. The bravest among the internet's legion of armchair analysts might even try to predict the Switch 2's sales figures, based I'm sure on all kinds of very important video game-related metrics and historical precedent.</p><p>I'm taking the day off from all that shit. I woke up, saw the price and just checked out entirely. A video game console with those specs, costing $450 (AUD$699 here) in the Year Of Our Lord 2025, with games costing $80, is a hard pass from me. In the last two years I've lost my full-time job, my mortgage has gone up by 30% and the price of everything else around me, from groceries to insurance, has shot up by similar margins.</p><p>I can't afford short holidays or a night out at the movies with my kids, and the new video game console is asking for $450? Nah. I know none of the above factors are Nintendo's fault--this is the first major console launch to land after the post-pandemic cost-of-living crisis--nor will they likely factor into many analyst's predictions, but they're factors today, in my life, and no doubt the lives of millions of other people around a world that's growing increasingly chaotic by the day.</p><p>I was going to end this blog by saying "Who knows what the future will bring, maybe I'll just get it when it goes on sale", before realising that the Switch was released in 2017 and didn't officially get a price drop...ever.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thomas-tank-diesel-10-scary"><h3>Fuck This Anthropomorphic Diesel Engine In Particular</h3></a><p>Thomas and the Magic Railroad's Diesel 10 gave me nightmares</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The design differs between the grips from the two brands. Dbrand's Killswitch Grip for Switch 2 is a wrap-around protective case, while Satisfye's new ZenGrip 2 slides on and off the new handheld, matching the design the company's Switch 1 grips, while also allowing you to keep it on while the console is docked.

		<p>Odin: Valhalla Rising will be getting its global launch on April 29th for PC, iOS, and Android, Kakao Games has confirmed. Pre-loads for Odin: Valhalla Rising will start on April 28th and character name reservations will open alongside the game pre-registrations which start from April 3rd. Those who do pr-register will get a limited edition Viking-themed avatar and mount as well as other rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="[ODIN:VALHALLA RISING] Pre-registration Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4HWmC4quRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Odin: Valhalla Rising, players will be able to explore various realms based upon Norse mythology including Midgaard and Jotunheim as one of four classes. Those classes are Warrior, Sorceress, Priest, and Rogue. Game modes include the 30v30 Valhalla mode, co-op battles, dungeons, and raids. Kakao Games will be adding features further down the line, including a Guild Wars mode. The story of Odin: Valhalla Rising is based upon Ragnarok, with Odin trying to avoid it. He does this by exiling Loki, who doesn’t take this well so awakens different creatures that have been laying dormant in the void of Ginnungagap.</p>

Characters Yunobo, Tulin, Riju, and Sidon from the game are all getting Amiibos on June 5.</span></span></p>



<p><span><span>Nintendo also promised but has not yet shown, a Mineru's Construct Amiibo for the future. Presumably, the Mineru's Construct Amiibo will be a little like Breath of the Wild’s Guardian Amiibo, which was oversized and a little different.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Though it didn’t overtly say as much, Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 will be Amiibo compatible. </span></span><a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the"><span><span><span><span>Street Fighter 6</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> is getting a Switch 2 release and with it will also come alongside a collection of Amiibo and Amiibo cards.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The long-anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 Direct aired today, and it was jam-packed with announcements, including hardware specs, new Mario Kart, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/new-sakurai-directed-kirby-air-riders-announced">Kirby</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-new-nintendo-switch-2-platformer-starring">Donkey Kong</a> games, and a long list of third-party titles coming to the console. The one thing it didn't detail, however, is the pre-order process, which is a little convoluted.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="56edb9ce-2e0e-4efe-b723-cffc17c36b65" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Pre-orders at participating retailers will go live next Wednesday, April 9. At the time of publishing, retailers have yet to prepare their individual pre-order pages (<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/video-games/nintendo/pcmcat1742407305710.c?id=pcmcat1742407305710#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20notifications%20about%20the%20new%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%2C%20games%20and%20more">though Best Buy has a link to sign up for updates</a>), but they will likely be updated within the next few days. That said, based on how recent console launches have gone, it will likely be a fairly frantic process with scalpers attempting to buy up stock to resell at a higher price. Once we learn specific launch times, you'll want to be right on the webpage the moment it goes live to maximize your chances.</p>

<p>To avoid that scramble, you can try to grab your console directly from Nintendo, but there's more to that process than meets the eye. If you head to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">Nintendo's website</a>, you'll be able to sign up to indicate interest in purchasing a system once they're available. To be clear, this is not a pre-order, but a sign-up list to indicate who might want to pre-order, so there's no payment information required. You will, however, need an active Nintendo account – more on that below. Once you sign in, you can choose between a base system for $449.99 USD or a bundle including a digital version of Mario Kart World for $499.99 USD.</p>

</article><p>The timeline here is different, however. Invitations from Nintendo won't arrive until a month or so after, on Thursday, May 8. They'll also come in waves, with additional invites sent out to eligible accounts until the store is open to the general public. Invitations will also only go to account holders that meet the following "priority criteria":</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">The account must be the one that purchased a Nintendo Switch Online Membership.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">That Online Membership must have been active for a minimum of 12 months.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">You must have opted to share gameplay data and played at least 50 hours of games.</li>
</ul><p>If your account fits all three of those criteria, you'll be able to order a console to be shipped to your address – no Nintendo Store pickups are allowed. The link will be active for 72 hours, so it will be less intense than the mad dash on other sites. It also specifies that launch day delivery is not guaranteed and that purchases will be limited to one system per account, though you can also buy accessories for the system.</p>

<p>As wheelchair-bound basketball players, movement involves dragging the Joy-Cons simultaneously to push yourself forward, simulating the movement of pushing a wheelchair. Flicking the controller performs shots, and players can even roll up skateboard-style half-pipes to perform fancy trick dunks. The game’s challenge comes in intuitively using both Joy-Cons at the same time to steer the characters and take it to the hoop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out the trailer below.</p>

The upcoming multiplayer game will be exclusive to Switch 2.</p>

<p>The reveal trailer follows From Software’s standard of using out-of-context clips, showcasing various characters such as a swordswoman wielding a ringblade and a rocket-powered flying robot. Scenes of a gothic castle complex and cathedral interiors create an oppressive atmosphere, and things take a turn for the bonkers with clips of a guy biting someone’s neck and draining them of a dark substance. A character is also seen transforming into a T-Rex-like monster. From Software describes The Duskbloods as a PvPvE experience, meaning players will face off against other human-controlled characters in addition to in-game enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>What does it all mean? The vague narration stating that “the moontears will flow for one and one alone” doesn’t illuminate much. However, a developer diary with game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will air on April 4 and should, hopefully, explain more. But until then, color us fascinated given From Software’s stellar track record.</p>

<p>The Duskbloods is coming to Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

Sakurai is the originator of both the Kirby franchise and Smash Bros., so his involvement with the new Air Riders is exciting news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Details are scarce on the new game, but footage revealed Kirby flying along on a star beside three of his other-colored Kirby friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original Kirby Air Ride released on GameCube over 20 years ago. It was a racing game with simplified controls and high-speed course navigation, which also highlighted Kirby’s ability to suck up enemies and absorb their abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, while some games from today’s Nintendo Direct were highlighted as launch games, Kirby Air Riders features no date of launch on Switch 2.</p>
