            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An ESRB listing has appeared for something called&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out what it might be.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listing</a>&nbsp;appears to confirm a remaster for the game will appear on PC and PlayStation 5 at some point in the future, although since it's just an ESRB listing and not an official PlayStation announcement, it doesn't reveal the extent or scope of the remaster.</p>
<p>This could just be a simple visual and performance overhaul for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-is-set-in-august">PC version</a> alongside a PS5 port, or it could be something more extensive and transformative (although since it's not a remake, we probably shouldn't expect the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date"><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>treatment</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb-tallneck.jpg?itok=vvbtTDL2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb-tallneck.jpg?itok=ysypGcLQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>appears to be getting the remaster treatment soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The ESRB's description for the game sure sounds like&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, although I admit there are a few lines mentioned in warnings regarding "sexual material" and "fictional drugs" that I'd forgotten.</p>
<p>Apparently, a character in&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>makes a reference to "lounging around Elysium watching porn", which has slipped my mind, while others refer to being a "drug addict", meeting a "pusher" selling "Razorwing for eight bucks a tab", and "OD[ing] on Overcast".</p>
<p>Additionally, the word "shit" apparently appears in text and/or dialogue, so there's that.</p>
<p>Again, this being the ESRB, there's no mention of exactly what will be different in this remaster, but if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-remastered-recasts-peter-parkers-face-model">other recent Sony remasters</a> are anything to go by, we can likely expect some visual improvements, some quality-of-life tweaks, and perhaps some extra accessibility features as well.</p>

<p>It's also not clear whether owners of&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>on PC will get access to the remastered version for free, nor whether those who own the game on PS4 will be able to upgrade to PS5 at no extra cost.</p>
<p>We'll probably have to wait for Sony to announce something official before we know for sure. In the meantime, you can refresh your memory of the original&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-review-merging-past-future-into-great-present">checking out our review</a> from way back in the mists of 2017.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-is-new-guest-at-twenty-sided-tavern-key-to-improv-and-dungeons<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <a href="https://thetwentysidedtavern.com/"><em>The Twenty-Sided Tavern</em></a> continues to make a name for itself in its New York run a new collection of faces has appeared, lurking in the corner with a hood over their heads… one of these people is Felicia Day, the first special guest of the Twenty-Sided Tavern. We talked to her about performing at a D&amp;D stage play, and her roots in improv comedy.</p>
<p>Felicia Day should be known by all in nerdy communities as the creator of Geek &amp; Sundry and <em>The Guild</em>. More recently <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e02e379b-4a69-4082-a688-3c8730b18a32" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-talks-making-3d-printing-more-inviting-space-with-feliciaday3d">Felicia Day has been getting involved in 3D Printing</a> and hosting multiple podcasts alongside regular acting roles for live-action and animated productions.</p>
<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Twenty-Sided Tavern</em> is a D&amp;D stage play experience where the players are influenced by audience prompts as well as the outcomes of various audience-led minigames that they can partake in with their mobile phones. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="05539938-70ba-4cd6-98cf-b51345d15acc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/twenty-sided-tavern-is-bringing-interactivity-to-dd-stage-theater">Earlier this year we spoke with DM and Tavern Keeper of The Twenty-Sided Tavern, David Andrew Greener Law (DAGL) and Sarah Davis Reynolds, respectively</a>.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//4zqXlDgzj8M"></iframe></p>
<h2>The Perfect Blend Of D&amp;D, Improv, And Stage Acting</h2>
<p>To start our conversation I wanted to understand how Day got involved in this production. She laughed as she began to explain that she "wished it was more exciting but they called and I said Yes. I am so thrilled, I had actually been seeing advertisements and reviews on all of my socials and I vowed as soon as I could get to New York I would see the show because it looks so awesome and to get an email asking me to be the first guest star for the show was such an amazing honor and I couldn't have said yes fast enough."</p>
<p>At this point Day explained that she had yet to see the show in person, but she had been provided a recording of the show to get a better understanding of how it functioned. "Believe me I do my homework, I'm an A-student" Day confessed</p>
<p>"I will be seeing it multiple times before I go on the stage next Thursday," Day continued "we have a great rehearsal process and I can't wait to get on the stage, it's so beautiful!"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-gameplay.jpg?itok=5fGKsYBv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-gameplay.jpg?itok=62cCJ1lm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A session of The Twenty-Sided Tavern in progress</figcaption></figure><p>With Day being involved in productions from stage to screen across multiple disciplines I wanted to understand what it was that made Day so excited to join as a guest of The Twenty-Sided Tavern.</p>
<p>"As an actor, it's always been my dream to act in a play on Broadway and of course I have been very involved in the D&amp;D world from the very beginning of the broadcasting D&amp;D world and on top of that I've been doing improv for as long as I've been in Hollywood. <em>The Guild</em> actually came out of an improv class, two of the cast members were in my improv group and we still perform occasionally in Los Angeles together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is truly combining three things that I love more than anything in once beautiful package"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on in our discussion Day spoke about the different material she has access to in the lead up to her role in The Twenty-Sided Tavern but reinforced that what she's been working on the most has been improv. "The wonder thing is that I can come and do the show without weeks and weeks of rehearsal because we're making it up, there's a lot of structure, audience interaction, and technical stuff going on but it's one of those things that it's going to be a lot of on the job training"</p>
<h2>The Role Of A Lifetime</h2>
<p>The way that The Twenty-Sided Tavern functions is that at the start of each performance the party is selected. Each archetypal character – Rogue, Warrior, Wizard, etc – has a number of different permutations that can be selected.</p>
<p>The role that Felicia Day is playing is the Mage.</p>
<p>"The character of the Mage depends on the audience, the wonderful thing about Twenty-Sided Tavern is that the audience is completely involved the whole time with what's going on on-stage. The audience gets to choose what character I play, they get an option between three different characters,"&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-audience-selections.jpg?itok=Qt_XeJvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/felicia-day-twenty-sided-tavern-audience-selections.jpg?itok=p06RWA79 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The audience selecting which character they want to see for a night</figcaption></figure><p>Day continued to describe the many ways the Audience gets to participate "there are all these points at which the audience helps me win a battle, or chooses the approach that we take as a party and it's so fun and so amazing, I can't wait to be live in the audience and then I can't wait to be on the stage after that."</p>
<p>Asking how involved she was in building out the skeleton of the three different mage characters Day explained to me that where she'll really be involved in is fleshing that character out past their selection. "The archetypes are there but of course my interpretation of a Gnome Mage is going to be very different from Aabria (Iyengar) or Erika (Ishii's) Gnome Mage so the wonderful thing about improv is that it's unique to the performer."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every scenario is going to be different every night, every character is going to be different every night, heck, my Gnome Mage is probably going to be different every night"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn't resist asking whether there was any chance of a cameo appearance from Codex, Day's character from <em>The Guild</em>. "You know, I don't think Codex will be appearing on this stage but I am working on a Guild musical, we're going to be doing a stage reading of that very soon so you will see Codex on a stage, probably in 2025"</p>
<p>Felicia Day's run at The Twenty-Sided Tavern begins on the 19th of September and will last until the 24th. At the time of writing there is only one showing left for Felicia Day's run, but if you're a fan of TTRPG actual plays like Dimension 20 Aabria Iyengar will be special guesting from September 26th - October 7th and Erika Ishii will be joining the Tavern from December 5th - December 17th.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24247911/wooting-80he-keyboard-gaming-hands-on</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wooting%E2%80%99s-80he-makes-the-best-gaming-keyboard-even-better.984336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24247911/wooting-80he-keyboard-gaming-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Wooting created the best gaming keyboard on the market two years ago with the 60HE. It popularized the use of Hall effect switches and a <a href="https://wooting.io/rapid-trigger">Rapid Trigger</a> system that speeds up how quickly you can activate a key, making it ideal for PC gaming. Now, Wooting has created <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he/wooting-80he">the 80HE</a> — an 80 percent keyboard that makes the best gaming keyboard even better.</p><p>While I’m a fan of 60 percent keyboards for gaming, I miss having a delete key, a print screen button, and even dedicated arrow keys and an F-row. The 80HE adds all of these keys inside a package that really doesn’t feel <em>that </em>much larger than the 60HE. It’s essentially two keys wider and an F-row of keys taller. The extra keys certainly make it more comfortable for regular typing and a lot more convenient than having to mod keys or use function key shortcuts.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Wooting 80HE with a zinc alloy case and white PBT keycaps.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Wooting has also switched up the housing for its 80HE, moving to a gasket mount instead of the tray mount on the 60HE. The silicone gasket mount holds together the board and the switch plate. It does a great job of reducing the noise, making the typing experience a little softer than on the 60HE. You can also adjust the case angle to 2.8 degrees, 7.5 degrees, or 10 degrees thanks to a variety of silicone feet included in the box.</p><p>I’ve been trying out both the $109.99 zinc alloy case and the $34.99 PCR ABS plastic case for the 80HE over the past week, and I personally prefer the zinc material. It’s the pricier option of the two, but you get a hefty case that helps produce the kind of <em>thock</em> sound I enjoy on keyboards. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Wooting 80HE (top) versus the 60HE (bottom).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I found the plastic case a little fiddly to open when I was building a bare-bones module version of the 80HE thanks to the clips holding it in place. The zinc option slid apart a lot more easily, though. You’ll have to be careful if you do take the 80HE apart or build one yourself, as there is a JST cable that needs to be disconnected when you remove the board from the case.</p><p>The sound on the 80HE is also improved over the 60HE thanks to updated Hall effect switches. Wooting’s Lekker V2 switches now wobble less and sound better than the original V1 switches. The differences are subtle, but I always disliked the key wobble on the 60HE default switches, so I’m happy to see that improved.</p><p>The Lekker switches are hot-swappable, so you can swap them out if they break or replace them with any Hall effect switches. Wooting lets you pick between the Lekker L45 and L60, with both feeling like linear switches and the L60s having a little more key start and end force. Wooting also uses screw-in stabilizers to eliminate rattle on the 80HE, and these are also replaceable with most other third-party screw-in and clip-in stabilizers.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You can easily swap the switches and cases on an 80HE.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The real magic of Wooting’s keyboards is made possible by these Hall effect switches, which use a magnet so the board can track how far a switch has been pressed. Most Cherry MX-style switches that are commonly used on mechanical keyboards use a copper mechanism to register a press with a board at a set actuation point of around 2mm. On the 80HE, you can adjust the actuation point on individual keys all the way down to 0.1mm. </p><p>The improved Wootility software allows you to enable adjustable actuation points, Rapid Trigger, and more advanced key functionality. Rapid Trigger changes the actuation and reset point of keys on the fly so that keys will activate the moment you press down and deactivate instantly when you release them. You can then repeat a key press in the middle of a motion, without needing to surpass the actuation point.</p><p>Rapid Trigger is ideal for PC gaming because of the fast deactivation that lets you move around quickly and repeat key presses faster. Keyboard manufacturers like SteelSeries, Keychron, and others have copied the Rapid Trigger feature after adopting Hall effect switches, and it has become a popular feature among <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em> players.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The LED bar can be used for key indicators and much more.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The other big addition to the 80HE is a new LED bar that sits above the arrow keys. Wooting says it’s designed to communicate with you and can tell you which profile you have active on the board or how much RAM or CPU your system is using. You can also just use it for fun RGB effects to match your keys or the rest of your setup. You can configure the LED bar in Wooting’s updated Wootility software. </p><p>One great feature of Wooting keyboards is that they store your profile on the board itself. You configure it in the Wootility web app, and there’s no need to install an app or have anything running in the background on your PC. Wooting is breaking from that tradition somewhat with the 80HE, though. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The light bar can animate during a firmware update.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>If you want RAM or CPU monitoring on the LED bar, you’ll need a new background app, which is coming soon. I haven’t been able to test this yet, but Wooting says it will only be required for the more advanced LED bar functionality. I’ve been using the LED bar as a profile indicator, which is super useful for swapping between gaming and typing profiles.</p><p>If you update the firmware on the 80HE, the LED bar fills up to show the progress, a neat little touch that hints at what will be possible with this new addition. Right now, you can get it to indicate the profile you’re using, when keys are pressed, or to let you know when the CAPS lock key is enabled. It will also be able to show your system volume once the background service is available.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Wooting stores all of your keyboard settings on the 80HE module itself.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The 80HE also supports up to 8kHz USB polling, but no wireless connectivity. While many keyboards promise 8kHz polling, the 80HE also scans every analog key position at that same rate. This faster polling rate also lowers the 80HE latency to just 0.125ms.</p><p>While I appreciate the improvements on the 80HE, the layout means the only options for cases right now are from Wooting directly. I’d expect to see third-party options over time, but until then, you’re stuck with black, ghost, and frost options for the plastic case or black, white, and raw options for the zinc case. </p><p>The 80HE — as a complete keyboard with a plastic case, switches, and keycaps — <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he">starts at $199.99</a>. If you upgrade to the zinc alloy case, prices start at $289.99. You can also buy the standalone 80HE module without switches and keycaps for $154.99, but you’ll need a $34.99 plastic case or a $109.99 zinc alloy one.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989237/keychron-q1-he-hall-effect-analog-switches-price-release-date-specs-features-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23823001/corsair-k70-max-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features-switches">Corsair</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/22/23178213/steelseries-apex-pro-mini-wireless-mechanical-keyboards-hall-effect-omnipoint">SteelSeries</a>, and many others offer similar boards with Hall effect switches, but none quite offer the combination of hardware and software that Wooting delivers. If you’ve always been tempted by the 60HE but wanted more keys, the 80HE delivers that and much more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As I’m sure as is the curse of anyone who’s watched the entirety of Peep Show multiple times, I cannot read the name ‘Marko’ without hearing it in a nasally Australian accent, inquiring about cocaine. This is probably a disservice to the hero of colourful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marko-beyond-brave">Marko: Beyond Brave</a>, who a quick goog tells me may be based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Marko#Epic_poetry_of_Bulgaria_and_North_Macedonia">Krali Marko</a> - a popular character in the folklore of Studio Mechka’s native Bulgaria. Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.</p>

<p>“Entropy has escaped its prison and threatens to engulf the world. Step into the shoes of Marko, a young warrior who uncovers a secret power hidden within,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186470/Marko_Beyond_Brave/">Steam page</a>. “Brave the ancient evils, battle mythical creatures and forge powerful alliances to restore the balance. With elemental powers at your command and every decision shaping the world's fate, embark on a thrilling adventure where courage is your greatest weapon.” I particularly enjoy this last point, given that Marko’s greatest weapon is clearly a comically large sword. </p>
<p>Massive sword aside, here are some more features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Traditional 2D art: The land of Zagora is brought to life in great detail, drawn, and animated entirely by hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Challenging, but fair gameplay: Tight, responsive controls. Jump, fight, and dash your way across challenges. Battle mighty foes and slay ancient evils.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the vast land of Zagora: a huge non-linear map with hundreds of rooms. Solve puzzles and find hidden treasures, all within the Slavic-inspired fairytale setting.</p></li>
<li><p>Encounter mysterious characters: A cast of cute and creepy friends and foes, all brought to life with traditional 2D frame-by-frame animation.</p></li>
<li><p>Master New Abilities: Discover new skills, allowing you to go toe to toe with the most brutal of enemies.</p></li>
<li><p>Discover all secrets: Delve deep into the world and discover hidden areas and unspeakable treasures. Collect all the pieces and puzzle together an ancient mystery.</p></li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I’m definitely drawn in by the art in this one, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>  meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols </a>hoppy-slashy certainly doesn’t hurt - specifically, the press release calls it a "Slavic Silksong". A few of the currently slim number of Steam reviews are reporting technical issues, however - so might be worth holding out until they’re sorted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He tried to juxtapose it with modern games that are either live service hamster wheels or single-player experiences that feel narratively convoluted and full of bloated gameplay systems. </p><p>But he also talked about the game oozing “with so much masculinity that I feel like I’ve been in a desert for the last few years” and how it has “themes nobody wants to go near anymore [like] ‘for courage and honor, for brotherhood, for the emperor.’” LegendaryDrops went on to praise the limited banter among the characters, calling out games that eschew simple good and evil characters and more stoic dialogue. </p><p>The video didn’t blow up until a few days later when YouTuber Asmongold <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/hBUqCUZ0swE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/hBUqCUZ0swE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a nearly hour-long reaction to it</a></span>, agreeing with most of LegendaryDrops’ points and elaborating on some of them. “The problem is not that [modern games] have complex characters, the problem is that their idea of a complex character is a self-indulgent loser that doesn’t have any charisma,” he said at one point. </p><p>He continued: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>That’s the reason why I remember I had to read <em>The</em> <em>Catcher in the Rye,</em> and I hated that book so much. And I feel like the reason why I hated the book is because I thought the main character like Holden Caulfield  or whatever was the biggest simp loser pussy bitch that I had ever, like just such a loser...I bet the people that fucking write stuff like fucking<em> Dustborn</em> or whatever they love that, they think it’s great.</p></blockquote><p>There’s a two-step that happens in both assessments of <em>Space Marine 2</em>. Each argument conflates modern gaming trends that many players find exhausting with a  more recent and boutique reactionary backlash against games accused of shoehorning progressive values into their narratives. These accusations are made whenever a title dares to showcase diverse characters or tell a story that doesn’t solely revolve around the straight white male that’s traditionally centered in video game box art. </p><p>Asmongold bringing up <em>Dustborn, </em>a recent action-adventure indie release about a band traveling across America, is specifically a reference to that. The game and the team behind it became such a target of “anti-woke” reactionaries online that the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dustborn-red-thread-games-harassment-abuse-review-woke-1851636977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dustborn-red-thread-games-harassment-abuse-review-woke-1851636977">had to put out a statement</a></span>. Rather than just disagreeing with the values expressed in the game, it became important for some to show that the game had financially failed and was bad <em>because</em> of those values, the same way some are now championing <em>Space Marine 2</em> not just because it’s a fun or well-designed game, but in part claiming that it’s fun and well designed <em>because</em> it centers young men as the target demographic. </p><p>None of this would have particularly surprised anyone if it wasn’t for Saber Interactive’s own CEO appearing to join in the debate. Matt Karch, who co-founded the company in 2021, appeared to leave a comment on Asmongold’s reaction video near the end of last week. “Hey man,” it began. “CEO of Saber here.  I love your videos.  When we signed the deal to make <em>Space Marine 2</em>, all I wanted was a throwback game.  We had the chance to work on something which by its nature was ‘old school.’ I can’t even comprehend many of the current games that we play these days.  They are too complex and too much of an investment.”</p><p>The comment continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We worked on Halo back in the day, and that game could be distilled down to the simplest of shooting loops, but it was entirely addicting. That is what we wanted to recapture.  I hope that games like <em>Space Marine 2 </em>and <em>Wukong</em> are the start of a reversion to a time when games were simply about fun and immersion.  I spent some time as Chief Operating Officer at Embracer and I saw games there that made me want to cry with their overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers.  We just want to do some glory kills and get the heart rate up a little.  For me that is what games should be about.</p></blockquote><p>It wasn’t until Monday, September 16, when a <em>Space Marine 2</em> news account on Twitter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SpaceMarineALT/status/1835701490511384643&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SpaceMarineALT/status/1835701490511384643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recirculated that comment</a></span> that more people became aware of it. Those in the comment section instantly flocked to it, flooding it with upvotes and positive responses fluctuating between things like “you are doing god’s work” and “I‘m glad we got games failing hard that have pronouns in them, like who tf plays these DEI games?”</p><p>A lot of people probably just thought, “Yeah, <em>Space Marine 2</em> rules, I miss couch co-op and not grinding battle passes.” But for a contingent of the anti-woke gaming backlash, it vindicated the idea that at least one of the scourges of modern gaming is “overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers.” All of this might have been easy to shrug off it not for a highly motivated and ongoing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428">harassment campaign</a></span> against story consultants who, earlier this year, became the boogiemen responsible for every person of color and pride flag that showed up in a major game. </p><p>The YouTube account behind the comment had no uploaded videos and was only created in May of this year. The bio read “CEO of Saber Interactive.  Generic male of sorts - lover of loud guitars, violent games, fast cars and all sorts of whisky.” When asked to confirm if the comment really belonged to Karch, a spokesperson for Saber Interactive declined. “Saber is not commenting on this matter,” they told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. </p><p>So far, 2024 has been full of breakout action games that have eschewed some of the excesses associated with open-world RPGs and grindy multiplayer games in favor of more streamlined and “old-school” feeling designs, and some (though not all) have been dragged into a culture war that seems to not so secretly be about entirely different things. <em>Stellar Blade</em> was a sci-fi Souls-lite that became mired in controversy around sexy costume censorship. <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> was a fantasy action game in the mold of <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>that became a breeding ground for fake conspiracies around nonexistent attempts to get the game canceled. And now<em> Space Marine 2</em>, a straightforward shooter campaign with crunchy combat and dazzling set pieces, has become the latest Rorschach test for what ails modern blockbuster gaming. </p><p>There’s extra irony in a <em>Warhammer 40K</em> game becoming that crucible, given its openly fascist world-building and the fact that the owners of it have had to repeatedly remind the more toxic corners of its fanbase that “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/11/19/the-imperium-is-driven-by-hate-warhammer-is-not/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/11/19/the-imperium-is-driven-by-hate-warhammer-is-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warhammer</em> is for everyone</a></span>.” To the degree that <em>Space Marine 2</em> doesn’t “impose” morals on the player, it’s only because the politics of its universe are so obviously bleak and abhorrent that regular people know to treat them as grim dark fantasy rather than a hero’s journey parable for 21st century virtue ethics. </p><p>There’s another hit game that’s recently bucked modern blockbuster gaming trends, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-sony-concord-ps5-pro-1851648360?rev=1726405020058&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-sony-concord-ps5-pro-1851648360?rev=1726405020058">and it’s <em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>. There are no daily quests, crafting systems, or XP grind in that either, just a crisp and highly refined mashup of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> collectathon platforming. Weirdly, no one seems to be obsessed with whether the cute little robot at the center of the game is a paragon of masculinity or secretly a vehicle for transmitting woke propaganda. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-co-founder-dreamhaven-lynked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2020, Dreamhaven was unveiled by Mike Morhaine, the co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment. Today, the somewhat mysterious company has more than 100 staff members, and it’s preparing to lift the lid on its first internally developed game. </p>



<p>In the meantime, it has been revealed that the firm is publishing Lynked: Banner of the Spark, which was recently showcased during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dawn-of-dreamhaven">Dawn of Dreamhaven</h2>



<p>Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier just revealed that Mike Morhaime’s Dreamhaven is the publisher behind Lynked: Banner of the Spark, an all-new cooperative action title with city-building elements and colourful combat sequences.</p>



<p>In 1991, Morhaime co-founded Blizzard Entertainment, and speaking to Bloomberg, the man himself was transparent about a comparison between Blizzard and Dreamhaven:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When we started Blizzard, we really had no idea what we were doing. This is a much more experienced leadership team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Next month, Dreamhaven will unveil a new game developed by Secret Door, a studio headed up by another Blizzard veteran – Chris Sigaty. Previously, Sigaty worked as the executive producer on StarCraft II. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-18/blizzard-co-founder-s-new-company-dreamhaven-aims-to-recreate-the-old-magic?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Per Bloomberg’s report</a>, Dreamhaven has been open about the struggles it has faced since it was founded. The last four years have been critical for the games industry, thanks to COVID-19 and the ongoing financial woes plaguing the wider market. Because of these issues, Secret Door’s title missed internal deadlines.</p>



<p>It was noted by Sigaty that Secret Door’s first game, produced with the backing of Dreamhaven, should be out next year, but a relatively small team and tighter budgets may cause further alterations to that timeline.</p>



<p>In a quote about the future of Dreamhaven’s titles, Morhaime said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The size of these games probably are not going to be the size of a Blizzard game. But the quality bar we’re trying to hit is still there. We’re trying to still put out high-quality, polished games that people can love and enjoy and share with their friends.</p>

      </div>
<p>This remaster includes improved visuals, with 4K resolution and 60fps, as well as adjusted game balance and difficulty options.

Its online servers were shut down in December 2021. Dimps senior vice president <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/09/18/20240918-freedomwars/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Takashi Tsukamoto said</a> that while Freedom Wars Remastered will not have cross-play with different platforms, online play will be available. PS4 and PS5 players, however, can play with each other and share online rankings.</p><p>The original Vita version of Freedom Wars only had Japanese audio, but Tsukamoto also confirmed that the remaster will feature English audio.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-16-and-rebirth-did-not-meet-our-expectations-square-enix-says.984279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that profits from&nbsp;tentpole releases&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, which launched last year and earlier this year respectively,&nbsp;"did not meet [its] expectations".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/pdf/24q4outline.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results outline released earlier today</a> (but pertaining to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down">presentation from May of this year</a>), Square Enix simply says that profits from both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rebirth&nbsp;</em>didn't meet expectations, but CEO Takashi Kiryu doesn't go into any further detail.</p>
<p>He does, however, say later in the outline that Square Enix plans to "establish a development footprint" aimed at "consistently and regularly releasing titles that beat our customers' expectations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=1V0n8UmT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=u9nVpcTi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>didn't meet expectations, according to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>This being a relatively public-facing presentation and outline, Square Enix doesn't state exactly what its expectations were for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, so it's hard to say exactly by how much the two games missed the mark.</p>
<p>The company hasn't publicly disclosed sales for&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, but back in September last year, Square Enix said that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-expectations-square-enix">were in line with its expectations</a>&nbsp;(a statement issued the month before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-ceos-reported-statement-on-final-fantasy-xvi-sales-is-widely-misinterpreted">having apparently been widely misinterpreted</a>).</p>
<p>We also know that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>shipments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-shipments">topped three million</a> within the game's first week on sale, so whatever Square Enix's expectations were for the game, they must be pretty high.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, too, that Square Enix doesn't say the two games weren't profitable; not meeting expectations isn't the same as not making a profit, so it's entirely possible that while both games made money for Square Enix, they simply didn't make enough.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=ZLwHWNGn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=Ll1rTFOQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>'s sales were also disappointing, according to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>, either. In the presentation, Kiryu admits that&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>, Square Enix's entry into the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>-style family-friendly shooter market, didn't perform quite as well as expected, which is probably why <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/foamstars-free-to-play-october">the game is going free-to-play</a>.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this outline pertains to a presentation from a few months ago, but the document was made public today. As such, this doesn't necessarily reflect Square Enix's current standing;&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-requirements-demo">since launched on PC</a>, although<i>&nbsp;Rebirth&nbsp;</i>remains a PS5 exclusive, at least for now.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of impact this has on Square Enix's strategy when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-prototype-designs-seemingly-leak/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The prototype designs for the Nintendo Switch 2 have seemingly leaked online. First appearing on Chinese social media before making <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/photos_of_switch_2_factory_prototypes_have_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">their way to Reddit</a>, the images give a look at what could be the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor.</p>



<p>Based on the leaked design, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a larger screen, new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">magnetic Joy-Cons</a>, and multiple USB-C ports. It’s general look will remain similar to the original Switch. It will also carry over the back stand design from the Switch OLED model compared to the small kickstand look of the base Switch.</p>



<p>With the aforementioned Joy-Cons, the images show that the way the attach will be different than the original. It also seems to support the earlier rumors of addition buttons on the back of each controller.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-nintendo-switch-2-specs">What About Nintendo Switch 2 Specs?</h2>



<p>In addition to the general design, some specs of the Nintendo Switch 2 have also reportedly been leaked. The Switch 2 will featured 12GB of RAM, HDMI 2.1 support, and even 256GB of internal storage. The system supporting HDMI 2.1 seems to back up earlier claims that the console <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support 4K resolution</a> in some capacity.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Insider Gaming has not been able to independently verify the legitimacy of the Nintendo Switch 2 design images. Until we can, or something is made official, the leaked images and reported specs should still be taken with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>Nintendo has yet to respond to requests for comment on the design leak. It’s unlikely they will, however. They are expected to reveal the console sometime later this year with a 2025 launch. If you want to see the images of the leaked design, you can do so below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What next for Final Fantasy?</h2></div><section><p>Square Enix has finally made public its dissatisfaction with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>’s commercial performance, admitting neither game met profit expectations.</p><p>In a financial results briefing held May 13 but only released today, September 18, Takashi Kiryu, president and representative director of Square Enix said: "In the HD Games sub-segment, we released multiple new titles, including major titles such as Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but profits unfortunately did not meet our expectations."</p><p>Kiryu went on to suggest Square Enix cannibalized sales of its Final Fantasy games released during the financial year ending March 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Final Fantasy XVI Echoes of the Fallen and The Rising Tide Game Awards 2023 Trailer Gallery</h3></div></output><p>“We recognize that issues remain in the Digital Entertainment segment,” Kiryu admitted. “The HD Games sub-segment failed to better its profitability, posting operating losses in every year of our previous medium-term plan. In addition to this, we did not manage our title portfolio across the company as well as we could have, which I believe resulted in opportunity losses due to cannibalization between our own titles."</p><p>Square Enix released Final Fantasy 16 in June 2023, then Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth just over half a year later in February 2024. Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both launched as PlayStation 5 exclusives, and while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-responds-to-final-fantasy-16-sales-concern-points-to-ps5-install-base">Square Enix <em>has</em> announced a sales figure for Final Fantasy 16</a>, it has yet to do so for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the second game in the company’s trilogy of Final Fantasy 7 remakes.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-maker-square-enix-will-aggressively-pursue-a-multiplatform-strategy-after-profits-tumble">The company has already announced a significant rework of its business</a> as it fights for profitability. It has a new multi-platform plan that encompasses PC and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-to-double-down-on-xbox-releases-final-fantasy-14-producer-says">potentially Xbox</a> and the next Nintendo console (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-pc-global-release-times-confirmed">Final Fantasy 16 launched on PC this week</a>). But it has also canceled a number of games, and, Kiryu revealed, taken steps to better curate its pipeline of games.</p><p>“In the case of the HD Game sub-segment, sales of individual games will remain the key variable, but we believe that we will be able to exercise some degree of control over that volatility by carefully curating our pipeline over the next three years,” Kiryu said. “By also working steadily to improve our profitability, we intend to offset the weakness in SD games to achieve overall profitability.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We did not manage our title portfolio across the company as well as we could have.</p></div><p>Square Enix has now extended the timelines for a portion of its pipeline, “in part because of the massive amount of time required to develop HD games, and in part because we determined that we should rethink how best to deliver some of the titles we had under development to our customers,” Kiryu revealed.</p><p>Final Fantasy isn’t the only Square Enix series struggling. Its Splatoon-style game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/foamstars">Foamstars</a> also flopped and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-makes-playstation-splatoon-shooter-foamstars-free-to-play-8-months-after-launch">has since gone free-to-play</a>.</p><p>So, what’s next for Square Enix? Square Enix has <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, the third game in the Final Fantasy remake trilogy, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate"><u>Dragon Quest 12</u></a> in the works. In January, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-producer-naoki-yoshida-says-it-may-be-time-for-the-younger-generation-to-handle-final-fantasy-17"><u>it might be time for a younger generation to lead the franchise and helm Final Fantasy 17</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>The Switch 2 is claimed to have 12GB of RAM--up from the 4GB inside the current Switch--HDMI 2.1 support, and an internal storage capacity of 256GB. As for the controllers, the leaked design shows off revised SL/SR buttons and a different layout for LEDs. Nintendo has said nothing at all about what to expect from its next system, apart from how it is aiming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-nintendo-has-nothing-to-announce-but-says-next-console-aims-to-surprise-and-delight/1100-6512297/" data-ref-id="1100-6512297">"surprise and delight"</a> fans when it is officially revealed.</p><p>There have been a <em>lot </em>of rumors regarding the final design of the Switch 2, and recently, it was reported that <a href="https://x.com/gibbogame/status/1831250317805314457?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 could be announced by late September or early October</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff Project T has officially been canceled by publisher Behaviour Interactive, and not only that, but the game's development studio has also been shut down.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1836103012575781262" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Behaviour says that following a playtest for&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>in July, the studio "ran a thorough internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective".</p>
<p>Behaviour goes on to say that while players "expressed appreciation" for&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>during the playtest, the outcome of the studio's "deep analysis" ultimately yielded "unsatisfactory overall results", leading to the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Project T</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-t-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-gameplay.jpg?itok=1DxIWXu8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-t-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-gameplay.jpg?itok=7HCzoQMQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project T&nbsp;</em>is officially dead...by daylight.</figcaption></figure><p>Behaviour doesn't go into any more detail regarding why the results of its playtest were "unsatisfactory", and since that kind of information is likely to stay within the studio, we'll probably only find out if a former developer speaks out at some point.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we're not likely to be seeing anything from the developers in their current state, because according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dansalexander_sadly-after-nearly-7-years-my-time-with-activity-7241896961732182017-D77M/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple</a> former Midwinter <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241867580527804417/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developers</a> on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregory-marques-39a711_my-studio-abruptly-closed-today-midwinter-activity-7241917376005349376-pHsG/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, the studio has been closed down along with&nbsp;<em>Project T</em>'s cancellation.</p>
<p>One employee describes Midwinter's closure as "abrupt", possibly indicating that staffers perhaps weren't warned about the studio shutting down in advance, which could in turn suggest that Behaviour made the decision fairly abruptly.</p>
<p>In any case, <i>Project T</i>, which was first fully unveiled just a few months ago as part of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s eighth anniversary, is no more, and neither is Midwinter, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Spotted by reliable Rockstar news source Tez2, the developers “accidentally included” Red Dead Redemption PC’s metadata in the latest launcher update that introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-anti-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-cheat for GTA 5</a>. However, Rockstar has promptly removed the data, and players can no longer spot files about RDR1 PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tez2 has linked the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2668510/info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> page for Red Dead Redemption’s PC port. In the update history section, players will see that developers provided three updates for the listing yesterday, and the changelog shows regular updates over the past few months. However, it hasn’t been confirmed as the official SteamDB page for Red Dead Redemption’s PC port.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1836018840150458526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videotechuk_</a> is another reliable source for Rockstar Games news, and they recently provided more details about the launcher update. Based on the X post, the update included data for several games, including Americas, GTA III Definitive Edition, GTA IV, GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition, GTA V, GTAV Gen 9, GTA Vice City Definitive Edition, LA Noire, LA Noire VR, Max Payne, Red Dead Redemption, and Red Dead Redemption 2. It’s worth noting that “Project Americas” is believed to be the internal codename for GTA 6.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption is Rockstar’s first entry that takes us on an expansive journey across the Wild West. The game was first released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2010 and received a port for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in 2023. However, this top-rated single-player adventure has yet to receive a port for the PC and the current-gen consoles, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.&nbsp;Players speculate that the latest find might lead to an official announcement from Rockstar. </p>

                <p>It's not uncommon for video game projects to be delayed by unexpected issues. But GSC Game World, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-clear-sky-review/1900-6198116/" data-ref-id="1900-6198116">STALKER</a> and its upcoming sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-to-november/1100-6525281/" data-ref-id="1100-6525281">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, had the terrifying and unique experience of being disrupted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Now, the first trailer for a new documentary, War Game: The Making of STALKER 2, chronicles the struggle that the team had to go through in order to finish the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWyO6X3hQsQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PWyO6X3hQsQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Andrew Stephan directed War Game, which takes viewers behind the scenes at GSC Game World as their lives were upended by the invasion. Creative director Maria Grygorovych and her team were previously based in Kiev before the start of the war. But GSC Game World ultimately had to move development from Kiev to Prague while the fight for their homeland continues to this day. War Game was sponsored and produced by Microsoft, and it will be released on Xbox's official YouTube channel.</p><p>"It wasn't my dream to do this film," Grygorovych told <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/stalker-2-ukraine-war-developers-doc-xbox-1236146958/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>. "But I really think it's important to share... We are really not public people and it's hard to share something personal. But when this opportunity comes to us from Microsoft, we thought that it's important to share with the world a little bit more about how difficult it is to live in a wartime from the personal side... When you see specific people who can share some real story, maybe someone can imagine how hard it is and why any war is something bad. It's impossible for me to find some reason to start a war."</p><p>Not all of the team members fled the country, and some stayed behind in Ukraine to fight. One of STALKER 2's developers, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/how-the-developers-of-stalker-2-weathered-the-ukraine-war-to-make-their-game-the-deanbeat/#:~:text=One%20Stalker%202%20developer%2C%20Volodymyr,its%20web%20site%20as%20well" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Volodymyr Yezhov</a>, gave his life while defending the city of Bakhmut from Russian forces in December 2022. Grygorovych noted that some of GSC Game World's programmers, QA members, and community managers enlisted with the Ukrainian army despite not being professional soldiers, and she hopes to welcome them back to the company when the war comes to an end.</p><p>War Game: The Making of STALKER 2 will premiere on YouTube on October 3. STALKER 2 will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC on November 20.</p>

If they can find them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer spoke with Konstantin Kopka, the game’s designer, to talk about how ecosystems and stages helped shape the game’s unique animals, the challenges that would lead to them adopting an on-rails movement style over an open world, and why they gave the player a tool to fidget with as they waited for that perfect photo opportunity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> sees players snapping pictures of eerie creatures in an abandoned wildlife park. Can you tell us a bit about what inspired you to create this experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kopka: Our main inspiration was, obviously, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the N64 and our childhood memories of playing that. We tried many different approaches to figure out the best design and ended up with our take on what we thought was the "heart" of that experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We took many mechanics and tried to improve on them to make the levels and monsters as interesting as possible and focused a lot on replayability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> straddles the line between cute and creepy. What drew you to capture these two feelings with the game's visual style?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The art for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was done by my brilliant sister, Elenor Kopka, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/elenorkopka/">who also does animated short films and ceramics</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Weird, ghostly things were a common obsession for all three of us, but Elenor brought the cuteness with her art style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into designing the game's various creatures and creating a whole ecosystem filled with strange beings to photograph?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like all creative ventures, this was a very iterative process. We started with a small roster of creatures to see how they would look in-game and kind of just went from there. Over time, through the collaboration of Elenor (art) and Philip Feller (animation), the park's inhabitants grew to over 100 distinct creatures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As soon as we had the vision for the different levels locked in, we tried to think about how the creatures would fit into the park's ecosystem, why they would be there, what they would do, and how we could set the scene for them.</span></p><p>Image via Ghostbutter.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what ideas went into the creature's behaviors and the faces they make? How did you create and design all of the little actions and things they do so they felt natural to this world and would give the player interesting things to take pictures of?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elenor and Philip did a brilliant job with that. I am really happy with the uniqueness of them all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We designed a system of symbols (e.g. a smiley face, a frowny face, etc.) to give us a general guideline on what poses we would build. In the end, most creatures ended up with a mix of "standard" poses and one or two poses that are completely unique to this particular creature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A very important design guideline we discovered was that it was important to have that ideal "photo moment" in the pose to give the player something to aim at.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to have the action take place on-rails? How did that affect the design of the game in ways both good and bad?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For a long time, initially, we actually had the game set in an open world, and we were very enthusiastic about this because it seemed cool and new.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We ran into tons of issues with this, however. The world felt very empty and confusing. As soon as we scrapped this aspect and made it a focused, on-rails experience, things just clicked into place and became much more fun to play. It was not an easy decision, but I think the game ended up better because of it.</span></p><p>Image via Ghostbutter.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>As the game plays on rails, what thoughts go into creating a world and inhabitants that offer interesting photo opportunities when movement and perspective are limited?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The on-rails aspect meant that our level design process was almost like designing a ride in an amusement park where you can exactly control when and where things happen. This made it easier for us to create suspense, and even (very light) jump scares.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to have the player (eventually) be able to stop the cart entirely posed some challenges because it restricted what we could and could not do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The game rates the player' photos of the creatures as they snap pictures. What drew you to add this rating system? What thoughts went into choosing how this system would grade the pictures?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of our biggest frustrations when playing and re-playing the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game was the tedious, slow rating process that happened after you finished the ride. So, from the start, we knew that this was something we wanted to improve and make way more fluid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rating algorithm is actually quite sophisticated. It even detects things like "how much of the creature is actually visible in the photo and how much is obscured by the environment, grass, etc."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, by having a one to three-star rating system, we allow for 100% completion of the game, which is important to some players.</span></p><p>Image via Ghostbutter.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the design of the photo album and giving the player a nice place to put their pictures while also offering some useful gameplay elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted the photo album to feel very rewarding and fun to browse, so we made sure that the process of putting the best snapshots into their slots would feel satisfying.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The camera has the ability to show the player a different take on the world with the Ghost-o-Vision. What drew you to add this functionality? What interesting elements do you feel it added to the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Ghost-o-Vision mechanic is introduced a bit later in the game and adds the new challenge of limiting the time the player has to find the ghost. It's also related to the lore of the park and I think it adds a nice bit of diversity to the overall mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to allow the player to interact with the world using the Grappling Hand? What do you feel this element added to the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We thought it would just feel good to shoot stuff with a huge grappling hook/hand thing, so that was the main reason we added it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over time, we figured out more and more how this would actually be used in the game. For example, the ability to shoot and destroy parts of the environments was added very late in the development but quickly became a favorite. It's also a nice "fidget" mechanic that allows players to do something while idle, especially if they already replayed the level a lot.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson has stated AI is "the very core of our business" and the company has over a hundred "active novel AI projects" to assist with game development.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company held its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvX8NMGUxI">Investor Day 2024</a>, detailing its next games and innovations: including the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">The Sims</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedis-final-chapter-currently-in-development-at-respawn-says-ea">Star Wars Jedi</a> and Battlefield.</p>
<p>Yet AI was a major part of the presentation. Speaking of generative AI, Wilson said: "This remarkable technology is not merely a buzzword for us, it's the very core of our business."</p>

<p>The company has over a hundred AI projects, said Wilson, across three strategic categories.</p>
<p>Efficiency is not just about cost saving but "doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality", he said. Expansion is about "giving our creative teams an exponentially bigger canvas upon which to create" by adding depth and intelligence to characters and personalising stories. Lastly, the company will accelerate innovation and the creation of content through Transformation.</p>
<p>"For years we have talked about our games delivering experiences that are always new and different," said Wilson. "We predict that with generative AI we will truly be able to fulfil this promise for billions of people for billions and billions of hours."</p>
<p>So how are these AI projects being put into practice? Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment and Technology, spoke at length about AI opportunities - after briefly running through forthcoming single-player games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and the Star Wars Jedi games, as well as the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>.</p>
<p>At present, EA's current game-development infrastructure handles a billion AI requests daily, Miele said, while the company's AI tools power in-game features for stable game experience, personal recommendations, and create a fair and secure gaming environment.</p>
<p>One specific example of AI use is in The Sims for its forthcoming hub that acts as a central platform for all series games. AI is powering discovery tools so that Sims players can search for suitable in-game assets using photos rather than text.</p>
<p>Through photo-based searching, players can find housing elements or even upload a photo of a real human to create their likeness. While powerful, there's also potential for this sort of function to be abused.</p>
<p>Another example is EA's new Script to Scene tool, which essentially allows game development to be done through text or voice prompts. This includes creating characters and scenes, as well as direct performances, all using generative art, AI-enabled game development, and procedural generation.</p>
<p>These are clear examples of how AI is already impacting game development. Indeed, as Eurogamer reported in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">AI is already used by 62 percent of studios</a>, according to a report by Unity. Character animation was the biggest use case.</p>
<p>And just yesterday, Eurogamer reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-boss-we-cant-do-graphics-anymore-without-ai">Nvidia boss Jensen Huang who discussed the advantages of AI</a> as a key component for advancing graphical capabilities.</p>
<p>Other areas of AI use are for NPCs, scriptwriting, and voice acting, which have all received criticism.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-will-feature-new-storytelling-tech-that-will-be-used-across-various-ea-studios/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In July 2023, following several rumors, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be working on a Black Panther game in development by Cliffhanger Games, a Seattle-based studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-new-studio-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-veteran-kevin-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in 2021 by Kevin Stephens. At the time, EA said it would be a third-person single player action/adventure game featuring an original story.</p>
<p>After quite a bit of silence on the project (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-game-reportedly-in-development-at-motive-will-launch-before-black-panther/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to launch after Motive's Iron Man game</a>), Laura Miele (president of EA Entertainment and Technology) revealed some interesting tidbits about the Black Panther game while she discussed the company's efforts in the $20 billion action/adventure and action/RPG segment of the market during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvX8NMGUxI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA's Investor Day 2024</a>.</p>
<p><em>Next is our studio in Seattle, Cliffhanger Games, and its renowned leadership team known for innovative action RPGs such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Black Panther will be a love letter to fans combining vibrant characters, the world of Wakanda, an original story, and all-new technology, delivering groundbreaking design and storytelling that will actually transfer across many games and studios in our company.</em></p>
<p>The most interesting piece of info is the new tech hinted at by Miele. The new technology will deliver 'groundbreaking design and storytelling' not only in the Black Panther game but also in future EA games, as it will be used by other internal teams, too.</p>
<p>No further details were shared at this time (the game is still in early production), but it's hard not to connect the dots. Kevin Stephens, the founder of Cliffhanger Games, was originally a Director of Engineering at Monolith Productions before becoming its Vice President and Studio Head. As such, he certainly had extensive knowledge of the <a href="http://wccftech.com/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-video-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemesis system</a> featured in Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War.</p>
<p>At the time, the Nemesis system was praised for creating unique moments between the player and the NPCs; while far from flawless, it hasn't been replicated in any other game to date. It's possible Cliffhanger is working on a similar concept, perhaps empowered by generative AI (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-ceo-says-generative-ai-is-the-very-core-of-business-not-a-buzzword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being used extensively at EA</a>). We'll have to wait for actual Black Panther game details to know for sure, but it is certainly an intriguing prospect.</p>

            <p>As per EA’s recent <a href="https://eainvestorday2024.q4ir.com/home/default.aspx">generative AI tugathon</a>, the third game in Respawn’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> adventure Star Wars trilogy has been confirmed again to be in development. According to EA, it’ll be the “final chapter" in the now-trilogy, following 2019’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Jedi Fallen Order</a> and 2023’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Jedi Survivor</a>.</p>
<p>The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedis-final-chapter-currently-in-development-at-respawn-says-ea">Eurogamer</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, EA’s s president of entertainment and technology, Laura Miele, had this to say during a presentation at the company’s investor day:</p>
<p>“Over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi. Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players."</p>
<p>The same series of presentations also saw EA CEO Andrew Wilson say that generative AI was at the “very core of our business”, and EA showcase some sort of <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1836190095910523025">horrific creativity-begone machine</a>.</p>
<p>Respawn’s previous two offerings were both well received, although Jedi Survivor has been plagued with performance issues on PC - although a recent patch looks to have helped.</p>
<p>Last September, series director Stig Asmussen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-jedi-survivors-director-is-leaving-ea">left EA after a decade at Respawn</a> - despite making <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-director-wants-to-make-cals-saga-a-trilogy">comments to IGN</a> earlier in the year that he has “always” seen the Jedi games as a trilogy.</p>
<p>“An undeniably fun Star Wars sequel with a suitably epic story and smart combat, but a hell of a lot of busywork alongside it,” was Alice Bell’s (RPS in peace) verdict in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Jedi Survivor review</a>. My own verdict is that I lasted an hour before having to change the spoken language from English because I disliked the main character so much. I also decided I didn’t want to play anymore at all an hour later, though, so don’t listen to me. Very good lightsaber hitting, though!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players guide Aloy as she learns to hunt robotic creatures and animals in the wild. Aloy uses arrows, spears, and explosive traps to injure and kill machines, boar, and occasional human enemies. Animals and humans emit small puffs of red blood when struck; one sequence depicts an abandoned camp with large blood stains on rocks and trees. The game contains a brief reference to sexual material (e.g., “Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn?”). In text / audio files, characters sometimes reference fictional drugs, overdoses, and getting high: “…not even out of junior high and already a drug addict”; “…I ran across a pusher who was selling Razorwing for eight bucks a tab”; “I’d spend a few days getting high, then OD on Overcast.” The word “sh*t” appears in the text / dialogue.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p>The recent first look at the PS5 Pro also showcased Horizon Forbidden West running on it, so another update for Horizon Zero Dawn wouldn't be an unusual move for Sony. On top of that, fans of Aloy and the post-robot-apocalypse can also look forward to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-release-trailer-story/1100-6526137/" data-ref-id="1100-6526137">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> later this year, as that game puts a more lighthearted spin on the series.</p><p>It's also rumored that Guerrilla is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-horizon-online-co-op-game-confirmed-in-job-listing/1100-6510122/" data-ref-id="1100-6510122">Horizon multiplayer game</a>, so things are looking quite busy right now for the franchise.</p>

		<p>Achilles: Legends Untold is getting free DLC content today in the shape of Fates of Moira, a collection new gameplay modes that are available to play once the main story campaign is completed. The name is reference to the character Moira, who becomes a central part of this mode, and it also deals with the fates with different challenges awaiting Achilles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Achilles Legends Untold: Fates of Moriai - Update 1.5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2ytN7qanH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The three modes that Achilles: Legends Untold Fates of Moira brings are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Inevitable Fate of Atropos: Precision and caution are your greatest allies. Every melee hit you land instantly kills any non-boss enemy, but the stakes are equally high for you—one hit and Achilles falls.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Fate of Clotho the Spinner: Achilles constantly loses HP, pushing you to play aggressively to stay alive. Using Hades Vision pauses the life drain, and you can heal by killing enemies with Drain Souls. However, you can’t attack or use weapon skills in Hades Vision, adding tension and strategy to every move.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Fate of Lachesis The Allotter: A relentless Laistrygon hunts you on every map, immune to conventional damage but can be slowed or debuffed. It grows stronger over time, forcing you to survive through strategy and cunning. The Ariadne’s Thread can temporarily remove the threat, but be prepared—it will return stronger than before.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the announcement of the free DLC, Dark Point Games has also confirmed that Achilles: Legends Untold is available from today on PS4 and Xbox One, with a Nintendo Switch release following later this year. Paweł Waszak, CEO of Dark Point Games, said, <em>“Given the strong demand and numerous requests we’ve received from our community, we decided it was important to make our game accessible to a wider audience. That’s why we’re excited to announce that we will be releasing the game on older-generation consoles, including Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. We want everyone to be able to enjoy the experience, no matter what platform they’re on.”</em></p>


<p>In our Achilles: Legends Untold review, Adrian said, <em>“The Greek Myths have been plundered by video game developers to such a degree it’s hard to conceive that a fresh take could be even possible. Remarkably, Achilles: Legends Untold offers just that. This action-adventure might be a little rough around the edges, but that arguably adds to its charm. If you can put up with some nasty difficulty spikes then you’ll find a remarkable world of myths and legends to explore.”</em></p>
