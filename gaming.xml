			<p>King of Meat is a strange name for a game, to state the obvious, and yet it totally fits the daft modern cartoon vibe that it’s going for, with bizarro riffs on quirky jokes running throughout. Set in Loregok, a techno-medieval world that’s gone absolutely ga-ga for the titular game show, your path to stardom is to dive into the dungeons, overcome platforming challenges, battle past skeleton minions, and make it through to the end. And you can become a star dungeon designer as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="King of Meat: Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/stZ0Vvfvd6s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, this is dungeon crawling by way of the dearly departed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a> – and this makes complete sense given Glowmade’s background. Where LIttleBigPlanet pioneered accessible User Generated Content (UGC), this has exploded in importance over the last few years with the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/roblox">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> becoming home to entire universes of created game experiences. King of Meat is much closer to a LittleBigPlanet or a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/05/05/review-modnation-racers/">ModNation Racers</a> in scope, sticking to its particular genre and trying to nail the fundamentals.</p>



<p>With that in mind, the third-person platforming and dungeoneering is eminently accessible. You’ve got a jump and a Yoshi-like flutter jump that is basically all you need to get around the world, and then there’s a variety of weapons for when enemies spawn and rush towards you. You start off with sword and shield and a crossbow for a bit of range, but can swap those out for a hammer, grenade launcher, knuckle dusters and more that you unlock as you progress. The melee weapons all have particular styles, basic and charged attacks, and attack combos that you can quickly learn.</p>

<p>Alongside these core weapons are a gradually growing range of magical abilities, first with a bellowing belch that will repel all before you, or a simple healing flask that can come in handy for tougher levels, and beyond to giant horse hooves stamping down from above.</p>
<p>You’ll apply all of this to levels that blend together platforming, combat and puzzling. Glowmade has stuffed the game with around 100 levels – created, in-game, by Komstructor – and they run the gamut of ideas, being sorted into three buckets of difficulty and labelled with generalised tags for what to expect from them.</p>
<p>It’s nice and easy-going on the whole. Combat does lack a bit of oomph to it, and it can often feel like you’re not really doing much to the hordes you’re battling – possibly because, for the tougher enemies, you really aren’t. When there’s four of you, you can always pick up buddies that have been downed, or they can give up and respawn from the gloop cans at the next checkpoint, but if all of you are downed, it’s game over. I really enjoyed some of the examples of puzzling that I saw, though, leveraging the basics of switch pulling, button shooting, and bringing power cells to key locations alongside game logic to provide some light brain teasers. One example had you pulling switches in order, Simon Says style, while another had multiple switch combos opening different doors. A bit trickier to manage when playing without voice communication, mind you.</p>

<p>And, of course, a lot of that will sound instantly familiar to anyone who explored the creation tools of LBP or Dreams. There’s a straightforward logic engine running in the background that can be twisted and bent to create all manner of things, from simply spawning in enemies as you and your team enter a room, to setting spike and flame traps to run on timers, program platforms to move around the world as you need, and much, much more complicated tasks.</p>
<p>The creation tools try to make all of that as manageable as possible, and I think Glowmade has done a fantastic job of organising those tools and providing the views you need. It starts with a blueprint phase where you place and connect rooms and hallways together, matching up their doors together, and it’s here that you’ll really realise that this dungeon builder works entirely on a single plane, albeit with doors on two levels and the ability to raise and lower the scenery within these spaces. That does put some shackles on what you could create, but that’s not really a bad thing.</p>
<p>From there you can switch to a 3D view and manipulate the scenery, put in place those traps, enemies and spawners, and then delve into the nitty-gritty of hooking up and configuring the logic behind it all.</p>

<p>Again, there’s huge amounts of potential and possibilities here –&nbsp;a user level I saw shrouded the whole level in darkness, with braziers flaring only as you reached certain points, forcing you to fight enemies mostly in the dark –&nbsp;and that can be hugely rewarding if you have the time and the desire to really embrace this. It can also be a bit daunting and overwhelming to try and come up with a concept and then actually make it. It’s really down to the player themselves what they want to get out of this, but I’ve come to be more of a consumer of UGC games than a creator.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of joy to simply consuming King of Meat, though. This is a fun setting, with the shared space lobby area having you run back and forth between different vendors, who always have quirky things to chat to you about. Then there’s the interstitial cartoons, which are all fantastic and lean right in on modern cartoon styles with an excellently pitched sense of humour. It’s absolutely geared towards younger gamers, but adults will get a wry smile out of it too. Oh, and I’ve got to mention the announcer who introduces each level and booms over your achievements like it’s a cross between Wipeout and Robot Wars.</p>

			<p>Square Enix Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGVWVq8cJPI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was at last week's Brasil Game Show 2025</a> to discuss Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 and the trilogy as a whole. Speaking about the decision to split the original game into three parts, he explained:</p>



<p><em>Final Fantasy VII is a game with a truly huge fanbase. We could have cut some parts and turned it into one game, but the fans of the original would never have forgiven us. If we want to tell this story using new technology, it's not possible to do so in a single title. That's why we made the difficult decision to split it into three parts.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview on stage, Hamaguchi expressed confidence that the ending of the final chapter of the trilogy would satisfy both new and old fans:</p>



<p><em>Of course, I already have a clear idea of ​​the ending for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3. I think this conclusion will appeal to both those who loved the original and those who became fans of FF7 thanks to the Remake series. I'm confident this new game will be loved by everyone.</em></p>



<p>Nearly a year ago, Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 would need some twist to make it a unique and exciting experience compared to the previous two. We still don't know what that will be, but we recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did get confirmation from Tetsuya Nomura</a> (another director on the series) that the game (and Kingdom Hearts IV, too) is on schedule.</p>



<p>Looking at the four-year timespan between Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, we might have to wait another two to three years before the conclusion to the remake trilogy is out. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous games are launching on Xbox Series S|X and Nintendo Switch 2</a>, starting with the first chapter.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Creator Doubles Down on Who Dropped The First Nuke]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-creator-double-down-first-nuke-drop/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-creator-doubles-down-on-who-dropped-the-first-nuke.1324096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In 2023, Fallout’s creator, Tim Cain, uploaded a video explaining <strong>which country </strong>dropped the first nukes in the Fallout universe. It was revealed that it was <strong>China </strong>that fired first, which put to rest the assumptions made by many over the game’s twenty-plus-year history.</p>



<p>Now, in an all-new video, Tim Cain has doubled down on his confirmation, explaining in more depth <strong>why </strong>China fired first. It’s lore that is mostly understood by die-hard fans, but it’s always nice to get a little more of a backstory for a universe so expansive and densely populated as Fallout’s.</p>



<h2 id="h-china-fired-first">China Fired First</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-first-nukes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Two years ago</a>, Tim Cain confirmed that China dropped the first nuke in Fallout, kicking off the Great War and bringing about the destruction of the entire planet:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reason we got nuked is: bio-weapons were illegal and somehow China found out we were doing FEV. And they were like, ‘You have to stop it.’ And we went, ‘Okay’. But all we did is move it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a new video, Cain once again touched on the topic and went into more depth about why China dropped the first wave of nukes on the United States:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>China nuked first.</p>



<p>It’s pretty obvious from the game. This isn’t canon, but let me explain what I mean and why we thought that. </p>



<p>In the original game we had established that the US was doing bio-weapons research. We weren’t supposed to, we had signed a UN treaty saying we wouldn’t do that, and I think you can find that out in the game. China discovered that we were doing it, but how did they discover that? </p>



<p>Espionage. </p>



<p>We went, ‘Oops our bad we’ll stop doing it. But we just kept on doing it, we just moved the research to another base. It’s the hidden base where you discover ZAX the supercomputer.</p>



<p>They just nuked us. We nuked back, other countries nuked, because all anyone saw was missiles flying. China technically started it by firing the first nuke, but you could argue that technically the US started it by doing illegal bio-weapons research then lying about it multiple times.</p>

<p>It’s an expansion on what we already knew, but Fallout fans <strong>love </strong>this kind of lore, so they’ll eat it up (myself included).</p>



<p>In the video, Tim Cain goes on to talk about Fallout-themed tidbits, such as why Vault Suits look the way they do, and how some brands wound up being implemented in the universe. It’s a treasure trove for the game’s biggest fans, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>If you’re planning on booting up Battlefield 6 with a Cronus Zen attached, there’s bad news waiting for you. In a series of posts on social media, it has been revealed that users are receiving account suspensions from Electronic Arts when trying to play Battlefield 6 using a Cronus Zen, an infamous piece of technology mostly used by malicious operators in games.</p>



<p>An image uploaded to social media showed that<strong> </strong>Electronic Arts is <strong>permanently blocking access </strong>to Battlefield 6 for those found to be using a Cronus Zen in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-won-t-prosper">You Won’t Prosper</h2>



<p>The Cronus Zen input device has long been the face of controversy in the gaming world, simply because it offers malicious advantages to those using it. It can massively reduce recoil, aid with accuracy, and introduce macros that users can lean on to gain an upper hand over their opponents, and it works on both PC and console platforms.</p>



<p>In a string of posts on social media, users started sharing images of bans after trying to boot Battlefield 6 with a Cronus Zen engaged:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The discourse has proven that both console and PC platforms are being impacted by these punitive actions, which have been met with jubilation from fans worldwide. In one post, a user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Cronus</strong> Zen community is losing their minds and getting banned on <strong>Battlefield</strong> 6 lmao. How about play the game how it was intended to be played and have fun?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stated that the ‘lead programmer’ for the Cronus lineup has mentioned how the device is ‘cooked’ for Battlefield 6, and that the team has advised users <span><strong>not to</strong></span><strong> </strong>use their Cronus Zen when playing the all-new FPS title.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a huge win for Electronic Arts? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

<p>Before we get to this, it appears there's apparently one more update in the form of a live stream.

<p>Fingers crossed this is just an update about the game's content, and Level-5 can reconfirm this latest entry really will be arriving next month on Nintendo platforms. The previous delay in July 2025 was apparently tied to recordings, localisation and "other related processes". More recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-trailer-dives-into-level-5s-repeatedly-delayed-baller">we also got a new trailer for the title</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Beta Matches Were ‘Nearly 99%’ Cheater-Free]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-matches-beta-cheaters-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-beta-matches-were-%E2%80%98nearly-99-%E2%80%99-cheater-free.1324084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, Activision’s Team RICOCHET has highlighted that ‘nearly 99%’ of matches in the Black Ops 7 beta were free of cheaters. This statistic has already been met with criticism, with many users claiming that they had cheaters or other malicious operators in their matches during the open beta.</p>



<p>Team RICOCHET has remained positive, emphasizing continuous improvements, and the median time to identify cheaters has been reduced to ‘under three matches’. What’s not clear is how many matches that 1% represents. Is it 1000 matches, or 100,000 matches?</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-still-won-t-be-free-of-cheaters">Black Ops 7 Still Won’t Be Free of Cheaters</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to rid Black Ops 7 of cheaters entirely, as with each new improvement made by Team RICOCHET, the world’s cheat manufacturers respond with their own evolutions. It’s a never-ending battle that can only <span><strong>improve&nbsp;</strong>and will never be entirely resolved</span>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1977766811916746869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent post</a> on social media, Team RICOCHET stressed those improvements:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve crunched the numbers for Black Ops 7 Beta, and RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history. </p>



<p>Each&nbsp;day, our cheat detections got faster and your matches got cleaner. </p>



<p>By the end:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nearly 99% of matches were cheater-free</li>



<li>The median detection time for cheaters was three matches.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Clips still surfaced online of cheaters ruining the fun for legitimate players worldwide, but Activision was quick to stamp these out and point out that the wrongdoers had been forcefully removed from the Call of Duty platform.</p>



<p>In recent years, Call of Duty has suffered immeasurably under the weight of cheaters, especially in modes like the game’s ranked play platforms. It’s a gruelling place to try and enjoy yourself, and it always seems like it ebbs and flows quite dramatically.</p>



<p>This year, the hope for Call of Duty players is that Team RICOCHET is in the best place possible and that foul cheaters worldwide have their attentions fixed elsewhere, such as on the recent release of Battlefield or the upcoming 1.0 launch of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>I’m not wishing ill will on those games, but the diversification might help spread the cheaters across a wider base rather than having them all focus on one game.</p>



<p>Will it be enough to propel Black Ops 7 into a better space when it’s released next month? Let me know what you think on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-early-access.1324075/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is right around the corner, but is there early access so you can play even sooner than that normal release date?</p>



<p>Looking at the calendar will fill sandbox fans with joy that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date is nearly here</a>, but sometimes, the super fans will do all they can to get their hands on a game as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Here is the answer to whether or not Jurassic World Evolution 3 has early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-jurassic-world-evolution-3-in-early-access">Can You Play Jurassic World Evolution 3 in Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can you guys see any early access up there? Image via Frontier</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access available for Jurassic World Evolution 3. Everyone will have access to the game on October 21 at 10 AM ET.</strong></p>



<p>Life may find a way, but early access did not find a way to follow <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> to release. The sandbox and park simulation game will have you building up your own Jurassic World amusement park, which has always gone well for people in the movies, right? Whether that is on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X, you will have to wait until the 21st to get your dino fix in.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a video game release will work in a three-day early access release for players who purchase a deluxe edition, but that is not included this time around. Instead, all you get for the extra $15 spent on the deluxe is four additional family units and some bonus skins and scenery. Whether or not that is worth it is completely up to your tastes.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-a-playable-demo">Does Jurassic World Evolution 3 Have a Playable Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, no, there is not a playable demo available for Jurassic World Evolution 3 either. Your only chance to play the game is to buy it outright.</strong></p>



<p>With this being the third game, you could maybe find the previous two games for cheap to see if you like it before spending the full price tag on <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>. That, or if you are an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, you can play the second game with your subscription.</p>



<p>When it comes to demos, many games these days avoid offering them to players. The thinking for that is, while it could be exciting for some players to give the game a try and fall in love with it, others may be turned off, and then the developer and publisher wouldn’t get any money out of the deal. It sucks, but that is where we are in gaming.</p>

<p>With this in mind, Time Magazine's website has featured the Switch 2 on its "best inventions" list of 2025. This list features 300 of the "best inventions making the world better, smarter, and more fun", and includes categories like robotics, accessibility, apps and software, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is listed under the 'Entertainment &amp; Gaming' category, which is all about revolutionising how "we play, create, and consume content". One other notable device featured on this list is the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/tags/rog-xbox-ally">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. Here's the attached description for the Switch 2, along with a list of the other inventions featured in this category:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The original Nintendo Switch rewrote the rules for portable gaming. Its 2025 sequel increases the power without sacrificing portability. A sampling of its impressive stats: An Nvidia Tegra T239 chip, alongside dedicated ray-tracing and Deep Learning Super-Sampling (DLSS) cores, lets the new model run at 4K on TVs, while the on-device 7.9-inch HDR display runs handheld titles at 1080p and 120Hz, meaning there’s no flicker during gameplay. Its 12 GB of LPDDR5X memory also helps keep sprawling open worlds stutter-free. Launched in June, the console sold 3.5 million units in its first week—making it Nintendo’s fastest-selling hardware ever."</p>

<p>The Switch 2 was also recently shortlisted for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/mario-kart-world-and-donkey-kong-bananza-shortlisted-for-console-game-of-the-year">'best gaming hardware' award</a> alongside the system's Pro Controller.

<p>Say hello to 'Nintendo Fukuoka'</p>

<p>Further details are scarce at the moment, but Nintendo says the store will be located in JR Hakata City (Amu Plaza), a large shopping mall consisting of clothing stores, furnishing retailers, restaurants, and more.</p>
<p>Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital of the Fukuoka prefecture. It's located within the Kyushu island of Japan, meaning it's significantly separate from the main industry island of Honshu, home to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, and Hiroshima.</p>

<p>The upcoming Nintendo Fukuoka store will join existing branches in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, the latter of which opened in October 2023. Meanwhile, joining Nintendo New York in America is the new San Francisco branch, which recently opened on 15th May 2025.</p>
<p>Nintendo of America President and COO Doug Bowser led the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and the store offers customers the opportunity to customise their Switch Joy-Con colours. Miniature replicas of the store's character statues are also available.</p>

<p>Including achievements and a new name...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Argonaut Games has announced its Croc remaster is getting a major update. It's officially titled <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc Legend of the Gobbos: Platinum Edition</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This free update will be applied to the console versions of the game (including Switch) on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> and promises to deliver the "best possible Croc gaming experience".</p>
<p>The 'Platinum Edition' of the game will include a new Time Attack mode, 25+ additions to the Crocipedia, the ability to swap between Croc Main Theme mixes in the main menu, bug fixes, and a bunch of quality-of-life features and improvements.</p>
<p>The team also explains how the name change is tied to PlayStation's Trophies system. This same update adds a new trophy set and will also bring these same achievements to the Switch (including its own "in-game Achievement tracking screen").</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So why the new name? Great question! When we initially launched the <em>Croc Legend of the Gobbos</em> remaster<em>,</em> we didn’t include enough trophies to qualify for the Platinum trophy on PlayStation. And it’s not permitted to simply fix this with a patch. So we had to come up with a smarter solution: release a new version of the game with a comprehensive trophy set, including 16 new Trophies and the highly coveted Platinum Trophy."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, this update is out later this week for the Switch. You can learn more about this title in our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Croc: Legend of the Gobbos wasn’t exactly a revolutionary entry in the 3D platforming genre even back when it released, and though it still doesn’t necessarily ‘wow’ us today, it certainly is an entertaining and worthwhile adventure. Things like the new controls, enhanced presentation, and extensive museum content are satisfying additions, and the core adventure itself is still good retro 3D platforming fun, warts and all."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo date is quickly approaching, giving everyone a first glimpse at what you can expect from the upcoming game from your favorite critic or content creator.</p>



<p>This sequel is easily <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-the-outer-worlds-2-pre-order-bonuses-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the more anticipated games of 2025</a>, with many RPG fans ready to jump back into this galactic universe full of flawed people and chaos.</p>



<p>Here is when you can expect The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo to lift.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date-explained">The Outer Worlds 2 Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No need to rush, the reviews are coming soon. Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo is set for October 23 at 9 AM ET.</strong></p>



<p>When the clock strikes 9 in the morning along the East Coast, you can expect plenty of sites and YouTube channels to start dropping their reviews for the game. If you are curious if one of your favorite critics or content creators is covering the game, you should consider checking their social media accounts. Many have already posted that they are playing the game early and will be working on a review when the time comes.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-review-scores-prediction">The Outer Worlds 2 Review Scores Prediction</h2>



<p><strong>Given that the game is a direct sequel and will do many of the same things that the original did, but expanded, you can probably expect The Outer Worlds 2 to have a similar review score to the first game. Somewhere between 83-87 makes sense for this kind of game.</strong></p>



<p>The first Outer Worlds game sits at 85 on MetaCritic, with the remastered Spacer’s Choice at 72 because of performance issues and not really bettering the experience in any way. Unless the sequel is absolutely mired in bugs and glitches, it shouldn’t fare too poorly with critics.</p>



<p>To some who are thinking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-outer-worlds-2-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> might be their most anticipated game of 2025, an 85 might seem low. Of course, we haven’t played the game yet to know for sure, but that is actually a very good score for any game release, let alone an RPG. That being said, if you are expecting the game to contend with other top games this year that reach well into the 90s, you might come away disappointed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Obsidian Entertainment</a> is a brilliant development studio with tons of talent and a great back catalog of games, they’ve never been one to have a game score 90 on MetaCritic outside of Pentiment, which was a shock to just about everyone. We’re willing to be surprised, but don’t expect it.</p>



<hr>



<p>What are your guesses for The Outer Worlds 2 review scores? Do you think it can contend for the best Obsidian games ever? Or will it be more in line with the original game? Let us know in the comments or on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

                <p>In June, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/">FBC: Firebreak</a> became Remedy's first self-published game as the company attempted to expand its shared universe that includes Control and Alan Wake. Remedy has previously disclosed that Firebreak's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-unsatisfied-with-fbc-firebreak-sales-but-it-still-plans-to-turn-things-around/1100-6533852/" data-ref-id="1100-6533852">sales came in below expectations</a>, but the latest report indicates that the game will cost the company a very significant write down.</p><p>Ahead of Remedy's quarterly financial report on October 29, the company <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared an update</a> that it is on the hook for a €14.9 million loss or approximately $17,234,085. Remedy notes that this amounts to "a majority of the game’s capitalized development costs," before adding that the company's cash position hasn't been changed by this setback.</p><p>Firebreak ran into trouble out of the gate with 1,992 players on launch day, which turned out to be its peak. Those numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have since drastically fallen</a> to less than 100 concurrent players per day. Remedy subsequently acknowledged that players were particularly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fbc-firebreak-update-will-address-the-game-frustrating-opening-hour/1100-6533265/" data-ref-id="1100-6533265">unhappy with the first hour of the game</a> and promised to rectify its shortcomings with a future update.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFx8yMOC67w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rFx8yMOC67w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Remedy rolled out the Breakpoint update at the end of September, which included a playable tutorial for new players that walks them through the basics, while adding context for the game's world, including The Oldest House from Control. The update also made significant changes to how players pick their missions. However, Remedy noted in its report that the update has not met its' "internal targets" despite earning "improved player and sales metrics."</p><p>The company is currently working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/" data-ref-id="1100-6514998">on Control 2</a>, in addition to the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake project alongside Rockstar Games.

<p>Get ready, trainers</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The end of this month officially marks the first anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> on mobile devices.</p>
<p>This title has been regularly updated with new expansions and features like trading, and soon it will receive even more "new and updated" features in the form of three major updates "coming soon".</p>
<p>There's the new share feature, the tradable cards list is being expanded, and there'll be improvements to the wonder pick feature. Here's some PR about each feature, and you can see it all in action in the trailer above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementation of the new share feature</strong>
<ul>
<li>A feature that lets you give ♢–♢♢♢♢ rarity cards to friends.</li>
<li>You can send one card to each of your friends each day.</li>
<li>Once friends send you cards through the share feature, you can select and receive one card each day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Range of tradable cards expanded</strong>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to trade cards from even the most recent booster packs.</li>
<li>In addition to cards of ♢–♢♢♢♢ rarity and ⭐︎1 rarities, ⭐︎2 and Shiny 1–Shiny 2 rarity cards will also be eligible for trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improvements to the wonder pick feature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cards from the latest expansion that you have not obtained will appear more often.</li>
<li>The number of cards you currently own will be displayed on each card in wonder pick.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The team says it's working hard to bring these updates to players "in the best possible way" and continues to listen to player feedback while developing and maintaining the title. The Mega Evolution expansion will also kick off at the end of October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is having another one of its "<a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjONe?object_uuid=74b18853-6a80-450b-b150-73f3aece1d26&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Buy 2 Get 1 50% Off</strong></a>" sales and it is absolutely filled to the brim with puzzles this time around. There are hundreds of options included in this sale from some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">best puzzle brands</a> out there. If you're on the hunt for your next puzzle, or are just looking to grab a nice gift for the puzzler in your life, this promotion makes it a great time to save some money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To take advantage of the promotion, you'll just need to add two eligible jigsaw puzzles to your Amazon cart and the 50% discount will be applied to whichever one is the least expensive. And since it isn't just puzzles included (there are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-october-2025">board games as well</a>), you can also mix and match with other items to still get that discount. I've gathered some of my top picks from this sale below, but there's a ton of other options available if you want to browse the sale yourself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Jigsaw Puzzle Sale on Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I mentioned above, there are a <em>ton</em> of puzzles included in this sale. I couldn't possibly include them all, so I've only highlighted a few top picks that I think best represent what is included here. There's a fairly wide variety of piece counts, from 300 to 3000, but I mostly stuck to 1000-piece puzzles here as they are the most popular whenever I've covered a puzzle sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are looking for some suggestions for what to buy, the Spider-Verse puzzle from Buffalo games has been on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">best puzzles for adults</a> for over a year now. It's got a ton of different Spideys and is consistently one of the most popular marvel puzzles out there. There's also the Disney &amp; Pixar Shop puzzle from Ravensburger that offers something similar for fans of Disney instead of Marvel. There's a bunch of characters and easter eggs hidden in each one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd also recommend checking out The Drippy Trip puzzle. It's the latest puzzle made by The Magic Puzzle Company and actually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">features a few fun secrets</a> from the popular cartoon Adventure Time. If you aren't familiar with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles">Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</a>, they are a mix between jigsaw puzzle and magic kit and are generally very popular with families. There have been five different series of these types of puzzles and Amazon has a bunch of them featured in this sale right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Board Games Are Also Included</h3><div catalogid="c50f91cc-9caf-48e8-84b9-2ba2d04822db" id="229501"><div id="229501" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buy 1 Get 1 50% Off Board Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's buy 1, get 1 50% off sale also extends to board games.

From our in-house, best-in-class photogrammetry to full-body mo-cap and even our bespoke enemy AI systems, every single bit of Unleash the Avatar has been lovingly hand-crafted.”</p><p>Mayya added, “Every wishlist counts because not only does it build our confidence that we’re making something you care about, but it signals to the world that Indian games have an audience. So if the trailer resonates with you and if you believe in a bold spin on the Soulslike genre from a scrappy team, please hit that wishlist button now.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><div><p><strong>■ Latest Informaton</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Independent game developer Aeos Games revealed a substantial amount of gameplay for its upcoming Indian Epics-inspired Soulslike, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>. The events of the game are set in an alternate version of India where the player is up against the wayward forces of Naraka (hell) who manage to unseal the barrier between realms. Along with challenging enemy encounters and memorable boss fights, players will also uncover the events that led to hell on earth and fight back the darkness for good.</p><p>The trailer shows off the haunting vistas of Vishwapur. This once pristine coastal locale is now overrun by Nisthari Rakshas. Players are tasked with defeating them with an assortment of combat options at their disposal ranging from genre staples like dodge, parry, and stagger attacks along with some new innovations like a ranged chakra and a flashy feather prism form.</p><p><strong>■ FAQ</strong></p><p>First up, we’d like to thank each and every one of you for your support for <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>. It’s heartening to see so many people care. Our team is heads down and working to get the game out so that we can live up to your expectations.</p><p>Now, before we start getting into how exactly <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is built in terms of tech, art, world, and story, here’s all the basic information about the game in one place. This should clear doubts you have about <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and what to expect.</p><p><strong>Who is Aeos Games?</strong></p><p>Aeos Games is the game development studio behind <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and is a part of the Aeos group of companies. Founders are brothers Varun and Rohan Mayya. The core development team is a mix of newcomers and industry veterans that have worked on games such as <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>; and movies like <em>Shazam</em>&nbsp;and <em>Flash</em>.</p><p><strong>What is Unleash the Avatar?</strong></p><p><em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is an Indian Epic Soulslike set in an alternate timeline featuring flashy, intense combat against legendary foes.</p><p><strong>What’s <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story about? What’s my character called?</strong></p><p>While it’s a little too early for us to reveal all of <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story, what we can say is, the game takes place in an age where the barrier between Naraka (Hell) and Earth has eroded and both Asuras and Rakshasas—have found their way to Earth. Imbued with a sliver of Lord Vishnu’s power, it is up to you to restore balance to the universe by putting an end to the demons’ sinister plans.</p><p><strong>Why is there an alternate India setting in this trailer that’s more inline with high fantasy instead of the relatively modern setting of the first trailer?</strong></p><p>The first trailer was meant to be a test of our photogrammetry systems and a public showing of our intent to work on a title from India.</p><p>Following feedback from our fans we felt the alternate high fantasy, Indian Epics-inspired setting you see now is more in line with the story we want to tell—and what our fans want to see—from a game like ours.</p><p><strong>What can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on? Can I wishlist it now?</strong></p><p>For now, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is slated for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,525 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via Steam. We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch. Stay tuned to our Steam page reveal and wishlist us to support what we do.</p><p><strong>Do I have to pay to play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p><em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is a premium, one-time purchase. No battle passes. No loot boxes. No daily grind. No dark patterns.</p><p><strong>When will I be able to play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>Remember that this is our first production title so we may not be super accurate with our launch dates as it is hard to tell right now. Internally however, we’re on course for a 2026 launch window. We’re currently in the production phase so we do have playtests every now and then. If you would like to be a part of these, keep an eye on our socials for playtest announcement dates.</p><p><strong>Can I make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>? Will you copyright strike my channel? Is there an <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> creators program?</strong></p><p>Yes you can make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and no we won’t copyright strike your channel. There are exceptions to this such as using <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> art, screenshots, videos, and gameplay to misrepresent the game or being in violation of our content creator guidelines. And yes, there is an <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> creators program. Stay tuned to our socials to know more.</p><p><strong>Is <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p><p>For now, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is slated for PC via Steam. We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch.</p><p><strong>Can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on the Steam Deck / ROG Ally / Xbox ROG Ally X / Lenovo Legion Go 2?</strong></p><p>We’re big fans of handheld PCs and we’d love to bring <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> to Steam Deck and other devices as well. Right now though, our focus is solely on desktops and laptop-grade computers.</p><p><strong>Is AI used in making <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>If you’re referring to enemy AI systems that are a cornerstone of every soulslike, yes those exist. If you’re asking if we’re using generative AI tools to make Unleash the Avatar, the answer is no. The game is handcrafted with love by fans of the genre, using gen AI would be a disservice to soulslikes and their fans.</p><p><strong>Is there anything new that we get to see in <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> that isn’t in other games?</strong></p><p>Built from first principles, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> runs on several custom systems: a fragmented-chakra engine with its own physics, enemy AI that knows when to reset posture, when to press, and how hard to push (tuned centrally), and a rigorously engineered parry model. Add generous chances to aura farm, and you get a soulslike that feels familiar, yet unmistakably new. We’ve also manually scanned countless photogrammetry assets from old towns in India specifically for <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>, so enjoy an authentic reconstruction of India in a video game!</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/indian-epics-inspired-soulslike-action-rpg-unleash-the-avatar-early-alpha-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>

<p dir="ltr">In April, the PEGI ratings website <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reportedly-been-rated-for-the-switch-2/1100-6531001/">listed Switch 2 as a platform for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. On top of that, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exec-teases-new-versions-amid-switch-2-rumors/1100-6533378/">the game would get "new versions</a> that will come to other machines" in July. Assassin's Creed Shadows launched in March on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-vantage-studios-a-creative-house-focused-on-three-major-franchises/1100-6535136/">Ubisoft revealed Vantage Studios</a>, which will oversee development on the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. There also recently was a report that Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/">canned an American Civil War-based Assassin's Creed game</a> because of concerns it would be too controversial.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>. The game is set in feudal Japan, following the shinobi Naoe and samurai Yasuke.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="25b964ba-1595-45a4-84b1-e7d705f5dc6c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrobotanica" rel="nofollow"><em>Astrobotanica</em></a>&nbsp;is an indie survival title being developed by&nbsp;Space Goblin Studio. Funded through a Kickstarter campaign, the title offers a relaxing survival experience during the prehistoric era of Earth. Playing as an alien named Xel, you have the technology to scan plants, animals, and cavemen, create various tonics that can cure illnesses, decrease air needs, and more. I've been interested in the game since I first heard about the Kickstarter campaign and jumped at the chance to dive into the demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bulk of the demo consists of scanning different plants to learn what they do, interacting with one caveman named Ube, and solving puzzles. It gives a relatively well-rounded feel of what&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;offers to the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="a90d9136-1388-4f79-8f46-10943fc6369d" href="https://techraptor.net/genre/survival" rel="nofollow">survival genre</a> mechanics wise. You scan plants and animals to see what they are. Scanning Neanderthals allows you to see what their current health status is. Interacting with them gives you to the chance to heal them and learn their language. Plants have different properties raw and when made into a tonic, with tonic making being a frequent action for surviving.&nbsp;</p>

From collecting trophies to put in specific places, using plant juices, or pushing orbs found in ruins to their correct position, the puzzles stand out as one of the interesting parts of the game. Not only were there multiple things to solve, all of the puzzles were different. If this variety is kept up in the complete version it will give&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;the ability to stand out amongst competitors that have 2-3 puzzle layouts that repeat with various difficulty through those titles.</p>

<h2>Lacking a Hook</h2>

<p>While most of the game mechanics are well explained, there is zero story tying game aspects together. Why are you on this planet? Why do you want to heal Neanderthals? What is your name? The only way you find out what you're called or your appearance is from the P.R.I.M.A.L. tab. Besides that, there's little else to really give you a reason to do, well, anything. If you don't watch any trailers, read the in-depth Steam page description, or skim through news about&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>, you have no idea what the game is about. What is the over-arcing goal that you're meant to work towards?</p>

<p>Hopefully the lack of narrative is due to the demo being a small sample of the early access version.&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;is supposed to be rich with lore, and hints of that are present. You can find different idols and stone tablets while exploring the demo area. However, what they represent or say, and even where they are stored in your inventory, are mysteries.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=jNAgGHYc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=-9Pc0FlH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Regardless of missing narrative, there is a quest tracker that updates as you complete various tasks. These include scanning a plant, making a tonic, and healing Ube. There's no real draw to it, though. No fanfare is made when an objective is complete. It's not the biggest issue, but being reminded that a task changed and you're focusing on something else certainly helps streamline the quest cycle.</p>

<p>Other missing items include map markers on the map or being able to put a marker on the map. Even when you buy the P.R.I.M.A.L. HUD upgrade, the map remains unchanged and pretty much useless since you'll be using the HUD compass for all your navigation needs. Since you only have access to the first level of upgrades, map markers could be listed later on.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrobotanica-primal-tab.jpg?itok=l_MNnIvf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrobotanica-primal-tab.jpg?itok=iRIL09a3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One other massive aspect of&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;that was missing in the demo was building. Many open-world survival games have building as one of the big draws to playing. You can design your own camp, create an epic castle, grow massive gardens, etc. The same can be said for this game based on the Kickstarter information. When it comes to the demo, you can't do any building aside from placing garden plots in the demo. You can see some structures you'll be able to construct in the future, but can't actually place them in the world, even if you do unlock the plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game struggled as I continued to play. By the time I wrapped up my three hour session, it was consistently lagging, sluggish to load areas as I moved around, and put excess strain on my PC. This is a concern for players on older computers and those that like long gaming sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;may have a unique premise and story that is ready to set it apart from the competition, but with no narrative present in the demo and lacking many staple mechanics of the survival genre, it's hard to see it. Open world survival crafting games are extremely popular, with titles like&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72a14f4d-4d77-4ace-a3aa-09008b8c98bf" href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld" rel="nofollow">Palworld</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="294eedd9-16ba-4c31-9a65-967aeca4d3fc" href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow"><em>Enshrouded</em></a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5840301c-ab91-4d31-a561-7a7d64d82464" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy" rel="nofollow"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>, and <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbd23abe-125c-4cba-8afc-994aaf0735ef" href="https://techraptor.net/games/rust" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>.</em>&nbsp;It's a competitive niche to launch a game in.</p>

<p>Many of these smaller issues could be in development and were simply unready for the demo. Nonetheless, playing the demo didn't hook me. There was no story to grab my attention, and the mechanics present weren't unique enough to keep me wanting more.</p>

                <p>The details surrounding the first pack of paid DLC for Borderlands 4 have been revealed. Dropping November 20th, this narrative-based content--called Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day--will feature all new missions, enemies and legendary gear. </p><p>Developer Gearbox Software shared these details on October 11 during a panel at PAX Australia. Apparently, Mercenary Day (think Christmas) is being threatened by the Timekeeper’s Minister of Culture. It’s up to Rush and the vault hunters to show them the error of their ways using an assortment of guns, grenades, and all manner of skill-based attacks. </p>

<p>Aside from the loot gained from completing missions and extra collectibles (like a new Drone Skin or Vault Hunter Style), players will also gain access to a Vault Card with unlockable rewards. There will be 24 cosmetic items to collect and 4 pieces of rerollable gear that can be earned multiple times, giving players a chance to roll each weapon with the “right” stats.</p><h3>The Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card loot:</h3><ul><li>4 rerollable weapons</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Heads usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Skins usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>5 Weapon Skins</li><li>5 Vehicle Skins</li><li>4 ECHO-4 Drone Skins</li><li>2 ECHO-4 Attachments</li></ul><p>Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day will be available for players who purchased either of the Borderlands 4 Deluxe editions. The bounty pack can also be purchased via a bundle (which includes all 4 packs) or as a single piece of DLC.</p><p>Gearbox also mentioned Borderlands 4's free seasonal content, including a new mini-event: Horrors of Kairos. From October 23 to November 6, players will be able to face tough world bosses in areas affected by blood rain. Each one will have a chance to drop new legendary loot. If that wasn’t enough, Gearbox is also planning to release new seasonal cosmetics through the use of SHiFT codes.</p><p>Then there’s the new endgame content coming in Q4, an early highlight being a tough boss called Bloomreaper the Invincible. Confronting this boss will be akin to starting a raid-like experience--players will have to adjust their builds in order to deal with Bloomreaper’s giant health pool and powerful attacks. Basically, Borderlands fans have a lot to look forward to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The system specifications of the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox have allegedly been finalized, and the next console by Microsoft is expected to consistently deliver better performance than Sony's system, according to a known leaker.</p>



<p>The rumors originate from the NeoGAF forums, where KeplerL2, a known AMD leaker with a solid track record, has commented on the recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/"> leaked specifications of the PS6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">the so-called Xbox Magnus</a>, saying that <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/page-6#post-270890566">they have been finalized</a>, corroborating the information shared by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>. </p>



<p>With these leaked specs in mind, the insider doesn't see <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270891283">how the PlayStation 6 can match the Xbox Magnus</a>, as it has fewer CPU cores, lower CPU frequency, fewer CUs (Compute Units), fewer ROPs (Render Output Units), lower GPU frequency, less cache, and memory bandwidth. The difference is not huge, but it is big enough that the next-gen Microsoft system is expected to deliver better performance in 100% of games, unlike this generation. Sony's system, however, should still have plenty of AI horsepower, as it should be capable of <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270893113">~1200 TOPs</a> (Trillion Operations Per Second), a huge jump from the PS5 Pro 300 TOPs.</p>



<p>The insider also commented on the RAM the PlayStation 6, the PlayStation handheld, and Xbox Magnus will likely have - <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270890829">30, 24, and 36GB, respectively.</a> For the two home systems, this would be a considerable jump over the 16GB of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which was expected, considering that ray-tracing support and AI-powered features are likely to become more important than in the current generation.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, it seems like Sony will be the only company to have two systems with different specs for the next generation. According to KeplerL2, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270892965">a lower-end Xbox Magnus model is possible</a>, but nothing in the documentation they have seen suggests that this is going to happen.</p>



<p>While KeplerL2 has proven to be one of the more reliable sources for early hardware information in recent years,, we have to take what they have revealed with a massive grain of salt. With both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">Xbox Magnus reportedly targeting 2027</a>, however, it will likely not take much longer to learn more about Sony's and Microsoft's next-generation systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Variety is the spice of life, and this is incredibly relevant when playing TTRPG like Pathfinder. No one wants to battle the same sets of goblins and highway bandits over and over again. To add a bit of variety to our games, we took a look at the Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers.</p>

<p>These packs of painted minis are intended to add a bit of variety and flair to battles, matched to the region that you'd likely encounter them in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before even getting to what's in any of these packs I'm a fan of them being corralled by the region where you'd likely run into them. When there are just so many monsters in the Pathfinder Bestiary, it can be difficult when trying to build an encounter from scratch to know what is available to you.</p>

<p>These collections, even as a list of names online, allows players searching for a new foe to throw into a Forest or Swamp encounter a few interesting alternatives because again… Variety is the spice of life.</p>



<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Bog Dwellers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Grimstalker</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Mudwretch</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Castoroides</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bog Mummy</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Boggard Scout</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Shimmernewt</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-02.jpg?itok=GXtaisgD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-02.jpg?itok=F6X1XK5x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This group can be split pretty evenly between the cuties and the creepies. The cuties are made up of the Castoroides, the large beaver-like creature, the Boggard Scout, ready to pounce or attack with it's conch morning star, and the Shimmernewt, who really isn't doing anything… Ironically the Shimmernewt is the deadliest of these creatures at CR 6.</p>

<p>These characters stand out with bright colors or recognizable features. The Castoroides and Boggard both do a good job of directing you towards their features, informing you about their abilities. Whether it be the Castoroised claws and tail, or the weapon the Boggard is wielding and it's dexterity. While the Shimmernewt is just standing their it's bright color immediately draws your eye.</p>

<p>On the creepier side the Grimstalker and Bog Mummy both fall into a very similar looking "Swamp Zombie" category. While accurate to the look the meshing of the dark greens and brown does give these minis a bit of a legibility issue when across the table from you.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Battles Cave Lurkers</h2>

<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Cave Lurkers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Xulgath Skirmisher</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Xulgath Stoneliege</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orc Warchief</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Myceloid</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hunting Spider</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Cave Scorpion</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-03.jpg?itok=QEEpN386 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-03.jpg?itok=yodPx5VQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I'm in love with every single mini in this pack. Of the humanoid creatures – Xulgath Skirmisher, Xulgath Stoneliege, and the Orc Warchief – each has been modeled with great motion or intention. Whether it's a hunched sneer or standing square on shouting each of these characters gives a sense of personality.</p>

<p>The Orc Warchief is a perfect example of what I like seeing from packs like these. They might not all be fodder enemies, but when you want one mini to really stand out from the rest in the pack you want it to be eyecatching. Putting a variety of Orc's on a battle map I want no one at my table to question that the one with the battle flags brandishing the giant mace is going to be the one that gives the most trouble.</p>

<p>Minis where everyone is the same are great to fill a battlefield, but when there is uniqueness it allows a level of immersion in the gameplay that lets the characters, through their player's eyes, infer more about the battlefield.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-07.jpg?itok=cLcVvKGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-07.jpg?itok=pcNrHdtP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Myceloid is another fascinating creature in just how harshly it's colors juxtapose what you normally see from monsters. Instead of dull colors and realism it's fluorescent green with a hot pink mushroom cap. It's screaming "Danger" in nature.</p>

<p>For the little creepy crawlies, the Hunting Spider and Cave Scorpion, the Cave Scorpion is very plain looking, but the Hunting Spider does a lot to stick out compared to other spider miniatures I've seen. Normally going for a a texture and color of the black hairs on a spider the purple gives off a sense of poison and a hard carapace for defense.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Battles Forest Stalkers</h2>

<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Forest Stalkers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Elf Hunter</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Werewolf</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Buso</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Wereboar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Werebat</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Catfolk Bandit</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-04.jpg?itok=bmJyCCFp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-04.jpg?itok=muDFkJSt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This group of Forest Stalkers is an interesting mix of one standard creature, the Elf Hunter, one wood zombie, the Buso, and a mix of animal-human hybrids.</p>

<p>The Buso is by far the most terrifying thing in this collection as everything about it just seems a bit off. A slender body, but a pale grey, one eye on it's face and a head of hair that belongs in a 6th century monastery, and a curved machete in it's hand ready to swing.</p>

<p>For each of the humanoid hybrids, I'm a big fan of the varying levels of humanity. The Wereboar and Catfolk Bandit dressed as if they were in a town of their peers or heading out on adventures of their own, the Werebat seems to be in a state of transformation shredding a human form for it's present one, and the werewolf has embraced it's change wielding tools and… that's about it.</p>

<p>Immediately, things like these can inform a player of the scenario that they're in and they've been very deliberately picked.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-05.jpg?itok=VnQxJ0KJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-05.jpg?itok=j_MtsE4h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>If Three Is A Crowd, Two Is Company, Then What Is One?</h2>

<p>While each of these miniatures are a fantastic representation of the stat block in Pathfinder that they represent as any player will know even at early levels you'll want to be challenging your party with groups of more than one creature.</p>

<p>The different were-creatures can join together to form a group, as can the two Xulgath's, but for many of the other creatures here it can be hard to put just one down at the table.</p>

<p>A mix of creatures is a great way to get hero or boss style creatures, like the Orc Warchief, but something like a Hunter Spider or Buggard Scout might fare better in a Spider or Buggard themed collection.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-08.jpg?itok=TtFxij1u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-08.jpg?itok=X3EDiYcc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of these characters definitely deserve their solo focus, but others come across as pack creatures that you'd want to have a few of if you plan to populate your table with accurate representations for combat.</p>

<h2>Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers of this Wizkids Pathfinder Battles collection is filled with creatures worth of standing as direct foes to your characters, as well as some casual fodder for them to encounter in a random battle along the way.</p>

<p>The strengths in this set are that each mini can help to prompt a GM to get their mind racing about unique encounters related to the location of the bundle. You're headed into a bog or swamp? Well do you want the party to encounter swamp zombies, local fauna, or a brightly lit lizard?</p>

<p>The downside of these collections is that while you'll get a good representation for one or two of a similarly grouped enemy, you won't have enough to run an encounter without having to say "imagine all of them look like this guy" while gesturing to the Shimmernewt.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>More leaks about Pokémon Gen 10, Wind and Wave, have surfaced online, revealing details about the boss fight and the MMO features. </p>



<p>Today has been a big day for Pokémon leaks, with new information coming up online by the minute. We have already been informed about Pokémon Wind and Wave’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story, setting, new mechanics</a>, and other details. Now, more leaks have appeared detailing the Gen 10 title’s boss fight and MMO features. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-wave-has-18-boss-fights">Pokémon Wind and Wave Has 18 Boss Fights </h2>



<p>According to new posts by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977825751467704701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, in Pokémon Wind and Wave, players will be able to beat the game without having to complete all the gyms or even capturing the legendary. All these missions are optional, but must be completed to get the true ending. Players will have the option to challenge the final boss as soon as they receive the ability to traverse the sea. However, beating it in the early game “will be a lot more difficult”.</p>



<p>Coming to the bosses, players will have to fight Wind and Wave Gyms and Titan/Lord Pokémon mixed. There are 18 total challenges, each belonging to a specific Pokémon type. These challenges are inspired by the ‘Sustainable Development Goals’, and clearing all of them allows the player to challenge the champion.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In Pokémon Wind/Wave the Gyms and the Titan/Lord Pokémon are mixed together</p><p>– There are in total 18 challenges, one for each type.<br>– They will be inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals<br>– Clearing all the 18 challenges allows you to challenge the Champion <a href="https://t.co/78je4sCij4">pic.twitter.com/78je4sCij4</a></p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977827351137591608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-wave-mmo-details-codename-naia">Pokémon Wind and Wave MMO Details: Codename ‘Naia’</h2>



<p>Moving on to the MMO part, leaks suggest that Game Freak is looking to blend open-world and MMO elements into the Gen 10 title. The MMO features have been codenamed ‘Naia’, where players can upload the procedurally generated islands they discover to the Naia servers and play with other players. </p>



<h2 id="h-gen-10-wind-and-wave-seed-pokemon-details">Gen 10 Wind and Wave Seed Pokémon Details</h2>



<p>Lastly, more details about the Seed Pokémon have surfaced online. These Pokémon will be provided to the player at the start of their journey, and they need to train them to a certain level to enter the island where the main legendary resides. The island will be procedurally generated based on how trained the Seed Pokémon is. Lastly, the evolution of the Seed Pokémon is procedurally generated as well and includes unique patterns. Which means every player will have a unique Seed Pokémon. </p>



<p>Readers should take this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>

Those who already own the premium Season 1 battle pass through the game's pricier Phantom Edition will instead receive the Season 2 battle pass for free.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the EA App hiccups, Battlefield 6's launch was surprisingly smooth across platforms, especially compared to previous launches for the franchise, many of which resulted in extended periods of server downtime.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, some players did run into a few other issues players during the launch weekend. One bug, which saw jump momentum affected while using certain weapons, has already been <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977388909471338958" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fixed</a>. A problem that still needs addressing allows players in multiplayer matches to get out of bounds and onto rooftops that aren't supposed to be accessible, creating problems for those in a match who aren't taking advantage of the exploit. It remains to be seen when a fix will be coming.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 saw a huge launch weekend, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-having-a-massive-debut-on-steam/1100-6535370/" data-ref-id="1100-6535370">surpassing 747,000 concurrent players on Steam</a> at its peak on launch day. Factor in those playing through the EA App or on consoles, and Battlefield 6 certainly looks to be off to a strong start overall. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1</a> will begin October 28, and will introduce multiple new maps, modes, weapons, and more to the game's all-out-warfare sandbox.</p><p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 review</a>, writer Richard Wakeling gave the latest installment of the franchise an 8 out of 10. He noted that while its campaign is dull and forgettable, there's nothing quite like the multipronged chaos of its excellent multiplayer package, even if Battlefield 6 doesn't feel particularly fresh or new.</p>

Some of the characters highlighted in the trailer include Aang, Korra, Zuko, Toph, Katara, Sokka, and Azula.</p><p dir="ltr">Visually, Avatar Legends looks to capture the look-and-feel of the beloved animated show, with a hand-drawn 2D art style and an emphasis on movement-centric gameplay and a "unique flow system." The game will feature a single-player campaign sporting an original story, as well as a combo trials mode and "best-in-class net code and cross play" for online multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Designed for both newcomers and veterans, it channels the energy of classic fighting games while breaking new ground in movement, style, and combat expression," the game's Steam page reads.</p><p dir="ltr">An untitled Avatar fighting game in development under Maximum Entertainment was canceled with little fanfare last year via a <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/a6d02489-03d2-4624-a052-18a3d85916bb/eng-me-interim-q32024-report-vf.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarterly earnings report</a>.

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Next Fest</a> is back! The biannual Steam event that celebrates demos for hundreds of forthcoming games begins today, October 13, and runs until 1 p.m. ET on October 20. But with 3,276 demos to choose from, it’s an overwhelming beast. Fear not, for we—like the brave knights we are—are here to highlight some of the best we’ve found across a breadth of genres, from indie to AAA.</p> <p>I like to think of Next Fest as the games industry’s demonstration that <a href="https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168">genres don’t mean anything any more</a>, as the thousands of demos are categorized through a combination of lies and jazz, and the words “point-and-click” are taken to mean “games that feature pointy objects and clicking sounds.” It can make looking for particular types of games an astonishing headache. So instead, push all such intentions aside: Next Fest is best enjoyed by just scrolling through into the deepest recesses and installing anything that catches your eye. Forget about the sorts of games you already like; instead plunge in deep and experiment. And to save your scroll wheel, we’ve picked out a selection of games that could be your new big obsession.</p>

 <p>Of course this in no way definitive! There will be hundreds of demos worth playing, and if you’ve discovered anything you’d recommend yourself, then we encourage you to do so in the comments.</p> <h2><em>Tingus Goose</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> SweatyChair<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> Q4 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4059560/Tingus_Goose_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>Normally with these roundups I like to start with a well-known name so everyone feels comfortable, safe, and familiar, before I then start adding the super-weird delights. But no such easing ourselves into the deep end today, because there is no more important demo to tell you about than <em>Tingus Goose.</em> I…words cannot suffice.</p>

 <p>This is a clicker in the vein of&nbsp;<em>Cookie Clicker</em>, except you’re…well, listen, you’re clicking on the weird little baby-creatures called Tingus that fly out of the beak of a goose. A goose that is growing out of the belly of a lady lying on a bed. As you water your goose (you heard me) its neck grows longer, and it reaches for the loving kiss of another goose hanging down from the sky above. They want to mate, and it’s your job to have them meet. But you need money to water a goose, and that’s gained by, um, having the babies roll over protuberances that grow sideways out of the goose’s neck. That, as you’d expect, earns cash. And don’t worry, you can click on the babies, too, to get more money, but don’t click too often or they pop.</p>

 <p>This is all a glorious piece of batshit crazy animation and gibberish game design, and I adore every second of it.</p> <h2><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> FuturLab<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 23 Oct, 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/">Demo link</a></p> <p>See, in other years this would have been my more welcoming first entry. We’re all looking forward to <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, right? And now we finally get to play it! Hooray!</p>

 <p>And yes, it is of course utterly marvelous. It’s more&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, but slightly prettier and with less clunky controls. I am having to force myself to stop playing to write this, and play the rest of the demos, and it’s proving tricky, and that’s what&nbsp;<em>PW</em> always did best: <em>take over your entire life with its demonic pressure-washing powers</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Slots And Daggers</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Friedemann<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> October 24, 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3970060/Slots__Daggers_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>O<em>h my goodness this is the best I want to play it forever</em>. This being&nbsp;<em>Slots And Daggers</em>, a post-<em>Balatro</em> roguelite slot machine game that purifies the mechanics to sweetest perfection. You begin by choosing the icons that can appear on the slots (starting with coins, sword attacks and shield) and then stop each dial to fight a monster. If you win, coins earned can be spent on new icons (perhaps a bow attack, or an upgrade to your shield), as well as on power-ups that boost your attacks, defense, and technique. You and the enemy have shield and health meters, with some attacks able to do true damage, others protected by your defenses. And, of course, the moment you lose it’s back to the start. Except you also win poker chips as you play, and these can be spent on “illegal” hacks to the slot machine that can permanently improve things.</p>

 <p>It’s all there, right? All the ingredients of a great roguelite, in the neatest possible way. And I can assure you that it’s outstandingly moreish.</p> <h2><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634621"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634621">© Mark Ffrench</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Mark Ffrench<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 7 Nov, 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4057820/Mosaic_of_the_Strange_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>Mark Ffrench makes a very specific genre of game. It’s Fill-a-Pix puzzles writ large, the logic puzzle games that usually fill a small grid on your phone now taking up wall-size friezes.&nbsp;<em>Proverbs</em> was my favorite of his, a massive rendering of Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s painting, Netherlandish Proverbs, turned into a puzzle. And that might sound pretentious, but <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/11/proverbs/">damn it was wonderful</a>. Later came&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-steam-deck-dynasty-warriors-what-to-play-1851747697/3"><em>2024: Mosaic Retrospective</em></a>, an incredible collage of events of the previous year, and next comes&nbsp;<em>Mosaic of the Strange</em>, the follow-up to a game I now realize I entirely missed,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3530670/Mosaic_of_The_Pharaohs/?curator_clanid=44696447"><em>Mosaic of the Pharaohs</em></a>. (I know what I’m doing when I should be working tomorrow…) Incredibly, this combines the puzzle concept with a point-and-click adventure, and my mind’s made up.</p> <p>It’s hard to know how to convince a skeptic to give a game like this a try, but they’re blissfully absorbing and I really cannot recommend them enough.</p>

 <h2><em>Painkiller</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Anshar Studios<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 21 Oct, 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/">Demo link</a></p> <p>I’d somehow entirely missed that&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em> was coming back. As 3D Realms trawls its archives, 2004’s&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em> is the latest recognizable name to get a total overhaul. A decade off has done it some good, and its return gives it fresh new central characters, and it’s playable alone or in 3-player co-op. It moves extremely quickly, which is my primary desire from any 3D Realms shooter, and the AI bots seem to do a decent enough job in the demo. It’s also gloriously gory and bursting with <em>Quake 3</em> vibes.</p> <h2><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Unfrozen<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>Hands up, who’s old enough to remember the <em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</em> games? No, it’s OK, don’t strain your arm. And let’s not even ask about the OG&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic</em> fans, as the breath of the question might cause them to collapse into dust. The RPG series goes back as far as 1986 incredibly, with its turn-based strategy spin-off&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</em> starting in 1995. Highly regarded turn-based strategy games right up until they weren’t, the series saw diminishing returns beginning with <em>HOMM 5 </em>and 2015’s <em>Might &amp; Magic Heroes VII</em> polished the whole franchise off for a decade.</p>

 <p>Well, it’s back, and its latest entry is coming from <em>Iratus</em> developer Unfrozen. Apparently it has the good sense not to meddle with a beloved formula, letting you build your mythological armies and grow a town, with its emphasis squarely on recreating everyone’s happy memories of <em>HOMM 3</em>. And look, I could lie to you and pretend I understood this demo, but turn-based strategy is a genre I have never gotten my head around. I’m just excited for all the <em>Might &amp; Magic</em> fans I’ve known and loved that it’s back.</p> <h2><em>Kingdom of Night</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Friends of Safety<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> Q4 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1695580/Kingdom_of_Night_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>I installed this one on a complete whim, and I’m very glad I did. It’s an RPG by way of a point-and-click adventure, set in 1980s Arizona with some heavy <em>Stranger Things</em> vibes. You play a teenage kid at high school who finds himself embroiled in a bizarre adventure of invading demons and magical powers. The demo immediately shows how the characteristics you pick affect how you play, with a choice between brains and brawn opening up different conversation options and ways to handle school encounters. It comes with an intricate spell system, real-time combat, and lots of lovely isometric pixel graphics. And I’m really getting into it. This was first announced six years ago, but is apparently arriving this year, complete with an option to play the whole adventure in co-op.</p> <h2><em>Servant of the Lake</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Rusty Lake<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3996940/Servant_of_the_Lake_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>The incredible&nbsp;<em>Rusty Lake</em> series <a href="https://kotaku.com/rusty-lake-mr-rabbit-magic-show-birthday-david-lynch-1851778424">just celebrated its 10th anniversary with a typically macabre birthday game</a>, but now is back with an upcoming full entry in the long-running Lynchian series. <em>Servant of the Lake</em> has the player arrive to the Vanderboom house by horse and cart, there to be a servant to the family for a single weekend. However, long-term fans will realize this puts us in the era of the first generation of the Vanderbooms, and thus in the presence of Aldous Vanderboom, the man who becomes the series peculiar antagonist, Mr. Crow. And, honestly, you own it to yourself to play every <em>Rusty Lake</em> game in order, building up to next year’s release of this one.</p>

 <h2><em>Reanimal</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Tarsier Studios<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4019420/REANIMAL_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p><em>Reanimal</em> is of course what Tarsier Studios is making instead of <em>Little Nightmares 3.</em> It’s a whole new project from the team and, still a year on from its announcement, it doesn’t yet have a release date. But at least we can play some of it now! You play as a sack-headed boy, who begins the game steering a boat to pull a mask-wearing girl from the sea, before finally reaching dry land and beginning the adventure of their attempt to escape their hellish home. It’s all extremely atmospheric, but very slow to get going for a demo. Still, persist and you’ll experience this horror-themed adventure for a decent while.</p> <h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></h2>  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Tribute Games<br> <strong>Release date:</strong> 2025<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4013980/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion_Demo/">Demo link</a></p> <p>I am delighted to report that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is a complete delight. Tribute Games follows up&nbsp;<em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em> with another old-school side-scrolling beat ’em up, this time with a broad cast of Marvel heroes to biff with. You pick two at a time (Spider-Man and She Hulk make for a great pairing), then alternate between the two of them as you set up combos and <em>Streets of Rage</em> your way down these pixel-perfect streets. In fact, it’s so&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em> that you even eat food you find by smashing garbage cans, just like real superheroes do.</p> <p>It’s so colorful and punchy (in every sense) that it feels like it could be a classic arcade cabinet hit from the ’80s, rejuvenated for modern machines.</p>

<p>Over the Hill is a game about offroading in which players drive vehicles from the 60s to 80s either alone or in a group, while dealing with the challenges that come with navigating some tough trails. It is not just the landscape that will provide a challenge, with Over the Hill featuring dynamic weather and a day/night cycle. The different areas are inspired by real world locations, each filled with different objectives. Completing these objectives will unlock new vehicles, upgrades, customisations, and cosmetics. And, you can capture the scenery through a photo mode.</p>
<p>A date for the full release of Over the Hill is yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>TinyBuildGames and developer Fire &amp; Frost have announced that the open world RPG Of Ash and Steel will be launching on November 6th for PC, and a demo has been released for Steam Next Fest. The game is being billed as an old school RPG where players will explore the Kingdom of the Seven without mission markers or overt quest guidance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Steam Next Fest Demo and Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHDPSRpxF1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The demo for Of Ash and Steel will feature an area of the game that can be explored including an abandoned village, of which you can try and solve the mystery of what happened. There will be a part of the main quest available to play along with side missions, and players will also be able to delve into the skill trees, various professions, and the upgrades. Players can experiment with different combat styles from being light footed to wearing a full suit of armour while wielding a giant weapon. In addition to the campaign, there is also an Arena mode where players can earn gear, gold, and XP. There are also ranks to climb to defeat more powerful enemies, and become the champion of the arena.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A ton of popular games are included.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's October Prime Day has ended, but the online retailer is already offering a new "Buy 2, Get 1 50% Off" sale this week. There's a little bit of everything for everyone in here, from classic family games to modern party games. If you've been hoping to add some more board games to your tabletop collection, right now is a great time to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sale itself is fairly straightforward: Amazon has a big <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2XPE?object_uuid=36931a4c-0172-46ee-99b4-5d30882de1af&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>list of items that are included in the promotion</strong></a> and all you need to do is add two in your cart and the 50% discount will be applied to whatever the cheaper one is. That means if you want to take full advantage of the savings, you'll want to buy two similarly priced items. I've gathered some of the best board game options in the sale here, which are based off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/board-game-reviews">IGN's own board game reviews</a> and recommendations. There are also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tons-of-popular-jigsaw-puzzles-are-buy-1-get-1-half-off-at-amazon-today">jigsaw puzzles included in the sale</a> if you want to mix and match for the full discount.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Board Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The amount of options to choose from in this sale is truly staggering, and it's difficult to choose only a few recommendations to highlight. Are you looking for intriguing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">murder mystery games</a> to play during a Halloween party? Do you need a fun <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a> you can break out on weekends? Are you hoping to find a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy game</a> that will take all night to play? There are tabletop options for all of those scenarios right here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those working with a smaller budget, I'd recommend checking out Flip 7. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flip-7-card-game-review">reviewed it earlier this year</a> and absolutely loved it. It's a fairly easy push-you-luck card game that can be played in under 20 minutes. At only $8, it's already cheap, and this promotion will end up dropping that price down to just $4 when you buy something else (that's at least $8) with it. All-in-all, it's an easy recommendation to make for anyone who just wants a fun game that has a shallow learning curve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something a bit heartier that's still family friendly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a> – both the original U.S. and some of the European versions – is also included here. This game is a modern classic that does a great job of combining simple gameplay with stimulating turn-based strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you find a game you like, the next step is picking out a good second option to take full advantage of the discount. I'd recommend browsing through some of the classic board games here that are essential for any collection, stuff like Clue, Catan, Sorry!, and multiple versions of Monopoly. If you don't already have those, now is a great time to pick one or more up for a substantial discount.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is Now a Good Time to Buy Board Games?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week we saw some pretty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-deals-october-prime-day-2025">great board game deals for October Prime Day</a>, but with that sale over and Black Friday on the horizon, you may be wondering if you should be making a purchase right now. While it's true that Amazon will likely have better board game deals for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> this year, this buy 1, get 1 50% off sale is still a great way to save money right now. If you are looking to grab some stocking stuffers or a family game to play <em>before</em> the holidays, then this sale makes it a good time to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, you'll still want to wait for better discounts if you're planning on making bigger purchases. Some of the bigger campaign board games that are $100 or more are not included in this sale and aren't likely to be discounted until November.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 13, 2025 7:42 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-october-2025]]></content:encoded>

While Assault, Engineer, and Recon classes, too, bring important tools and skills to a fight, it’s only the Support class that can get downed soldiers back on their feet at lightning speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squad mates of any class are free to revive each other with or without the medic tools in Support, though they are locked only to reviving players in their squad and take much longer to pick them up. Support players do not have these squad limitations and can instantly revive a soldier with things like defibrillators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With dozens of teammates in every Battlefield 6 match, there’s always plenty of players looking to be revived, and as buildings are often crumbling down around them, the chances of being picked up aren’t always too likely. Heightening the stress on both ends are measurements for downed players showing how far away the nearest group of medics is. When JohnBattlefield2000 opts not to revive you at just five meters away, things tend to get a bit heated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some have already begun using the repair tool, a gadget wielded by engineers to repair vehicles (and draw on walls) in Battlefield for years, to leave messages for Support medics who neglect their fallen comrades.
