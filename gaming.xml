            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/stars-of-icarus-preview-out-with-steampunk-in-with-space/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stars-of-icarus-preview-%E2%80%93-out-with-steampunk-in-with-space.1212825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/stars-of-icarus-preview-out-with-steampunk-in-with-space/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Steampunk is, let’s face it, old hat now. Specifically, it’s a top hat with goggles, some cogs and maybe a timepiece or two on it. But space? Well, space is always going to be filled with wonder and cool. So it makes total sense that Muse Games would look to the stars for their successor to Guns of Icarus, the aptly titled Stars of Icarus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stars of Icarus | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQSOF3HGQo4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, while people might dream of the smooth utopian future of 90s Star Trek, the likely reality of space travel is going to be much grimier and difficult. Stars of Icarus sees crews of ragtag spacefarers battling over scraps, facing off in abandoned scrapyard, space stations and around asteroid belts for the right to whatever spoils might be had.</p>


<p>Two teams of five players face off in combat, but the spaceships that you can pilot can accommodate between one and three people. A single-person ship is going to be small and nimble, a little fighter that can move quickly, but it won’t have anything when compared to the multiple turrets of a two-seater corvette, or the thick shields, gun batteries and sheer survivability of a three-seater frigate.</p>


<p>Coordinating your efforts works on multiple levels, both in terms of ensuring that your ships stay together and can support one another, taking a tactical approach to engaging the enemy, but also within a ship. In a corvette, one person has to pilot, manoeuvring the ship with an eye on what the enemy is doing and facing them with the particular guns that are available, not to mention turning away from incoming fire if part of the shields are breached. Meanwhile, the other crew member can dash back and forth between weapons, unloading their ammo and then switching to another point, repairing components as they take damage, and deciding where to put the one AI helper – put them on a particular gun battery and they’ll keep blasting away at anything in sight with decent efficiency.</p>

<p>It’s really satisfying to have it all come together. I enjoyed playing in a solo fighter, the mouse and keyboard controls reminding me of trying to play classic X-Wing and TIE Fighter games in the early 90s without a flight stick… but this game’s meant for these inputs. But I also really enjoyed playing as a crewer in a corvette or frigate, scrambling back and forth between fixing and firing. The one time I tried to pilot a corvette… well, let’s just say I wasn’t really taking the 6DOF field of battle into account very well, and angling the ship to bring guns to bear took a lot of brain power for a newcomer. By comparison, the team at Muse were dab hands at quickly rotating the ship between long-ranged and short-range turrets.</p>
<p>But fans and veterans from Guns of Icarus should take to this much more quickly, though with the new rotational factor coming into play a lot more, adding to the verticality of the game’s combat.</p>
<p>Of course, the ships can be extensively customised with different gun loadouts and gear, so you can have a short-ranged bruiser or a powerful long-ranged sniper style of ship, or perhaps put a repair beam on a corvette so that you can fall back, regroup and go again much more easily. That opens up plenty of tactical variety, especially when combining with the environments, where you could drop down into some cosmic fog, use constructs to block views and approach angles, laying traps or springing them to get an advantage.</p>

<p>Muse Games took inspiration from 90s anime for Stars of Icarus’ art direction, so there’s cel shaded characters and ships, bright block colours and chunky ship designs. In combat, it helps things to read quite well, keeping the visuals relatively uncluttered. It also lends itself well to quick character customisation with colour palettes. As a premium game, Stars of Icarus will have all the ships, tools and weapons unlocked from the start, and a healthy selection of customisation options… though more cosmetics will feature in an in-game store. Sometimes you got to show off, right?</p>
<p>And that sometimes could be in the in-game lobby, a gathering place to run around with your anime-styled avatar and hang out with other community members. Muse hopes that much of the sense of community that they found with Guns of Icarus can carry through to Stars of Icarus as well when it launches in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-direct-everything-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian Entertainment debuted its special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M3QwLBrg8g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Outer Worlds 2 Direct</a> today, revealing a planet-sized presentation full of gameplay with new details about its 2025 sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 30-minute showcase gave players a tongue-in-cheek look at how Obsidian is building on the foundation laid by its original 2019 space adventure RPG with tweaks to existing mechanics as well as completely new gameplay features. It was also all hosted by comedian and Sonic the Hedgehog movie voice actor Ben Schwartz, who helped keep <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> Direct going with plenty of skits in between the nitty-gritty details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From wacky new Flaws and planets to a fresh perspective on player choice, we’ve collected all of the highlights from today’s The Outer Worlds 2 Direct and shared them below. Also, as announced at the 2025 Xbox Games Showcase, The Outer Worlds 2 now has a release date of October 29, 2025. You can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at that show here</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Exploring Space as an Earth Directorate Agent</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are dropped into The Outer Worlds 2 as an Earth Directorate Agent. Obsidian describes these do-gooders as “space cowboys or space sky marshals” or  “good guys that go in to places and fix everything that’s wrong.” How you build out your character and experience from here, though, is up to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Filling out your character’s story means choosing things like a Background and Traits, with the latter setting the foundation for how you approach gameplay throughout the story. You can be Brilliant, Heroic, Innovative, Lucky – or Dumb, if that’s your thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also skills, which have been refined this time around, and perks, which are heavily inspired by the system used in Fallout: New Vegas. One example of a perk shown during the Direct is Assassin, an ability that grants a movement bonus after a stealth kill.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Guns, More Choice</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 is about expanding the universe Obsidian created in 2019, and that means introducing vast improvements to the gameplay across the board. There are more guns with more unique animations to be found here, with many of them shown off during the Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all very Borderlands, as some weapons carry unique traits. Rookie’s Reward is a great example of what’s in store, as this firearm slowly levels up with the player as it's used through the game, celebrating each new level with a confetti and fireworks show. There’s also the Pop-Up Gun, which distracts enemies with pop-up ads projected by a pesky drone. Another highlight is a music-infused sword that rewards players who smack enemies to the beat of a song.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this creativity was carried over into the new throwable tools. Grenades, for example, can trigger a simple explosion, or players can use science grenades that suspend foes with zero-gravity technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for movement, Obsidian says it’s revamped its approach to exploration, too. That means more freedom to run, jump, slide, and parkour around Arcadia as they find valuable loot. You’ll also be able to take advantage of both first- and third-person perspectives after the option was absent from the original game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Flaws Are Back and Better (and Worse) Than Ever</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One beloved elements from the original The Outer Worlds were Flaws, a feature that gave players the option to take on negative attributes in exchange for other perks. We got to see four Flaws as part of today’s presentation: Bad Knees, Kleptomaniac, Sungazer, and Overprepared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bad Knees gives players, well, bad knees, allowing them to move quicker in exchange for joints that pop (and alert enemies) when leaving the crouching position. Kleptomaniac grants higher selling values for stolen items while occasionally forcing players to nick some items against their will, while Sungazer causes permanent vision damage in exchange for a daytime healing passive and increased weapon spread. Overprepared is a Flaw for the kind of player who is always cautiously reloading, granting them increased magazine sizes with a penalty if a clip ever organically runs out of ammo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Factions and Companions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To no one’s surprise, The Outer Worlds 2 is populated by an army of key factions and individuals to help and halt your journey. The Protectorate, for example, is described as an authoritarian group in the isolated colony of Arcadia.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Their dictatorship is thematically based around the question of how much freedom people will give up for security and luxury,” Obsidian describes. “For Protectorate subjects, unfortunately, that answer is ‘everything.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the Order of the Ascendant, an offshoot of the Order of Scientific Inquiry from the original Outer Worlds that also has past ties to The Protectorate. These major factions and more have been made to have close ties to the story and themes of The Outer Worlds 2, but they’ve also been made to be even more absurd as Obsidian aimed to expand the humor. Additionally, players can expect to listen to a Fallout: New Vegas-inspired radio system, which features stations from each major faction, with each carrying around 20 original songs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Factions have been fleshed out and improved for The Outer Worlds 2, and Obsidian says companions, of which there are six, have received the same treatment. Niles, an Earth Directorate agent whose story can be shaped by the player’s action, is the first companion you’ll meet. Today’s Direct also showcased the “somewhat cute” automech drone, who helps Niles, named Val, as well as the deadly assassin and mathematician Marisol, the cultlist Aza, a combat medic who survived experimentation named Inez, and Tristan, a heavily armored Protectorate arbiter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The Bridge</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian wants players to know that they’ve got options when it comes to how they choose to experience The Outer Worlds 2, and the best example of player choice is an early mission called The Bridge. It’s all about finding ways to lower a bridge, with players able to take more straightforward options like convincing The Protectorate to lower the bridge themselves, sneaking to the control room, and going in guns blazing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian takes the options a step further, though, giving players the choice to use a shield that protects against poison gas to get around dangerous areas or jump boots that offer more traversal options. You can even sacrifice a companion in order to gain bridge clearance. This is the kind of freedom the team says players can expect from The Outer Worlds 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As today’s Direct came to a close, Obsidian shared its thoughts on the sequel, saying, “The Outer Worlds 2 is really the biggest game we’ve ever made.” As we move closer to its newly announced release date, it’s easy to see why. For more on The Outer Worlds 2, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase"><u>its October release date announcement</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Back in March, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/six-ways-microsofts-portable-xbox-could-be-a-steam-deck-killer/">outlined six features we wanted to see</a> on what was then just a rumored Xbox-branded, Windows-powered handheld gaming device. Today, Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/xbox-handheld-rog-ally-x-games-showcase/">announcement of the Asus ROG Xbox Ally hardware line</a> looks like it fulfills almost all of our wishes for Microsoft's biggest foray into portable gaming yet.</p>
<p>The Windows-11-powered Xbox Ally devices promise access to "all of the games available on Windows," including "games from Xbox, Game Pass, Battle.net, and other leading PC storefronts [read: Steam, Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, etc]." But instead of having to install and boot up those games through the stock Windows interface, as you often do on handhelds like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/">the original ROG Ally line</a>, all these games will be available through what Microsoft is calling an "aggregated gaming library."</p>


<p>Asus and Microsoft are stressing how that integrated experience can be used with games across multiple different Windows-based launchers, promising "access to games you can't get elsewhere." That could be seen as a subtle dig at SteamOS-powered devices like the Steam Deck, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">can have significant trouble with certain titles</a> that don't play well with Steam and/or Linux for one reason or another. Microsoft also highlights how support apps like Discord, Twitch, and downloadable game mods will also be directly available via the Xbox Ally's Windows backbone.</p>
<p>And while the Xbox Ally devices run Windows 11, they will boot to what Microsoft is calling the "Xbox Experience for Handheld," a bespoke full-screen interface that hides the nitty-gritty of the Windows desktop by default. That gaming-focused interface will "minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks," meaning "more [and] higher framerates" for the games themselves, Microsoft says. A rhombus-shaped Xbox button located near the left stick will also launch an Xbox Game Bar overlay with quick access to functions like settings, performance metrics, and fast switching between titles. Microsoft also says it is working on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/valves-deck-verified-badge-will-show-which-games-run-well-on-steam-deck/">a "Deck Verified"-style program</a> for identifying Windows titles that "have been optimized for handhelds."</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sunless-sea">Sunless Sea</a> and Mask of the Rose developer Failbetter Games has unveiled Mandrake, its very first project away from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallen-london">Fallen London</a> universe. It's a rural life sim set in a "world of old, wild powers" where horticulture is forbidden, and it'll eventually be making its way to PC.
</p>
<p>
Taking inspiration from British history and folklore, Mandrake casts players as the last in a line of horticultural sorcerers - one who finally returns to their family's abandoned home in the 'small, complicated' village of Chandley after a long time away. 
</p>
<p>
Initially at least, Mandrake sounds like pretty familiar stuff. You'll tend to your garden, fish, forage, cook, and craft furniture to decorate your home; you'll venture into the woods, to the beach, to the mine in search of minerals, and into the community to befriend the locals, learning their stories and becoming intertwined with their lives.
</p>

<p>
But Failbetter's announcement hints at something a little darker and more mysterious around Mandrake's periphery, and it's here the studio's knack for the peculiar starts to peek through. Soon, for instance, you'll be trading turnips and runner beans for stranger, more intriguing seeds; you can befriend a river, eavesdrop on the dead, drink with a god who lives in your chimney, and spend a haunted night at the Butcher's Oak.
</p>
<p>
The eccentric locals, meanwhile, include a hunter who makes pacts with the woods, and a girl saved from the sea, who still hears voices calling to her from beneath the waves. Chandley is home to spirits and other strange creatures too, including the long-armed Granny Jakes who lives in a hidden orchard, and Hroame, "sometimes stone and sometimes not". But not everything is friendly. "Don't go out after dark," Failbetter warns, "the night is not for you."
</p>
<p>
Mandrake doesn't have a release date yet, but Failbetter says that due to its complexity and "some very unusual features" it'll be seeking player feedback as the game continues its journey toward launch. To that end, it expects to run a number of playtests prior to Mandrake's release, so curious sorts should <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710210/Mandrake/">considering wishlisting it on Steam</a>.

But what about the Switch 2? More than two-years after Microsoft and Nintendo entered into an agreement to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to Switch, nothing has materialized. Sources close to the matter tell <em>Kotaku</em> that both sides are still working on it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Microsoft and Nintendo have now negotiated and signed a binding 10-year legal agreement to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to Nintendo players—the same day as Xbox, with full features and content parity—so they can experience <em>Call of Duty</em> just as Xbox and PlayStation games enjoy <em>Call of Duty</em>,” Microsoft president Brad Smith <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1629180356359495680&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1629180356359495680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced back in February 2023</a></span>. “We are committed to providing long term equal access to <em>Call of Duty</em> to other gaming platforms, bringing more choice to more players and more competition to the gaming market.” </p><p>That deal, the details of which have never been made public, was inked back when Microsoft was trying to consolidate regulatory approval for its roughly $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. To assuage concerns that it might take one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world and make it exclusive to Xbox, Microsoft made agreements with other companies, including eventually Sony, promising that for at least the first 10 years after the acquisition went through, it would continue bringing <em>Call of Duty</em> to other platforms, including ones it hadn’t been on in years like the Switch.</p><p>So where is it? The list of platforms for <em>Black Ops 7</em> revealed today does not include Nintendo’s older hardware or the recently launched Switch 2, even though the latter has performance capability on par with the PlayStation 4, which is getting the game this fall. While sources tell <em>Kotaku</em> that both Microsoft and Nintendo are still committed to getting the franchise on the latter’s hardware, it’s unclear what the hold-up is or what the final result will be. </p><p><em>Call of Duty </em>hasn’t appeared on a Nintendo platform since 2013's <em>Ghosts</em> came to the Wii U. While the ports of the multiplayer shooter never ran particularly great on the <em>Mario</em> maker’s underpowered consoles, it at least provided an option for fans to access the annual blockbuster. One obvious avenue for getting <em>Call of Duty</em> on weaker hardware is using cloud gaming. <em>Black Ops 6</em> is currently available to stream with Game Pass Ultimate but cloud gaming hasn’t been used to bring last year’s entry to Switch. </p><p><em>Black Ops 7</em> isn’t the only Microsoft first-party game that’s currently a no-show on Switch 2. Despite the increased horsepower of the handheld hybrid, games like <em>Sea of Thieves </em>and <em>Grounded</em>, which were previously ported to PS5,&nbsp;remain MIA. That might be because Microsoft doesn’t currently have plans to bring either of them over, or it could simply be that Nintendo wants to announce those plans on its own time. For now, the Switch 2 remains conspicuously absent from Microsoft’s recent multiplatform shift. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nao Shibata, a solo developer from Japan who makes games under the name Nao Games, revealed the project--an action game with a unique control scheme--is out now.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed during the PC Gaming Show, Berserk or Die uses a keyboard and mouse as a controller--but not in the traditional sense. Players will smack the left and right sides of their keyboard in order to move and attack in that direction--with attack power dependent on how many keys are pressed with each slap--while shaking the mouse will activate the player character's special ability.

Berserk or Die will feature unique pixel art from Nao Games and music from Vampire Survivors composer Filippo Vicarelli.</p><p dir="ltr">Berserk or Die is the first published game from Poncle, which burst onto the gaming scene in 2023 with its roguelike action game Vampire Survivors. The studio says Berserk or Die is "the first of more projects from Poncle this year, as the studio takes its first steps in the world of publishing."</p><p dir="ltr">Berserk or Die is available now on PC.</p>

The teams behind Blippo+ revealed this during today's PC Gaming Show, where it released the wildest trailer I've seen in a minute.&nbsp;</p><p>"Blippo+ is a wholly original channel-surfing experience filled with soaps, sitcoms, news, weather, and talk shows – all painstakingly made with vintage analog broadcast equipment and an intergenerational cast of over 100 actors, comedians, performers, and artists," a press release reads. "Television newcomers and nostalgics alike will delight in flipping through Blippo+'s linear broadcast, browsing the robust Electronic Program Guide, tinkering with TV menu settings, and luring the Femtofax videotext forums to unravel the planet-shaking narrative unfolding over the airwaves of Planet Blip."&nbsp;</p><p>Check out Blippo+ for yourself in the new trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKTXT_0RlFM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKTXT_0RlFM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>&nbsp;Unlike the Playdate version of the game, Blippo+ on Switch and PC introduces a time-hopping mechanic that allows viewers to travel back and forth through weeks of TV programming "without losing the magic of 'non-demand' linear viewing." Today's trailer also highlights Blippo+'s use of technicolor source material, as well as a cast made up of local Los Angeles artists.&nbsp;</p><p>Blippo+ is currently available as part of Playdate Season 2, and the color version will launch on Switch and PC sometime this Fall.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Shiro Games has revealed its next project and it is an online co-operative action game called Farever, which is set in the world of Siagarta. The world is full of unknowns and will require players to explore every corner of it to find its secrets. Shiro Games is building a rep for building these kinds of games, such as its upcoming space based co-op title<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/spacecraft-is-the-new-game-from-shiro-games/"> SpaceCraft</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Farever | REVEAL TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvIuM3Cr8iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“In&nbsp;<span>Farever</span>, adventure is always around the corner,”</em> said Nicolas Cannasse, CEO, Shiro Games. <em>“We’re thrilled to reveal the game during the PC Gaming Show and can’t wait to invite players to Siagarta for co-op exploration when&nbsp;<span>Farever</span>&nbsp;comes to Steam.”</em></p>
<p>Farever will feature 10 different classes, and there will be an Early Access period that will feature four of those classes. There will also be over 100 weapons available in the full release, with every single weapon having its own set of unique skills. Fighting will not be the only thing that players will be doing in Siagarta either. To traverse the world there will be platforming challenges and environmental puzzles to solve. Players can take on different jobs too such as blacksmithing or becoming a cook, with both skills being helpful to solo players and groups. Farever’s content will scale with group sizes so there is always a challenge to face as well. Those challenges could come from any of the various factions that inhabit the land including the Crimson Rams, the Heralds, the Kobolds, the Nepsids, and the different guilds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-new-trailer-45-minute-livestream-set-for-june-21/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Bandai Namco and Rebel Wolves debuted a new trailer for the upcoming action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. While the trailer is only two and a half minutes long, it's really just an appetizer for a 45-minute live stream set for June 21 at 12 PM Pacific Time on the DawnwalkerGame Twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dawnwalkergame" target="_blank" rel="noopener">channel</a>. The event will show around 15 minutes of new gameplay content&nbsp;alongside an extended developer commentary.</p>
<p>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, Game Director and Co-Founder of Rebel Wolves, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>It’s been a pleasure to finally show you more of the game, and I want to thank our community for the incredible support. Back in January, when we first revealed the game, we promised to shed more light on the gameplay this summer—and that moment has finally arrived. We’d like to invite you to join us on June 21 for our Gameplay Reveal Event. You’ll learn more about the abilities Coen gains as he becomes the Dawnwalker – a mysterious being balancing the line between the world of day and the realm of night.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Game Trailer | Trapped Between Two Worlds" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bk1ezydqhco?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is the first instalment in Rebel Wolves' original dark fantasy series. Fourteenth-century Europe is engulfed in chaos: bloody wars are tearing the continent apart and the Black Death is claiming a deadly toll. Seizing this moment of weakness, a clique of powerful vampires emerges.</p>
<p>You'll play as Coen, a young man who has become a Dawnwalker: a being that is no longer fully human, yet not quite a vampire. You have just 30 days and nights to save Coen’s family or exact bloody revenge on his sire, regardless of the consequences or the cost to Coen of his thirst for blood. The game will ask the most critical question: is it worth sacrificing your humanity for the ones you love?</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but maybe Rebel Wolves will provide it in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">old</a> and also new game merchants have revealed a new initiative aimed at offering "seamless mod integration", as well as announcing that they'll be hosting <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> - the modding project remaking Oblivion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine that currently targeting a release this year - when it arrives.
</p>

<p>Dubbing this integration push GOG One-click Mods, the retailers have tapped a selection of mods that either provide new stuff to do or key tweaks deemed can't miss. The goal is to let you avoid the perils of time-consuming mod installation when you fire up the affected games.</p>
<p>The initial group of "handpicked" mods includes the aforementioned Fallout: London, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-3">Doom 3</a>'s Phobos mod, Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines' Unofficial Patch, and Heroes of Might and Magic 3's Horn of the Abyss mod. Skyblivion's set to join that gang once it comes out.</p>
<p>We asked GOG what went into selecting those specific mods as the starter group, wondering if factors like established relationships with certain modding teams or a desire to host mods for games that sell well on the store had played into it. "It was a mix of all those things, frankly," a GOG spokesperson responded, "from the mods' popularity and our existing relations to the quality, the quantity and the type of content they offer.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Cultural impact also played a big role. Horn of the Abyss, for instance, is now an absolute must-have for anyone who loves Heroes of Might and Magic 3; once you have it, you cannot imagine playing without it. On top of that, some of our team members have deep ties with the modding scene, offering - completely unbiased, of course - insights on which mods we should prioritise. In some cases, it made the outreach process and contact with creators much easier – simply because there are mods we know and love, and communities we’re already part of."</p></blockquote>
<p>GOG claim this initiative "definitely takes things to another level entirely" compared to what's gone before. "While we are actively working to expand it further, community response to these initial titles will be a key factor in shaping what comes next," the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what affect this initiative has going forwards. Right now, it only affects a few mod for a few games, so I can see myself using it to have an easier time when jumping into Skyblivion for the first time and giving Fallout: London another go. However, it'll have a long way to go to factor into the largely Steam and Nexus Mods-based nature of the majority of the modding I do when I'm not grabbing one of these big, once-in-a-blue-moon total conversions.</p>
<p>It's not going to be possible to seamlessly integrate every little mod, and if certain key mods for certain games end up as part of the inititive and others don't, that could potentially cause some headaches. We'll just have to see how things go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-features-much-greater-reactivity-and-third-person-view-says-obsidian/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, where The Outer Worlds 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> its official launch date, Obsidian dedicated a good portion of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M3QwLBrg8g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Direct</a> (which also featured Grounded 2) to the upcoming action RPG sequel.</p>
<p>Creative Director Leonard Boyarsky highlighted that the game has benefited from having a bigger budget and more time in development. This allows The Outer Worlds 2 to be a much more 'true Obsidian reactive RPG' compared to the original The Outer Worlds.</p>
<p>Skills and traits are also even more important now. They not only affect combat, but also conversations and areas that the developers are calling 'RPG interactions'. In these instances, players will be able to use their skills, perks, and backgrounds to solve challenges in many different ways.</p>
<p>While the previous installment pitted players as the Stranger, essentially a blank slate character for players to fill, this time, Obsidian is giving more structure to the player character's background. They are an Earth Directorate agent, whom the developers compared to space marshals. However, players will still get to choose why they joined the Earth Directorate, with options such as Ex-Convict, Gambler, Lawbringer, Professor, Renegade, and Roustabout.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 won't have attributes. Obsidian leaned into traits for this sequel because they wanted more meaningful changes. Some of those shown in the Direct include Lucky, which provides a 5% higher critical chance and opens up certain opportunities, and Nimble, which increases crouch speed and combat sprint speed by 25%. However, you can also select negative traits, like Dumb, which locks five of the twelve available skills from being upgraded at all and also adds a few appropriate conversation options. Selecting a negative trait lets you add an extra positive trait.</p>
<p>After traits, players pick skills, which are the backbone of your character's play style. Examples include Speech, Sneak, Science, Observation, Guns, Melee and more. Additionally, Obsidian is essentially 'borrowing' the perk system for Fallout: New Vegas while also expanding on it. For example, Pickpocket lets you steal from NPCs, while Heavy Handed empowers melee power attacks with a knockdown (which has an internal cooldown to maintain balance). There's even a Serial Killer perk that adds a chance for killed humans to drop their hearts; consuming the hearts provides a permanent max health bonus.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 also brings back the Flaw system. These are also trait-like things that define your character with pros and cons. For example, Bad Knees lets you move faster but also produces a loud popping noise whenever you rise up from crouch, alerting nearby enemies. Sungazer makes weapon spread 100% worse, but also gives the player character continuous healing while outside during the day (up to 50% health). Overprepared increases the size of all weapon magazines by 50%, but also inflicts a 40% debuff for 8 seconds if you completely empty a magazine.</p>
<p>When it comes to reactivity, players will be given all sorts of options when dealing with obstacles. For example, they'll have to cross a heavily patrolled bridge area at some point, and one of the available options is to make a deal with those non-player characters who patrol it by sacrificing one of the companions (of which there are six). Of course, doing so may have serious repercussions even with the relationship with the remaining companions.</p>

<p>Obsidian also touched on the colony of Arcadia, which is the setting of The Outer Worlds 2. This is an isolated solar system with plenty of natural resources that is run by an authoritarian faction called The Protectorate. Arcadia is in trouble due to the appearance of space-time rifts, allegedly caused by skip drives (which allow interstellar travel). As an Earth Directorate agent, they'll have to find out what can be done to stop them. As you would expect, each faction has its own vision about what's happening and, most importantly, how to solve it.</p>
<p>The game even has a radio system, another nod to Fallout: New Vegas. There are three radio stations to tune into, each belonging to one of the major factions. Obsidian also said that the radio will also respond to what the player is doing, increasing the feeling of reactivity to the player's actions. Lastly, third-person view is fully featured this time around for those who don't love first-person view.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will be released on October 29 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. As usual for Microsoft-owned companies, the game will be available on day one via Game Pass for active subscribers.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2">Endless Legend 2</a> is no longer without end. Developers Amplitude and publishers Hooded Horse have announced that the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game will release into early access on 7th August 2025. </p><!--more-->
<p>As you hopefully learned from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2-is-everything-i-love-about-2014s-best-4x-but-on-a-map-thats-constantly-changing">my hands-on earlier this year</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> 2's key differentiating factor is that it takes place on a procedurally generated waterworld that gradually dries out as you grow your civ. The water pulls back at intervals to reveal new tiles. This is helpful when the tiles harbour precious resources, and less helpful when the tiles form a causeway to your awful shithead neighbours. Shoo shoo!</p>
<p>Leaky ocean floor aside, the sequel also introduces a cleaner turn-based combat system in place of the original game's divisive method of having units move automatically based on initiative, after you'd given them orders. Beyond that, the broad strokes are as in Endless Legend 1. You plump and fortify your cities while training up hero characters with RPG-style skilltrees. There are NPC villages to befriend or beat into submission; adding their units to your construction options is part of how you'll tailor your civ to overcome your dastardly neighbours. And there are terse yet colourful quests that dig into your faction's backstory.</p>
<p>The game will offer five major factions, according to the latest press release. We currently know about three: the Kin of Sheredyn, aka Greco-Roman wall-builders, the Necrophage, aka ravenous bastard insects, and the Aspect, aka manipulative and insidious coral people. If I were a betting man, or alternatively a person capable of recognising familiar iconography on key art, I'd say Amplitude are also bringing back the Cultists from the first game. Their signature quirk was that they could only found one, gigantic city and were reliant on brain-washing NPC villages to extend their reach.</p>
<p> When they announced the game, Amplitude promised us six factions by the end of early access. Perhaps the Necrophage cannibalised one of other civs? Perhaps they're struggling for development resources? I guess I should do a journalism and ask. Amplitude bought their independence back from Sega last year - here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legends-how-amplitude-bought-their-independence-back-from-sega">my interview with CEO Romain de Waubert de Genlis</a> about how that happened. Since then they've scrabbled together <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/amplitude-studios-raises-investment-griffin-gaming-partners-1236227964/">$13.5 million in funding</a>, which isn't Ubisoft money, but not to be sneezed at. I try not to sneeze at money, regardless of quantity.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Movement in each stage is controlled entirely by attacks, so players don’t need to reach a specific destination, just survive the onslaught.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/baby-steps-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-preview-a-promising-first-stride.1212645/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/baby-steps-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of the demo’s debut on Steam Next Fest, we got the opportunity to play the first chapter of the upcoming game developed by Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch (<em>Ape Out</em>), Bennett Foddy (<em>Getting Over It</em>), and published by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pepper-grinder-review" rel="nofollow">Devolver Digital</a>, <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with Bennett Foddy in particular, you're getting what you expect: a game that makes movement difficult in service of creating frustrating platforming, that eventually pays off once you finally get everything just right. What excited me most about this demo, though, were the things I didn’t expect: presentation in line with much larger studios, and a game that delivers on humor better than other games in years.</p>

<h2>One Small Step for Man</h2>



<p><em>Baby Steps</em> in particular reminds me a lot of <em>QWOP</em>, Foddy’s breakout browser game. In <em>QWOP</em>, you played as a track star for whom running is, surprisingly, quite difficult. This time, using a controller in place of <em>QWOP</em>'s signature keyboard controls, even the most basic steps are a bit of a struggle. The level design is expertly paced around this struggle, though. Right when I started getting the hang of movement, a new ledge or set of steps came to throw me off my game.</p>

<p>This sort of movement has become a staple of any game with his name on it, and <em>Baby Steps</em> is no different. What is different, though, is the scale.</p>

<p><em>Baby Steps</em> looks great and runs smoothly, even in a very expansive world. Compared to the usual style of Foddian games, which steered more towards the minimalist side, <em>Baby Steps </em>feels like a premium, large-scale experience that spared no expense. I'm quite excited to see what locales show themselves next, as there are more varied locales shown in trailers than what I saw in my short slice of gameplay.</p>

<h2>One Giant Leap</h2>



<p>The most notable thing about <em>Baby Steps </em>wasn’t the Foddian locomotion system or presentation, though: it was the humor. Being a funny video game is no easy feat, but the team behind <em>Baby Steps</em> is delivering in spades.</p>

<p>The protagonist of the game, Nate, is perhaps the most pathetic man I’ve ever met, real or fictional. After he’s teleported by a mysterious power to a large mountain, he avoids human contact at all costs.</p>

<p>At one point in the demo, a fellow traveller remarks that he could probably use a map. Finally! A way to get some direction, and really get a grip on where exactly he is.</p>

<p>Nope. Nate says he’s actually fine without it, all in the name of avoiding any additional human conversation or contact. Barring a big shift in him, it feels like Nate will be actively working against the player at every step of the way.</p>

<p>In any game, or any story for that matter, there’s always some kind of force working against the protagonist. This feels like a rare time in games where a protagonist is working against themselves. Beyond creating a lot of funny scenes and situations, I’m excited to see where this game goes narratively, both for Nate and the mysterious world surrounding him, something I didn’t expect going in.</p>

<h2><em>Baby Steps</em> | Final Thoughts</h2>



<p><em>Baby Steps</em>, like most Foddian games, will almost certainly find an audience on streams. Foddy’s games like <em>Getting Over It</em>, and Foddy-inspired ones like <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/coverage-club-jump-king-takes-frustration-platforming-to-new-heights" rel="nofollow"><em>Jump King</em></a> and <em>Only Up</em>, were sensations on the platform, and I imagine this game will be no exception.</p>

<p>However, this slice of the game convinced me that this might be the best Foddy game from a player perspective yet. From the increased production value to the sharp wit, there is a lot here that justifies playing it yourself. Whether you’ve been closely following the creator since <em>QWOP</em> or this is your first exposure, this is a game that is poised to be a joy to play. Even if you play it and find it isn’t your thing, even if you play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9" rel="nofollow">games with similar ideas </a>this year, I promise that you won’t play anything else quite like <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p>

And a personal favorite indie platformer of mine, <em>Planet of Lana</em>, is getting a beautiful-looking sequel. Plus <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is finally coming to Xbox. It only took nearly six years and Square Enix hemorrhaging money to make that happen.

I’m all&nbsp;<em>Souls</em>ed out but maybe this one will have the juice, or actually turn out to be more of a classic arcade action game than a FromSoftware-inspired dodge-fest. </p></div><div><p><em>Clockwork Revolution</em> is a <em>BioShock</em>-looking immersive action-RPG where everyone is having fun with their cockney accents. I was hoping for a release window but it seems to be shaping up nicely. The core mechanic is the power to manipulate time to fight enemies or solve puzzles by visually altering the environment. Players will also have an arsenal of gadgets, weapons, and a companion steampunk drone called Prentice.</p></div><div><p> The <em>Honey, I Shrunk The Kids</em>-style survival sim is getting what looks like a bigger, more polished sequel.&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em> is coming to Xbox and PC via Early Access on July 29 with new systems, bugs, and stories to tell. How is Obsidian releasing three games this year? Well, for this one it’s getting help from <em>Deus Ex</em> maker Eidos Montréal. </p></div><div><p>Bloober Team is wasting no time doubling down on the third-person action survival horror genre. Following its dutiful remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, <em>Cronos: The New Dawn </em>arrives just one year later. Players have to travel through time to save humanity from crippling horrors of the past. It looks like it’ll be incredibly eerie as long as it can sport polished gameplay to match the scares on display. </p></div><div><p><em>The Elder Scrolls Online: Seasons of the Worm Cult Part 1 </em>and update 46 go live on June 18. While that bit continues story quests from the game’s first year a decade ago, <em>ESO</em> is also getting its first world-altering in-game event in October. </p></div><div><p>The cinematic action puzzle game promises to make players utilize solutions based in real-world science to survive after crash landing on a giant rock of ice. There will be platforming and stealth as players uncover the mystery haunting the frosty planet of Persephone.</p></div><div><p>Become an interior decorator who also hunts ghosts in this cozy sim where you can use a vacuum gun to suck up books or magically arrange them perfectly back on the shelf. </p></div><div><p> Heavenly Spear brings the Japanese Pantheon to the real-time strategy game in the fall. In addition to 12 new gods with unique powers, there will be a new 12-mission campaign as well.</p></div><div><p><em> MUDANG</em> could be all Unreal Engine 5 flash and no tactical gameplay substance, but it seems like it at least has a shot of filling the stealth takedown void left by <em>Splinter Cell</em>. Intriguingly, you play as a bunch of different characters ranging from a North Korean special forces operative to a K-pop idol.</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Planet of Lana </em>was excellent, and had some of the best visual flourishes of any 2D cinematic action game, but it was easy to underrate it as just “another good one of those,” so it’s rad to see <em>Planet of Lana 2</em> is happening and only a year away.</p></div><div><p> “Gone Fission” is <em>Fallout 76</em>'s latest life sim update adding all sorts of fishing rods to customize and fish heads to collect as players in the Wasteland continue to thrive years after the shooter MMO’s rocky launch. It’s live across all platforms starting today.</p></div><div><p><em>Solo Leveling</em> is a “global phenomenon” based on a “hit webtoon.” If you, like me, were also unaware of that, just know that <em>Arise Overdrive</em> is an anime action-RPG you can play with friends. It’s coming to PC in 2025 and Xbox in 2026. </p></div><div><p>No, it’s not<em> Palword</em>, but it sure does have that energy!<em> Aniimo</em> will arrive next year and looks like another survival game with fun creatures to befriend, except you can take control of them directly in this game instead of putting them into indentured servitude. </p></div><div><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> isn’t out until July 11 but there’s a demo you can start playing today.</p></div><div><p>Unlike <em>Spiritfarer</em>, the excellent narrative cozy sim about death, <em>At Fate’s End</em> is an action game where you solve emotional trauma with duels. It looks very tight. </p></div><div><p> Prepare for all your sweaty Xbox friends to chainsaw you in half when <em>Gears of War </em>multiplayer gets its pre-release betas stating June 13. A new trailer, meanwhile, showed off the extra enhancements going into the modern, multiplatform remaster. </p></div><div><p>The rumored remake of <em>Persona 4</em>, whose excellent <em>Golden</em> port only just arrived on Switch not too long ago, exists and is coming...eventually. Atlus teased fans with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-4-revival-trailer-teaser-remake-jrpg-xbox-ps5-1851784003&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-4-revival-trailer-teaser-remake-jrpg-xbox-ps5-1851784003">the briefest of glimpses</a></span> at the PS2 game’s completely overhauled world and graphics. Considering how good the<em> Persona 3</em> remake was, I have high hopes. </p></div><div><p><em>Sea of Thieves </em>season 17 arrives in August with an emphasis on explosives. Players can recruit new pirate allies to salvage for new weapons. It really feels like the game should be on <em>Switch 2</em> after it came to PS5 last year, but Microsoft hasn’t announced a port yet. </p></div><div><p>Mark, Thula, Bulletproof, Atom Eve and more will square off in a 3v3 tag fighting game based on the hit comic series that’s also a gore-filled cartoon. The series first made its fighting game debut with Omni Man’s cameo in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. <br></p></div><div><p>Fans have been waiting so long that some had given up all hope that Square Enix’s exclusivity deals with Sony for <em>Final Fantasy </em>would ever expire. But it turns out the biggest entries in the franchise in recent years will come to Microsoft’s platform after all, starting with <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>which shadow-dropped today. The wait isn’t quite over just yet for <em>FFVII Remake Intergrade</em>, though. That one arrives this winter.<br></p></div><div><p>Double Fine’s next game is just a month away. <em>Keeper</em> tells a story with no words about a light house and a sea bird going on a journey of self-discovery. It’s out October 17. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a7eabe142c3deb449a8dd4772c26b5cc" data-recommend-id="image://a7eabe142c3deb449a8dd4772c26b5cc" data-format="png" data-width="1036" data-height="568" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Phil Spencer appears at the Xbox showcase.

Literally. It barely even looks like a single-player <em>Call of Duty </em>campaign. Hopefully, the deep dives that follow later this year show that’s not just a marketing trick. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
