            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-update-new-boss-descendants<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nexon's looter-shooter&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has received a major update that adds two new Descendants for you to play as, as well as a new boss to take on and more.</p>
<p>The first new Descendant is Ultimate Valby, a variant of the existing Descendant Valby that has improved stats and slightly different moves. Bubble Bullet has been replaced by Spiral Tidal Wave, a straight-flying projectile that can be stacked and fired three times in a row, and Hydro Pressure Bomb causes Ultimate Valby to leap forward and damage enemies in an area where she lands.</p>
<p>Your second new Descendant is Luna, an entirely new character who you'll likely vibe with if you're a fan of characters like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>'s Lucio or <i>League of Legends</i>' Seraphine. She's a music-themed Descendant with a curious rhythm mechanic that causes her damage to increase as you hit skills in time to the music.</p>

<p>That new Ultimate Weapon is called Peace Maker, which can build up stacks to fire its ammo in a single shot. As you can imagine, it'll likely make for a powerful addition to any arsenal.</p>
<p>This update arrives alongside a major hotfix that includes tons of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and other tweaks. You can read the full changelog for this&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2614115?headlineId=1015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>is a free-to-play looter-shooter created by Korean studio Nexon. Released earlier this month, the game sees players taking control of the titular Descendants, powerful individuals who must repel an invasion by the alien Vulgus race.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/are-kontrol-freeks-worth-it/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>If you’re a console-based gamer or you frequently use a controller on a PC setup, you might have heard of ‘Kontrol Freeks’. Even if you’ve never held a controller in your life, there’s a good chance you know what they are – but you might have written them off as not at all applicable to you. In this breakdown, we’re taking a closer look at the popular product that promises to help controller players better their aim in shooters. To that end, we’re asking a key question: ‘Are Kontrol Freeks worth it?’</p>



<p>Read on to find out if Kontrol Freeks really help.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-kontrol-freeks">What Are Kontrol Freeks?</h2>



<p>Let’s assume for a moment that you’ve never heard of these small rubber devices that sit atop the thumbsticks on a controller. That’s all they are – they’re specially shaped and moulded rubber ‘sticks’ that offer a boost to the height of a thumbstick, along with other ‘benefits’ like better grip and a bold aesthetic. </p>



<p>Kontrol Freeks come in all shapes and sizes, with some offering a super-high peak while others opt for a moderate boost. There are concave Kontrol Freeks and convex Kontrol Freeks to meet the needs of a wide variety of gamers, and some are specially themed to pay tribute to a certain franchise, such as Call of Duty.</p>



<p>From subtle purple to bright red, and from inky black to pure white, the Kontrol Freek market is diverse when it comes to picking the colour that you most appreciate. It’s worth stressing that there are hundreds of alternatives on the market, but none have the profile that Kontrol Freek does. </p>



<h2 id="h-do-kontrol-freeks-work">Do Kontrol Freeks Work?</h2>



<p>To answer the question, ‘Are Kontrol Freeks worth it,’ we need to lean on one core concern, and that’s whether or not they <strong>actually work</strong>.</p>



<p>By design, Kontrol Freeks are supposed to give you more accurate control over your thumbsticks, which allows you to finesse your aim and control recoil a little better, especially when playing first-person shooters. They also help you stay ‘on the stick’, especially if your hands are feeling a little sweaty. </p>



<p>Over the years, Kontrol Freeks became so popular that some controller manufacturers started building their ‘effects’ into their units, with brands like Scuf and Battle Beaver offering players permanently heightened sticks, or interchangeable pads that could mimic the effects of Kontrol Freeks.</p>



<p>As a brand, ‘KontrolFreek’ has been around since 2008, which means it’s doing something right. They’re not the most affordable extenders or grips on the market, but they are the most prolific and well-reviewed devices you’ll find anywhere. </p>



<p>But do Kontrol Freeks work?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In my experience, <strong>they do</strong>. They’re not going to make you an esports pro overnight, but they can help you to get a little more precision in your aim, depending on how comfortable you are with your thumb (or thumbs) being boosted. In the esports world, some players have drastically high thumbsticks, but you can start with a small boost and work your way up from there. It’s also a popular option to have a higher ‘aiming’ thumbstick than the ‘movement’ thumbstick.</p>



<p>But what are the downsides to Kontrol Freeks?</p>



<p>As a result of their tight grip on a thumbstick, they can chew the rubber to pieces, which means that when you take the Kontrol Freeks off, you’ll be left with permanent marks on the controller. They’re also not super cheap, as I just mentioned. They can also alter your impressions of a controller, so when it comes to playing without them, you’ll be at a disadvantage.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-kontrol-freeks-cheating">Are Kontrol Freeks Cheating?</h2>



<p>Here’s a funny question, while we’re on the topic.</p>



<p>Many people are under the impression that using Kontrol Freeks is a form of cheating as you’re ‘augmenting’ your controller, but that’s not the case. They’re perfectly ‘legal’ in most competitive settings and tournament organisers won’t have any issues with them being used. In the worlds of Call of Duty, Fortnite, Rainbow Six Siege, and other shooter games, Kontrol Freeks are a fairly common sight.</p>



<p>If you’ve been wondering if Kontrol Freeks are worth it for R6 or Fortnite but you’re afraid of being labelled a cheater, don’t worry – you’re <em>fine</em>.</p>



<p>So, are Kontrol Freeks worth it? I’d say that they are but don’t expect miracles – there’s no replacement for innate talent and plenty of practice.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/owning-a-printer-is-a-curse.941241/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/printers-suck-so-bad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I own a home printer. I bought it because, like many things I didn’t know I’d have to spend all my time doing when I started a business, I often need to print documents and mail them places. Years of asking friends to print things for me or sneakily printing personal documents at work made me think owning my own printer would be a good choice that improved my quality of life. It's not.</p><p>Here’s a non-exhaustive, unranked list of what sucks about this thing:</p><ul><li><span>When plugged in, it has a lot of color-changing lights I can’t turn off, much like my computer headphones and other gamer peripherals that have come into my possession over the years. The color of these lights doesn’t indicate anything, and they just exist to keep me from being able to sleep in any room occupied by my printer.</span></li><li><span>It came with a terrible desktop app. I actually just opened this app after writing the above bullet point, wondering if I could turn the lights off, but the main thing the app seems to be for is telling me I can buy ink from HP.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>It’s a wireless printer, connected to my single home network, and sits maybe three feet from both my computer and my router, and yet the odds all three of these items will be able to find each other when required changes every time.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>It chews through ink, apparently on purpose. When I tried to print some stuff a few weeks ago, I was surprised to find that the black ink cartridge was empty, but I chalked this up to assuming the factory-provided cartridge sucked. I bought a new one for <em>fifty American dollars</em>, printed less than 100 pages, and this weekend found that it was out of ink again. Researching this led me to a ton of printer nerds in forums who’ve made “coverage charts” demonstrating that, yep, this is working as intended.</span></li><li><span>The app would like to remind me that I could buy more ink from HP.</span></li><li><span>The printer will indicate that it is “ready,” but this status has no relation to whether or not anything will happen after I hit “print.” This weekend, I attempted to print a single page 10 times. Half of those times, the printer told me it “wasn’t ready” after I asked it to print, despite being “ready” moments ago. The other half, it continued to tell me it was “ready” but just didn’t do anything.</span></li><li><span>When I realized I was out of black ink this weekend, I decided I could just print in color, by selecting the “color” option from the print screen. This did not work. This did not work so much that I eventually removed the empty black ink cartridge from the printer, which caused the printer to throw a lengthy fit and refuse to print.</span></li><li><span>The app would like to remind me that I could buy more ink from HP.</span></li></ul><p>In fairness to my printer, an inanimate object that doesn’t need my empathy, I am willing to concede that printing is hard. I remember how long it took me to learn to write by hand, which I guess is the human equivalent of printing. But once I learned how to write, I could reliably write things down whenever the need arose. My printer has no such consistency, despite the fact that we’ve had home printers since at least the 80s. I don’t remember printing being this shitty when I was young, but maybe my expectations were lower with nascent technology, or maybe I just had a child’s sense of how things should work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here is what makes the printer’s life so hard that its only recourse is to make <em>my </em>life hard too, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/why-all-printers-suck-even-the-best-ones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wirecutter</a>,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>there is some amazingly complicated technology in your printer, including the printheads, the ink, and the mapping software. You take your printer for granted, but that box can cover a piece of paper in millions of dots of precisely located, color-matched ink in a few seconds. You’re probably buying the printer for the cost of parts and distribution, which means the manufacturer is effectively subsidizing the thing on the premise that they’ll recoup their research and development costs (and the rest of their overhead) from your ink purchases.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7534/printers-will-always-be-terrible?zd=1&amp;zi=jegbef3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outline </a>points out that printers “have to attempt to cooperate with <em>every computer ever made</em>, and <em>every computer that ever will be made</em>,” which, OK, is a pretty tall order when you think about it. Taking these sites at their word and not assuming Big Print has gotten to them somehow, I guess I should be awed that the printer even occasionally works?</p><p>But I am not awed; I am angry. The fact that this problem seems universal–it’s not just my printer, or my computer, or my home network, or me–suggests that the problem rests with printers themselves, or at least <em>every</em> company that makes one, or–you might want to sit down for this–capitalism. As The Outline writes,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Blame the glory of the free market. Manufacturers were incentivised to make [printers] shittier. It’s similar to how freemium mobile games tend to prioritize addictiveness over quality in order to generate more in-app purchases. Or how Facebook utilizes aggressive growth hacks over not incinerating democracy. It’s a prioritization of profit above all else.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You probably know all this, and as such do not own a printer. You probably do what I used to do, and use your job’s printer, or print at the office supply store, or the library, or from one of your idiot friends like me who owns a printer. But me, your idiot friend, cannot print things for you, because even though it is 2024 in America, a country that has put a man on the moon, I cannot print things at home by pressing "print" on the machine designed specifically for the purpose of printing. I can merely spend hours cursing the heavens, wondering where in the three feet of ether my print job has gone, while a shitty app tells me it can sell me more ink. </p><p>(I feel like I should end this blog with that clip from <em>Office Space</em>, but it makes me feel old, and I already feel old enough writing a whole blog railing at technology. Sorry if that's what you were expecting here.)</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-microsoft-financials-q4-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its financial summary for the final quarter of 2024, and while hardware sales are dire, the company is enjoying its highest gaming-related monthly active user count ever.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/SlidesFY24Q4.pptx?version=d1825a39-c7b8-f75f-fe23-275f2be198cc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">slideshow</a> accompanying its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2024-q4/press-release-webcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earnings report</a>, Microsoft says its gaming revenue grew 44% this quarter when compared to the same period last year, citing its monumental <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">Activision Blizzard acquisition</a> as one of the key reasons for this growth (which is an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-revenue-grows-49-due-to-activision-acquisition-xbox-hardware-up-3-year">increasingly common refrain</a> when it comes to Microsoft financials).</p>
<p>Additionally, the company says its "content and services revenue" grew by 61%, growth which Microsoft also attributes to the Activision Blizzard acquisition. It should come as no surprise that this acquisition has been so pivotal for Microsoft; it is, after all, the single biggest corporate purchase in gaming history, easily beating out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-acquires-zynga-to-strengthen-mobile-gaming-division">Take-Two's Zynga acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft also says it's attracting 500 million monthly active users to its gaming services and devices, which is a record for the company, so it's clear there's still great interest in Xbox as a brand, which should hopefully cushion the blow when it comes to consoles.</p>

Hardware decline is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-revenue-drops-4-year-on-year-while-xbox-hardware-revenue-declined-30">another</a> familiar <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-revenue-grows-1-year-on-year-content-services-are-up-5-xbox-hardware">story</a> for Microsoft, but 42% is a particularly precipitous drop, perhaps indicating that Microsoft won't be staying in the console game for too much longer.</p>
<p>Indeed, a quick glance at the <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/TranscriptFY24Q4.docx?version=c21096e2-8fc6-6a11-6c23-f836c9ebad32" rel="noopener" target="_blank">transcript of the earnings conference call</a> that accompanies the financial report tells a similar story. In that call, Microsoft head Satya Nadella says the goal for Xbox is to offer "content for everywhere people play games", and while he clarifies that means "starting with the PC", he goes on to say he wants Xbox to "access all the traditional high scale platforms" on which people play games.</p>
<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood concurs; later in the call, she says Xbox's goal is to "take a broad set of content to users in more places", and that the aim is to build a "software annuity and subscription business" that emphasizes "enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP", further reinforcing the idea that Xbox consoles are not long for this world.</p>

The company's overall revenue is up 24% on a year-over-year basis, which makes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">recent closure of studios like Tango and Arkane</a> even more galling if you ask me.</p>
<p>As far as its future is concerned, Microsoft says it's expecting further revenue growth throughout the 2025 fiscal year, but that hardware will likely continue to decline.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-is-encouraged-by-gaming-progress-with-500m-maus-fallout-playtime-jumped-5x-on-game-pass-after-the-show/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Microsoft's Q4 2024 earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella talked quite a bit about gaming. He shared (quotes via <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fool.com</a>) a new milestone for monthly active users (MAUs) for games owned by Microsoft.</p>
<p><em>We now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices, and our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter. </em><em>18 of them, such as Call of Duty, Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on devices they already have, including as of last month, Amazon Fire TV.</em></p>
<p>Of course, a sizable portion of that userbase comes from Activision Blizzard's prized IPs, like Call of Duty, Diablo, World of Warcraft, Candy Crush, et cetera. However, another franchise that earned a nod from the Microsoft CEO is Fallout, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-popularity-got-bethesda-at-least-80-million-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a massive boost after the release of the first season of the Amazon Prime Video show.</p>
<p><em>Finally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. </em><em>It was the second most watched title on the platform ever and hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter over quarter.</em></p>
<p>That's not to say everything is peachy. While the $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition continues to pay dividends (Xbox content and services are up 61% year-over-year, but 58% of that increase is due to ABK), hardware sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-boosts-microsot-q3-gaming-revenue-xbox-consoles-sales-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue</a> to decline, with console hardware revenue down 42%.</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A portion of the earnings call, investors asked Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood about the outlook for gaming. Here's what they had to say:</p>
<p><em><strong>Satya</strong> <strong>Nadella:</strong> Our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox, and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. When I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never had.</em></p>
<p><em>We feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high-scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC, and mobile. But we're also excited about these new sockets, right? We <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-dont-need-an-xbox-to-play-xbox-says-new-fire-tv-app-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded</a> XCloud to Amazon Fire TV. That's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. That ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI, and that's what we're building toward. That was the strategy behind Activision as an asset. Amy, if you want to add to it?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Amy</strong> <strong>Hood: </strong>The real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and really build what looks more like to us, the software annuity and subscription business, with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long term. As Satya mentioned, things were with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. And I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass as well with some of the new announcements.</em></p>
<p>Game Pass just added several big games and is about to <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-august-2024-lineup-just-got-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> even bigger, although it also became more <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expensive</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/31/sky-cipher-xbox-wireless-controller-transparent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a> today, Xbox officially announced the Sky Cipher Special Edition controller, as which releases alongside a new packaging design.</p>



<p>The announcement partly confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-controller-leak-teases-new-special-edition-release-possibly-coming-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a previous leak</a> from earlier this month, which correctly estimated Xbox will introduce the Sky Cipher controller this August.</p>



<p>Xbox now reveals that Sky Cipher has a blue and transparent design, and today’s post acknowledges the nostalgia factor of the latter. The controller also has “metallic features and silver interior parts that shine through from inside.” </p>



<p>Fans can pre-order the controller today in some Xbox markets. Xbox revealed the controller’s estimated price tag is $69.99. According to the product page, the Sky Cipher controller will be available soon on August 13, 2024.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Transparent tech is making a major comeback! We’re introducing an exciting, brand-new controller to the Xbox lineup, the Xbox Wireless Controller – Sky Cipher Special Edition: <a href="https://t.co/3TxMwJDKQa">https://t.co/3TxMwJDKQa</a></p>— Xbox Wire (@XboxWire) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1818648057220673740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The design also includes two-tone thumbsticks, as well as metallic triggers and a matching D-pad. </p>



<p>Xbox added that the Sky Cipher will include a brand-new packaging design aiming to reduce the product carbon footprint. </p>



<p>Today’s blog says Sky Cipher’s packaging removes single-use plastics and the paper manual. Instead, Xbox replaced the latter with a QR code. Xbox also revealed that the new packaging will be about 20 percent smaller and lighter apiece. </p>



<p>Most recently, Xbox made headlines after introducing an amusing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-releases-new-controller-with-deadpools-butt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool-themed controller</a>, and later a Wolverine counterpart. However, these controllers are only available via giveaways, so fans cannot purchase them outright.</p>

                <p>One of the strangest debates in video gaming has been around the use of yellow paint to signal interactive objects in an environment. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-characters-and-everything-we-know/1100-6515795/" data-ref-id="1100-6515795">Star Wars Outlaws</a> does have this accessibility feature, but developer Ubisoft Massive will also let you turn it off, in case the thought of seeing a dash of signposting paint in a galaxy far (far!) away runs counter to your sense of immersion.</p><p>Players can choose Explorer Mode in Star Wars Outlaws, an option that turns off the "guiding color on core navigational elements" in the world around you (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/star-wars-outlaws-will-finally-let-us-turn-off-that-annoying-yellow-paint-on-every-climbing-surface/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). Essentially, this mutes the visual language that guides players toward interactive parts of the environment and collectibles. While this does make Star Wars Outlaws less video-gamey, the mode can potentially make navigating levels more of a chore.</p>

      </div>
<p>"My major struggle was that it could often be tough to understand exactly what you're able to do," Phil Hornshaw wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-preview-hey-kid-you-wanna-do-space-crimes/1100-6525386/" data-ref-id="1100-6525386">Star Wars Outlaws preview</a>. "You know how people make fun of developers for covering everything in yellow paint to show you what can be climbed, blasted, or collected? Star Wars Outlaws is a pretty good example of why they do that, because I often felt unsure of what I could interact with in a given area. I appreciated that the game left me to figure out what I needed to do instead of just slapping a waypoint on it, but everything in Star Wars is covered in lights and buttons, making it tough to tell what's a control panel for Nix to flip or a generator you can shoot, and what's just a cool-looking background texture. It sometimes left me floundering to figure out what to do next."</p><p>There has been a big debate over the last couple of years regarding yellow paint in video games. Some critics call it a distracting method of signposting that is clumsily implemented, while proponents for it say that it helps make video games more accessible to a wider audience. While games like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor did make use of this visual language, it also added more-subtle design elements to indicate which areas of the environment could be further explored through the gameplay options available to players.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws will drop from hyperspace on August 30 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and puts players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-expands-the-galaxy-by-letting-you-play-a-kind-of-normal-person/1100-6525387/" data-ref-id="1100-6525387">in the boots of the resourceful Kay Vess</a>. Unlike the games developed by Respawn at EA, Outlaws is focused on a character who doesn't have any Force sensitivity and has to use her wits, cunning, and guile to survive in a hostile galaxy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-bounty-hunter-review-jango-deserves-better<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> released during an era when <em>Star Wars </em>games were a dime a dozen. It was pretty easy to miss a game or two, so I never played <em>Bounty Hunter </em>until now. Nonetheless, I was happy to see it get a port on modern platforms so I could finally experience a game through the eyes of one of my favorite <em>Star Wars</em> characters: Jango Fett.</p>
<p>Well, I have no nostalgia for <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>. I suspect this port by Aspyr is hoping for players to relive their experience with the game. Looking at it with a critical lens, in 2024, it's hard for me to see what the hype was all about, and moreover, the port leaves a lot to be desired. It's not a game befitting Jango Fett, that's for sure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-cutscene.jpg?itok=tUN3zYYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-cutscene.jpg?itok=ZiEzeuZh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Temuera Morrison reprised his role as Jango Fett in the original release -- less than a year after his debut in <em>Episode II</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Port Quality of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em></h2>
<p>Originally launching in 2002, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is a bonafide antique. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-old-republic-kotor">early 2000s</a> had its fair share of classics, but it can be a bit rough experiencing older games in 2024. That is, unfortunately, the case here. It's a game rife with issues stemming from 2002 game design, and those issues persist today, despite the chance to be fixed in this port.</p>
<p>But before all the doom and gloom, in terms of visual fidelity, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> features a fresh coat of paint. It's not a remaster, but Aspyr likely did the same upscaling as they did in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response"><em>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</em></a><em> </em>launch earlier in the year. And hey, it looks pretty great here. Textures are crisp, and lighting is overall improved.</p>
<p>I got a chance to try out both the PS2 and GameCube versions of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> just for comparison's sake, and Aspyr breathes new life into a game that looks rather rough around the edges on its original consoles. Its visuals are by far the best thing this game has going for it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting.jpg?itok=v4BuGhda 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting.jpg?itok=55fM_oZ3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Feelin' lucky?</figcaption></figure><p>Even as a port, I'd expect other areas to be improved. Namely the camera, which was notoriously jank back in the day (and I can confirm this having played the originals less than a week ago, as of this review). Aspyr claims to have updated the camera system in this port, which might be true, but it's definitely no better than it was before.</p>
<p>Many deaths or mishaps in my playthrough can be attributed to this reworked camera, which was still jerky and finicky. In short, it's atrocious, and the lock-on system often butts heads with the camera and creates situations where you can walk off cliffs or get pummeled by enemies. Get used to getting frustrated is all I can say.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-boss.jpg?itok=gyg_aIy8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-boss.jpg?itok=3dN0b2gT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How fast can your trigger finger go?</figcaption></figure><h2>AI, Saving, What Else Isn't Great?</h2>
<p>It would have been great to see an improvement to <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>'s save system, but it is antiquated. There's a checkpoint system and five lives for each level, and if you die you spawn on these checkpoints. You can't save in the middle of a level, so if you quit, you have to restart the level.</p>
<p>That's just not practical in this day and age, but it's not too surprising in an older game. Other than that, AI is dumber than a box of rocks, and heck, I even had one of the final bosses stand still after a few seconds of fighting. They didn't shoot, they didn't do anything -- the boss simply let me kill them without a fuss.</p>
<p>There isn't any extra gameplay content in this port beyond achievements, as far as I can tell, so don't go expecting to find new surprises. The extras from the original game are still unlockable by collecting bounties and such, but I'm sure that's not a huge incentive for players returning to experience this game again.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is very much a game of its era. Playing as Jango Fett before the start of <em>Episode II</em>, you're on a cross-galaxy trip to capture bounties and put an end to a notorious, intergalactic cult. You'll shoot and jetpack across six different chapters, each featuring its own planets and environments.</p>
<p>It's a very straightforward game. Jango Fett has an arsenal of weapons like the flamethrower, rockets, poison darts, and of course, duel blasters. You'll rely on the latter the most. There's his jetpack, too, which isn't as capable as I'd like -- since it's usable only in short bursts -- but still fun to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting-2.jpg?itok=KHHw1mBN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting-2.jpg?itok=rlGAvXV1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It feels a little messed up to wipe out an entire civilization full of Sebulba's bros.</figcaption></figure><p>This adventure is a third-person shooter/platformer hybrid, often tasking players to shoot through an absurd number of infinitely respawning enemies as they navigate to an objective. Levels take advantage of Jango's jetpack, but often times platforming sequences feel like a pain what with all the enemies around.</p>
<p>In the original <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>, Jango Fett's blasters shot as fast as you could pull the trigger. The base fire rate is improved here by just holding down the trigger, but you're still better off mashing it as fast as possible. Some enemies are spongy and soak up hits, so your finger is likely to feel tired after a few rounds of combat -- that was certainly the case for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-bounty.jpg?itok=zf8ZwEyq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-bounty.jpg?itok=D_Lw6-Mf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This guy is definitely peddling death sticks.</figcaption></figure><p>In between combat, you can scan crowds and enemies for bounties to either capture or kill. You'll earn unlockables this way, though it's purely optional. Thankfully, Aspyr adds some improved controls which makes this game slightly less cumbersome to play on modern controllers.</p>
<p>A big improvement to all of these mechanics is that scanning for bounties slows time down, as opposed to the original. When you're fighting a dozen enemies shooting you at the same time, the slow motion is a great help.</p>
<p>Enemy overload is apparent in the last several levels and is quite a pain. Hordes of enemies run at you and the best solution is to torch them with a flamethrower. The finale should go all out but instead feels more like an afterthought compared to some of the earlier levels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-unlock.jpg?itok=7lgH7G3c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-unlock.jpg?itok=d2jNpU5_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Concept art is always cool, and here is no different.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter </em>| Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If we ignore the lacking quality of this port, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> shows its age. It's really not all that fun playing as Jango Fett, with his limited jetpack fuel and the constant need to mash the trigger. With so many enemies that respawn constantly, there's little to get excited about. Its saving grace is a somewhat palatable story, and decently fun platforming.</p>
<p>Bundle everything together and you have a very shoddy experience. <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is intriguing to experience as a fan of the series and character, but does little else. The camera, by far the worst part of this whole experience, makes me hesitant to go back and play this antiquated title for quite a while.</p>

Star Wars: Bounty Hunter isn't a good game, nor is it necessarily bad, but its age shows as you play through its campaign. Not only that but the port quality and terrible camera controls leave a lot to be desired. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

For a long while now, third-person games have been decorating their worlds in yellow (or white) paint to indicate to players a doorway they can pass through, a rocky outcrop that can be climbed, or an area worth exploring. While some are grateful for the support, others describe this as unnecessary handholding, or decry it as poor level design. Ubisoft, meanwhile, is taking the position of Switzerland in the matter, and offering an option to keep it in, or switch it off entirely.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,195922,196345" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It was the fine folk at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/star-wars-outlaws-will-finally-let-us-turn-off-that-annoying-yellow-paint-on-every-climbing-surface/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/star-wars-outlaws-will-finally-let-us-turn-off-that-annoying-yellow-paint-on-every-climbing-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> who spotted this detail, during the recent flurry of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-demo-gameplay-preview-1851608928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-demo-gameplay-preview-1851608928">hands-on previews with the promising game</a></span>.

However, experience suggests that this can instead just reveal the core problem that has quite literally been painted over: without the guidance, you’re left just stumbling around, jumping fruitlessly toward promising-looking rocks, or trying to open doors painted onto the scenery.</p><p>I remember a more recent <em>Tomb Raider</em> game let me switch off the white paint from the game, and it became an exercise in ludicrous frustration, as the level design revealed just how arbitrary it all was.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/full-list-fallout-london-console-commands-cheats/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>I’m as guilty as many of you regarding using console commands and cheats in Bethesda’s open-world titles. I still occasionally spawn a few hundred thousand Caps in Fallout 4 so that I can buy and modify all of the custom weapons I mod into the game. But there’s a new kid on the block! So, without further ado, here’s a full list of Fallout: London console commands and cheats!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-one-of-the-fallout-london-console-commands-and-cheats">Every One of the Fallout: London Console Commands and Cheats</h2>



<p>You have access to a rather large number of Fallout: London console commands and cheat codes, which you can activate or deactivate at any time during gameplay!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>player.additem (Item ID) (Value)</strong> – Add a specific item to your inventory.</li>



<li><strong>additem (Item ID) (Value)</strong> – Add a specific item to your character.</li>



<li>p<strong>layer.addperk (Perk ID)</strong> – Grant your character a specific perk.</li>



<li><strong>(Ref ID) .amod (OMOD ID)</strong> – Attach a specific attachment to your current weapon.</li>



<li><strong>sexchange</strong> – Change your character’s gender.</li>



<li><strong>player.setav carryweight (Value)</strong> – Set your carry weight to a specific value.</li>



<li><strong>kah </strong>– Kill all enemy NPCs in the immediate area.</li>



<li><strong>killall </strong>– Kill all NPNs in the immediate area.</li>



<li><strong>showlooksmenu player</strong> – Open the character creation menu to alter your character’s appearance, name, background, and traits.</li>



<li><strong>(Ref ID) .rmod (OMOD ID) </strong>– Remove an attachment from your weapon.</li>



<li><strong>player.removeperk (Perk ID)</strong> – Remove a specific perk from your character.</li>



<li><strong>resurrect </strong>– Resurrect a selected NPC.</li>



<li><strong>player.setlevel (Value) </strong>– Set your character to a specific level.</li>



<li><strong>showmenu sleepwaitmenu</strong> – Access the wait menu.</li>



<li><strong>player.placeatme (Item ID) (Value)</strong> – Spawn an item, creature, or character in front of your character.</li>

<li><strong>tdetect </strong>– NPCs no longer detect you.</li>



<li><strong>tgm </strong>– Enable god mode.</li>



<li><strong>tim </strong>– Enable immortality mode.</li>



<li><strong>tmm 1,0,0 </strong>– Toggle all map markers.</li>



<li><strong>tcl </strong>– Turn on/off no clip to remove collision.</li>



<li><strong>unlock </strong>– Unlock targeted doors or containers.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-use-console-commands-in-fallout-london">How to Use Console Commands in Fallout: London</h2>



<p>As Fallout: London doesn’t entirely replace Fallout 4 during installation—it’s running over the top of the original product, like an overhaul mod—it utilizes the same console command system you’re like familiar with. To use console commands in Fallout: London, hit the tilde (~) on your keyboard to open the command menu. Once it appears in the bottom left corner of your screen, you may start typing or copy/paste cheats into the console.</p>



<p>Be wary of what cheats you use, though. It’s possible to irreversibly break your game, which may require a fresh install!</p>

<p>Check back shortly because we’ll have plenty more from the world of Fallout: London in the coming days! In the meantime, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>?</p>

<h3 id="h-nfl-draft">NFL Draft</h3>



<p>“Your authentic Draft Night experience starts when Roger Goodell takes the stage. The draft environment is dynamic, with the Draft Board updating in real-time. After selections are made, you’ll witness the iconic moment of your draft pick walking across the stage, holding up their new jersey or receiving the life-changing call from home.”</p>



<h3 id="h-prospect-hub">Prospect Hub</h3>



<p>“To reduce friction in the scouting and drafting process, we’ve completely redesigned the prospect hub in Madden NFL 25. Previously, in order to see a prospect’s athletic grades or physical measurables, you would have to go all the way into the player card. This year, we’ve brought all prospect information forward into a more familiar spreadsheet format…”</p>



<h3 id="h-super-bowl-presentation">Super Bowl Presentation  </h3>



<p>The presentation has been overhauled in both Superstar mode and Franchise mode. The way the Lombardi Trophy is presented will change depending on the game’s outcome and scenario.</p>

<li>Helmets</li>



<li>Stadium</li>



<li>On-field logos</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Build your rosters
<ul>
<li>Option to create every player if you’d like to!</li>

<h3 id="h-league-tools">League Tools</h3>



<p>“The league creation flow has been updated to make the selection of your league type and roster clearer, and the team select screen now provides expanded information about rankings, top players, and rosters.”</p>

Every time I step out of an elevator, I accelerate wildly in case the elevator falls without warning and chops me in half, leaving the frontal and, all things considered, inferior portion of my body swaying in place for a second before collapsing in a cloud of bisected bone and organ. Don't laugh: I know you do this too. Kletka isn't helping: created by <a href="https://ln404.itch.io/">in404</a>, it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> scavenging game reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an "endless" post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

The elevator's roof is a gnashing, lipless mouth with a lantern dangling beneath it like a droplet of drool. It parts and closes ever so gently as you scurry around with hunched shoulders, refuelling the generator and patching the machinery. You can almost feel its breath in your hair. Needless to say, you'll want to keep it sated with edible objects pilfered from the surrounding world. I spent my 15 minutes in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1699480/KLETKA/">Steam demo</a> with both eyes riveted to the screen displaying the creature's level of peckishness and my cursor hovering over the brake lever.
</p>
<p>
The rooms and corridors of the Gigastructure aren't much safer than the elevator. They're as dark as a dog's interior, and chocabloc with traps such as landmines and lakes of electrified water. The game's rusty, lichenous PS1-era visual direction makes spotting resources and items a fiddle, and your all-important torch has to switch off and recharge at regular intervals. Worst of all, you'll have to deal with Samosbor. I'm not sure what Samosbor is, but you can't kill it. If you see a lot of red light, run run run as you would from a Balrog with the mumps.
</p>
<p>
Kletka's demo includes a multiplayer mode for up to four - this won't allow crossplay with the full release, which is due later this year. You can spectate online games and join the proceedings when the host finds a vending machine in the Gigastructure, as when rescuing Survivors from closets in Left 4 Dead. Also as in Left 4 Dead, though for different reasons, co-op partners are worth having around even when they suck at the game. Teamwork makes the dream work, yes, but Kletka's Steam blurb offers the fine counterargument that "friends make for good fuel".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-developer-rebellion-partners-with-level-infinite-for-project-archipelago/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In an official <a href="https://rebellion.com/rebellion-and-level-infinite-announce-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, Rebellion revealed a new partnership with Level Infinite to work on an unannounced title with the codename “Project Archipelago.” </p>



<p>Rebellion calls it an original IP that uses “the unique skillsets of both organisations to create a new gameplay experience.”</p>



<p>Today’s blog post also reveals that Rebellion will roll out a playtest of the game sometime “soon.” The playtest will only feature a “pre-Alpha build of Project Archipelago,” as well as a dedicated Discord. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Although fans can playtest Project Archipelago soon, Rebellion did not offer further details about the project or its gameplay. But the playtest does give fans an idea of the development timeline.</p>



<p>Rebellion did add that “more details will be revealed about the project in due course.” Although the devs appear to be wisely patient, it seems that more news about the project is coming soon. There will likely be even more revealed at Gamescom 2024 in August.</p>



<p>Fans likely recognize Rebellion for its work on the Sniper Elite and Zombie Army series. In February 2024, Rebellion <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rebellion-reveals-zombie-army-vr-is-coming-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Zombie Army VR</a>, which is coming out sometime this year.</p>



<p>Level Infinite published a variety of popular games, such as PUBG Mobile and Honor of Kings. Just last week, Honor of Kings developer TiMi Studio Group announced the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/honor-of-kings-worldwide-launch-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached 50 million downloads</a> since launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-addresses-dead-game-debate-who-cares-if-theres-only-five-people-playing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Our obsession with the concept of the “dead game” and player counts is unhealthy for the video game industry and gamers, one of the developers behind <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> has said.</p><p>Palworld, dubbed “Pokémon with guns,” launched in early access form to record-breaking success. It is the second most-played game ever on Steam, with an incredible concurrent player count of 2,101,867 on Valve’s platform. Only battle royale PUBG is ahead of Palworld in Steam’s all-time peak concurrents chart.</p><p>Palworld’s Steam concurrents have fallen since that explosive launch earlier this year, and now usually hit a peak in the tens of thousands rather than millions. The decline has caused some to call Palworld a “dead game,” but it is far from the only game to be called that in recent years.</p><p>For example, Rocksteady’s catastrophic <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, whose Steam concurrents usually peak in the hundreds of players, was called a dead game upon its release. Arrowhead's Helldivers 2, Ubisoft's Skull &amp; Bones, and Blizzard’s Overwatch 2 are also often called dead games. Sony’s live service hero shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> has been labeled "dead on arrival” before launch because of low beta concurrents on Steam.</p><p>The “dead game” narrative is exacerbated by an industry currently pumping out more live service games than the market can perhaps support, or even wants, and by publishers who walk away from their live service games amid low player numbers. This month <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-a-dino-crisis-for-capcom-as-it-abandons-new-exoprimal-content-just-a-year-after-launch">Capcom announced plans to move on from dinosaur-themed shooter Exoprimal just a year after launch</a>, with Steam concurrents brutally low.</p><p>John “Bucky” Buckley, community chief at Palworld developer Pocketpair, has been a vocal critic of the “dead game” phrase, and in social media posts has called on the industry, media, and gamers to ditch the fixation on concurrents and player counts.</p><p>Bucky followed up on these posts in an interview with YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GoingIndie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Going Indie</a> for a video titled, ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/NO38QvKraTQ?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dead Games Are A Good Thing, Actually.'</a> In it, Bucky called out publishers and developers who try to brute-force mechanics designed to keep players playing forever into games they're not suited to, declaring it "unhealthy."</p><p>“Just play the games you like,” Bucky said. “If you finish in a day, cool. Good job. I’m glad you enjoyed it. Play the next one.</p><p>“I don’t think it really serves anyone to push gamers to just play the same game day in, day out. There are games that you can play every single day for months on end and never burn out. League of Legends, Dota, most MMOs, but they’re designed to be like that.</p><p>“Whereas what we’re seeing now is a trend of... I won’t necessarily say who’s trying to push it, but a lot more people are trying to push gamers to play games that aren’t really designed to be played for months on end, for months on end.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Who cares if there’s only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself.</p></div><p>“I don’t think you need to be pushing yourself to play the same game all the time,” Bucky continued.</p><p>“It’s not healthy for us, it’s not healthy for developers, it’s not healthy for gamers, it’s not healthy for the gaming media. And it’s just not healthy for our industry, because the more we push this kind of narrative, the more very large companies are going to just say ‘gamers want more live service.’ And we’re just going to get more of these really soulless live service games that come out and then get shut down nine months later, 12 months later, because they’re not making enough money. And we all lose in that case.</p><p>“Play all the indIes you can. Spend as much money on indies as you can. Who cares if there’s only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself. Just enjoy games. I don’t think it needs to be any more complex than that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But will the industry, the media, and gamers listen? The “dead game” narrative is in part fueled by the video game industry’s obsession with secrecy. Unlike Hollywood, which makes movie budgets and box office figures public, video game publishers tend not to announce video game sales and/or revenue unless they’re truly spectacular, with development budgets almost always kept a closely guarded secret. In truth, it’s almost impossible to determine whether a video game has met expectations, which is why vague publisher comments made by CEOs in investor-focused financial calls get so much attention.</p><p>This secrecy means gamers and the media have just one publicly available performance metric with which to gauge performance: Steam concurrents. Valve continues to make this stat available for the world to see, and so the world has developed a hyper-focus around it, in turn leading to an over-reliance.</p><p>In any case, there have been plenty of examples of live service video games that were prematurely consigned to the scrap heap. Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege suffered a disastrous launch but went on to become one of the biggest live service games around. Hello Games' No Man's Sky is another redemption story, as is CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077. And let's not forget the humble origins of Fortnite, what began as a lackluster tower defense game but ended up perhaps the biggest live service of them all.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Braid: Anniversary Edition has "sold like dog shit", according to its creator Jonathan Blow.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/j_blow">Blow regularly streams on Twitch</a> and has discussed the sales performance of the Braid re-release on a number of occasions since its release in May.
</p>
<p>
YouTube channel Blow Fan has pieced together a montage of clips from Blow's streams (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/braid-anniversary-edition-has-sold-like-dog-sht-creator-jonathan-blow-says/">VGC</a>), in which he bluntly shares his thoughts on the sales of Braid: Anniversary Edition.

<p>
On 20th May, six days after the game's launch, Blow stated it was "a little too early" to see the game's performance, specifically the downward curve of sales after release. He also noted events like the Summer Sale can be a major contributor post-launch.
</p>
<p>
"It's not like we sold a million copies day one or whatever, which is what you expect. It's a remaster, so you don't expect it to be like a new game in terms of the hype level. But we just have to see where it lands," said Blow.
</p>
<p>
Then, on 17th June (34 days after launch), Blow stated the game had "sold horribly". "It depends on what your standards are," he said. "It's sold well if you compare it to nostalgic things like the Jeff Minter game that's on Steam or Atari 50. It's sold much better than all of those but it still has sold like dog shit compared to what we need to make for the company to survive.
</p>
<p>
"The future is uncertain, let's put it that way," he concluded. "It hasn't been good."
</p>
<p>
Blow reiterated sales have "been utterly terrible" on 21st July and then again on 22nd July, adding on the latter that console platforms "are dead now" with Steam as the game's biggest platform.
</p>
<p>
Referring to commentary added in the Anniversary Edition, Blow said: "At some point, you just have to know that what you did was a good thing even if the world doesn't really acknowledge it and this is one of those cases I think."
</p>
<p>
He then stated the likes of cons and events, as well as most YouTube interviews and podcasts, aren't useful for promotion.

<p>
Finally, on 27th July, Blow noted the "whole industry is having a hard time" and then, when asked how many of his development team are working on the compiler for programming language Jai, Blow replied: "None, because we can't afford to pay anyone because the sales are bad."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/braid-anniversary-edition-briefly-delayed-but-itll-feature-a-bunch-of-new-levels">Braid: Anniversary Edition launched in May</a> and adds 40 new levels, as well as over 15 hours of commentary.

</p>
<p>
The indie puzzle-platform game was first released on Xbox 360 in 2008 and quickly became a critical darling.

            <p>
Sorry singing fans, Amazon's Yakuza TV show won't include the game's iconic karaoke sessions.
</p>
<p>
The Yakuza, or Like a Dragon, games are known for their bizarre minigames, but it seems the TV producers are taking a more serious approach to their adaptations by focusing on human emotion and offering new interpretations of familiar characters.
</p>
<p>
When asked during a roundtable if karaoke would be featured in the Like a Dragon: Yakuza TV show, executive producer Erik Barmack said it would not, though "singing may come eventually" (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/yakuzas-tv-show-adaptation-no-karaoke-minigame/">The Gamer</a>).

</p>

<p>

"When you start to figure out how to boil down this world into six episodes... there's so much source material to pull from," said Barmack. There's no confirmation of further series, but it seems the door for karaoke is open at least.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/yakuza-tv-series-no-substories/">TV show won't focus on the substories</a> of the games, which often include some outlandish characters and activities.
</p>
<p>
"I think we're digging into the human emotions and the emotional elements of the characters of this iteration," said lead actor Ryoma Takeuchi (Kazuma Kiryu). "In a positive way, we're departing from the game at the end of the day; it all comes together."
</p>
<p>
Added Barmack: "As this series is an origin story, we wanted to make sure fans were emotionally connected to these characters... It's a balance that has to be found between the world that is so quirky and these characters, which need to feel real to everybody who is watching the series."
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-tv-show-drops-a-new-teaser-trailer">teaser trailer for the series was shown at San Diego Comic Con</a>, plus a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NS-3_Gqr-s&amp;t=8s">video interview</a> with director of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and show executive producer Masayoshi Yokoyama.


</p>
<p>
He described the portrayal of characters Kazuma Kiryu and Akira Nishikiyama as "totally different from the original story", but added "that's what's great about it" because there's nothing more to add to the game's character. There will also be brand new characters original to the Amazon TV show.
</p>
<p>
In November 2023, Sega reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sammy-reports-best-financial-performance-for-a-decade-despite-european-studio-disappointment">lifetime sales of the Yakuza game series had reached 21.3m units</a>. The most recent game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">Infinite Wealth, sold 1m units in its first week</a> to become the fastest selling in the series.

<p>Wilson said these plans for Battlefield are “one of our top priorities,” and “one of the most ambitious projects in our history.” </p>



<p>They also emphasized EA’s investment in the team and resources necessary to deliver on that. </p>



<p>The prepared remarks state that EA has already “brought together the very best team,” and supplied them with optimal “resources and technology.” EA previously confirmed that it has the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-has-largest-team-ever-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“largest team ever”</a> working on the new Battlefield game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the new remarks, Wilson also noted that the Battlefield franchise “has surpassed over 25 million players over the last twelve months.” However, EA did not offer further details on the exact nature of the upcoming Battlefield project.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, EA announced that some legacy Battlefield games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-battlefield-game-ever-going-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are going offline</a>. That includes the fan favorite Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline. </p>



<p>Today, players will lose access to purchasing those titles on some platforms. Further, those games will also permanently shut down their online services on November 7, 2024.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 fans did recently get a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-is-getting-a-dead-space-event-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space crossover event</a> called “Outbreak” just a couple of weeks ago. Fans are still holding out for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-space-2-remake-shelved-for-battlefield-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space 2 remake</a>.</p>

Users who already own the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One versions will receive a free upgrade. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions will no longer receive updates as Creepy Jar shifts its focus to the newer platforms. <span id="more-902056"></span></p><p>The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series release brings the console previously unreleased content that until now has been available exclusively for the PC version of <em>Green Hell</em>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the new versions, via Creepy Jar:</p><blockquote><p>With the current-generation console version of <em>Green Hell</em>, console players will be able to enjoy updates #17 (Storage &amp; Transportation), #18 (Fortifications), and #19 (Flamekeeper) for themselves for the very first time. And console players can upgrade—for free—to the current-generation version if they have previously purchased either the Xbox One or PlayStation 4 versions of the game.</p><p>While the Creepy Jar team is excited to bring <em>Green Hell</em> to current-generation consoles, last-generation consoles will no longer receive updates as the developer focuses on current-gen and beyond. Simply put, the last-generation consoles are unable to shoulder the weight of the newer updates while running at the quality Creepy Jar expects to deliver to players.</p><p>It is important to note that due to the discrepancy between current and last-gen console versions in terms of content, neither the Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5 versions will be compatible with their previous generation counterparts. As well, there will be no cross-play between versions and no save transfers from last-gen to current.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>2K and Hangar 13 have announced that Mafia: Definitive Edition will be added to Game Pass on August 13 for console, PC, and cloud.</p><p>Mafia: Definitive Edition is a remake of the 2002 game with extra features such as additional vehicles, weapons, and outfits. It also implements Mafia 3's gameplay mechanics, including shooting and cover systems. While driving within speed limits is no longer enforced, players can play on "Classic Mode," which emulates the original experience--cops will pull the player over for speeding and first-aid kits will restore less health.</p><p>Back in 2022, Hangar 13 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mafia-game-is-in-development/1100-6506973/" data-ref-id="1100-6506973">confirmed that it was developing</a> a new Mafia game.

However, Hangar 13 hasn't released any new information since then.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-definitive-edition-review-an-offer-you-could-probably-refuse/1900-6417570/" data-ref-id="1900-6417570">Mafia: Definitive Edition review</a>, we said, "Mafia: Definitive Edition might be an improvement on the original game, but its modernization stops short of the mark, resulting in an uneven game that squanders its enticing potential."</p><p>Mafia: Definitive Edition is available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Xbox Cloud Gaming is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-works-on-4k-fire-tv-sticks-which-are-up-to-50-off-at-amazon/1100-6524775/" data-ref-id="1100-6524775">now available in select Fire Stick 4K TV devices</a>, so players can enjoy Game Pass games without the need for a console.</p>

      </div>
<p>Prior to launch, EA explained how it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-will-have-inaccuracies-at-launch-ea-says/1100-6524998/" data-ref-id="1100-6524998">"never going to be a viable option"</a> to create CFB 25's thousands of players manually by scanning them all into the game and using human hands alone to do it. Instead, EA used AI and a machine-learning toolset to create the character models. EA inputted "hundreds" of head shapes, hairstyles, skin tones, complexions, beards, and brows into the model. Using this data, along with a single reference photo of the athlete or coach in question, EA said it was able to create the player likenesses in the game.</p><p>In total, College Football 25 features about 11,390 real players, along with 5,000 or so player models for coaches, fans, and created players, totaling more than 16,000 character models.</p><p>College Football 25 was in development for years, but things really ramped up in February 2024 when EA<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-offering-college-athletes-600-to-appear-in-new-football-game/1100-6521289/" data-ref-id="1100-6521289"> signed Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals with college athletes for the game</a>. That happened just five months before the game launched in July 2024. Using machine-learning and AI was critical in helping get College Football 25 out the door on time and at the desired level of quality, Wilson said.</p><p>The executive gave this answer in response to a question about why EA decided to make College Football 25 exclusive to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, instead of bringing the game to multiple generations of consoles. Wilson said EA decided to focus on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S because that is where "the player communities are showing up at the greatest level."</p><p>"And the uptake that we've seen across the new platforms would suggest that the platform decisions we made were the right ones," Wilson said. College Football 25 reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hit-5-million-players-in-its-first-week/1100-6525421/" data-ref-id="1100-6525421">5 million players in its first week alone</a>.</p><p>Before this, Wilson spoke about how AI could positively benefit EA's games going forward, even if there is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">human cost to this as well via layoffs and other job displacement.</a></p><p>Wilson said EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">conducted a study across all of its development processe</a>s and found that 60% of development processes have a "high feasibility" of being positively impacted by generative AI. As an example, Wilson said in the past it took six months to develop a stadium in one of its sports games, and now it takes six weeks. In the future, it could take six days, he said.</p><p>EA's ambition, Wilson said, is to use generative AI to make its development processes 30% more efficient. Wilson said EA's development teams are driven by the desire to "get to the fun faster" and release games faster. The aim is to "get to greatness much more quickly," he said.</p><p>Prior to this, Wilson warned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">advances to AI would lead to job losses</a>. Wilson said the "fear of displacement of the workforce" is a legitimate issue as it pertains to AI. He said history has shown that major revolutions like the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution led to "displacement" in the workforce in the near term and then "meaningful increases" in job opportunities down the road. AI could follow a similar trajectory, Wilson said.</p><p>EA is not alone in its admiration for AI. Microsoft is heavily invested in AI and has said AI will be baked into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">every product it makes going forward, including Xbox.</a> Microsoft also implemented <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-undermining-activisions-independence-with-latest-layoffs-ftc-says/1100-6520894/" data-ref-id="1100-6520894">mass layoffs</a> around the same time of pushing further into AI.</p><p>Video game actors and performers are now on strike in part over concerns about AI. Wilson, however, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-ceo-isnt-worried-about-immediate-impact-from-video-game-actors-strike/1100-6525423/" data-ref-id="1100-6525423">not very worried about it. </a></p>
