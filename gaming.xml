						<h5>PlayStation 5 Pro</h5><p><span>November 7th, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>Mid-generation console refreshes are nothing new in the gaming industry. Everything from the pre-market crash Atari 2600 up through just about every Nintendo console to hit the market, console manufacturers have found ways to introduce additional purchases into the lifespan of a console, usually accompanied by a form factor change or addition of new features in the box. The concept of introducing a console that could run all of the very same games but with added performance was something unique to the Sony ecosystem with the PlayStation 4 Pro or Microsoft’s Xbox One X. Companies like Nintendo tried something similar with the New Nintendo 3DS but these introduced games that were exclusive to the upgraded hardware (Xenoblade Chronicles being one of these rare titles). Sony’s PlayStation 5 Pro aims to be the console that can achieve a higher benchmark across all of their titles, but is that boosted flagship console worth the investment if you’re already a next-gen player?<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>What comes in the package is the same usual assortment of parts that Sony has bundled with all of their consoles. To get a deeper look at what's in the package and my powered-off impressions, check out our unboxing article <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-unboxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. One of the first purchases I will be making this weekend will be to get the external disc drive so I can finally check out the latest Prince of Persia and several other titles from my backlog that I own the discs for and couldn't justify double-dipping on a digital version just to play on this particular piece of hardware. I know I will keep banging the same drum here, but I am really disappointed with Sony's answer to the horizontal stand on the PlayStation 5 Pro. It lacks stability, and nothing short of a hardware update could improve that stability, whether it's a third-party stand or purchasing that disc drive. The vertical stand that Sony provided would work for most people, but given how my consoles are set up directly below my wall-mounted television, there isn't space to have the PlayStation 5 Pro stand upright and not block the screen.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>PlayStation 5 Pro owners won't find a secret menu that gives players superuser access to overhaul the appearance and performance of a given game. Instead, Sony's PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) runs behind the scenes at all times. If players didn't have a list of PS5 Pro Enhanced titles or a base model PS5 sitting side by side, there's a good chance that the secret sauce wouldn't even be visible to the player. For some titles, such as Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, which features a Quality mode that runs at 30 FPS, the same mode running on PlayStation 5 Pro is a significant gameplay boost.</p>
<p>Personally, I found the Quality Mode on PS5 to be sluggish and not as responsive when it mattered most. The same game and graphical mode instead ran much closer to 60FPS, the same performance I was getting out of the aptly named Performance Mode. Right out of the box, for players booting up a PlayStation 5 Pro enhanced title, It Just Works™. One option available to players in the Screen and Video menu is the toggle for 8K Output (which, truth be told, I don’t have a capable display in my office and most likely won’t unless Sony does a massive upgrade to their InZone monitor line).<u></u><u></u></p>

<p>Another graphical toggle on the PlayStation 5 Pro is to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-significantly-performance-improvements-game-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhance the image quality for PS4 games</a>. Interestingly, the toggle is disabled when the console is attached to a FullHD display, and the PS5 Pro will advise that this option is only for a display that supports 1440p or 2160p output. This doesn’t seem to be the only way to enhance a last-gen title as I started up Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven to take a peek at the image quality and was quite surprised at how much the console cleaned up and applied anti-aliasing to the character models and environment.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a 100% perfect enhancement as some strange artifacts and image warping appeared while I was focused on a particular character’s idle animation and the way the image would bend and partially distort as hair clashed with their helmet, something I hadn’t seen on the same version running on the base PS5. The fact it took me to stop and focus so intently on a specific character to notice a flaw meant that in action, I didn’t see much issue with the native upscaling in actual practice. I intend to revisit some of the other titles in my collection, Persona 5 Strikers for one, to see how much the aliasing and jagged edges I observed while reviewing that title have been addressed with the native PSSR support.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>I touched upon this during my unboxing, but the PlayStation 5 Pro design feels built for the optional disc drive attachment or the vertical stand, at the very least. The two white stand pieces offer a quick and dirty way to lay your PlayStation 5 Pro down horizontally, but with how much it would wobble, there's stability at play here that hurts the presentation and overall aesthetic of Sony's flagship console. Consider investing in something like Sony's vertical stand or the disc drive that'll permit playing the rest of your disc-based library, both of which will add to the total bill to the point of being in the ballpark of simply buying two PlayStation 5 Slim units.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>It will take some time to dig into and fully appreciate what Sony is bringing to the table with their mid-generation refresh of the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/ps5-pro/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. With nearly 100 <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro Enhanced titles</a>, Sony has already shown a big commitment to proving their $699 console refresh is an initial value, but it will take through next year to see what the barriers of entry will be for every developer to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's unique feature set or the automated PSSR running behind the scenes. Many gamers might balk at the premium price tag of the PlayStation 5 Pro or use it as fuel for the ongoing console wars, but it's important to consider its role in the console ecosystem as more along the lines of an upgrade from the base GeForce RTX series to a SUPER. If you're guilty of upgrading your graphics card for $600 or more to achieve ten or fifteen more FPS in Cyberpunk 2077, you already know the value Sony's bringing to the table with the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p><em>[Editor's Note: Sony provided Wccftech with a PlayStation 5 Pro review unit for editorial purposes.]</em></p>

					
					

<p>Mark Cerny has crafted something amazing with the PlayStation 5 Pro, introducing new AI upscaling and PSSR rendering techniques that will make existing games look their best. Rather than being a new console entirely, Sony is positioning themselves as the graphics card upgrade that players have been asking for for years.</p>

Now, on the verge of the next set Surging Sparks’ release, it’s a good moment to look at which Stellar Crown cards are getting the most love.</p><p>Things started going odd for the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> in January 2024, with Paldean Fates. This special set contained a ridiculous 88 baby shinies, and while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paldean-fates-pokemon-tcg-pull-rates-1851196505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paldean-fates-pokemon-tcg-pull-rates-1851196505">pull-rates felt amazing</a></span>, the sheer volume of cards made it utterly impossible to collect. This was followed by Temporal Forces and Twilight Masquerade, two sets with almost identical card numbers and pull rates, both with a galling one-in-five chance of receiving a secret rare or better. (Even bland ex cards were only appearing in one out of every six packs!) While this appears to be the new norm <em>Pokémon TCG</em> in the Scarlet &amp; Violet era (and looks set to continue with November’s Surging Sparks), it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-value-crown-zenith-paldea-evolved-1850552711&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-value-crown-zenith-paldea-evolved-1850552711">still hard not to hark back to the joy of sets like Crown Zenith</a></span>, and wish for better.</p><p>So it was even more galling when August’s “special” set, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-shrouded-fable-pull-rate-1851611684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-shrouded-fable-pull-rate-1851611684">Shrouded Fable, then bemused everyone</a></span> by featuring the lowest number of cards since the desultory <em>Pokémon Go </em>set in 2022, <em>and</em> making the good ones nightmarishly hard to find. Boy, did everyone get a lot of the same bulk.</p><p>So then came September’s Stellar Crown, and while the pull rates still sat at a sulk-inducing 20 percent, it sat at a sweet spot for size. A Goldilocks set, if you will. With a total of 175 cards, rather than the 220+ that had become the norm (and be warned, Surging Sparks has a deranged 252, with an eye-watering 191 of them before the secret rares start), it feels manageable, collectible, and most importantly, is packed with completely gorgeous cards.</p><p>Here are the cards fetching the highest prices, whether for the meta, or just because they’re so very pretty. (All prices are correct at the time of writing, but obviously are subject to rapid change.)</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1cfb7b1658787c256b3bd9ba4317c87a" data-recommend-id="image://1cfb7b1658787c256b3bd9ba4317c87a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Area Zero Underdepths Gold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Area Zero Underdepths Gold." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1cfb7b1658787c256b3bd9ba4317c87a" data-recommend-id="image://1cfb7b1658787c256b3bd9ba4317c87a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Area Zero Underdepths Gold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s been a long while since a gold card has troubled anyone’s wallets, let alone a Stadium card. However, it also represents something of a drop-off in prices, currently selling for just shy of <strong>$16</strong>.</p><p>Tera Pokémon are obviously a big part of the meta right now, so a Stadium card that lets you load your bench with <em>eight</em> cards when you have one in play is a huge deal. Especially if it’s used in tandem with an attack that’s boosted by the numbers on the bench (click next!).</p><p>However, this does also seem to mark <em>some</em> sort of return for gold cards, given that just behind it in value is the gold Bravery Charm at $11, and indeed the card you’ll see next.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="20fc7693cc34977e8ef28f6339f7c72f" data-recommend-id="image://20fc7693cc34977e8ef28f6339f7c72f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Terapagos ex Gold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Terapagos ex Gold." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20fc7693cc34977e8ef28f6339f7c72f" data-recommend-id="image://20fc7693cc34977e8ef28f6339f7c72f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Terapagos ex Gold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There was a time when gold cards were heartily sought after, but by the end of the Sword &amp; Shield era, people were just rather fed up. That was usually because the art was always so muted, compared to other versions in a set, and that the market was saturated. However, this year the three-star rarity seems to have gained a bit more traction again, and this card’s fetching almost <strong>$22</strong>, two months after release.</p><p>This is then boosted by Terapagos’s arrival in the TCG via Stellar Crown, and this card’s wild power when combined with that Area Zero Underdepths Stadium. 30 damage per card on your bench, with a possible eight cards total, means a whopping 240 attack just for two Energy. It’s a card so powerful it adds the caveat that you can’t use it on your turn in the first round.</p><p>But then it goes even further, offering a 180 attack with a follow-up that Basic Pokémon can’t damage it in the next turn, albeit for the tricky requirement of a Grass, Water <em>and</em> Lightning energy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-recommend-id="image://aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Briar Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Briar Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-recommend-id="image://aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Briar Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I guess put this down to the ol’ <em>PTCG </em>tradition of any card with a full-art female character fetching bigger prices.</p><p>Sure, it’s an interesting Trainer, letting you take an extra Prize Card under extremely specific circumstances, but you know.

Spinarak is my OG fave spidey-type, obviously, but Garvantula just looks so cuddly!</p><p>Anyway, this serious analysis aside, this SIR for the Garvantula ex is a really special piece of art, that embraces the color palette of the Tera types, and develops it into something stunning.</p><p>It’s also stupidly powerful. If you’re facing another ex (or V), this does 220 damage for two Energy, and no consequence or cost! Then get another of those multi-Energy mixes and you can deliver 180 damage, although this time you lose all three Energy, but also stop your opponent using an Item card.</p><p>It’s so pretty, and I have to stop myself spending <strong>$26</strong> to get one.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a37b6e5f0c710350e71759d788bee98" data-recommend-id="image://8a37b6e5f0c710350e71759d788bee98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dachsbun ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dachsbun ex Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a37b6e5f0c710350e71759d788bee98" data-recommend-id="image://8a37b6e5f0c710350e71759d788bee98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dachsbun ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I have very strong feelings about Pokémon made out of food.

By the TCG’s own ranking, this is only considered a single-star rarity, a card that should be showing up more frequently than the SIRs below it on the list. Yet here it is, in third place, with an asking price of <strong>$40</strong> for a small piece of cardboard.</p><p>It certainly helps that Orca’s art is utterly stunning, yet another example of how it’s inexplicable madness that The Pokémon Company doesn’t sell poster-sized versions of these art works in its stores. I’d put this on the wall in an instant.</p><p>As a card for your deck, it’s nothing special. It’s nice that it adds a 20HP heal to its 20 attack, but that comes at the cost of needing two Energy for a Basic card with such low damage. But honestly, play this and your opponent will be so distracted, craning their neck to get a better look at it, that you’ll put them right off their strategy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6bfcefe83bd9791182851edfa88a72bc" data-recommend-id="image://6bfcefe83bd9791182851edfa88a72bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squirtle Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squirtle Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6bfcefe83bd9791182851edfa88a72bc" data-recommend-id="image://6bfcefe83bd9791182851edfa88a72bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squirtle Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Poor Bulbasaur, always in third place, behind Squirtle and the all-conquering Charmander.

That’s taking nothing away from artist Saborteri, because this too is gorgeous.</p><p>It’s not often you see two different attacks on a Basic card like Squirtle, so that one-Energy 50:50 chance of preventing damage is a useful device if you’re forced to start this in your Active Spot, before being able to evolve. Or for a silly two Energy, you can do a measly 20 damage.</p><p>It’s ahead of Bulbasaur by four bucks, currently going for <strong>$44</strong>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f146493c6f0b8e3f9f41213068004414" data-recommend-id="image://f146493c6f0b8e3f9f41213068004414" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Terapagos ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Terapagos ex Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f146493c6f0b8e3f9f41213068004414" data-recommend-id="image://f146493c6f0b8e3f9f41213068004414" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Terapagos ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Woah.</p><p>This is a card of such exceptional detail that it comes close to rivaling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Giratina_V_(Lost_Origin_130)#/media/File:GiratinaVLostOrigin186.jpg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Giratina_V_(Lost_Origin_130)#/media/File:GiratinaVLostOrigin186.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lost Origin’s Giratina V SR</a></span>! (Which, by the way, has seen a recent revival, currently going for $400 or more.) This is a more subtle affair, though, and I think tempered by its rather twee pastel vibes, but that’s not holding it back much. This card is still, two months on, fetching over <strong>$94</strong>.</p><p>Make sure to enlarge that image above to appreciate the incredible effort from artist Saboteri (yup, the same person responsible for the Squirtle!).</p><p>That price is a fair chunk down from its initial high of $150, and part of a more gradual decline following its initial plunge to $115. Will it level out, or continue dropping? I sort of suspect the latter, and imagine this’ll find its base at around $60. Cards of this much artistic complexity tend to keep more value, but it’s hard to argue that Terapagos has gained some sort of mass fan adoration in the way Giratina can claim. It is, after all, a hairy turtle.</p><p>In play, this card is exactly the same as the gold version at the start of this list, as indeed is the $8 Double Rare version. Although, given its popularity in the meta, you won’t find it cheaper than that for the moment.</p><p>Still, at more than double anything else in the set, this is clearly the card to pull from Stellar Crown. Get it graded at a PSA 10 and that price goes up to $334.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-creator-says-its-time-for-aaa-studios-to-move-away-from-safe-bets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The 15-person team behind Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-team-put-on-redundancy-notice-amid-funding-struggles"><u>recently put on notice</u></a>, following struggles to find funding for their next project. But Surgent Studios isn’t shutting down, its staff aren’t gone forever, and it’s not asleep at the wheel, according to its founder, Abubakar Salim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They are, he says, “literally raring” to go the second money comes in, like a “cocked gun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We still have so much more to say and so much more to build on,” Salim tells IGN. “And the audiences that we've already started to build as well, and the players and the people who want to champion us, they want to hear more…We are ready. We're so ready. It is just about taking that leap of faith with us.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Leap of Faith</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So what’s the leap of faith? It’s called Project Uso, and it’s a single-player, isometric, Afro-gothic action RPG. You play as a vampiric android containing the spirit of Eshu, the Yoruba god of chaos. As Salim explains, the idea is to explore the idea of two minds in one body through the mechanics of tabletop RPGs. But rather than rolling against a dungeon master, in Project Uso, the player sometimes must roll against themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Uso is about the concept of identity, with Uso meaning “face” in Swahili. It’s inspired by Salim’s exploration of his own dual nature in the wake of his daughter’s birth. While ZAU was about who he is <em>without</em> a parent, Salim says that Uso is about asking who he is <em>as</em> a parent.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project Uso Early Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a parent, I always used to find myself being like, I love my daughter, cleaning her dirty nappy. I also want to go see my mates to the cinema, go outside with my mates or whatever. You know what I mean? There's a battle of freedoms here. And there's that sense of, do I do this or do I do that? Or even when I'm talking to my daughter and I'm making choices, how do I make sure that she listens to me? Am I strict or am I soft? You are having this battle within you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salim is candid that he’s relatively new to game development. Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was the first game he’s made, having come into the industry from acting. He’s best known in gaming spaces as Bayek in Assassin’s Creed: Origins, and has held a number of other gaming roles since then in addition to his numerous film and TV acting credits (including the most recent season of House of the Dragon). But the last four years of working on ZAU have been a learning experience for him, particularly in how games are typically funded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I've learned is that mainly when you get funding for a game, that funding is really there to get you to launch and maybe just a bit more after,” he says. “Maybe. And you are supposed to have your next project turned up and done and signed either before you've even launched the first game or maybe just afterwards. That gap in between is frightening because you can see that coming like a train.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The way that you entice people to go to somewhere different and somewhere new is by doing something different or something new.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this, he explains. While gaming companies briefly poured funding into new projects, there’s been an industry-wide wake-up call in the last two years resultings in mass layoffs, financial struggles, and funding drying up. As a result, Salim explains that companies have become far more cautious in the bets they’re willing to make on new games. That includes EA, whose EA Originals label published Tales of Kenzera: ZAU but which hasn’t picked up Salim’s next project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salim says he understands, but doesn’t agree that it’s the best strategy. On the contrary, he thinks now is the time for companies to take risks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why would I, as a player of Call of Duty or as Fortnite, want to leave that to go to something new when I've already established myself in this space?” he says. “I totally understand that. It's like going to your favorite cafe or going to your favorite restaurant. The way that you entice people to go to somewhere different and somewhere new is by doing something different or something new, by being bold, by being creative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think a great example of this is Animal Well. You look at Animal Well and it's completely unexpected. You didn't know what you were getting into. And that was a risk that was taken by a YouTuber. I think we need to see more of that from people in positions of power and in positions of stability.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bouncing Back</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Surgent Studios and Salim have had a rough time finding funding for Project Uso, but there’s been another layer to their struggles: harassment. Tales of Kenzera: ZAU has found itself the target of ongoing, racist attacks online, largely targeting the game for its Black protagonist and its Bantu inspirations. But none of this has discouraged Salim from pitching Project Uso. On the contrary, he’s of the belief that it’s important to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-director-addresses-constant-targeted-harassment-lowers-price-of-game-on-switch"><u>address such attacks directly</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think that the anti-diversity, equity, inclusion sort of movement, it's about not having the right information,” he says. “I think we are seeing a lot of gaps being filled with conspiracy theories, like ticking boxes and all this sort of stuff, which isn't actually true when you look into it. And that dialogue needs to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salim acknowledges that directly speaking with harassers can be dangerous, and isn’t for everyone. Both parties, he says, have to come to the discussion in good faith, and harassers often don’t. But he believes such engagement can change hearts and minds, and is worth doing for those able. And on a higher level, he adds, companies have a responsibility to take even firmer action against harassment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is definitely a fear of having a stance, I feel, when it comes to businesses. They kind of want to be neutral, which again, totally understand. But there is a level where it goes a bit too far…We're in a time right now where someone can post a YouTube video and say my garb is like a Rafiki outfit and call my studio Spear-Chucker Studios, and I don't know whether there's going to be repercussions or not. I have to call them out on it. And it's like, come on. It should be down to the [company], be it YouTube, or be it Twitch, or be it even Valve, for example, to be like, ‘Yeah, that's not cool. Get out.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Surgent Studios is currently in a holding pattern with Project Uso, Salim has faith that the industry will bounce back from its rough patch, and he’ll bounce back with them. He believes that while video games are both art and business, they are art first and foremost, and “the arts always survive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The beauty though, about games, I feel, is that the conversation and dialogue is a lot more open,” he says. “And so I feel that bouncing back can happen sooner and bolder and more brilliant than any other art form. And that's what gets me, that's what inspires me. That's what kind of drives me to continue going on even after everything that's happened. Because it's a beautiful space to be in. It really is. And don't get me wrong, the amount of times I've wanted to be like, ‘I should just stay as an actor, man. I'm in a big TV show. I should just be really comfortable here and just doing my thing here.’ But there is something inside me that just says, ‘Nah, man, I wouldn't be happy. That's just not enough.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-finally-suspends-boba-fett-leader-basically-because-it-was-completely-broken<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Stick that in your bacta tank.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fantasy Flight Games has finally suspended the Boba Fett, Collecting the Bounty leader from the Star Wars Unlimited trading card game, basically because it was completely broken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boba Fett is no longer a legal card to use in the leading Star Wars Unlimited format, Premier, as of tomorrow, November 8. It can't be used in Competitive or Casual organized play events, though will still appear in Twin Suns, Draft, and Sealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suspension comes exactly eight months after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-star-wars-unlimited-release-date">Star Wars Unlimited was released</a>, as Boba Fett debuted in the original set Sparks of Hope. Lead game designer Danny Schaefer said in a lengthy <a href="https://starwarsunlimited.com/articles/a-leader-suspended" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> that "the dominance of Boba Fett" is now "too much to ignore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaders are the main piece Star Wars Unlimited players build their decks around and Boba Fett was almost immediately discovered to be incredibly overpowered, a poor advertisement for a trading card game in just its first set.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The dominance of Boba Fett is too much to ignore.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fantasy Flight Games endured through a secondary set release but Boba Fett's dominance continued, representing 40% of Top 8 decks at the Planetary Qualifiers and a staggering 55% of winners. This comes in a game which has 32 total leaders (before the third set adds another 18 tomorrow), meaning Boba Fett should represent just 3% or 4% of the winners if everything was balanced well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boba Fett was banned altogether because it's "clean and easy to understand; it’s timely, in that we can take immediate action when problems arise; and it’s precise, allowing us to target only the most problematic cards without collateral damage elsewhere," Schaefer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He called the card "the most severe power level outlier" and said a ban of supporting cards instead wouldn't work becasue Boba Fett is powerful enough to dominate with their replacements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Unlimited players quickly noticed the huge power disparity in Boba Fett. Like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, and several other trading card games, Star Wars Unlimited relies on mana generation and management.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means players slowly amass an increasingly large pool of mana over the course of the game, using it to play more and more powerful cards. Any card that can generate extra mana or recover used mana is therefore incredibly powerful, and Boba Fett did just that.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/07/boba-1730998151694.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all though, as Boba Fett could be deployed with just five mana himself despite having high stats more equitable to a leader that deployed at six resources. Boba Fett is also the only hero to have multiple support cards designed to work with it specifically, with cards such as Fire Spray and Boba Fett's armor boosting it even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Unlimited players will therefore have mixed feelings about its banning. Many, if not most, competitive players will have lost their main deck, but many others will be relieved the meta will balance out a touch by Boba Fett's banning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The competitive scene will also enjoy a boost through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-tcgs-twilight-of-the-republic-decks-spotlight-ahsoka-and-general-grievous">the release of the aforementioned third set, Twilight of the Republic</a>, which brings new heroes such as Ahsoka from The Clone Wars and General Grievous from Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-card-game-review">In our 7/10 review of the base game</a>, IGN said: "Star Wars Unlimited delivers a solid core game, with plenty of opportunities to look at deck building strategy and in-game tactics."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Games, with Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure sparking a $200 million hit to revenue, and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business">Smash Bros.-style brawler MultiVersus flopping to the tune of $100 million</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a total writedown of over $300 million in Warner Bros.’ games business so far in 2024, and it doesn’t look like the company has a game coming out any time soon that will reverse the trend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s the plan? During a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, the company plans to double down on just four titles, and significantly reduce the number of video games it releases in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those games are Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC “in particular Batman,” Zaslav added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Batman: Arkham Shadow Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re through some of the worst — and it hasn't been pretty on the gaming business — but we have four games that are really powerful and have a real constituency that love them, and we’re going to focus on those four primarily,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re going to go away from trying to launch 10, 12, 15, 20 different games. I think we have a real chance now with focus to have the gaming business be steadier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have four strong and profitable game franchises with loyal, global fans: Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC in particular Batman. We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious highlight there is Batman. Controversial live service looter shooter Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure was in part due to it not being yet another single-player Batman Arkham game, which developer Rocksteady is best-known for. Warner Bros. Games just released a VR-exclusive Batman Arkham game. Could Rocksteady now be set to return to Batman after Suicide Squad’s struggles?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> reported that staff at Rocksteady were currently working on a director’s cut of the phenomenally successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><u>Hogwarts Legacy</u></a>, while leadership pitches a return to single-player following its live service misstep. Could that pitch have involved Batman, and been successful?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be some time before we find out. In the shorter term, Warner Bros. has confirmed development on a Hogwarts Legacy sequel and it has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetherRealm’s Mortal Kombat 1 released in September last year, and fans are wondering what it’s up to next. In September, NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">the studio had decided on its next game three years ago</a>, but insisted it was “still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.” Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor owner and publisher Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Unlike other animals, they are easily spooked by your presence and will run away if they see you coming too aggressively. As such, this can make taming a cat a tricky endeavor. However, as long as you follow the steps below, you'll have a tamed cat in no time:</p><ul><li>First, you need to find a cat, which most commonly spawn in villages. Once you find a cat, approach them extremely carefully. Any sudden movements and the cat will run away. You also want to ensure you're crouching.</li><li>While you're approaching the cat slowly, have a raw cod or raw salmon in your hand. This makes the cat less likely to run away.</li><li>After you're close enough to the cat, feed the raw cod or salmon to it. This will successfully tame the cat, making them follow you around.</li><li>You can feed the cat another raw cod or raw salmon to make them enter love mode.

As you might expect, you can find a majority of the frogs in Minecraft in the swamp biomes.

A frog will follow a player holding a slimeball when they are six blocks or closer.</li><li>Find two frogs, get them to follow you while holding a slimeball, and then feed each frog a slimeball.</li><li>This causes the frogs to enter love mode and eventually, one of the frogs will become pregnant.</li><li>The pregnant frog then looks for a water source with air above it.

The process is similar to the breeding of frogs, but turtles can take much longer to lay their eggs.</p><ul><li>To breed turtles, find a beach during the day. You can usually find turtles swimming near the coast.</li><li>When you find two turtles, feed each of them some seagrass. This causes them to enter love mode.</li><li>One of the turtles in love mode will spawn eggs in its inventory and slightly grow in size.</li><li>After the eggs appear in the turtle's inventory, they will go back to where they first spawned.</li><li>The turtle tries to find a patch of sand to lay its eggs. You'll know the turtle has found their spot when they start rotating 360 degrees.</li><li>After a while, the turtle will lay anywhere from one to four eggs.</li><li>Turtle eggs take four to five in-game days to hatch in Minecraft.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375264" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375264"></a><figcaption>A turtle with its eggs in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png"></figure><p>The turtle breeding process will take some time, but after it's all said and done, you'll be left with one to four baby turtles.</p><h2 id="How_to_tame_a_Parrot_in_Minecraft">How to tame a Parrot in Minecraft</h2><p>Parrots are rare animals to find in Minecraft, but luckily, they can be tamed rather easily. This means once you find one parrot, you won't be able to get rid of them after the taming process is complete.</p><ul><li>Parrots most commonly spawn in jungle biomes. Once you find one, you can tame them by feeding them any of the following seeds:  <ul><li>Wheat seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, beetroot seeds, torchflower seeds.</li></ul></li><li>This doesn't guarantee you tame the parrot, however.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-darktide-crashes-onto-playstation-5-in-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Two years after its PC launch and a little over a year since its arrival on Xbox Series X/S, co-op-focused first-person action shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> finally has a PlayStation 5 release date, and is set to be available from 3rd December.
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is the work of developer Fatshark, the team behind the acclaimed Warhammer: Vermintide series. It's described as a "spritual successor" to those earlier games, and while it has a similar focus on four-player co-op action, it trades the brutal melee combat of its predecessors for meaty gunplay.
</p>
<p>
"In the depths of the hive," Fatshark explains, "the seeds of corruption threaten to turn into an overwhelming tide of darkness. A mysterious and sinister new force is seeking to take control of the entire city. It is up to you and your allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos. As Tertium falls, Rejects Will Rise."

<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell liked Darktide a lot when it launched for PC back in 2022, celebrating its "stupendous atmosphere and vicious action" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-darktide-review-a-horde-of-minor-flaws-can-be-overcome-by-faith">his Recommended review</a>, despite some niggling launch issues. "This great hive of action lives by its vampiric atmosphere," he wrote, "its booming, eviscerating, and just apocalyptically scaled take on grimdark violence. That, and by the grace of the Emperor's mercy."
</p><p>
Warhammer 40,000: Darktide will <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP4122-PPSA21255_00-0888672453602469/">cost £32.99 via the PlayStation Store</a> when it launches on 3rd December, and there's 10 percent off for PlayStation Plus subscribers, bringing the price down to £29.69. Additionally, anyone that pre-orders can start playing six days early.

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket looks to be another profitable venture for The Pokémon Company, and as this journey is just starting, we’re breaking down everything we know about the next Pokémon Pocket expansion, and rounding up all the latest leaks and rumors.</p>



<p>The launch period for Pokémon TCG Pocket was a success, earning an impressive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-earned-over-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$12 million in its first four days</a>. The community hoarded the Shop’s Poké Gold supplies and splashed out to pull the rarest cards and complete their collection. Pokémon TCG Pocket’s debut set is only the beginning though, with many generations of Pokémon cards still to come.</p>



<p>That being said, leaks and datamines have revealed information on the future of Pokémon TCG Pocket, and if you’re a fan (like me), the future looks very fun if true.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-what-the-next-pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-is">Do we Know What the Next Pokémon TCG Pocket Expansion is?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We always want new cards. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neither The Pokémon Company nor leakers and dataminers have been able to pinpoint exact details on the next major expansion for Pokémon TCG Pocket. However, an extensive leak has revealed Season One—AKA the Genetic Apex Set—reportedly ends on <strong>Jan. 29, 2025</strong>. If this report is true, <strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s next expansion is likely gearing up for Season Two at the end of Jan. 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The set doesn’t have a name, and we haven’t seen any cards revealed, but translated leaks have hit the internet pulling back the curtain on plans and new incoming features.</p>



<p><strong>A</strong> <strong>mini-spoiler warning in case you don’t want to know what’s coming!</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-leaked-pokemon-tcg-pocket-season-2-details-amp-rumors">Leaked Pokémon TCG Pocket Season 2 details &amp; rumors</h2>



<p>The datamined Pokémon TCG Pocket Season Two information comes courtesy of a translated Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gd737a/translated_leaks_on_new_updates_spoilers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit post</a>—via the original <a href="https://www.pocketscroll.it/pokemon-pocket-un-leak-svela-i-dettagli-sui-prossimi-aggiornamenti-eventi-e-set-di-carte/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Scroll</a> source—which says, “<strong>January 29, 2025:&nbsp;Set A2&nbsp;will be released, a new complete set similar in scope to&nbsp;Genetic Apex&nbsp;that contains 226 cards.</strong>“</p>



<p>It also claims the new expansion set has tons of “new cards” and carries on Season One’s content strategy of releasing special promo cards throughout the season “released approximately six weeks after each main set.”</p>



<p>The leaked Pokémon TCG Pocket roadmap also hints at a bunch of new items and gameplay features arriving too:</p>



<ul>
<li>New types of Tickets.</li>



<li>Rainbow Rarity Cards—likely to be as rare as Crown cards.</li>



<li>New <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-flair-in-pokemon-pocket-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair designs</a>.</li>



<li>New Fishing Mode (akin to Wonder Picks) with a chance for free, daily items and goodies.</li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, take this all with a grain of salt, but the subreddit post’s claims and information have proven 100% accurate so far. Both developer and publisher can always have a change of heart, and plans can be altered for Pokémon TCG Pocket—so stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stakeout-24-7-playlist-live/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-getting-stakeout-24-7-playlist-tomorrow.1030029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stakeout-24-7-playlist-live/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Camo grinders, rejoice! Treyarch has announced that Black Ops 6 is getting a Stakeout 24/7 rotation from tomorrow at 10 am PT (6 pm GMT). This tiny, intense map has been a fan favourite since Black Ops 6 was released on October 25, particularly amongst those grinding to rapidly unlock attachments and camos for their weapons on the way to Dark Matter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-to-stakeout">Prepare to Stakeout</h2>



<p>Stakeout is a small but mighty map that is equal parts lucrative and frantic. It gives the likes of Shipment a run for its money in terms of balls-to-the-wall chaos, and it has been the source of many energetic Black Ops 6 that have made it to social media in recent days showcasing insane kill feeds.</p>



<p>Treyarch just announced a Stakeout 24/7 playlist, which will behave similarly to the ongoing Nuketown 24/7 rotation:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1854569718344302671
</p></figure>







<p>Aside from the fact it’s small and great for the camo grind, Stakeout is pretty ass. It’s a tactical nightmare that offers no mercy to users, and it’s relentless – from the moment your match starts, you’ll be under fire. There is nowhere to hide on this minuscule map, which is little bigger than a couple of apartments glued together.</p>



<p>It’s also super easy to fall out of the map, so be on the lookout for that.</p>



<p>It’s a super map for grinding camos on melee weapons and small-form weapons like handguns and micro-SMGs, though, so that’s a saving grace. If you’ve got something like the baseball bat outstanding on your path to Dark Matter, this is where you’ll tick those boxes.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Stakeout 24/7? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>In a dev update released by Stunlock Studios, fans of V Rising were given a preview of what's to come in V Rising. The next update, V Rising Version 1.1, is slated for 2025 and is set to be a pretty expansive update, as it plans to add new features, bosses, and a new PvP arena feature. V Rising had been in Early Access for quite some time and only just recently experienced its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/v-rising-bloody-yet-fun-survival/">full release in May</a>, with the game shortly being released on PlayStation 5 in June. Now, Stunlock Studios has released a <a href="https://blog.stunlock.com/dev-update-27-whispers-of-darkness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a> that discusses what they've been working on since the full launch of the game, which includes some hefty new features, as well as plenty of bug fixes for both console and PC.</p>
<p>According to the blog post, they've received plenty of positive feedback on the progression thus far, and the developers go on to say: "There are always minor issues we could spend endless hours refining. We'd rather focus on the results of something we first experimented with in the Secrets of Gloomrot patch and expanded upon in the 1.0 update." One of their main focuses is random drops. They were initially added to provide an extra layer of excitement for the players and to create unique moments for each player and every save that a person may have.</p>
<p>To combat some of the disappointment that players felt when they knew what item they needed to improve their build, Stunlock Studios have now added a new feature called the Fusion Forge, which allows you to craft items by combining different items to be able to take the best part of them to equip.</p>
<p>Additionally, they've now added consequence-free PvP. Previously, engaging in PvP would have consequences, including a loss of resources, which could prove to be quite bothersome. Now, they have added Dueling, which allows you to fight against other Vampires. Once the match is complete, health is reset to where it was before the match began so that there are no lasting consequences from the fight you may have had with the opposing Vamp.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your very own Arena using an Arena Station, a structure that you can place within your castle to create the boundaries of the arena, with players allowing themselves to assign to different teams via flags, as well as fighting it out in duels and team fights.</p>
<p>So far, this update is shaping up to be quite expansive, as it is also expanding on the existing area of the game and taking players to a brand new mysterious zone that the developers have not yet given away the name for.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up V Rising for this upcoming update?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-flop-cost-warner-bros-100m-contributing-to-disastrous-year.1029999/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. has admitted that platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>was a flop, adding yet more to the losses the company has sustained in what is becoming a disastrous year for its interactive branch.</p>

<p>In a recent earnings call (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN</a>), Warner Bros. CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>contributed to "another $100 million plus impairment" due to its underperformance, meaning WB's overall gaming writedown on a year-to-date basis is over $300 million.</p>

<p>If you're wondering where the other $200 million of that writedown came from, it was contributed by February's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>massively underperforming</a>.&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>isn't quite on the same catastrophic level, but that's two live-service experiments that appear to have failed for WB this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/multiversus-flop-100m-shaggy-superman.jpg?itok=wbYCOpfC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/multiversus-flop-100m-shaggy-superman.jpg?itok=qKXOCSkQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>hasn't performed as Warner Bros. would have liked.</figcaption></figure><p>Warner Bros. will no doubt be disappointed with&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' failure to perform, especially given that the company believed in the game so much that it&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-creator-bought-by-warner-bros-discovery">purchased developer Player First Games back in July</a>.</p>

<p>After being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-open-beta-will-close-in-june-full-release-coming-in-early-2024">taken offline last year</a> following a lengthy open beta period,&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-release-date-full">released in full</a> as a free-to-play fighting game earlier this year. Its character roster includes the likes of&nbsp;<em>Scooby-Doo!</em>'s Shaggy, DC's Superman and Batman, and&nbsp;<em>Adventure Time</em>'s Jake and Finn, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-jason-agent-smith">other familiar faces</a>.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a>&nbsp;might give a good indication as to the scale of the game's failure; it's currently got just 1,121 players (at time of writing), with a 24-hour peak of 1,741. That's compared to its all-time peak of over 150,000 when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-beta-and-new-characters-announced">launched in open beta in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Despite its disappointment in&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, WB has a plan. Per the earnings call, it's focusing on four core franchises:&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>,&nbsp;the DC universe,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m">a sequel</a> and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">Director's Cut</a> apparently already in the pipeline for the latter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-student-troll-warner-bros.jpg?itok=vobqEvr7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-student-troll-warner-bros.jpg?itok=J-saNM7O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. is committing to its more successful franchises in the wake of&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' failure.</figcaption></figure><p>According to CEO David Zaslav, Warner Bros. is not just committing to DC, but "in particular Batman", so we may well be about to see a lot more&nbsp;<em>Batman&nbsp;</em>games arriving.</p>

<p>Hey, who knows? Perhaps the single-player game on which Rocksteady is apparently working is a new&nbsp;<em>Batman&nbsp;</em>game. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your movie preferences), we do, however, know that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/james-gunn-the-batman-rumors">won't be a game based on the 2022 movie&nbsp;<em>The Batman</em></a>.</p>

            <p>Life simulation game Inzoi will launch on PC via Steam early access on 28th March 2025, publishers Krafton have announced. Billed as a potential <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">Sims 4</a> usurper, and equipped with syrupy Unreal Engine 5 visuals, it was originally slated for launch this year.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzoi-begins-its-fight-for-the-sims-crown-with-a-time-limited-character-creator-trial-on-august-20th">released a free character editor of the game in August</a>. Graham was somewhat taken by it, though he was more taken by the prospect of driveable cars, an editable city, and planned mod support at launch. As for me, I quite like the bustling downtown areas and ferris wheels visible on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Posting on Discord (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/inzoi-launches-in-early-access-on-march-28-2025">Gematsu</a>), producer and director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim justified the delay with hokey reference to human biology. "It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings," he wrote. "The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZOI - a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth." </p>
<p>I wonder if clinical physicians ever tell anxious new parents not to worry about kids being slow learners because after all, it is said that among video games, raising an early access project to 1.0 status takes the longest time because developers must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. And really, when you think about it, the extra love and care that is required to properly nurture an early access game is how you should see your journey with little Timmy here, who has just shoved an entire Barbie doll up his nose.</p><p>"This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving inZOI a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible," Kim went on. "Until the release date, we'll continue to improve areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for years to come."</p>
<p>Well, can't make fun of that part, I guess. And I do wish Inzoi the best of luck taking on the Sims, nowadays <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">a Sims Universe</a> - hopefully, it'll fare better than Paradox's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">Life By You</a>. Though I have to say, I find it rather creepy that every Inzoi character I've seen looks like a catwalk model.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Six Days in Fallujah has been turning heads in the tactical shooter space since it was released in early access more than a year ago. The game’s developer, Victura, aims to educate as much as it does entertain, and that’s what the Command and Control update is all about.</p>



<p>This major update is available to download and explore now, and at the heart of the patch is the game’s first attempt at a solo mode. This single-player portion is made playable alongside an AI fireteam, and at Gamescom in August, I got to see first-hand how intelligent those AI soldiers can be.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-documentary-video-game">‘A Documentary Video Game’</h2>



<p>Victura has claimed that Six Days in Fallujah is the ‘world’s first documentary video game’, fusing gameplay with real-world footage and interviews with Iraqi and American soldiers who were on the ground in Fallujah in 2004. </p>



<p>I saw some of this content at Gamescom, and Victura hasn’t sugarcoated anything – it’s <strong>harrowing</strong>.</p>



<p>Today’s Command and Control update boasts countless improvements and new features, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>First ‘Documentary’ story missions</li>



<li>Advanced fireteam AI system</li>



<li>‘HLZ Wolf’ procedural mission</li>



<li>Graphics overhaul</li>



<li>300 technical enhancements</li>
</ul>



<p>Six Days in Fallujah is a unique shooter in many ways. For instance, it boasts a procedural architecture system that ensures you’re never playing the same map twice. It becomes impossible to predict what’s next in Six Days, and that’s exactly the kind of concept and emotion that Victura was aiming for.</p>



<p>This latest update is impressive, though. From better utilising NVIDIA’s RTX GI technology to implementing engines to simulate real weather and lightning effects, the visual palette for Six Days has been improved immensely. </p>



<p>Are you going to jump into Six Days in Fallujah’s most sizeable update since it hit the open market? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The last year-plus for Warner Bros. Games hasn’t been the best for the company, and Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav admits that. During the company’s <a href="https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/investor-relations/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earnings call</a> on November 7, Zaslav said that the games business is “substantially underperforming its potential”.</p>



<p>This comes after financial disappointments such as MultiVersus and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League lost the studio more than $300 million this year alone. Now, Warner Bros. Games is going to put more emphasis on its most successful franchises moving forward.</p>



<p>“I think we’re through some of the worst — and it hasn’t been pretty —  on the gaming business,” Zaslav said during the call. “But we have four games that are really powerful and have a real constituency that love them, and we’re going to focus on those four primarily. We’re going to go away from trying to launch 10, 12, 15, 20 different games. I think we have a real chance now with focus to have the gaming business be steadier.</p>



<p>He added: “We have four strong and profitable game franchises with loyal, global fans: Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, in particular, Batman. We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio.”</p>







<p>Warner Bros. Games is already working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitive edition of Hogwarts Legacy</a> that Insider Gaming exclusively reported on in October. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel to the game</a> is also in production. </p>



<p>With Mortal Kombat, the company continues to see character additions for the game with the latest being the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-ghostface-gameplay-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming launch of Ghostface</a> on November 26.</p>



<p>On the Batman side, it’s been quite from the company overall since Suicide Squad. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors recently began to circulate</a> that Rocksteady could be working on a new Batman game.</p>



<p>Not mentioned on the call but still in development is the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-latest-claims-about-monoliths-wonder-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman</a> game from Monolith.</p>



<p>What do you think of Warner Bros. Games putting the focus on a few key franchises rather than multiple titles? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

The Ryzen 5 CPU is a mid-range processor, whereas the GPU and RAM are entry-level components best suited for less graphically intensive games. Many indie games and older AAA titles should work just fine, but don't expect great performance with newer AAA hits like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. We mention Black Ops specifically, because it's featured in the product images for this laptop.</p><p dir="ltr">We've seen similar HP Victus gaming laptops go on sale for around $500-$550 during big sales events like Prime Day, but it's very rare to see an entry-level gaming laptop for <em>this </em>low of a price.</p><p dir="ltr">This HP Victus gaming laptop discount is not the only early Black Friday Door Buster deal.

                <p>Starting today, Hello Games is rolling out cross-save compatibility to a select number of No Man's Sky players. While not everyone will have access immediately, all players can now link their different accounts on the No Man's Sky <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cross-save website</a>. Hello Games says that all players will be able to do the same in "the coming weeks."</p><p>It's a pretty straightforward process to get started. Players simply sign in to a platform account--PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, GOG, with Nintendo Switch Online coming soon--using the links provided and follow the instructions to connect any accounts they have on other devices. Then simply launch No Man's Sky on one of the connected platforms. It should be noted that the players' most recent save will automatically be uploaded to the server, and made available for download on your other connected platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBlz6kcdAS0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XBlz6kcdAS0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players only need to connect a single account, this allows the ability to transfer saves between a PS4 and a PS5, for example, if you're logged into the same PSN account. The feature only allows for five cross-saves.</p><p>The update also sees Mass Effect's iconic Normandy ship coinciding with the launch of N7 Day, which celebrates the Mass Effect series. A new limited-time expedition starts today, with the chance to add the cruiser to your fleet if you can complete it in time. This event will only be around for the next two weeks, so players should hurry and head to the stars if they missed out the first time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/death-stranding-just-sauntered-onto-xbox-series-xs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In a surprise celebration of the game’s fifth anniversary, Kojima Productions and 505 Games have just dropped <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding">Death Stranding Director’s Cut</a> onto Xbox Series X|S and Amazon Luna.</p>
<p>Having originally launched as a PlayStation 4 exclusive published by Sony, and with the sequel set to be similarly PlayStation 5 exclusive, Hideo Kojima’s genre-bending game is now on Xbox. The studio has also confirmed that they now have full ownership of the Death Stranding IP.</p>


<p dir="ltr"><span>Hideo Kojima said, “It is my pleasure to finally announce that Death Stranding Director’s Cut will be delivered to Xbox players. I would like to thank all the fans who have stayed connected with us as well as everyone in the Xbox community who have been patiently waiting. Kojima Productions will continue to connect more and more players around the world, so please stay tuned.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The production of Death Stranding seems to have been about as unique and individual as Kojima’s career as a gaming auteur. Having been given the boot by Konami following the release of Metal Gear Solid V, Kojima founded his own game studio, doing so with the backing of a very enthusiastic Andrew House and Sony, who secured the company’s next game as an exclusive – this turned out to be Death Stranding in 2019 – and helped them get access to Guerrilla Games’ Decima engine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it seems there was a good bit of wiggle room in that publishing partnership. While Sony had exclusive console rights, Kojima was also able to sign with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/13/death-stranding-pc-review/">505 Games to publish the game on PC in mid-2020</a>. Come 2021, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/23/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-is-it-an-essential-upgrade-for-ps5/">PS5 enhanced Director’s Cut</a> launched and was then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/28/death-stranding-directors-cut-pc-release-date-30-march-paid-upgrade-option-revealed/">similarly followed on for PC</a>, and they took a further opportunity to bring the game to Mac, iPad and iPhone in early 2024.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now, it seems that the publishing deal was for five years with the IP rights reverting back to Kojima after that time.&nbsp;In porting the game across to Xbox, we’re now in a curious place where the excellent Decima engine is now on Xbox as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, what does this mean for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>? Well, likely a similar situation to the first game. Death Stranding 2 is being published by Sony, which means that there will at the very least be console exclusivity for a good few years after launch. It remains to be seen whether 505 will be involved again and help bring the game to PC and other platforms down the line.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-revealed-coming-out-in-2025/">Death Stranding 2 is expected to launch in 2025 for PS5</a>.</p>
