            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian</em>, a followup to this year's&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator</em>.</p>
<p>According to Koei Tecmo, the new game will be "a new adventure from the world of&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>", but it'll feature "new protagonists and an original story", so don't expect to follow up with the characters from the previous game.</p>
<p>All we know about&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>so far is that it's currently in development for PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch (sorry once again, Xbox users), and that it's intended to launch next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-and-the-white-guardian-path.jpg?itok=V_03tia3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-and-the-white-guardian-path.jpg?itok=oqgzv6fG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>sure looks like an&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>For what it's worth, though, the teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>sure makes it look like an&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>It's got all the idyllic locations, mysterious-looking caverns, and wide, sweeping expanses you'd expect from the series, plus plenty of cozy-looking villages.</p>
<p>The new protagonists look like they fit the bill, too; there's a studious-looking anime boy who wears glasses, and a girl with cat ears who looks like she's going to take the role of&nbsp;<em>Atelier</em>'s familiar sassy protagonists.</p>
<p>You can check out the teaser reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give too much away, but we're not expecting the game until next year, so that makes sense.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says this game will "build on the experiences of the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series while also evolving", and also that it'll be "completely offline", so you won't need an online connection to play it.</p>
<p>It's not yet clear whether the game will be a free-to-play title with microtransactions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-to-play-all-star-jrpg-atelier-resleriana-announced-for-west-by-koei-tecmo">like its predecessor</a>, but given that it's totally offline, it sounds like it'll be a premium JRPG instead. Let's hope so!</p>
<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025. Stay tuned for more.</p>

For the past decade and a half, the studio has largely positioned itself as, above all, a maker of games in which choices matter, and that’s extended across multiple series. Both <em>Dragon Age </em>and its space opera franchise, <em>Mass Effect</em>,<em> </em>have given players universe-bending choices that have carried over between games through save data transfers and external apps that let you craft your world state. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, however, only three decisions from previous games will carry over, and that has fans concerned about the sequel’s handling of continuity.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

In this menu, you’ll have the chance to create your version of the Inquisitor, the protagonist of 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. Then you’ll be able to make three key decisions (or report which decisions you made in these situations when playing <em>Inquisition</em>) that will be reflected in the story: who did the Inquisitor romance, did they disband or maintain the titular organization, and are they still friends with Solas, the party-member-turned-antagonist of <em>The Veilguard</em>? Given Solas and the Inquisitor’s past relationship, these will obviously play key parts in how that character reacts to events in <em>The Veilguard</em>, as you won’t be controlling them this time around. But given how many big events have happened throughout three previous games, fans are wondering just how much, if any, impact their previous decisions will have on the story.<br></p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, <em>Veilguard</em> creative director John Epler explained that the trimming down of imported choices was partially because the fourth game takes place in a distant region of its universe. <em>The Veilguard </em>is set in northern Thedas, whereas previous games were in the south. So maybe it doesn’t matter whether you ended up with the traditionalist Cassandra or the more progressive Leliana as the church’s leader at the end of <em>Inquisition</em>, because that’s all happening elsewhere.</p><p>On its face, I buy that explanation for why a large swath of choices from previous games are seemingly not brought up in <em>The Veilguard</em>. If BioWare doesn’t bring up these choices in any dialogue or codex entry, does it really matter what, specifically, is going on elsewhere in the world? This approach worked for <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, which was set in a different galaxy from its predecessors, allowing it to carefully write around which of the galaxy-changing choices you made at the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435">end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em></a></span>. What I and several other fans are left wondering is how this will affect returning characters in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>There are two major figures in this discussion: The Inquisitor and Morrigan, a party member from the original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> and a major supporting character in <em>Inquisition</em>. Both characters have been confirmed to return in <em>The Veilguard</em> and both were part of one of the biggest decisions in <em>Inquisition</em>. Near the end of the game, there is a questline in which either the Inquisitor or Morrigan drinks from the Well of Sorrows. This magical well is said to house elven knowledge, but it will come at a price. Regardless of which of the two of you drinks from the well, one of you is forever tied to Mythal, an elven goddess who has possessed Flemeth, Morrigan’s mother.</p><p>Flemeth is seemingly killed and absorbed by Solas at the end of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> and the decade-long theory has been that Solas may have some kind of magical control of either the Inquisitor or Morrigan after being revealed as a traitor at the end of the game. Now, without the ability to import this decision into <em>The Veilguard</em>, fans worry it might be going absolutely nowhere, which is strange for a game that centers on Solas and the elven gods. The lack of choices that specifically refer to Morrigan is also strange considering she may have a son depending on if the player romanced her in <em>Origins</em> or conducted a ritual to conceive a child in the endgame. In any case, the inability to import any choices pertaining to her has taken fans by surprise.</p><p>The Inquisitor, meanwhile, is one of the biggest question marks leading up to<em> The Veilguard</em>. BioWare has confirmed the character will appear in the game (I may have spent a good 30 minutes trying to recreate mine in the character creator when I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350">played the game earlier this month</a></span>), but has been tight-lipped on what their deal is this time around. But the fact that you only answer three questions about their journey has fans concerned about both the substance of their role in <em>The Veilguard</em> and whether it’s possible for the game to represent all the variations of the hero players have made over the years.</p><p>That’s a tall order, of course. But it understandably matters to players, given that the conflict between the Inquisitor and Solas is one of the most personal in the series. (I’d even argue that they should have still been the protagonist of the game in which you face him, but I digress.) Now, we’ll be meeting a version of our old hero entirely defined by BioWare’s writing team with very little input on our part. If the only questions about them we’re allowed to answer are “Who did they romance?” and “Are they still friends with Solas?” that doesn’t leave a lot of room for nuance. There’s a question now of whether players who weren’t especially invested in Solas are going to get a character who’s a little too different from their own Inquisitor for their comfort level.</p><p>But even if you don’t put the Inquisitor and Morrigan under a microscope, it is questionable that the only choices that seem to have any impact on <em>The Veilguard </em>come from <em>Inquisition</em>. This may make sense in context of the full game, but it does feel diametrically opposed to a series that once let you use an app to import every decision from earlier games, big and small, into <em>Inquisition</em>.</p><p>Though a lot of fans are understandably concerned, others have been more understanding, saying that <em>The Veilguard</em> should focus more on new relationships and choices as they pertain to new protagonist Rook rather than being overly referential. Others are taking the wait-and-see approach, hoping that once the game is actually out these decisions will make better sense in context or that those choices will come up in another <em>Dragon Age </em>project down the line.</p><p>Epler explains that, in selecting which choices <em>The Veilguard </em>would import, the team wanted to pick details that could result in more than just a cameo and some altered dialogue. I could see things like the status of the Inquisition and the Inquisitor’s relationship to Solas having major ramifications, but like many others, I am surprised that some very significant choices aren’t going to be brought up in a game <em>about</em> those related characters and factions. What I played of <em>The Veilguard </em>felt like it had a lot of strong connective tissue between the games of old even without explicitly referencing my choices, but I never met Morrigan or the Inquisitor in my demo. I don’t know how I’ll feel about their roles when all is said and done. We’ll see how it all pans out when <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>launches on October 31.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Fight alongside and against Ancient China’s most feared warriors.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,018 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Omega Force [1,236 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/omega-force">Omega Force</a> have released new information and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Dynasty Warriors: Origins [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a></em> introducing new gameplay details following its Tokyo Game Show 2024 live stream. <span id="more-918291"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>From the “Yellow Turban Rebellion” to the climax of the “Battle of Chibi,” the story of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> will transport players to the heart of an ancient China in turmoil. Through the eyes of a nameless hero, players will have to make choices in order to restore peace and shape history to their own experience.</p><p>Travelling across the world map as they embark on their epic journey, players can suppress rebellions or choose to rescue government forces during “Missions,” overcome “Skirmishes,” and visit various locations where they will be able to buy weapons. Throughout their quest, players will also encounter a variety of characters familiar to the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchise, such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei. Depending on the bond forged, these characters can become travelling companions, or an enemy.</p><p>Battles in <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> will require players to be more strategic than ever before. A variety of “Tactics” can be used to command their allies and coordinate forces. By gathering a large number of soldiers under their command, fans will also be able to form a “Large Force” which they can lead by deploying “Grand Tactics” maneuvers. This will allow players to radically change the course of a battle. However, users will need to keep an eye on their opponents, who will also be able to form a “Large Force” and will try to deploy their own “Grand Tactics” to win.</p><p>In one-versus-1,000 combat, players will have to master and alternate between swift and powerful attacks that can break an opponent’s guard. Repeated attacks will increase the protagonist’s “Bravery”, enabling them to use powerful and unique attacks called “Arts.” These “Arts” will be unique to each weapon, so it will be crucial for players to master the various arsenal at their disposal, allowing the protagonist to gain “Rank” and thus improving their skills.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Not only will players have to master the protagonist’s various attacks if they want to emerge victorious on the battlefield, but they will also have to strengthen their defense. By blocking enemy attacks at the right moment, they can unleash a powerful riposte, “Parry,” which creates a breach in the enemy’s defense. Some attacks cannot be blocked, so players will have to dodge them before counterattacking.</p><p>Finally, players will sometimes encounter powerful officers protected by an energy called “Resolution.” Players will have to work on reducing this “Resolution” to weaken them before they can launch a powerful “Assault” attack which can sometimes be the decisive coup de grace.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,067 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,157 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,350 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on January 17, 2025.</p><p>View a new set of screenshots <a href="//">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>“Ask the Producer Sho!” Live Stream Archive</span></h2><p>(From 3:19:22 to 4:07:28.)</p><p><iframe title="コーエーテクモLIVE! in TGS2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cj3NIx8hEN0?start=11962&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_918292"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve's new hero shooter, Deadlock, hasn't even officially launched yet, but cheaters are already becoming a problem. The game is currently in the midst of a closed beta, meaning players can only access the game via an invite from another player. But that hasn't stopped the game from gaining <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valves-new-game-hasnt-been-announced-already-has-almost-17000-concurrent-players/1100-6525718/" data-ref-id="1100-6525718">massive popularity</a>, and as is the case with many online shooters, more players means more cheaters.</p><p>Naturally, Valve is handling the influx of aim-bots and other instances of cheating the way any reasonable developer would: by turning the offending players into frogs.</p><p>"When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards," the Deadlock developer known as Yoshi shared in <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/09-26-2024-update.33015/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a forum post outlining a recent game update</a>. "The system is set to conservative detection levels as we work on a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive. We will turn on the banning of users in a couple of days after the update is out. When a match is ended this way, the results will not count for other players."</p><p>The frogs in question are essentially defenseless, unable to do damage or use the abilities of the character they were playing prior to being frog-ified. Non-cheaters can easily kill a frog, or simply choose to let it leap around the arena for the rest of the match.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-finally-acknowledges-deadlock-a-new-game-people-have-been-playing-for-months/1100-6526115/" data-ref-id="1100-6526115">Deadlock was officially announced</a> in late August, when Valve uploaded an announcement trailer and lifted the NDAs signed by streamers and other playtesters. The game's official release date has yet to be announced, but one thing is certain: No fairytale princesses will ever plant a kiss on any of Deadlock's frogs, especially given their history of cheating.</p>

<p>Version 5.1, which is titled "The Rainbow Destined to Burn", launches across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available on October 9th. It follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-50-release-date">August's Version 5.0</a>, which brought the nation of Natlan with it, as well as a number of other new features.</p>
<p>This update isn't quite as major as the last one, but it does continue the Natlan storyline, asking you to help rescue the nation from "destruction and the looming threat of the Abyss". We've all been there.</p>

<p>She can debuff enemies, heal her teammates, and deal area-of-effect damage to enemies, making her a versatile (if somewhat tricky to get to grips with) character for your team.</p>
<p>Xilonen will be available as part of the first half of Version 5.1's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-showcases-new-5-star-geo-character-chiori">Chiori</a>. The second half will bring reruns of Nahida and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-hu-tao-build-guide">Hu Tao</a>.</p>
<p>Version 5.1 also introduces the Sabzeruz Festival in Sumeru, where you'll get the chance to take part in a number of minigames and extra activities for the chance to claim some rewards, including an opportunity to recruit Candace.</p>

<p>Of course, HoYoverse has also released a number of codes to help you grab some free goodies, as is customary when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update announcements. Here are today's codes!</p>

<p>A new patch update in Deadlock has announced that cheaters in the can can now be turned into a frog before being banned.</p>



<p>The new update came from the Deadlock patch notes, which reveals that Valve has added an initial anti-cheat detection system into the game. “When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards.”</p>



<p>Valve describes the new system as its first step in being able to detect cheaters and is “set to conservative detection levels” while the team work on a v2 anti-cheat system. One of the biggest questions here though is, will we still be able to turn cheaters into a frog in the new system?</p>



<p>Despite Valve saying that the update will roll out in a couple of days, one X user (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/poggu__/status/1839438568110031076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@poggu__</a> has been able to snap some footage of what it will look like:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Deadlock is still in its ‘early access’ stage but has already seen an all-time peak of 171,000 players on Steam, with a daily concurrent peak of around 100,000 as of late.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, Valve is yet to officially announce its full release date, but assumptions are that it’s likely to be sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Deadlock? And what do you think of the new anti-cheat system that’s been implemented to turn cheaters into a frog? Let us know in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/deadlock.17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a>!</p>

            <p>Valve has released a patch for its-still-in-works hero-shooter Deadlock, which includes a rather brilliant anti-cheat measure.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/09-26-2024-update.33015/">patch notes</a> cover a pretty extensive list of tweaks and adjustments, as well as the introduction of a new hero called Mirage. But, the highlight by far is that aforementioned anti-cheat measure.</p>

<p>If you were feeling a little froggy-headed this morning, I am sure this particular patch note will make you hoppier.</p>
<p>You see, now when a player is rumbled for cheating in Deadlock, their opponents will be given the option ban them immediately, or... turn the wrong-doer into a frog for the rest of the match. And then, when the match is over and the frog has finished hopping all over the place, the cheater will still get banned. </p>

</figure><p>

"The system is set to conservative detection levels as we work on a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive," Valve wrote in the patch notes. "We will turn on the banning of users in a couple of days after the update is out. When a match is ended this way, the results will not count for other players."

</p><p>I promise this isn't all croak and mirrors. You can see just how Deadlock's current anti-cheat measure looks in action via the post below. Sorry, pal, but that's no glitch. Be gone!</p>

<p>After an extended period of silence despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">a wave of leaks</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">high-levels of player numbers which were available to the public</a>, Valve officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">revealed in Deadlock a very un-fanfare-y way</a> back in August.</p>
<p>Since then, a Valve developer has given us all an extra peek at a prototype of Deadlock, which showed a rudimentary urban area, complete with placeholder assets such as those of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadlock-prototype-had-half-life-2s-antlions-marching-along-beside-you">Half-Life 2's alien insectoid creatures, Antlions</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Dustborn is a unique little game. It’s a narrative heavy road trip with audio-based superpowers, combat with a throwable baseball bat that can be recalled Mjollnir-style, and some light ghostbusting. It’s an eclectic mix of ideas that might seem difficult to balance.</p>
<p><iframe title="DUSTBORN | LAUNCH TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiBhYBG6bEE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The highlight here is definitely the story and the characters. Set in the pseudo-dystopian hellscape known as America – an alternate history one, I mean, that’s now called the American Republic. You play as a woman called Pax who is tasked with delivering a package to Nova Scotia and has a small team to help her out. Pax and two of this team are Anomals – individuals with superpowers stemming from a mysterious cataclysmic event – and are planning to use this trip to Nova Scotia to escape their lives to a country more accepting of them. So in order to smuggle themselves and the mysterious package across the country, they start a band and go on tour. It’s the perfect cover…. band.</p>


<p>The characters and their dialogue is phenomenal throughout, and there’s absolutely tonnes of it. Most of the time, the game plays like a Telltale adventure or, more fittingly as it’s published by Quantic Dream, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/24/detroit-become-human-review/">Detroit: Become Human</a>, just without the silly quicktime events for opening doors and stuff. You’ll be having a lot of conversations, walking around an location for some light puzzling or adventuring, sending one of your crew in to pick a lock or just knock a door down, and so on. I absolutely love this part of the game, I found myself quickly becoming attached to the characters thanks in no small part by the excellent voice acting, which is handy when you can’t skip a single line of dialogue.</p>


<p>What’s also superb is the attention to detail, sometimes to a fault. Dustborn keeps tracks of an awful lot of things you say or do and often brings it up later. At one point, Sai was having a bit of an episode in a bathroom and I was trying to convince her to come out so we could continue. Having exhausted all of my non-magic options, I tried to give her some beef jerky I’d picked up earlier – something that would definitely have worked in a LucasArts point &amp; click – and boy, was she offended.&nbsp;Later I offered it to her again when she was a little more calm, and she actually commented “is this what you tried to give to me earlier? I’m not a dog, Pax!” which really made me laugh.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of little elements like this that make everyone feel more convincing as characters. One quirk that doesn’t, though, is when you can check in with everyone at the end of the day, butting into the conversations they were having between themselves. Those chats then pause and resume after you’re done with an “as I was saying” type line. After a while, I found it ruined my immersion to hear that after a serious conversation.</p>
<p>Dustborn isn’t exactly subtle with its themes or intentions. From “Anomals” sounding almost exactly like “a-normals” to the “ghosts” which are actually echoes of misinformation that turn people into hateful and paranoid people, it’s all very much on the nose and outside of the accurate statement “misinformation makes people bad,” it doesn’t really say any more than that. Even the people that’s aimed at would agree, but just argue they’re not the ones who are misinformed. Some of these ideas don’t play out to satisfying conclusions, the game establishing a few interesting topics and then leaving them behind as you move onto the next one. It would have been great to tie them back together more cohesively.</p>

<p>While the characters and story are the main focus of the game, there’s a few other genres thrown in alongside. The occasional combat sequences play like a ropey arena brawler. It’s a bit too imprecise and chaotic feeling, but it’s also too easy and gets repetitive despite having some fun abilities, like Pax’s voice turning enemies on each other or convincing them they’re on fire. You can skip some of these encounters… but a one-off instance where I was able to sneak past a gang of bikers broke down when one of the other crew members failed to follow me to the bus, forcing me to fight anyway. Another one-off flashback took the form of turn-based RPG combat, which is rough but deep enough to be satisfying for its brief appearance.</p>
<p>Then there’s the music. You’re in a band, so you need to “write” some songs that you can perform whilst on tour. There’s a rhythm mini-game for both writing and playing the songs, not too dissimilar to Guitar Hero, but while some of these original songs are catchy in places, I wouldn’t expect them to end up in your daily playlist. The rhythm game itself is also just serviceable, button prompts flying in from all sides of the screen in a way that can make the timing more difficult to judge than it should be.</p>

<p>Variety is nice, but all these elements undercut the game’s focus and pacing. You can have a road trip across America smuggling a mysterious package that deals with weighty topics like discrimination and misinformation, but when the main story is combined with long conversations on other topics, it can feel disjointed. Add to that the funny subversions and absurdities between the serious stuff, and there’s a bit of tonal whiplash.&nbsp;It builds toward an ending that leaves a few too many threads without a satisfying resolution.</p>
<p>The presentation on the whole looks good, with pleasing character designs and models and a good art direction, but with environments that often feel a bit sparse and bare.</p>
<p>Now this all sounds like doom and gloom, but it really isn’t. I really enjoyed Dustborn. Mechanically, it doesn’t quite hit the targets perfectly, but I’m a sucker for a character driven story and the characters here are remarkably well realised, which is more than enough to keep me going through some mediocre gameplay and unrealised potential. The world might be a touch heavy handed in how it’s set up, but I think that we can collectively agree that the time for subtlety has passed when people are unironically cheering on Homelander whilst watching The Boys.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-developer-fntastic-returning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fntastic, whose name you might remember from the disaster that was&nbsp;<em>The Day Before</em>, is once again asking for your money, this time in the form of a Kickstarter campaign to revive the studio and help it make its latest game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1839404741841047686" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Fntastic implores those who "helped us create Fntastic through Kickstarter" to pledge their "help again to bring Fntastic back".</p>
<p>The studio has <a href="https://www.fntastic.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created a new official website</a> to herald its return, and it comes complete with a step-by-step plan explaining how you can help Fntastic if you want to, as well as a "Fntastic 2.0" outline in which the studio details how it's going to do things better this time around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fntastic-the-day-before-return-escape-factory.jpg?itok=tgOZpuhA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fntastic-the-day-before-return-escape-factory.jpg?itok=aSgVG07o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Day Before&nbsp;</em>developer Fntastic is working on a new game, and it wants your help.</figcaption></figure><p>In its <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/66cf2872c641a645890f1c5d/t/66e3f77eace4a55f13841699/1726216072958/Fntastic-2-0.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plan for recovery</a>, Fntastic pledges to run its business on the three core principles of "honesty", "transparency", and "professionalism", pledging to build trust within its community, actively engage with said community via social media, and end the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-devs-ask-for-volunteers-to-help-finish-their-game">practice of relying on "volunteers"</a>.</p>
<p>The studio says its new mission is to deliver "high-quality gaming experiences, combining innovation, creativity, integrity, and transparency". One rather wonders why that wasn't the plan to start with, but hey.</p>
<p>As well as its plan, Fntastic has also released <a href="https://www.fntastic.com/faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an FAQ</a> anticipating some of the questions people might have about its return. The studio says that after its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-developer-shuts-down-as-controversial-game-flops">initial closure</a>, its staffers "reflected on our past mistakes and initiated significant internal changes".</p>
<p>Fntastic's return this time around hinges on a game called&nbsp;<em>Escape Factory</em>, which looks to be a sort of multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-esque platformer with "physics-based challenges". It looks like the studio's Kickstarter campaign covers both the game's development and the company's return.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Fntastic is the company that created&nbsp;<em>The Day Before</em>, a zombie survival game with a marketing campaign Fntastic itself describes as "embellished" (which is certainly one way to put it).</p>
<p>On release, the game was quickly and widely panned for its lack of similarity to the game trailers and marketing hype promised it would be, and just a few weeks after its launch,&nbsp;<em>The Day Before&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-will-completely-shut-down-in-janhuary-as-steam-will-refund-all-players">shut down for good</a>, with Fntastic refunding everyone who bought it.</p>
<p>Fntastic may want everyone reading its new plan to think it's turned over a new leaf, but back in January this year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fntastic-the-day-before-social-media">blamed what it called a "hate campaign"</a> for&nbsp;<em>The Day Before</em>'s failure.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned FAQ, Fntastic admits that its team "still consists of the same people who created all of our previous games". Despite pledging not to use volunteers, the studio also says that "some team members are helping out on a goodwill basis".</p>
<p>I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not bringing back Fntastic is a good idea, but if you want to, you can support the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fntasticgames/escape-factory/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Escape Factory&nbsp;</em>Kickstarter campaign here</a>.</p>

    <p><span>Storyline progression, Xilonen, Nahida's birthday, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.1 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “The Rainbow Destined to Burn,” will launch on October 9, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-918151"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The main storyline will continue in the newly unveiled region of Natlan, where Xilonen will join as a master forger and a dependable ally in combat and exploration. Meanwhile, Sumeru will celebrate the return of the Sabzeruz Festival, filled with joy, festivities, and a special birthday surprise for Nahida.</p><p>Following the previous Archon Quest, Natlan is in urgent need of help to save herself from destruction and the looming threat of the Abyss. While players and Xilonen work together to forge an Ancient Name for the Traveler, Citlali, a member of the Masters of the Night-Wind, will finally appear to lend a hand. Meanwhile, her fellow tribe member, Ororon, is devising a secret plan. Players’ efforts to rescue Natlan will be rewarded, as they can claim an additional 500 Primogems by completing the two new acts of the Archon Quest in Version 5.1. Additionally, up to 400 Primogems can be obtained by completing specific World Quests and gaining Natlan Exploration Progress.</p><p>Xilonen, renowned for crafting legendary items like the Pyro Archon’s sunglasses, is not only a talented smith but also an agile and reliable warrior. Unlike traditional climbers, this five-star Geo Sword wielder can skate effortlessly and execute agile leaps along cliff walls. In combat, Xilonen demonstrates versatile support skills by reducing enemies’ Elemental RES or healing her teammates, thanks to her unique combat equipment: Samplers. All three Samplers initially record Geo Source Samples, which Xilonen can instantly activate using her Elemental Skill to reduce enemies’ Geo Elemental RES while enhancing her Normal and Plunging Attack DMG. When she teams up with Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, or Electro characters, the Source Samples will undergo Elemental Conversion and change colors, but they can only be activated after maxing out her Nightsoul Points through Normal Attacks, allowing her to reduce the corresponding Elemental RES of enemies. If at least two Source Samples change color, Xilonen can activate them more rapidly, shifting her Elemental Burst from dealing Geo AoE DMG to healing nearby active teammates. Additionally, she can help the team regain a certain amount of Phlogiston by triggering a Nightsoul Transmission.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_918152"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>In the Version 5.1 Event Wishes, Xilonen will feature in the first half alongside the rerun of Chiori, while the second half brings back Nahida and Hu Tao. As more allies join the team, Natlan introduces a new Enemy Boss: the “Secret Source Constructor,” an ancient construction machine with a lethal nature that awaits challengers in a long-forgotten cave.</p><p>Back in Sumeru, the streets come alive with joyful rhythms during the Sabzeruz Festival, honoring the birthday of Lesser Lord Kusanali. This year, players will reunite with Dehya, Tighnari, and Collei to prepare a heartwarming birthday surprise for Nahida, taking on the special role of Knight of Flowers to escort her carriage through the festival parade. In Port Ormos, the festivities feature a series of mini-games, including “Rocking Carriage,” where players control a carriage to collect flowers and dodge obstacles; “Interreflection of Reality and Dreams,” which challenges players to spot anomalies in the dream world; and a combat challenge where participants fight as the Knight of Flowers. By earning enough Festive Fervor through these activities, players can claim various rewards, including a chance to recruit Candace for free.</p><p>Version 5.1 also introduces several quality-of-life improvements for the Spiral Abyss, character ascension, Artifacts, and Echo Cosmetics. In the Spiral Abyss, a new skip feature allows players to bypass Floor 9 if they achieved full stars on Floor 11 in the previous update. Similarly, players who completed Floor 12 with full stars can skip both Floors 9 and 10. Character ascension has become more intuitive, with inventory updates displaying the quantities of craftable materials. A new formula filter at the Crafting Bench will also simplify crafting management. Additionally, in the character Artifact interface, Artifact Set filters and affix sorting preferences for individual slots will now be saved, eliminating the need to reset them after each session. Lastly, Zhongli and Keqing’s Echoes can now be obtained by completing new Envisaged Echoes challenges introduced in the latest update.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,067 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,260 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,350 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

According to LG, it’s the first controller to utilize Ultra-Low Latency (ULL) Bluetooth technology — an <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specifications-in-development/#:~:text=Ultra%20Low%20Latency%20HID">in-development standard</a> that aims to make wireless controllers as responsive as their wired counterparts.</p><p>The BT ULL-enabled controller was compared against a “standard controller” at&nbsp;LG’s webOS Summit event on Friday. “The demonstration highlighted the superior responsiveness, reduced input lag and control precision of the BT ULL technology across various cloud-based games, including FPS, fighting and racing titles,” LG said in its newsroom post.</p><div><figcaption><em>There’s no close-up shot of the new controller, but the design may be subject to change before it officially launches.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: LG</cite></p></div><p>Input lag on Bluetooth controllers can vary by model and environmental factors, but anything below 10–20 milliseconds is preferred. Wired controllers typically have a lower input latency, which makes them appealing to competitive gamers. Razer’s new ULL Bluetooth gaming controller was supposedly demonstrated with a “game-changing 1ms input lag.”</p><p>Google once tried to solve controller input latency issues with its Stadia service, enabling the controller to connect directly over Wi-Fi to Google’s data centers. This allowed Google to avoid the added Bluetooth latency. After Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378713/google-stadia-shutting-down-game-streaming-january-2023">shuttered its Stadia service</a> last year, the company released an update to enable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23559284/google-stadia-controller-bluetooth-mode-how-to">Bluetooth on its Stadia controllers</a> for use on PCs, Macs, phones, and other devices.</p><p>Bluetooth ULL support is being built into select LG 120Hz OLED and Mini LED TVs that use MediaTek’s MT7921 WiFi chipset, which are scheduled to launch in 2025. LG is also planning to introduce a certification for third-party ULL-supported controllers to ensure they “work seamlessly with LG webOS smart TVs,” with Razer being the first company to qualify.</p><p>There’s no price, release date, or even an official name associated with the new Razer controller yet, so it may take some time before it’s available for consumers to buy. We could get some additional details on both the controller and LG’s ULL-supported TVs at 2024’s CES, which is taking place January 7th–10th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy has entered into a €15m convertible loan agreement with technology conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>. This type of loan is an agreement that can be converted into a predetermined number of equity shares at a later date.</p>
<p>Tencent's loan is still to be approved by Remedy's Extraordinary General Meeting, which is scheduled to be held by 24th October. Following its approval, Tencent will "have the right to convert the loan into new Remedy shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the convertible rights" three years after the drawdown.</p>

<p>"Part of Remedy's long-term strategy has been to strengthen our position in the value chain, to have more control over how our games are commercialised, and to grow our share of the value these games can create," Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said today, in a <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/inside-information-remedy-enters-into-a-eur-15-million-convertible-loan-agreement-with-tencent/">press release</a> detailing the loan.</p>
<p>"As we move towards self-publishing, this financing will support us in developing and fully realising the potential of the games we have in development and successfully carrying out the commercial activities of our next self-published games."</p>
<p>The studio exec said Tencent's investment in the company "demonstrates strong confidence in Remedy's long-term vision and strategy".</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-developer-cancels-premium-co-op-multiplayer-codename-kestrel-despite-early-promise">Remedy cancelled a premium co-op multiplayer game</a> it had in the pipeline with Tencent. This project started life as codename Vanguard, before it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-reboots-free-to-play-co-op-multiplayer-project-vanguard-as-premium-release"> rebooted last year</a>, and was being developed by the studio, with Tencent set to handle the publishing side of things.</p>
<p>At the time of this announcement, Remedy said the cancellation would allow the studio to focus on other games in its portfolio. Upcoming games include the self-published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">Control 2</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remakes and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-promises-a-unique-remedy-angle-on-the-genre">Control multiplayer spin-off which the company said will give players a "unique Remedy angle" on the genre</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Remedy also recently entered a partnership which will see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">Annapurna Pictures financing half of Control 2</a> in exchange for the film and TV rights to Control and Alan Wake. Earlier this month, Thomas Puha from Remedy moved to assure his followers that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">mass exodus of staff at indie video game publisher Annapurna Interactive</a> would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">not affect the studio's partnership with Annapurna going forward</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ibuypowers-rdy-y70-pre-built-pc-is-the-ultimate-dream-for-console-users/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PC gaming experience for new players can be particularly overwhelming when setting up and optimizing PCs for their best use. The renowned system integrator <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">iBUYPOWER</a> has presented a fantastic solution to this problem, making the whole journey seamless by utilizing Windows 11.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, iBUYPOWER is one of the longest-running system integrators in North America that deals in high-quality and high-performance prebuilt and custom gaming PCs designed with utter perfection, allowing consumers the ultimate "plug-in-play" experience. Opting for them is an excellent choice for those fresh to <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/gaming-pcs?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">gaming PCs</a>, especially those who grew up playing console games and are determined to avoid common issues when setting up their new system.</p>
<p>iBUYPOWER’s <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/store/rdy-y70-valorant-vcta-b003?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">RDY Y70 VALORANT VCTA B003</a> pre-built system, equipped with Windows 11, is one of the more impressive choices to consider. Not only does this PC tick all the boxes when it comes to performance, features, and aesthetics, but iBUYPOWER takes robust checks to ensure high-performance gaming out of the box, making it a viable choice for console players, especially as there are only a few steps to get the system up and running, which we'll go through step-by-step.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This specific iBUYPOWER system celebrates <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/valorant-champions-tour-americas?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">iBUYPOWER’s collaboration with VALORANT’s VCT Americas competition</a> as their Official PC Partner, which was announced during their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ibuypower?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">25th anniversary</a>. With curated components chosen for the build, this is not only one of the best PCs on the market, but iBUYPOWER nailed the PC’s ultimate use-case – to create tournament-ready systems that are tuned for competitive play, making this system a compelling option.</p>
<p>Moving onto the PC specs, the iBUYPOWER RDY Y70 VCTA B003 features Intel's Core i7-14700KF CPU, 32GB of DDR5-6000MHz RAM, and 2TB of M.2 NVMe Gen4 SSD. It is also equipped with NVIDIA's RTX 4070 Ti SUPER GPU, which is perfect for 1080p / 1440p gaming and makes this PC a fantastic all-around option for regular users and gamers alike.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The setup process isn't that complicated, especially when you have an iBUYPOWER system that is already tuned with optimal settings out of the box. Once you have unboxed the computer, the first thing to do is to connect the graphics card to your PC since, under the iBUYPOWER "SafeGuard Packaging," the manufacturer ships out the system without the GPU mounted inside. The best way to do this is by following the steps advised by iBUYPOWER themselves.</p>
<p>Next is powering on the system by plugging in the computer with the included power cable. Make sure to keep an eye on wattage recommendations in the manual, before proceeding with this step. Once the PC's power port, located on the back of the power supply, is connected, the next thing is to set up your monitor to the system. Connect the pre-included set of display cables, either HDMI and/or DisplayPort cables, from your monitor to the GPU, and you’ll have a system up and ready to go.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to note here is the iBUYPOWER RDY Y70 pre-built PC is one of the more solid options on the market when it comes to opting for a system that caters to regular consumer needs while offering high-performance gaming for several years. The company has indeed created a remarkable product tied to their VALORANT VCT Americas collaboration, which shows the level of quality, value, and performance often found in iBUYPOWER’s product lineup.</p>
<p>Not to mention the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ibuypower?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">extensive warranty coverage</a> you get out of any new iBUYPOWER system which offers 3-Year Standard (3 YR Labor + 2 YR Parts) servicing. If you’re in the market to upgrade your gaming PC, iBUYPOWER has the builds that will handle both gaming and productivity tasks with ease. Make sure to keep an eye on their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ibuypower?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">coupons</a> page or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ibuypower?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">daily deals</a> page for the newest discounts.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-this-a-reference-guide-tarkov-quest/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98is-this-a-reference-%E2%80%99-tarkov-quest-guide.994161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-this-a-reference-guide-tarkov-quest/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has added a super-size, monumental Fence quest into Escape from Tarkov called ‘Is This a Reference?’ It’s a bizarre task that requires you to place dozens of Wi-Fi Camera devices across almost every map in the game, specifically at locations that are references to other games, movies, and television shows, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It’s a sizeable beast of a quest that’s confusing many players. If you’re one of them, check out our ‘Is This a Reference’ quest guide below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stock-up-on-wi-fi-cameras">Stock Up on Wi-Fi Cameras</h2>



<p>You’ll need <strong>27 Wi-Fi Cameras </strong>to complete Is This a Reference in Escape from Tarkov – that’s the first blocker.</p>



<p>Presently, they’re being sold on the Flea for around €900 – or around 140,000 roubles. If you’re not investing in the Flea Market, you can head over to Mechanic’s storefront and barter for Wi-Fi Cameras. They’ll cost you 1 x Electronic Components and 1 x Powerbank, but this isn’t exactly the best way to go given that you’ll have to spend around 200,000 roubles per barter.</p>



<p>Also, you can only get four devices per restock, and you’ll need to wait a couple of hours between each reset.</p>



<p>Given that Wi-Fi Cameras are very rare, you’re not likely to find them on your adventures around Escape from Tarkov, which means you’re going to spend <strong>a long time trying </strong>to complete Is This a Reference.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-is-this-a-reference-in-tarkov">How to  Complete Is This a Reference in Tarkov</h2>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to have at least 1.0 Fence rep to unlock the task in the first place. Once you’ve ticked that box, it’s time to equip some Wi-Fi Cameras and head out into the world of Tarkov. </p>



<p>This task will take you across Streets of Tarkov, Reserve, Woods, Shoreline, Ground Zero, Lighthouse, and Factory.</p>



<p>Presently, the information available to pad out an Is This a Reference guide is thin because so few players have managed to find the spots alluded to in the task. Per the typical operating model, players have been given little guidance to find the spots required for Is This a Reference, and only vague clues have been offered by Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>With that in mind, here’s our full location guide for Is This a Reference:</p>

He then hears a voice that says: "Rise, son of Guilliman."</p><p>According to the game’s subtitles, that line — again, pre-patch — was attributed to Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines. Fans took it as an odd thing for Calgar to say to Titus, given he also is a son of Roboute Guilliman, the primarch from which all Ultramarines are based. (Check out the cutscene in the video below.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Now, onto patch 3.0. Here’s the change in question:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an unidentified voice at the end of the story that was assigned to the wrong character.</li></ul><p>Assigned to the wrong character, you say? So, who is the <em>right </em>character? The same cutscene now attributes the line to [Voice], which is ambiguous, but Warhammer 40,000 lore fans have a clear idea who this voice belongs to: the Emperor himself.</p><p>If true, this has big implications for Space Marine 2’s story, the nature of Titus’ abilities not just in this game but the first, and any role he might play in the ongoing narrative. But given Titus is now part of the Warhammer 40,000 canon (he has his own model you can play on Games Workshop’s tabletop game and the company has even released an official lore video delving into Titus’ backstory on Warhammer TV), fans are taking this as further evidence of the Emperor’s resurgence across the galaxy.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/sm2-recruit-sep24-image2-1727204000-1727434922614.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The official Titus model for Warhammer 40,000. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For the uninitiated, the Emperor of Mankind is the reigning monarch of the Imperium of Man whose slowly decaying body has sat immobile within the Golden Throne of Terra for over 10,000 years. But that hasn’t stopped the Emperor, the most powerful psyker to have ever existed, from seemingly stepping in every now and then to help humanity out in its darkest hours.</p><p>At this point in the ongoing (and slow moving!) Warhammer 40,000 storyline, there is growing evidence to suggest the Emperor is finally stirring, with some convinced his return proper is coming sooner rather than later. Indeed, in Warhammer 40,000 novel Godblight, the Emperor uses Guilliman as a vessel to burn down the Garden of Nurgle from within the Warp, miraculously reviving his son in the process.</p><p>Warhammer 40,000 fans now believe the Emperor is doing something similar with Titus. Titus’ unexplained immunity to the corrupting influence of Chaos during the Space Marine games may have been the Emperor’s doing all along. Indeed Titus’ ability to interact with the Chaos artifact and destroy it might be because he is blessed by the Emperor. As the ending of Space Marine 2 makes clear, the Inquisition’s suspicion of Titus and his abilities continues despite his heroics. But perhaps in the inevitable Space Marine 3 we’ll see the truth of the Emperor’s involvement, and Titus finally clear of the Inquisition's attention.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/emperor-upon-throne-1727435118566.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Emperor of Mankind in the 41st millennium. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For now, Space Marine 2 and Warhammer 40,000 lore fans are simply enjoying the debate this change has sparked, and have pointed to a <a href="https://x.com/MocapVeteran/status/1835234473882894538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tease</a> by creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick about whether the line of dialogue in question does indeed come from the Emperor. Here’s his response:</p><p>“That is open to individual interpretation. It could be in Titus's mind, could be Calgar, or it could be the Emperor (though GW might disagree on that). I know who I meant it to be when I wrote it but I'll keep that to myself ;)”</p><p>IGN recently interviewed Saber chief creative officer Tim Willits about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-will-hopefully-automatically-make-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-performance-mode-look-better-than-quality-mode-does-now-dev-says"><u>the boost he expects the PS5 Pro will give the game</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 has “changed everything” for the studio</u></a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-warhammer-40000-superfan-henry-cavill-is-playing-space-marine-2-no-he-wont-reveal-his-username"><u>Warhammer 40,000 superfan Henry Cavill has been playing Space Marine 2 and delivered his verdict</u></a>, and we also have details on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more"><u>what fans can expect from Space Marine 2’s seasonal post-launch content model</u></a>.

                <p>Because of the deep lore and the giant creatures of Capcom's Monster Hunter franchise, it may be intimidating for inexperienced gamers who haven't played the titles before. However, the latest preview for the next installment, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-launching-in-february/1100-6526679/" data-ref-id="1100-6526679">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, is laser-focused on setting up the game for new players and veterans alike. Think of it as Monster Hunter 101, as related by the in-game handler, Alma.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxSlVspp1cI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="99">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jxSlVspp1cI?start=99" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The player character is a Hunter who is on an expedition to the Forbidden Lands. The Hunter's expedition team includes Alma, a female smith named Gemma, and a Palico--a feline-like companion who aids the player in battle and was also seen in World. Multiple teams are also on this journey to reunite a young boy, Nata, with his people and vanquish the monster who scattered them: Arkveld, the White Wraith.</p><p>The creatures in the game will adapt to the presence of the expedition team over time, which means that the players will have to shift their tactics as needed. It's also explained that the different terrain of the Forbidden Lands will play a role in how the battles are fought. But surviving in the wild also means that the Hunter has to secure food with the help of their Palico.</p><p>Another aspect of the game is the Hunter's relationship with their Seikret, a bird-like two-legged beast that can be ridden like a horse. The Seikfret can spirit the player out of harm's way when things go wrong in battle with the monsters. Similarly, the Hunter can signal for help in battle to avoid getting overwhelmed or even killed. Some threats in this game are simply too much to handle without backup.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 28, 2025.</p>

            <p>A website unveiled to mark <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>'s anniversary earlier this week has given us our best clue as to what unannounced Silent Hill game may be on the way: either a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> Remake or even Silent Hill 4: Part 2.</p>
<p>At first, the <a href="https://www.silenthill-historicalsociety.com/">Silent Hill Historical Society website</a> looks little more than a bit of fan service thrown up to celebrate Silent Hill 2's 23rd anniversary and the upcoming release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>. But fans have been poking around the site and using its clues to piece together a new mystery.</p>
<p>This post will include light spoilers about the alternate reality game (ARG), so if you'd prefer not to be spoiled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/"><strong>please retreat now</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>

<p>With several references to Silent Hill's own serial killer, Walter Sullivan, the website offers loads of information about the town, including confirmation that despite its, uh, troubling past, people still "live" there today (at least, in ARG form).</p>
<p>However, Sullivan and his victims are mentioned in Silent Hill 2, too, leading some to think the Silent Hill 4 references are a red herring, not least because the website includes several screenshots seemingly taken from the upcoming remake.</p>
<p>After solving the site's dozens of puzzles, fans then discovered an all-new email-based story.</p>
<p>"From this point forward, the line between reality and fiction will begin to blur," reads a hidden page on the website. "To establish communications with the world of Silent Hill, you will need to use this email software." It then links to what appears to be an email client.</p>
<p>As the statement outlines, these "blurring" of the lines and interactive elements sound a lot like the rumours we heard about the defunct Silent Hills, which at some point, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hills-reportedly-would-have-sent-players-real-life-emails-or-text-messages">was reportedly going to send players real-life emails and text messages</a>.</p>
<p>Fans were then invited to share their email and, in some instances, physical addresses, and warned that it would likely "take a few days" to resolve the story. They were then asked not to share URLs (presumably not to spoil anyone's fun).</p>
<p>Later, players were told to send an anonymous email account a video of them burning a leaflet - the same leaflet that Bubble Head Nurses have been giving out at the Silent Hill stand at the Tokyo Game Show this week.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>As for what's next? Who knows. Fans are still busy deciphering the clues.</p>
<p>However, the story that unfolds through the website, puzzles, and emails hint at a strong connection to Silent Hill 4: The Room. Right now, we're still unsure if this suggests a remake is on the way or - given that the ARG talks of murders still happening in 2024 - a brand new game extending The Room's grim storyline is in the works. A Silent Hill: The Room - Part 2, perhaps.</p>
<p>Given NoCode is working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a> and NeoBards is working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, it's thought this is an entirely different, unannounced project, most likely developed by an internal team at Konami or an external Japanese studio.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, it's certainly keeping fans occupied as we wait for Silent Hill 2 Remake to launch on 8th October (or 6th, for those forking out for the deluxe edition).</p>
<p>Sony recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-ps5-console-exclusive-for-one-year">Silent Hill 2 Remake will be exclusive to PlayStation 5 for one year</a>. According to a new trailer released this time last week, Bloober Team's highly-anticipated remake will become available on "other formats" on 8th October, 2025.</p>
<p>"In rebuilding such a beloved classic with upgraded visuals and controls, the new combat style fits in surprisingly well," Tom wrote in Eurogamer's excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding">Silent Hill 2 Remake preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Konami have delivered a new look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and once again it’s all cut scenes and no gameplay, but we do get a look at The Boss, Colonel Volgin, and Revolver Ocelot.&nbsp; We also get our first look at Eva, the KGB agent who will provide support throughout the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater TGS 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p66fcP-u0NM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A Metal Gear game remake had long been rumoured before Metal Gear Delta: Snake Eater was eventually confirmed and announced back in May. At the same time, Konami confirmed a remastered Master Collection featuring Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remakes the PS2 classic in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>As for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, very little is known about it, especially when it comes to gameplay. We don’t know if Konami has modernised anything, but we do know that Hideo Kojima’s name has been wiped from the title.</p>
<p>The story is as follows:</p>

<p><em>In the middle of the Cold War, Naked Snake, the man who would later be known as Big Boss, infiltrates the Soviet Union to help a scientist named Sokolov defect. However, the mission ends in failure when Snake’s mentor—The Boss, a soldier known as the mother of special forces—betrays him, and Sokolov is captured by Colonel Volgin of the GRU.</em></p>
<p><em>One week later, Snake returns to the same Soviet territory to rescue Sokolov and eliminate The Boss—a mission that will mark the start of a new legend, amid the backdrop of an ever-changing scene, the game’s central theme.</em></p>
<p><em>This epic installment tells the story of the birth of the hero known as Big Boss, the very start of the Metal Gear Saga.</em></p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater does not have a release date but it is expected to launch sometime next year.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2515020/view/4685522407035993829?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Update 1.01</a> aims to improve game stability, add controller options, and address several other issues. As part of the game stability improvement, the update resolves an issue that caused frame rate drops under unspecified conditions. The update also enabled Bluetooth connectivity for DualSense and DualShock controllers, fixes character graphics not displaying properly on certain screens, some UI issues, incorrect text display, errors in the ending credits, and unexpected crashing issues under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI finally launched this month on PC, complete with the DLC expansions released on PlayStation 5. Even without them, the latest main entry in the long-running series is more than worth anyone's time, as highlighted by Kai in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/"> review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. It is <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-rumors-intensify-ahead-of-tgs-2024/">rumored</a> that the game will eventually be released on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but no official announcement has been made to date.</p>
