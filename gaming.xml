			<p>Atomfall surpassed Rebellion's expectations by far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-blows-past-2-million-players-in-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching over two million players in just one month</a>, and its presence on Game Pass was definitely helpful toward that goal. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley heaped praise on Microsoft and their subscription service:</p>
<p><em>It's been a huge success. Microsoft has been a fantastic partner to work with, they've really leaned in to helping us. They brought their skills and their scale to bear on our small project, and it's done really, really well for them, so they got a good deal, we got a good deal out of it as well.</em></p>
<p><em>With Game Pass, you can get people to try it, then as a result of those people trying it, they like it, and they then tell their mates on social media, 'I found this game on Game Pass, I really enjoyed it, you should have a go.' And then some of them are on Game Pass, and will play it. But some of them aren't on Game Pass, and will also want to be part of that conversation. So, they'll go and buy it. </em><em>At least, that's our theory – we don't have the data in for that. But Chris and I both feel, one of the biggest challenges for a company like us is discovery. And Game Pass has allowed for a lot of discovery for our game.</em></p>
<p><em>It does mitigate risk, because without going into details, they guarantee you a certain level of income, regardless of what it will sell for. But it potentially has a knock-on effect. Places like Xbox sales, for example. You could argue that all the hardcore are on Game Pass, and they're the ones that might buy a new IP like this, so therefore, are you cannibalising one section of the audience? And I think, perhaps, yes, a little bit. But what you gain from that cost is disproportionate.</em></p>
<p>Atomfall <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/801800/view/497192590186120441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just got a bug-fixing update</a> yesterday.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Bethesda is still to announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but there's no denying the project is real and ready to launch.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots and details of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake were dug up from developer Virtuos' website</a>. Now, references to the project have been found on Bethesda's own website too - including code for a "Buy Now" button that has since been removed. 
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer previously reported, it's understood that Bethesda's current plans are to shadow drop the game next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But nothing has been officially announced - for now.

<p>
Still, Bethesda is clearly readying for next week behind the scenes, with some overly-eager website updating that - of course - caught the eye of fans. 
</p>
<p>
"I was digging through the source code of bethesda.net and found a reference to 'oblivion-remastered' in the Google Tag Manager setup," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5">fan posted on reddit</a>, showing a screenshot of the code in situ. 
</p>
<p>
"It points to this URL: https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/oblivion-remastered The page isn't live yet, but what's interesting is that I checked the Google Tag Manager container on the Wayback Machine, and this reference wasn't there as of April 10th. So it looks like it was added very recently!"
</p>
<p>
The code has now been removed - just as the screenshots from Virtuos' website were too. But, of course, copies are now all over the internet, and you can still see the original files in place via an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415122013/https://www.virtuosgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/">archived version of Virtuos' website</a>.
</p>
<p>After years of leaks and an even lengthier wait for a new entry in The Elder Scrolls series (don't look up how long ago Skyrim landed), fans don't have long to go now. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">"remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. Maybe that could come next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tabletop Tavern is, currently, not quite where it needs to be to properly scratch that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> itch. The units can be a bit flaky, charges lack impact, and there's just not enough to do to keep early battles interesting. What is it, however, is a great concept with a lot of personality: you're playing actual tabletop miniatures inside a medieval tavern, gradually building up your army across Slay The Spire style branching progression nodes. I'm absolutely rooting for it, simply because there's still so little offering a comparable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> experience to Total War, and also because it's made by a solo dev. Trailer below, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337380/Tabletop_Tavern/">here's a Steam demo</a>.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, when the world was young, god still loved us, and no-one was trying to force AI assistants into my toothbrush, Warhammer makers Games Workshop had the absolutely wild idea that building a community might actually help them sell a few toys, and so used to host regular games in stores. It's the sort of thing you have to find a club these days for mostly, but that's the framing here: you've settled in for a bit of wargaming and a pint of ale or six in your local tavern.</p>
<p>A lot of the controls will be immediately familiar to Total War players - the Ctrl-Alt-drag formation shift even makes an appearance, as do the little triangles to denote individual units within formations. Much like Total War, you've got your rock-paper-scissors infantry-cavalry-ranged archetypes, along with different types of terrain and weather. Pikeman have an anti-large bonus, shielded units are handy at blocking missiles, and so on. But it's also just far less gloomy than Warhammer in general, with classic blinding green flock mats and notably less screaming about how Sigmar has abandoned us.</p>
<p>Again, it needs some work - there's not much impact feedback, and so things feel a little limp. Plus, the gradual army building of the roguelike structure means early skirmishes are quite similar. Still, the events between battles to restore unit health or perhaps recruit a few bonus mates are a great touch, and I'm eager to see how this one develops. Between this and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/real-time-tactics-game-strategos-aims-to-outflank-total-war-with-over-120-factions-at-launch">Strategos</a>, it's always good to see more games giving Creative Assembly a friendly poke out of complete complacency. Throw in an army painter, and I'm yours.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the biggest technical surprises when it comes to the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console was that it would support features like HDR (High Dynamic Range displays) and VRR (Variable Refresh Rate). However, as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-scrubs-mentions-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-supporting-vrr-on-a-tv-while-docked.1166361/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by a ResetEra user</a>, any mention of VRR being available when setting the console in docked (or TV) mode has been removed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canadian</a> websites.</p>
<p>The description used to say:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR, VRR, and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>Now, though, it has been modified to:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-More-details-about-features-2790188.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British website</a> still features the original description, hence the confusion. Needless to say, we'll reach out to Nintendo to try and get clarification on the subject. It would be very underwhelming if docked mode truly lacked variable refresh rate, which would be critical for a smooth gameplay experience when playing at 4K on the console.</p>
<p>This does not affect handheld mode, which has built-in NVIDIA G-SYNC through a native DisplayPort 1.4 connection. The speculation is that variable refresh rate might be lost in the conversion from DisplayPort to the HDMI output needed for docked mode.</p>
<p>In other slightly weird Nintendo Switch 2 news, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-do-not-support-cloud-saves.1166340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild nor The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will support the cloud save backup feature</a> that is included with the Nintendo Switch Online premium membership. To clarify, it will still be possible to transfer saves from the original Nintendo Switch, but users won't be able to create new cloud saves in these versions.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World fans will want to tune in to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated Direct stream later today</a>.</p>

            <p>It's soon bank holiday weekend for us in the UK, which means I'll be doing two things: sleeping and eating. Maybe I'll eat a duvet or two! Who knows. Four days with no imposed structure is enough time for things to <em>get weird</em>. Maybe I'll eat your duvet! No. Not again. Have to calm down.  I'll simply distract myself with the "culinary quest" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hungry-horrors">Hungry Horrors</a> - a game that, I must admit, I'm mainly drawn to because I'm not sure I've ever seen Yorkshire Pudding employed as an upgrade before.</p>

<p>If you hadn't noticed from all the pickled eggs, shortbread, and some sort of regional abomination called 'Toad In <em><strong>A</strong></em> Hole'? (literally unplayable), Hungry Horrors takes influence from British and Irish folklore and what they're calling 'authentic regional dishes'. I'm yet to spot my own authentic regional dish, the Super Noodle sandwich, but it's not too late. The idea is that you'll serve food to folkloric creatures to stop them snacking on you instead. Each creature has their own preferences, whether that be a yen for sweet food or a dislike for fish, and you'll have to work out what these are.</p>
<p>It's roguelikely in structure, and you'll return to your base after each run to try out new recipes. Here's a little more from the Steam page, which also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048840/Hungry_Horrors/">houses a demo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Meet Black Annis, Jenny Greenteeth, Grendel, and other legendary beings straight from Celtic, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh legends. Each creature you encounter has been terrifying the people of these lands for centuries, challenging you to outwit their monstrous appetites".</p></blockquote>
<p>Dev team hungry horrors recently got caught in pickle of their own, having to <a href="https://clumsybearstudio.com/blog/post-008-launching-our-first-steam-demo.html">evacuate the Bangkok apartment they were living and working in</a> following the Myanmar earthquake. Given the circumstances, I suppose I can forgive 'Toad In A Hole', although just barely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Virtuos Games' remaster of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </a>is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-images-discovered-on-virtuos-games-website">all but confirmed</a> to be releasing later this month, and honestly, even that "all but" is looking shaky.

<p>If you've been following all this, you may have noticed that the timing of the remaster's (or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">remake's</a>?) release is a little bit, um, <em>convenient</em>. The team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">Skyblivion</a> - a full remake of Oblivion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine - is also due to release this year. While it's obviously tempting to frame this as the monstrous cads at Bethesda n' chums taking a power-hose grade widdle on the dreams, work, beds, and pets of volunteer modders, it seems the modders themselves aren't too bothered.</p>
<p>"The real remake is the friends we made along the way," says <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912137244036522179">Skyblivion lead KRebel</a>. "This changes nothing for me. This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community its a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster."</p>
<p>This echo earlier statements made to our <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remaster-leak-skyblivion-project-lead-stay-positive">network chums at VG247</a>. "I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined, friends, experience and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry which I ended up doing," KRebel said. "At the end of the day it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all."</p>
<p>And that's the key point here, I think. The official remaster has presumably been in the works for many years at this point. Bethesda knew it was coming, and still allowed the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> team to carry on doing their thing. The result? Well, it means we've all got a more bucolic Tamriel to visit when the official version's seemingly ubiquitous 2005 shooter piss-filter gets too much.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Over the last two months, both current and former Gamurs employees tell us things have only gotten worse.</p><p>Successive waves of layoffs have hit the network in February, March and April of this year, impacting not just many of the sites’ full-time editorial staff, but people <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/media-company-gamurs-group-reportedly-lays-off-more-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher up</a> at Gamurs as well including, we’re told, a large part of the company's SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) team, as well as those employed in positions like marketing, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamurs-group-reportedly-lays-off-more-staff-shuts-down-pc-invasion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content strategy</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/media-company-gamurs-group-reportedly-lays-off-more-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assignment editors</a>.</p><p>Former employees tell us that using the network's Slack userbase as a metric, there were approximately 320 workers registered on the company's account in late 2024, a number that by this week has dwindled to around 260. Of those remaining, a large number are freelance workers who say they have not only been kept in the dark about these dramatic workplace changes, receiving no notices or announcements from company leadership, but are contracted to sites that don't appear to have operating budgets for the immediate future.&nbsp;</p><p>We've been shown screenshots of internal Slack messages frequently rejecting these workers’ pitches at some of Gamurs' biggest websites by citing budget constraints, which recently laid-off writers speculate is part of a wider cost-cutting measure (Freelancers for Gamurs sites are paid by the post and must pitch stories to editors).</p><p>After this week's layoffs, The Escapist–which lost a number of full-time staff–is mostly now posting Roblox guides. Destructoid has lost several key writers and is now being updated with stories mostly being produced, we're told, by former DotEsports staff who have&nbsp; been moved over, with DotEsports now updating at a much slower pace than previously.</p><figure><figcaption>AOTF was purchased by Gamurs in 2022 as a site 'for all things relating to video games'</figcaption></figure><p>Twinfinite, which also lost staff, was last updated on March 27, while Attack Of The Fanboy--once a nerd culture site, but which had recently pivoted to celebrity gossip and political content--hasn't seen a new post since March 28. Siliconera and The Mary Sue, also affected by layoffs and resignations, are both down to just a handful of new stories a day.</p><p>PC Invasion, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamurs-group-reportedly-lays-off-more-staff-shuts-down-pc-invasion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply doesn't exist anymore</a>; the site now redirects to Prima Games, the once-mighty guides label that Gamurs purchased in 2022, with some of PC Invasion’s content moved under its masthead.&nbsp;</p><p>Former staff also tell us that, despite laying off successive waves of writers throughout 2025, Gamurs has been actively trying to recruit writers from regions like<a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/?#positions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> India, the Philippines and the Balkans</a>. Former staff speculated this could be because these workers can be paid less than writers from the US or United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's accurate to say that entire chunks of the network have just been shut down at this point", one former full-time staffer told Aftermath. Others we've spoken to wonder if the continued layoffs, coupled with silence from the company's leadership, could indicate that Gamurs is either about to be sold or is looking for a sale.</p><p>“Almost everyone [at my site] has been laid off over several waves, the most recent of which happened this morning”, one former Gamurs writer told us. ”Entire websites, like the Escapist and Twinfinite, are just sitting basically dormant. We're all speculating Gamurs are going to sell.”</p><p>“Right now operations have ground to a halt”, another full-time writer, recently laid off, says. “[Ownership] shutting down sites just seems inevitable, especially because they’ve always been willing to just let people go for literally no reason other than to try and save on overheads”.</p><p>I reached out to Gamurs for comment on this story.

The dance has become incredibly popular, to the point of being shouted out in Charli XCX's tour and shared on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlixcx/video/7389277177629379872?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charli XCX's TikTok</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/dress-to-impress-brat-update-promo-1744834699035.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's unsurprising that Roblox wanted the Apple Dance as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dress-to-impress/Brat_Update_Details_and_Patch_Notes_(DTI_Charli_XCX_Collaboration)">collaboration between Charli XCX and one of the most popular games within Roblox</a>: creative fashion contest game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dress-to-impress-roblox">Dress to Impress</a>. Spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/559582/charli-xcx-apple-dance-roblox-lawsuit" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>, the lawsuit in question was filed last week in California, in which Heyer claims that originally, Robox did contact her to license the Apple Dance for the crossover event. Heyer says that she was open to the idea of the dance being licensed if the terms were right - she even <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kelley.heyer/video/7448063559411584299" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed it to Fortnite</a> and Netflix via actual, signed agreements - but never reached an actual agreement with Roblox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heyer alleges that Robox released the Apple Dance emote for sale in the event before negotiations were ever completed and without Heyer giving her consent for its use. Heyer says that Roblox sold over 60,000 Apple Dance emotes, resulting in an estimated $123,000 in sales. The suit also argues that while the emote was a part of a Charli XCX event, the dance emote itself is unattached to the song or Charli XCX, and thus is solely Heyer's intellectual property.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suit accuses Roblox of copyright infringement and unjust enrichment, and requests relief in the form  of the profits Roblox received from the dance plus damages as a result of Roblox harming Heyer's brand and Heyer herself, plus attorney's fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 2:15 p.m. PT: </strong>Heyer's attoney, Miki Anzai, shared the following statement: "Roblox moved forward using Kelley's IP without a signed agreement. Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-combat-zone-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-review"><u>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</u></a> is an electrifying animated Netflix series that debuted in 2022 and left me gobsmacked. Across 10 episodes, we rip through Night City alongside protagonists David and Lucy as they confront the terrors of the concrete hellscape while stuck between two warring MegaCorps. This brilliant anime is full of potential and is too damn good to be forgotten. Thankfully, it's now been reanimated via cardboard and plastic, allowing players to explore some of the key moments of the series through a refined tabletop miniatures game that's as razor sharp as the Cyberpunk 2077 setting.</p><div catalogid="ee2f861d-896e-452c-918b-38684ca2ff50" id="217983"><div id="217983" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The setup mimics the show – one player controls Maine and his crew of merc edgerunners, and another the Arasaka paramilitary team. Players select a scenario and then craft their gang from a selection of characters based on the assigned points value for the mission. Maine’s group can include any of the main protagonists of the series, including David, Lucy, and Rebecca. Arasaka has a mixed cast of faceless grunts alongside more menacing options such as the braindance editor Jimmy Kurosaki and massive hulk Adam Smasher. You can outfit team members with various weapons and cybergear, allowing for advanced tactics and more nuanced options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the strengths of this game is that the system it uses is already seasoned. The ruleset is identical to publisher Monster Fight Club’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-red-combat-zone-tabletop-game-review">Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone</a> miniatures game. I’ve already written many words about this excellent tabletop skirmish game, and I am more than pleased to see it return with a fresh exoskeleton. It’s really a top-notch ruleset that hasn't received the acclaim it deserves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting aspect is the activation system. Characters are allotted color-coded action tokens that are spent to roll matching dice. The stronger actions allow you to move farther or roll larger dice, such as a 12-sider, to perform various activities. The active player chooses one of their characters to activate, and then spends their assigned tokens to sprint across the board, attack their foe, or perform special actions such as netrunning or completing a scenario objective. There is added texture through leadership abilities allowing you to activate additional models out of order, or the option to react when wounded. This creates a dynamic flow to play with a controlled chaos that blends player agency with unpredictability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This splendid system is interesting in that it evokes a sense of resource management for players to puzzle over. Each action is precious and needs to be spent for maximum gain. For instance, if Dario is being targeted by an Arasaka Point Man, do you spend her best action token for the opposed defensive roll, or do you go with a weaker action to save her best die for later in the turn? This decision process evokes a similar feel to tactical board games, such as some of the more inspired <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawler board games</a>. It’s more opaque than traditional miniatures games such as Kill Team or Frostgrave. This quality isn’t a total surprise, as the founders of Monster Fight Club have a long established history, having designed hit board games such as Spartacus: A Game of Blood and Treachery and Star Trek: Ascendancy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the system here is identical to Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone, the content is certainly not. In addition to swapping out Night City gangs for edgerunner mercs and Megacorp goons, the plastic miniatures of that previous box have been abandoned in lieu of stylish acryllic standees. This style of plastic faux 3D figure has started to become popular in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> hobby, but it hasn’t quite been experimented with on the same scale in miniatures games. Monster Fight Club is looking to spearhead this movement as these standees are incredibly appealing for both ease of play and striking aesthetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the reasons the acrylic standees work so well in this game is that the characters' depictions are all grounded in the anime. The artistic style of the Edgerunners series is an iconic element of the property, so carrying it forward to the miniatures game is an enormous win. The sleek tone of the figures blends well with the cyberpunk terrain and battlefield, merging for an overall enhanced visual field that is fantastic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The standees are such an enormous benefit to the game that I can’t imagine the average wargamer opting for miniatures instead. Look, all of us that play these types of games have scads of unpainted figures occupying our shelves. This switch to illustrated acrylic standees is such a breath of fresh air, as it allows you to just dive into the game with virtually no assembly or prep time. And for many, they will look better than the average paint-job we are capable of. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The standees are such an enormous benefit to the game that I can’t imagine the average wargamer opting for miniatures instead.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some may instead find that desire for full-blown miniatures eating away at their soul. Fret not, for an <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxX4mx?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aftermarket option</a> does allow for a return to plastic multi-part miniatures. It’s a pricey option that will certainly increase your overall burden in entering this game, and I certainly find it entirely unnecessary, but it’s an option that’s there for collectors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The terrain is of similar exceptional quality to the magnificent Cyerpunk Red: Combat Zone kit. Cardboard buildings, rubble, and barricades are composed of thick chipboard that slots together with ease. The surface is a sturdy mounted board similar to that found in hobby board games. There’s no paper mat needing an immediate upgrade here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This line of Cyberpunk miniatures games are also well supported with aftermarket purchases of Monster Fight Club’s various <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EB3G?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">plastic terrain options</a>. They have crafted some of the best cargo containers in the industry, and have expanded that series of products to include walkways, crates, and various other small scatter options. It’s incredible stuff that rivals the top-notch cardboard options in the core box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone is an impressive box. It once again includes a fully featured <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign</a> reminiscent of its peers such as Necromunda and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcry-heart-of-ghur-brings-big-changes-to-the-tabletop-game">Warcry</a>. Players can take their gang through multiple battles and increase their characters' potency. Eventually your gang will reach the end of their story and engage in a climactic finale that wraps up their narrative. Campaign play isn't a requirement, however, as the game performs exceptionally well in one-off skirmishes. The wide range of scenario options are exciting and varied, affording for a large amount of experimentation.

The characters are well realized, with abilities and play-styles that reflect the Netflix series. David, for instance, can really dig into cybergear and run wild. Adam Smasher is scary as hell. Lucy can netrun with the best of them. Owners of Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone products may be pleased to find out that you can mix content across games. Since both utilize the same core ruleset, they are fully compatible for those wanting to explore anachronistic conflicts that jump across the timeline. Regardless of Combat Zone experience, this new boxed set feels singular and expansive, offering a tailored skirmish game that is fantastic in its own right.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2rAp?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6odK3?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YDp5?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">See more board games based on video games</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 16, 2025 7:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">This is a wonderful miniatures skirmish game that begs consideration.

                <p>Ubisoft is reportedly making a new battle royale game that's inspired by Apex Legends, so much so that the project once used the game as a thumbnail.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ubisoft-is-developing-a-new-battle-royale-heavily-inspired-by-apex-legends/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft's new battle royale game is codenamed "Scout" and has been in development for a few years already. Its characters are said to be similar to Apex Legends' own Pathfinder, Wraith, and Lifeline, as well as others.</p><p>The company's higher-ups reportedly wants to take advantage of Apex Legends' dwindling player base. As a result, they are said to think that there's now an opportunity to launch another battle royale game. This is despite Ubisoft's internal research team indicating that engagement in battle royale games is on the decline.</p><p>Ubisoft has already entered the battle royale genre with Hyper Scape.

Luckily, <i>Warcrow</i> creators Corvus Belli (makers of the fantastic sci-fi wargame <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-guide" rel="nofollow">Infinity</a>) just sent us the latest release for the game, units from the brand new, elf-esque Syenann faction. Let’s dig in and see what they’re all about!</p>

<p><em>*Tariff Note: Due to the constantly changing tariff situation at the time of this writing, this product, though scheduled to launch this month, may be delayed*</em></p>

<h2>&nbsp;<b>Who Are The Syenann?</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-group-shot.jpg?itok=t605XT2z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-group-shot.jpg?itok=LChKAYiX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In <i>Warcrow</i>, the Syenann are guardians of the great forests of the world of <i>Warcrow</i>, who like to stalk in the shadows and strike without warning. Using the forest to their advantage, and always with an eye toward gaining the upper hand on their opponents via their natural surroundings, the Syenann are a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>This Action Pack, which serves as a great starter kit for this upcoming army, contains the following units:</p>

<ul><li>3 Protector of the Forest minis</li>
	<li>2 Shadows of the Yew minis</li>
	<li>1 Druid mini</li>
	<li>1 Ynyr Daá Lainn mini</li>
	<li>1 Grand Captain mini</li>
	<li>1 Aiodos mini</li>
	<li>1 Alula mini</li>
	<li>1 Lioslaith Coic Caledhee mini</li>
</ul><p>With exactly enough miniatures to field for each troop (most or one-off’s) you’ll have everything you need to dive in. Now let’s take a look at each troop, and speak briefly about what they do on the field.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Protectors of the Forest</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-protectors-of-the-forest.jpg?itok=hSaOx3UC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-protectors-of-the-forest.jpg?itok=ulLI6uDp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Protectors of the Forest are your boots on the ground unit for the Syenann. With impressive movement (they’re a 4-4 [10]), they hit hard from afar with their main attack, an 18 range rolling one red and three orange dice (if you’re not familiar with the mechanics of the game… that’s pretty darn far, and pretty darn hard-hitting).</p>

<p>Their two special abilities thematically link them to the whole army’s role as assassins in the forest. Their “Sharp Archers” ability says that if you inflict damage on a ranged attack, the target suffers one stress. That pairs with their “Stalking from the Forest” ability, which allows you to move this unit a short distance if they’re within 5 strides of a forest terrain piece of an allied unit.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Shadows of the Yew</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-shadows-of-the-yew.jpg?itok=DX7QgL4w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-shadows-of-the-yew.jpg?itok=FKcK3Mec 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But if you thought the Protectors of the Forest were assassin-like, wait until you see the Shadows of the Yew. This two-unit infantry troop moves even faster, strikes with two red dice, one orange, and one yellow (melee), and has lots of “switches” that allow it to cancel your opponents defenses, inflict extra damage, slip out of trouble, and cancel hits.</p>

<p>Their special abilities are also pretty impressive, with “Camouflaged” making it extremely hard to hit them from a distance, and “Silent and Precise” that shut down a lot of enemy options when you charge in on the attack.</p>

<p>Now let’s move onto talking about characters included in this pack.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Grand Captain</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-1.jpeg?itok=CaduZ3Js 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-1.jpeg?itok=O7EXTeX0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Grand Captain is a unit that can be attached to another Infantry unit, or fielded on their own. They attack hard with ranged and melee weapon options, and when attached to a unit they offer up free hits per attack.</p>

<p>Their special ability “Maneuvers in the Forest” allows them to command up to two friendly units within 5 strides of a forest to position themselves next to the forest, and their “Ambushing Tactics” ability gives all allied units the ability to re-roll melee attack rolls if they’re close to a forest.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Lioslaith Cóic Caledhee</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-lioslaith.jpg?itok=aRWsURBf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-lioslaith.jpg?itok=CvCdw1Nl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lioslaith is another High Command unit that can be attached to an infantry unit, but on her own she’s a very fearsome warrior. With a hard-hitting melee attack (each roll is a red, two yellow, a defensive blue, and an auto-hit), and switches that allow her in offense to cancel blocks and in defense to move herself away from a fight, she’s brutal on the field.</p>

<p>Her special ability “Encircling Defense” lets allied units within 5 of a forest or an allied unit ignore 1 damage per activation, and her extremely powerful “Scabbard of Nuada” ability allows you, once per game, to ignore damage that would kill her, remove all damage from her character, and move her away (at the cost of two stress).</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Ynyr Dará Lainn</b></h2>

<p>This feather-bound character takes to the skies to attack! With a very interesting move allowing them to charge up to 20 (!!), and his special abilities are all about swooping in, attacking, and getting away.</p>

<p>“Death from the Skies” let’s you engage with an enemy 10 or less away and attack with an extra yellow dice, while his “To The Sky” ability allows you to remove him from the battlefield, remove all stress from him, and then re-deploy him using the scout rules.</p>


<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-2.jpeg?itok=bPC_XI0J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-2.jpeg?itok=8iqYv0pV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Druid is the magic-user of the group, with a very weak attack and average movement, but their use of magic sets them apart. Their “Punish the Intruder” ability is a ranged attack with heavy damage potential (and the ability to risk negative Tinge for extra stress added to the enemy).</p>

<p>Their “Exalting the Troops” special lasts 4 turns, and gives allied units nearby an extra orange die on all their attacks (with the ability to risk tinge to remove stress from themselves, or add a different colored die). And perhaps their most interesting ability is the “Defenders of the Great Forest” ability, which lets them just plop down a fresh piece of forest scenery!</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Alula</b></h2>

<p>Alula is a character unit built for getting the jump on the enemy. Their special ability “Surprise Attack” lets them jump into battle when another friendly unit within 10 strides of them is engaged. That enemy unit also receives the “disarmed” state, and you get to make an opportunity attack against them.</p>

<p>Add to that their “Vanguard Observant” ability, which basically allows all allied units to draw line of sight from anything <i>this unit</i> can see, and it’s clear the Alula is meant to wander off on his own, jump into surprise fights, and give your allies a clear view of the battlefield.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-3.jpeg?itok=5x8IT1cB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-3.jpeg?itok=rCa2ucQ9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Aoidos</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-aoidos.jpg?itok=Bt2eDOUc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-aoidos.jpg?itok=9xoEjpnS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, there’s Adidos, another character unit that can join infantry. Their spell, “Ballad of the Dryad,” gives an enemy unit within 15 strides of them a state of your choice (usually you’d likely want to make them stressed or disarmed). And, if they don’t pass a Willpower test with two successes, you can choose an ability on their profile and they can’t use it until the spell wears off (3 turns).</p>

<p>Their “Dance to My Tune” ability also inflicts stress on enemy units who fail a WP test, making them a walking problem for all enemies nearby.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Building The Kit</b></h2>

<p><i>Warcrow</i> prides itself on not including complicated models that need a whole booklet of instructions to put together, but I did find it difficult, at times, to know exactly how a specific piece was supposed to fit. Also, these are resin miniatures, so if you’ve gotten spoiled by the instant gratification of plastic glue on plastic minis, you’ll have to resort back to superglue for these <i>Warcrow</i>.</p>

<p>That being said, most models were, indeed, very intuitive to build, with each unit packaged separately so you know you’re not cross-pollinating bows and arrows across units.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Final Thoughts</b></h2>

<p>This is a very, very slippery army. I love when elf-type armies are represented not as high-magic, civilized, or haughty - but as animalistic or like a true force of nature. These are definitely your archetypical wood elves, and I love the look of them.</p>

<p>With rules that rely on forest terrain, you’ll need to ensure you’ve got enough when going into battle to get the most out of this army. Without any forests, you’re kind of losing out on the whole point of the army - this could be a downside, if you were hoping to just build them up, grab some random buildings from your terrain shelf, and get them into the action.</p>

<p>But when all is said and done, the Syenann are an army that brings a whole new dimension to this brand new game - trading brute force for precise strikes and an overload of stress on your opponents.</p>

                <p>Sony has <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1912571352495665235" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">increased the price for PlayStation Plus subscriptions in Canada</a>. This is the first price hike <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-price-increases-announced-for-all-tiers-premium-plan-going-up-40-year/1100-6517342/" data-ref-id="1100-6517342">since September 2023</a> when Sony last increased prices in the region.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps-plus-extra-goes-from-159-99cad-to-189-99cad-in-canada.1166082/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">email reportedly sent to subscribers</a>, Sony explained the price increase, saying, "The price for your current PlayStation Plus Extra 12 month subscription will be increased to CAD 189.99. This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service."</p><p>Unfortunately, Sony isn't offering any new perks for PS Plus to help offset the price increases. Still, players will have access to the PS Plus Catalog and free monthly games by subscribing to the service. It's unclear what impact tariffs may be having on these price increases, but experts have suggested that tariff-related increases won't be limited to US pricing.</p><p>The new prices in Canadian dollars are as follows:</p><ul><li>PlayStation Plus Essential 12-month subscription — $110 (previously $95)</li><li>PlayStation Plus Extra 12-month subscription — $190 (previously $155)</li><li>PlayStation Plus Premium 12-month subscription — $225 (previously $190)</li></ul><p>Sony already announced that it would be raising <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/ps-plus-price-hikes-strike-even-more-countries" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS Plus prices in other countries starting today such as South America and Australia</a>.
