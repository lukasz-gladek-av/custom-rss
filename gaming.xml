            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, Sega confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> guest characters such as Hatsune Miku, Ichiban Kasuga (Yakuza), Joker (Persona 5), and even Steve, Alex, and Creeper from Minecraft. But the guest characters do not stop there. Sega has now announced a Nickelodeon collaboration that brings SpongeBob SquarePants to the track — and teased Avatar and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a kart racer packed with Sega characters and as such celebrates the company’s history. In addition, big-name guest characters are helping to flesh out the roster of racers. As part of that, those who buy the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Digital Deluxe Edition get the Season Pass, which includes the Nickelodeon content as well as the recently announced Minecraft characters, vehicles, and tracks, characters from the Netflix series, Sonic Prime, and two more yet-to-be-announced collaborations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer below shows off SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star racing the Patty Wagon, a vehicle shaped like a Krabby Patty from the SpongeBob SquarePants series, across the Bikini Bottom track (Bikini Bottom is the main setting in the SpongeBob SquarePants series).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has said CrossWorlds will feature a huge roster of over playable characters, if you include DLC. Characters you’d expect to see, such as Sonic, Dr. Eggman, Knuckles, Shadow, and Tails are present and correct, but now you can add the likes of SpongeBob SquarePants into the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CrossWorlds is of course going up against Switch 2 exclusive kart game Mario Kart World, which has so far resisted adding guest characters from outside the Nintendo pantheon. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set for release on both the Switch and the Switch 2, so it looks like we’ll be set for some old-fashioned Mario vs. Sonic kart racing rivalry when Sega's effort launches in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently went <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-hands-on-preview">hands-on with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> and came away impressed. “It’s a vibe,” we said, “and one that I’ve enjoyed and will look forward to drifting through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Footage of the next Battlefield game is once again popping up online, this time of its single-player campaign.</p>
<p>Despite requiring participants to sign an NDA before they can get involved, playtest players continue to find a way to share all manner of things, from clips of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhifj5/bf6_campaign/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gameplay</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/all_of_the_bf_labs_subfactions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">factions</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhny43/gear_customization_heading_in_the_right_direction/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gear customisation options</a>, and details of its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lh7bzp/how_do_you_feel_about_battle_royale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">battle royale</a>.</p>
<p>This leak of the single-player campaign seems to be one of the biggest yet, including locations of where players can expect to travel in the solo campaign, and the environments you can explore when you get there.</p>

<p>Some of this information appears to have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhm017/the_entire_menu_of_the_cracked_bf_labs_build/">datamined from the latest Battlefield Lab build</a>. There's plenty of unfinished images and assets, leading some fans to assert the game "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/comment/mz5eb63/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">looks like AI slop</a>" or "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/comment/mz5djnh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">fugly</a>" despite numerous statements from EA and the development teams that this is a work-in-progress with placeholder details that will be replaced when the game releases in full.</p> <div>

<p>The same thing happened with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a>. Despite branding the playtest as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" and requiring participants to sign an NDA, plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay footage popped up in various corners of the internet</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">EA was not happy</a>, eventually hitting back at a grumpy reddit thread about an unsupported claim about skill-based matchmaking with "Okay, enough".</p>
<p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst we don't yet have a release name or date, EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>. We also recently learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-major-battlefield-reveal-still-set-for-summer-as-mass-effect-bundle-takes-fans-by-surprise">Battlefield 2042 is getting a Mass Effect bundle</a>, as a series exec confirmed there's still a big Battlefield (2025) reveal set to come this summer.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remedy says it's hearing your feedback on FBC: Firebreak "loudly and clearly" and is committed to improving things, particularly the shooter's opening hour, "starting now".</p>
<p>Collating feedback from across social media, Discord, and Steam, the developer - for which Firebreak is its first self-published title - said that while "several things have gone well", "clearly, not everything has". Consequently, its first priority is to improve the game's "first hour experience", making progression faster and more rewarding.</p>

<p>"The game's first hours do not provide a great experience due to a combination of things. Some of this is down to a lack of onboarding (more about that in a bit), explaining the game’s systems, how to take advantage of the tools at your disposal, and a lack of clarity as to what to do in the Jobs and how to do the work effectively," the team <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2272540/announcements/detail/536605349656920275">said</a> in its first patch notes.</p>
<p>"In addition, the power fantasy isn’t great in the first hours of the game as starting (tier 1) weapons feel weak, and unlocking higher-tier weapons requires a bit too much grinding," the studio added. "We can see from the data and are seeing feedback that players who stick around and unlock more powerful tier 3 weapons and Perks, playing on higher Threat levels and Full three zone Job runs, are having a better time."</p>
<p>Because of this, Remedy says it wants to get you "to the fun faster", which also means getting us to the better tools and weapons. With better onboarding, user-interface clarity, and making Jobs easier to access, the studio thinks we'll get a more rewarding start.</p>
<p>That's not all, though.</p>
<p>"We hear you: the grind is too slow," the team added. "You want to try different builds, equip stronger weapons, use Altered Augments and experiment with Perks. Right now, getting to that takes too long.</p>
<p>"The upgrade economy was balanced with players finding a good amount of Lost Assets currency during Jobs, but as the currency (the folders on the ground) does not particularly stand out from the environments, players completely ignore them and are thus earning Lost Assets roughly 3x slower than hoped," the notes admitted. "Then, players do not earn Lost Assets unless they finish a job. If you exit a job midway or disconnect, you'll get nothing. That’s frustrating. We are looking into what we could do about this, but there are no changes to announce yet."</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-review">Eurogamer's FBC Firebreak review</a>, we awarded it 3 out of 5 stars, writing: "A bold approach to the concept of work marks this game out as a singular enterprise".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-hears-your-criticism-loudly-and-clearly-and-is-fixing-things-starting-now]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Digital Foundry Is &quot;Happy&quot; With Switch 2, But Feels The Screen Is &quot;Problematic&quot; 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/20b1277270269/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The tech boffins over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Digital Foundry</a> have delivered their final verdict on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">Switch 2</a>, and it's mostly positive—but the console's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">LCD screen</a> has been found wanting.</p>
<p>In his review, Digital Foundry boss and games media veteran Richard Leadbetter says that, overall, he's "happy" with Nintendo's new hybrid system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite being significantly larger than Switch 1, the thinness of the handheld remains much the same, making it feel significantly less bulky than Steam Deck and other PC handhelds. Similarly, the bigger screen can make for a more immersive experience and colour reproduction is significantly improved over the original model. What’s also surprising – and highly appreciated – is the number of games that either run at native 1080p in handheld mode (like Mario Kart World, for example) or use DLSS to upscale to 1080p, delivering pleasing results.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter likes the hardware in general, taking time to praise the new Joy Con controllers and even citing the "little ‘feet’ on the bottom of the unit" as praise-worthy. "This is the original Switch revised and refined into a generally more pleasing and more effective unit, delivering a proper generational upgrade with highly impressive efficiency."</p>
<p>However, the console's LCD display—<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/switch-2-launching-this-year-with-8-inch-lcd-screen-according-to-new-analyst-rumour">a point of contention even before the console was released</a>—proved "problematic in a number of ways" for the industry vet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo promised HDR, but an edge-lit LCD that barely tops out at 420 nits will never deliver anything like a decent high dynamic range experience with the signature HDR contrast and highlights almost completely absent in handheld play. Even more disappointing is motion quality: the Switch 2 LCD has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">blurring characteristics</a> that are easily worse than the 2017 Switch’s display. Side by side with the Switch OLED panel, the key problems with Nintendo’s choice for Switch 2 come into sharp focus – it’s simply nowhere near as good.</p>
<p>There are clear problems with Switch 2’s VRR (variable refresh rate) functionality too. Now, in theory, we believe that there’s no reason why it should not work effectively. The Switch 2 Welcome Tour software includes a VRR showcase that demonstrates what we think is a 40-120Hz VRR window, but crucially it also reveals support for LFC – low frame-rate compensation – outside of that window. A fully featured VRR on Switch 2 is possible!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Another minor grumble relates to the length of the supplied USB-C cables, which Leadbetter feels simply aren't long enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a couple of years since Crate Entertainment announced Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn, a new expansion coming to the hack-and-slash action RPG. Back then, the US-based studio estimated a launch in 2024, which clearly didn't happen.</p>
<p>Now, the developers have <a href="https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/fangs-of-asterkarn-development-update-june-2025/146114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a new progress update. The game has a chance of launching late this year, but Crate admitted it could be delayed to Spring or even early Summer 2026. In their partial defense, the developers noted that Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn will be by far the biggest expansion for the game, dwarfing <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-ashes-of-malmouth-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashes of Malmouth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-forgotten-gods-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forgotten Gods</a>:</p>
<p><em>To put things in perspective, by our current estimations, Fangs of Asterkarn will cover approximately 3.55sq. km, which makes it roughly 110% as big as Ashes of Malmouth. Kurnhold, the de-facto capital of the Kurn and the new quest hub, spans 4 zones, compared to the 1.5 that the Covenant of the Three took up in Forgotten Gods.</em></p>
<p><em>In all that world, there are, as of this writing, currently 47 main/side quests, and that number will likely continue to grow as we flesh out the content. Scattered across Asterkarn are 54 new bosses, including 8 new Nemesis encounters. Mechanically, these bosses will feature some of the most advanced skill tech Grim Dawn has had yet as we continue to push this aging engine to its absolute limits. If you have been keeping up with our updates, then you are already aware of the first superboss, the Dread, but another awaits you…somewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>From these bosses, and their minions, you will be looting over 380 new Unique items and 120 Monster Infrequents. This is not including Awakened Epic items, which is a list we are still working on and expect to grow post release, or Ascended common drops in Ascendant mode, which have 33 unique tertiary affixes found nowhere else in the game. All this is not even including the two roguelike dungeons we have planned post-release, which will expand the world and add another two rounds of new bosses and unique loot drops.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdawn/comments/1f89pgp/comment/lld78ko/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last official word</a> is that Crate Entertainment plans to release Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn for the Xbox One simultaneously with the PC version. The team <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-definitive-edition-xbox-release-date-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Grim Dawn Definitive Edition for Xbox One in December 2021, including both Ashes of Malmouth and Forgotten Gods.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/back-page-every-game-should-have-a-cow</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/back-page-every-game-should-have-a-cow.1225209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="We love Cow" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6c9dcef21db1d/we-love-cow.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>In the magazine business, the Back Page is where you'd find all the weird goofs that we couldn't fit in anywhere else. Some may call it "filler"; we prefer "a whole page to make terrible jokes that are tangentially related to the content of the mag".</em></p>
<p><em>We don't have pages on the internet, but we still love terrible jokes — so welcome to our semi-regular feature, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/back-page">Back Page</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I know what you're thinking. You just read that headline, and you said out loud to yourself: "Yes! I completely agree with this sentence. Never before have truer words been written onto the hallowed pages of the internet. All other journalists should pack up and quit, because this is the pinnacle of the craft; it simply does not get better from here."</p>
<p>I know. But I pitched 1,000 words, and so, that's what you'll get, even though you already agree with me. Woe! Such is my life.</p>
<p>So, here are a few examples of what every game on Switch could look like if they got smart, took a page out of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s book, and realised that what the world needs is 'More Cow'.</p>
<h2>Super Smash Bros.</h2>
<figure><a title="Smash Bros with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83f38ad7f2b6a/smash-bros-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>The great thing about Cow in SSB is that no one wants to beat up Cow — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"I main Kirby."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I've memorised every single Toon Link move."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can beat you with my eyes closed and one hand tied behind my back as any one of the indistinguishable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors">Fire Emblem</a> characters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Who cares</em>? Most of the characters in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros</a>. have opposable thumbs, or, at the very least, little hand-nubs like Jigglypuff and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> Villager. Fighting is pretty much a fist-based sport. You're all playing with the training wheels on.</p>
<p>And do you know what that means? Only <em>true</em> SSB aficionados would choose Cow – a character with no fists. Or arms. Cow doesn't even have an angry game-face, just a placid, terrifying smile, ready to strike fear into the hearts of every opponent like Pikachu wishes he could.</p>
<p>Bonus: you can refer to Cow as having a "moo-veset".</p>
<h3>Metroid</h3>
<figure><a title="Metroid with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43bdd945205a8/metroid-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mootroid Moosion. Samoos Aran. Et cetera — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so, you know the Metroids? The iconic jellyfish-like aliens from the series, which Samus has to kill and/or learn to love? Very scary and/or cute, right?</p>
<p>Sure, sure. But hear me out: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> is one of the most frequently played speedruns at the various Games Done Quick tournaments, and do you know what part gets the audience most excited? It's a little detour called <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/125534/what-is-super-metroids-save-or-kill-the-animals-incentive-sgdq-2021">Save the Animals</a>, where the speedrunner has to take precious seconds out of their time returning to an early room to free a bunch of space-birds and space-monkeys before the planet explodes, extinguishing all extant life.</p>
<p>So, we know people who play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> love animals. Why not give them what they really want – SPACE-COWS? Samus could ride them through the levels instead of having to Morph-Ball everywhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/seriously-what-the-heck-is-going-on-inside-samusr-morph-ball">which can't be good for her spine</a>.</p>
<h3>Splatoon</h3>
<figure><a title="Splatoon with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c4cf19b41a7d8/splatoon-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Look! The three flavours of milk! This game designs itself, really — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I commend Nintendo for discovering the fun combination of squids and ink, but let's be real: it could be any animal and the fluid it produces. Bees and honey. Horses and sweat. Hippos and blood. Why not cows and milk?</p>
<p>Imagine this: you're playing a game of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> (Spilt Milk Edition), and you've dressed up your cow in cool sunglasses and legwarmers. You load up your milk gun, which is directly attached to your character's udders, and let rip, spraying fresh 3.5% all over the floor like you think the dirt is cereal. You take out one of the enemy team (whose milk is a chocolatey brown) in a slippy, creamy massacre, before diving into the white stuff and swimming through curds to get to their base and cover it in dairy graffiti.</p>
<p>Doesn't that sound fun, and not at all horrendous?</p>
<h3>The Legend of Zelda</h3>
<figure><a title="Breath of the Wild with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6dab908154b85/breath-of-the-wild-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I put an extra Cow in this image so they can be friends — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know cows already exist in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">LoZ</a> world, but they're usually cooped up on Lon Lon Ranch, stuck in underground caves, or getting abducted by aliens, and they always look <em>so sad</em>. Let's give Hyrule's cows the recognition they deserve by promoting them to Series Regular. I've already got someone in mind to demote: Epona.</p>
<p>Put away the pitchforks! Epona can still stick around, just in a lesser role. It's not like Link's never replaced her before – remember that motorbike in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild_-_the_champions_ballad_plus_expansion_pass">Breath of the Wild</a>? That's not a <em>whole</em> lot different to a cow, really.</p>
<p>Besides, Epona doesn't give you delicious, HP-restoring milk. That's a point in Cow's favour.</p>
<h3>Star Fox</h3>
<figure><a title="Star Fox with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ed91ece7126e9/star-fox-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>MOO a barrel roll <i title=":smiley:"></i> — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Slippy's a frog. Peppy's a bunny. Falco's a bird. Sure, I can suspend my disbelief enough to believe that woodland creatures can A) exist in space, B) fly spacecraft, and C) toss witty banter at one another long enough to become friends, but do you know what I <em>don't</em> believe? That there are no cows in space.</p>
<p>You're telling me that an animal LITERALLY KNOWN FOR BEING ABDUCTED BY ALIENS doesn't exist in space? And that it wouldn't have encyclopaedic knowledge of spaceships, having been on so many? I don't buy it! Aliens, much like me, love cows, and there's a good reason for that: they make great astronauts.</p>
<p>Give Slippy, Peppy, Falco and co. a cow friend, call it Milktopher Cow or whatever, and give the people what they want.</p>
<h3>Balatro</h3>
<figure><a title="Balatro with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7504f122ebc3/balatro-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wouldn't Balatro make you 50% less grumpy if all the cards were cows? Yes. — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sure, why not! LocalThunk has done so many <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a> collabs already – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bugsnax">Bugsnax</a>, and more – why not a cow deck?</p>
<p>There's already a cow-adjacent Joker ("The Bull"), so I feel like LocalThunk might be amenable to more cow cards.</p>
<p>Was this an excuse to draw my own cow cards? Yes. Yes it was.</p>
<h3>Nintencows</h3>
<figure><a title="Nintendogs with Cows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dfd1eedc59ac3/nintendogs-with-cows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Genius — <em>Image: Kate Gray / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/nintendogs">Nintendogs</a>. But with cows.</p>
<hr>
<p>You herd it here first, folks: these are just some of the games that would be better with nature's most beautiful and beefiest ungulates. Do you have suggestions for how to <em>steer</em> the industry in the bovine direction? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>He accompanied his message with photographic proof, showing that on 20th June, he'd finally earned a gold sticker on every Joker, something less than 1 percent of all global players have managed to do thus far.</p>

        <p>But "not the gaming rights".</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hollywood producer, director, and screenwriter Adi Shankar has acquired the rights to Duke Nukem.</p>
<p>Shankar - who developed both the Castlevania and Devil May Cry animated shows for Netflix - told <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a64929637/adi-shankar-castlevania-devil-may-cry-interview/">Esquire</a> he has "video games in production", and has been approached with "different IPs and companies that want to work with [him]", as well as "obviously more" Devil May Cry. In amongst that is Duke Nukem, albeit "not the gaming rights".</p>

<p>"I got video games in production. Obviously more Devil May Cry," he said. "I'm being approached with different IPs and companies that want to work with me. I bought the rights to Duke Nukem. Not the gaming rights, but I bought it from Gearbox.</p>
<p>"It's a middle finger to everybody. When Duke Nukem blew up, a bunch of people sat around trying to turn it into a brand, when it's just a middle finger. Duke Nukem can't be made by a corporation, because the moment a corporation makes Duke Nukem, it's no longer Duke Nukem. I don't intend on having anyone tell me what to do on this one."</p>
<p>As for his Devil May Cry show? Shankar said Season 1 "had to be the gateway drug", but in Season 2, "the storytelling is going to pivot".</p>
<p>"Season 2 is going to be different, stylistically and tonally, from season 1. Virgil is a big, very important character. It's essentially a new show," Shankar added.</p>
<p>"I have goals. I want to body Arcane, surpass it in viewership... Arcane is the Joker lighting cash on fire, and it's great. With season 2 of Devil May Cry, I want to beat that. Show up to a tank fight with a water balloon and destroy the tank. Because that's cool."</p>
<p>Celebrating Devil May Cry's latest sales milestone, Capcom said the anime had been met with critical acclaim and boasts more than 5.3m views, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-devil-may-cry-animated-series-gets-positive-update-one-week-after-debut">has now been renewed for a second season</a>. Along with Johnny Yong Bosch as Dante, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-posthumously-stars-in-netflixs-devil-may-cry-anime">first series of Devil May Cry included legendary Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy as VP Baines</a>.</p>
<p>"Netflix's long-gestating animated adaptation of Capcom's venerable hack-em-up gives Dante his blockbuster action hero moment," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-season-1-review">Eurogamer's Devil May Cry season one review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-producer-adi-shankar-acquires-rights-to-duke-nukem]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rebel Wolves, the studio from former CD Projekt director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, has dropped a new trailer giving us our first meaningful look at The Blood of the Dawnwalker's gameplay.</p>
<p>Recorded on PC - and clearly labelled as a pre-beta "work-in-progress" - the trailer presents a bumper-length introduction to some of the game's features and gameplay mechanics. You can check it out below:</p>

<p>As well as watching protagonist Coen in action, and some of the gorgeous environments he'll visit, we also get a good long look at his perks menu, too, and learn a little more about how to balance his human qualities with his superhuman ones.
</p>
<p>"Using hexes consumes his health," explains design director, Daniel Sadowski. "The way our magic system works, there's always a price to pay for manipulating reality."
</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves confirmed its first project would be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-game-directors-new-studio-confirms-first-project-as-fantasy-rpg-dawnwalker">at the beginning of last year</a>. Described as a "brand-new role-playing saga", it's single-player and open-world, with a "strong focus on story and narrative", casting players as Coen - a "young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night". You must "fight for your humanity or embrace the cursed powers to save your family".</p>
<p>Alongside Tomaszkiewicz, Rebel Wolves counts former CD Projekt scribe Jakub Szamałek as its narrative director and main writer, with other team members including design director Daniel Sadowski, animation director Tamara Zawada, art director Bartłomiej Gaweł, CFO Michał Boryka, and studio head Robert Murzynowski - who have collectively worked on games such as Cyberpunk, Thronebreaker, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a>, and The Witcher series.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-gameplay-from-former-the-witcher-developers-fantasy-rpg-the-blood-of-the-dawnwalker]]></content:encoded>

You are now living in a post-Switch 2-release world. Having fun?</p>
<p>It's been a whirlwind month for Nintendo fans, with a brand new console to busy ourselves with! Consequently, penning missives to us at NL Towers hasn't been top of your list, it seems. Don't worry, we understand - those Peach Medallions aren't going to collect themselves!</p>
<p>So, it's time for a lighter edition of our monthly letters page feature. Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Let's sit back with a warm beverage and go through our dispatch box...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - June 2025</h2>

<h3>"gretsy" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone seemed really gretsy about the Switch 2 price point on announcement and then preorders sold out around the world in the first 30 seconds. I'm having trouble reading the temperature of the room and I'm wondering what you're seeing behind the scenes. Without revealing confidential metrics, can you talk about site engagement and user enthusiasm since the announcement? Where do you see this generation headed over the next several years? It looks like Nintendo is trading mass adoption for a flashy pop in the first year but what do I know? I'm just an email sitting in an in-box hoping someone finds me.</p>
<p>Keep calm and carry on! Your coverage is top tier!<br>
<strong>JJ Koester</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, JJ! Switch 2 has predictably seen a big bump in interest, although with games media struggling and sites going offline everywhere, it's hardly some massive secret that times are tough.</p>
<p>As for user enthusiasm, we've run a fair number of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/polls">polls</a> over the past couple of months, so they give a decent indication of general opinion. Pre-orders were always going to sell out, so I wouldn't put too much weight in that as an indicator of public sentiment. Anecdotally, I'll say that despite claiming she won't get one yet, my mum has already researched trade-in options and will 100% have a Switch 2 before the summer is out.</p>
<p>For me, it's a pricey device, yes, and $80 for Mario Kart is a kick. But it should come as zero surprise to anyone who's been paying any attention to the industry, and $450 isn't beyond what we were thinking before the price reveal - higher end, but not PS5-Pro-level <em>'What the hell?!'</em> The wider economic issues right now have definitely poured petrol on the price fire.</p>
<p>As for the future, it's now on Nintendo to dazzle us with games you can't play elsewhere that nobody else could or would make. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"disappointing"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey!<br>
I love this site. It’s my primary source for all things Nintendo.</p>
<p>I’m curious if you guys plan to review Monster Train 2 when it comes out in a few days. I’d love to hear your thoughts about it. I loved the first one, and I value your opinion.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>This generation of games has produced some of the most disappointing sequels to some of favorite games:</p>
<p>- Sports Story<br>
- Mario + Rabbids 2<br>
- Switch Sports<br>
- Blossom Tales 2 (I liked the first, but not one of my favorites)<br>
- Tears of the Kingdom (you may have heard of it)</p>
<p>That could be a great article start. Most disappointing sequels to great games.<br>
<strong><em>KevinLo9</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weirdly, I've been discussing Monster Train 2 just recently (although note that Kevin's mail came in <em>just</em> too late to make last month's mailbag). Unfortunately, it's fallen through the coverage cracks with the Switch 2 hullabaloo.</p>
<p>With the first one being a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-22-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">Game We Missed</a>, I was keen for us to cover the sequel, but the timing was, er, 'suboptimal'. Unfortunately, with things as they are, we have to be more selective than ever (far, far more than I'd like to be) when choosing which games to cover with a review, and Switch 2 soaked up all our resources.</p>
<p>Not sure I'm onboard with <em>all</em> those disappointing sequels, personally. But hey, different strokes. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"I don’t lean"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I was curious how you feel about WW being on switch 2. Do you think it was a smart decision to have the default GC version or would it better to just re-release the gorgeous Wii U remaster? I don’t lean one way or another, but I do suspect it was the Big N’s quickest means of attracting eyes towards the GC add-on which would the two games’ absence from S1. Just a theory, though.</p>
<p>Anyways, take care everyone!<br>
<strong><em>Yousef</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the upgrades, I personally just prefer the look of the original Wind Waker, and I don't think being on NSO precludes the Wii U version coming to Switch 2. The original game is still excellent (the repetitive wind-conducting aside), and having it readily available is fantastic. And yes, I'm sure it didn't hurt to be able to point to <em>another</em> Zelda game in the Switch collection.</p>
<p>Although for the cognoscenti among us, F-Zero GX alone would have been enough. Just F-Zero, nothing else in the GameCube app. Or on Switch 2. Ever. $450 for an F-Zero GX machine. Sold. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"jokesters"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Which of you jokesters thought it would be a good idea to change “Mother 3 (GBA)” in the search bar to “Mother 3 (GBA - Unknown)”. You had me thinking for a second that they announced it for a different platform. Whyyyyyyy<strong><br>
BandeeOfTheStars</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like the artmonkeys have been up to their tricks again. Certainly not a rogue acci-click from one of the team!...</p>
<p>All corrected now, thanks for the flag. And to prove that Bandee isn't just making things up to crowbar Mother 3 into the conversation, here's a pre-correction grab. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure><a title="Mother 3 Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f43ada0992fc7/mother-3-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<h3>"a slow drip"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think that Nintendo will slowly release more enhancements to older first party software that wasn't part of the Switch 2 release updates? There's a handful of first party games that would benefit from the increased power from the Switch 2 that weren't included in the update list, and I wonder if Nintendo is planning a slow drip feed of improved games a la NSO releases.<strong><br>
Kazman2007</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine most of the first-party lineup will get an update of some sort, if only to address minor hiccups caused by the Switch 1 emulation. It's been great to see games getting 'silent' bumps across the board and in various cases fulfilling their potential - I might actually pick up the Arkham Trilogy now that Knight runs. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>Feel free to respond to this letter however you wish as I'm not sure what I actually want to ask or say." - <strong>Willax</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Shmibblybops wartenshninkals! <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

		<p>Back in January, we got a first look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-a-new-rpg-from-former-the-witcher-3-devs/">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, the brand new RPG from Rebel Wolves which is a studio made up of former CD Projekt RED developers including the game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. He has been joined by other CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek. Now, a 20 minute gameplay overview video has been released giving a look at different gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Gameplay Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ro8psdfcxJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gameplay overview starts with Coen heading towards a cathedral in search of a powerful weapon, but on the way he gets into a fight with some bandits. This early encounter shows the combat system that will be in The Blood of Dawnwalker, with players using a sword to fight. With the sword, Coen can attack in different directions to hit enemies and avoid their blocks. When on the defence, you will need to take into account the direction enemies are coming in to attack so you can parry it. In addition, Coen has different abilities to use with this combat encounter introducing Acrid Dust, which stuns enemies, and Burning Blood, a hex that boils an enemy’s blood and burns the skin. Artery Attack is another ability and in this case it decapitated the enemy. Coen then loots the enemies which allows him to find a better weapon. He also eats some food to replenish health. The successful encounter has also levelled Coen up and this provides a skill point that can be spent in one of three skill trees; human, vampire, and shared.</p>
<p>In The Blood of Dawnwalker, players will need to make decisions that will influence how the world around Coen reacts to him. When approaching the city&nbsp; where the Cathedral is the guards wave Coen through, but if he had done things that upset the vampire lords or the population the guards could have been much more aggressive and not let him in. Interestingly, one of the main things you will need to do is storm the castle Greisberg where the vampire lord is holed up to overthrow them, and it seems you could attempt this at any point of the game though if it is the first thing you try it will be very challenging. As you wander the streets, there will be scenes playing out that having nothing to do with Coen but they could open up new quests. Rebel Wolves has stated that there are multiple paths to follow in the game which each one impacted by the relationships you have with different characters, and the choices you make when completing quests. You can also choose to abandon quests and choose different paths.</p>
<p>Exploration in The Blood of Dawnwalker will vary based on the time of day. During the day, Coen is a human so can only explore like a human would, and most places are open to him. At night though things change, as when the sun sets Coen is a vampire and has new traversal abilities like jumping across rooftops using Shadowstep. Coen also gets a Focus mode that highlights points of interest and loot. As a vampire, Coen’s health is represented as a thirst level and he needs blood to replenish that health. That means having to feed on humans but if you feed on certain people it could have lasting consequences on the story.&nbsp; While feeding you can decide how much blood to drain. Taking a bit which render the victim unconscious, but taking it all will kill them. This decision can only be made if Coen hasn’t gone hungry at which point he will just drain victims. You can choose not to use humans as a blood source with animals being an alternative.</p>

<p>Another ability Coen has is Planeshift, and this lets him walk up walls and across ceilings, making those hard to reach places as a human much easier to reach at night. When in vampire form, combat is also different as Coen uses his claws rather than a sword to attack, but it still follows the same directional mechanics. In this scenario he is facing Blood Guards, soldiers that use vampire blood to become stronger. They are dual wielding enemies with strong attacks so you have to be smart fighting them. If you want to you can switch to using your sword instead of claws while in vampire form.&nbsp;The Blood of Dawnwalker is due to be released in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that there is going to be a Little Nightmares Showcase on June 24th, taking place at 12PM PST/ 5PM EST/ 8PM BST/ 9PM CEST. It is likely we are going to get more details for Little Nightmares III. Last year <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/03/little-nightmares-iii-delayed-until-2025/">Little Nightmares III delayed until 2025</a>, with Supermassive Games announcing that the studio needed more time to get the game ready for release.</p>

<p>Supermassive Games have taken over development duties from Tarsier Studios for this third instalment. Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of “disturbing places”, Low and Alone will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and nasty things lurking around in the shadows. This showcase will probably show us new gameplay for Little Nightmares III and, hopefully, a confirmed release date.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Little Nightmares II review, I said,<em>&nbsp;“It’s rather obvious, but if enjoyed the first Little Nightmares then you will enjoy the Little Nightmares II. While some new elements have been added it is more of a next chapter to the story than a full blown sequel. The attention detail is incredible, bringing the story to life without a single spoken word. It’s unsettling, creepy, darkly amusing, and at times a little frustrating, but immensely enjoyable. Another little, slime covered gem from Tarsier Studios.”</em></p>

<p>Little Nightmares III is coming to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Who knows? We might get confirmation of a Switch 2 release too.</p>

		<p>2K and Gearbox have released a new story trailer for Borderlands 4, which shows us some elements of the setting of the next entry to the series. In this trailer, we see some of how The Timekeeper, the main antagonist of Borderlands 4, rules the planet of Kairos. The Timekeeper does this from a tower in Dominion City, with his Commander’s executing his will (and enemies) across the rest of Kairos. This follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/check-out-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-reveal-everything-we-now-know/">the Borderlands 4 gameplay reveal</a> that took place at the end of April.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Story Trailer | Borderlands 4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a Vault Hunter you are not just looking for treasures across Kairos. You have a run in with The Timekeeper and as a result events are set into motion where you, and other Vault Hunters, are on a mission to end The Timekeeper’s iron fisted regime and bring freedom to Kairos. There will be characters across Kairos that will be sympathetic to your cause too and will be allies in the fight that will determine the future of the planet. You can play Borderlands 4 alone or team up with others in four player co-op, exploring the planet, fighting bandits and bosses, and discovering lots of different weapons. Looting has been revamped for Borderlands 4 with Legendaries being much rarer, with decent weapons easier to find. Loot will be instanced for each player, so no worries about rushing to snap up the best stuff.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is now available to pre-order with the standard version priced at £69.99. There is a digital deluxe edition available for £89.99 which includes Firehawk’s Fury Weapon Skin, Gilded Glory Pack, and Bounty Pack Bundle. The Super Deluxe Edition is priced at £119.99, includes the items from the deluxe edition along with the Ornate Order Pack and the Vault Hunter Pack. Those who pre-order the game will get the Gilded Glory pack and that includes a Vault Hunter skin, a weapon skin, and an Echo-4 drone skin.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 will release on September 12th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3e3334b44c74/donkey-konga-2-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Mmm, bananas. <em>Ahem</em>, sorry about that. We meant to say, welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Before we swing over to this week's bongo brawlers, let's quickly recap what happened <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-jet-set-radio-dreamcast">last time</a> when three covers from the Dreamcast's <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/jet_set_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> went head to head (to head). There was a decent spread of votes, but the funky Japanese design ultimately walked away with 46% of the split and the win. North America followed behind with 30%, and Europe took home the remaining slice — <em>funky</em>.</p>
<p>After the week we've had in Nintendo Land, there was only one direction we could head in this time. With DK on the brain, we're turning to the prized primate's beloved bongo-bashing sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_konga_2_hit_song_parade">Donkey Konga 2</a> ('Hit Song Parade', in Japan), for another three-way vote.</p><p><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0ltyump&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You don't need us to provide a recap of this one. The series still slaps, it's been too long, trilogy remaster when? etc. Keep to the beat as we meet our three competitors below.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/gamecube/related-articles:159632,184111 @ 1750628761 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c0914233e26c/donkey-konga-2-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Woah, DK! You're hitting the bongo so hard, your legs have swung into the air! That's too much bongo, DK!</p>
<p>The central pose is fitting, really, when you consider just how hard this cover slaps. The red and white background, the cel-shaded DK, that rock-and-roll spray-painted '2' in the logo. Just makes you want to whip out the peripherals and go for a bongo sesh, no?</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02b44c041163d/donkey-konga-2-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design is a little tamer, by comparison, but it does have added Diddy Kong, which is always a bonus. The bright green background subtly packs in some musical notes (a nice touch), and we're fans of the DK and Diddy sprites that appear in the logo — did we really need the other ones down the bottom, though?</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Konga 2 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78f5519329731/donkey-konga-2-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10198-donkey-konga-2">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, now that's more like it! The logo from the European design returns here, but it takes centre stage on its own. With the focus on DK and Diddy, and the bonus balloons and confetti that are scattered around them, this one really sells the 'party' vibes.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-donkey-konga-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-new-trailer-45-minute-livestream-set-for-june-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> earlier this month, Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco Entertainment have released a lengthy gameplay overview for the action RPG The Blood of Dawnwalker in which the studio's CD Projekt roots were very clear. Gamers were shown combat both as a human and as a vampire, as well as the different approaches to quests depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>The footage was captured on PC from the game's latest pre-beta build without any additional post-capture cleanup. It already looks very good, though. After fighting some bandits, protagonist Coen enters the region’s largest city, Svartrau, showing a bustling town fairly reminiscent of Novigrad from The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>One of the key features of The Blood of Dawnwalker is the stark contrast between day and night: bustling medieval life masks the influence of a vampire regime during the day, while moonlit rooftops reveal hidden secrets at night. Moreover, as a Dawnwalker, Coen is neither fully human nor entirely vampire. During the day, he can wield a sword and use magical runes in the form of bloody scars etched onto his skin, although this kind of magic comes at a cost: it siphons off a portion of Coen's health.</p>
<p>During the night, Coen embraces his supernatural instincts and unlocks an entirely new set of powers. His nocturnal abilities include lethal vampiric claws and Shadowstep, a skill that allows him to navigate across rooftops swiftly. At nighttime, Coen must also constantly grapple with his relentless bloodlust. During gameplay, visual cues help players to assist Coen in satisfying his hunger in various ways, such as drinking the blood of foes (including vampires, innocent villagers, and animals) or using special blood vials.</p>
<p>If he remains unsatisfied, not only will this craving weaken his abilities and vitality, but it may also cause him to lose control in critical moments and unintentionally kill an important character in the story. This wouldn't be the end of the game, though; one of the core tenets laid out by Rebel Wolves is that of the narrative sandbox, where there is no difference between main and side quests, and each consequence of the player's actions will simply push the story forward, albeit in a different direction.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Gameplay Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1XOa0JYJv8g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Polish developers also revealed that The Blood of the Dawnwalker uses a For Honor-like directional combat system (albeit with four directions) designed to bring cinematic intensity and tactical challenge to every confrontation. Players must study enemy movements, block precisely, and time their counterattacks well to perform seamless, strategic takedowns.</p>
<p>The overview ends with Coen's confrontation with one of the vampire bosses, Xanthe, which ends badly for the player character. Rebel Wolves noted that players can take on the bosses, even the final one, relatively early on if they so choose, but they will be extremely challenging. The game runs on a sort of timer because Coen has only 30 days to save his family, although the developers said it's more like a resource than an actual countdown.</p>
<p>Lastly, Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco confirmed that The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>The "gnarly remake" adds multiple new parks</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> revives two more classics next month, but that's not all! In case you missed it, it's also adding a new pinball-themed park to the series featuring the Birdman himself.</p>
<p>This is one of multiple new parks "joining the lineup of original parks" in this upcoming title, due out for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>11th July 2025</strong>. To build up the excitement, Activision and Iron Galaxy have now released a new trailer showcasing this park in motion. Here's what you can expect along with some of the inspiration behind this design:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pinball drops players into a pinball game featuring the tombstones of fallen skaters around a playfield filled with ramps, rails, and flippers at the control of Tony Hawk. Watch out for silver balls running down the board and track your best combo on the backbox display.</p>
<p>"Developer Iron Galaxy Studios shares a special connection to pinball, many of its early members incorporating their knowledge acquired while working for Midway Games in Chicago, a prominent name in arcade and pinball gaming. This homage offers the perfect mix honoring their roots while flexing their creative skills in a wild new park design."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can expect all sorts of wild segments throughout this park including "the eyeball", "brains", and even a river filled with "hungry alligators". Apart from this pinball park, some other new parks include Movie Studio and Waterpark.</p>
<p>Here are some additional screenshots and you can even get some "pro tips" about what to be on the lookout for in this park over on the official <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-park-map-guide-pinball">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 blog</a>.
