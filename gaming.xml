            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/find-nikvard-kingdom-come-deliverance-quest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll pick up a quest relatively early on called ‘Magnum Opus’, but it’s a lengthy one that’ll sit in your quest log for quite some time. It could be many hours until you finish it, and there are quite a few steps along the way to resolving it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I’ve put together a Magnum Opus quest guide, designed to help you conquer the most troublesome objective – finding Nikvard in Kingdom Come Deliverance. He’s a slippery character, but in this guide, you’ll learn Nikvard’s location in just a few steps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finding-nikvard-in-kingdom-come">Finding Nikvard in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Magnum Opus will be handed to you by the Lower Semine Miller if you follow his quest line.</p>



<p>It requires Henry of Skalitz to find his way into Trosky Castle and liberate a book that’s hidden somewhere within, but details are sparse. As the quest pieces itself together, Henry concocts a plan to get himself inside, but things quickly turn awry.</p>



<p>Once you’ve made your way into Trosky Castle (against your will), you’ll find yourself facing the objective with almost nothing to guide you on your quest. Talking to the Scribe and some of the castle’s occupants doesn’t reveal much, and ultimately, you learn that Nikvard has the book, <strong>but nobody knows where he is</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-where-to-find-nikvard-for-magnum-opus">Where to Find Nikvard for Magnum Opus</h3>



<p>Nikvard has the book – that much is obvious.</p>



<p>If you want to go through the various speech checks and minor actions to advance the quest and level up some skills, feel free to follow the quest as it was designed. If you’d rather skip that and head straight to Nikvard’s location to force the completion of the quest, then you’ll need to go here:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Look for the red flag!</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The red and yellow flag marker is where you’ll find Nikvard in KCD2</strong>.</p>



<p>The location of the Magnum Opus in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is actually <strong>outside </strong>the castle grounds. It seems that Nikvard had a spot of bother with his digestive health and the book ended up falling down a latrine, passing through the sewer pipe and landing on the floor outside the castle.</p>



<p>It’s sitting immediately alongside Nikvard’s dead body, which is a shame. He seemed like he would have been a nice guy.</p>



<p>Don’t worry, the guard standing nearby commenting on the dead body won’t mind you taking the book – but the Miller will comment on how badly it smells when you take it back to him.</p>

            <p>
We might not have seen a whole lot of EA's next Battlefield game beyond the few seconds of pre-alpha footage shared this week, but it turns out it's probably not all that far away. The publisher has confirmed it expect the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year.
</p>
<p>
EA shared the news as part of its third-quarter financial earnings report, saying its new Battlefield is "expected fiscal year 2026 release". That means the game should - all being well - arrive sometime between 1st April this year and 31st of March 2026.
</p>
<p>
Specifics remain limited, but EA last year confirmed the long-running multiplayer shooter series would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">returning to the modern era</a> for its next outing, and that it'd feature traditional classes and more focused maps - a clear indication it would be revisiting a tried-and-tested formula after shaking things up in 2021's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">poorly received Battlefield 2042</a>.
</p>

<figcaption>EA launches Battlefield Labs.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fGteYuaNxA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
That announcement also brought word EA planned to launch playtests for Battlefield's next instalmnt in order to "get the community back on our side" - and that initiative, now known as Battlefield Labs, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">officially unveiled this week</a> alongside some brief early gameplay.
</p><p>
The next Battlefield game is being developed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">huge group spread across four major EA teams</a>, now working under the umbrella name of Battlefield Studios. That includes series creator DICE, splinter studio Ripple Effect, Dead Space Remake developer Motive, and Criterion - the veteran UK studio, which, as Eurogamer reported earlier this week, has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">paused work on its next Need for Speed game</a> in order to pitch in with the new Battlefield.
</p>
<p>
EA will be wanting to hit the ground running with the next Battlefield entry after it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">forced to admit 2042 "did not meet expectations"</a>. The publisher also had a difficult 2024, and last month said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard "underperformed"</a> as it lowered its financial forecast for the year.

<p>There’s yet another rumor suggesting that the next PlayStation State of Play is coming this month. This one, however, has a date tied to the claim.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxgL5aFU6I7_BMaJmsuX3xaYVbkLo9cv_Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PH Brazil</a>, PlayStation is set to host its next State of Play on Friday, February 14. His claims back up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior ones from Nate the Hate</a> of an event happening in February.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s last State of Play took place in September 2024. That event included games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a>, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Palworld, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-revealed-at-state-of-play-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. In total, they held four in 2024, with the first happening on January 31. </p>



<p>As far as what this State of Play would include, that wasn’t hinted at. There are plans for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Xbox games</a> to make their way to the PlayStation 5, so it could be the time for some announcements on that front. Halo and Gears of War are two of the bigger names making the rounds online, though there is nothing to confirm those being the next games to come.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for comment on these growing rumors. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>What would you like to see at the next PlayStation State of Play? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
It's been a bit of a busy one for Capcom, what with the publisher airing not one but two showcases to demo its latest wares. One half of that dealt with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> ahead of its release this month, but Capcom also had a few things to share about its other titles. So if you missed its latest Spotlight, you'll find everything announced and featured below.
</p>
<h3>Mai Shiranui's fighting pass for Street Fighter 6</h3>

<p>
We already knew Fatal Fury's Mai Shiranui was making the jump to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> this week, and we got a further look at her "agile movements, tricky projectiles, and quick attacks" in Capcom's latest showcase. Mai comes to Street Fighter 6 on 5th February PST, arriving alongside the Say Hello to Mai fighting pass - which includes customisation items relating to Mai and Fatal Fury. And as for what's next, Elena is set to complete the character roster for Year 2.

<h3>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics finally arrives on Xbox</h3>

<p>
After pausing to highlight this year's Capcom Cup 11 - which will be determining the Street Fighter 6 world champion between 5-9 March - it was time to move onto Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. This seven game compilation has been out on PlayStation, Switch, and PC since last year, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-now-coming-to-xbox-following-technical-discussions-with-microsoft">technical issues held back its Xbox release</a>.
</p><p>
Those have now been resolved, however, and it's finally available digitally on Microsoft's console - gathering together X-Men Children of the Atom. Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 New Age of Heroes, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/punisher">The Punisher</a>.

Capcom's other fighting collection, the economically titled Capcom Fighting Collection 2, also has a release date. As well as a whole bunch of artwork and previously unseen development documents, this compilation features eight titles: Capcom vs SNK, Capcom vs SNK 2, Project Justice, Capcom Fighting Evolution, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-alpha-3-upper">Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper</a>, Plasma Sword, Power Stone, and Power Stone 2.

<p>
It doesn't have a name, and it's still probably years off, but that didn't stop Capcom from re-airing the same announcement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Okami sequel trailer it aired during December's The Game Awards</a>. The publisher paired this segment with a spotlight on its demo for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review">excellent Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, plus the news that Path of the Goddess and the original Okami are both now available in a two-game bundle.

<h3>More details of Onimusha: Way of the Sword emerge</h3>

<p>

This all-new entry in Capcom's fondly remembered Onimusha series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">another Game Awards debutante</a>. For its latest airing, though, Capcom highlighted some of the key areas it's focusing on to make Way of the Sword "as captivating as possible". These include its new protagonist (plus enemies that are interesting "more than just visually"), its setting, and its combat.
</p><p>
Set in a "beautifully eerie depiction" of Edo-period Kyoto, Onimusha: Way of the Sword tells the heroic tale of a samurai who wields an Oni gauntlet, feeding it the souls of monsters roaming the land of the living. Doing so involves swordplay with a particular emphasis on the satisfaction of slicing through enemies, and players can use the souls they collect to restore health and trigger special moves. Capcom says combat will be intense when Way of the Sword arrives in 2026, but stresses it's not trying to make an "impossibly difficult" game.
</p>
<h3>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is being remastered</h3>

<p>
If 2026 is just too long to wait for your Onimusha fix, Capcom has you covered. The publisher also used its latest Spotlight to announce a remaster of 
Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, which  originally launched back in 2002. There's not a whole lot to report on this just yet, but it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC sometime this year.
</p>
<p>
And with that, we're pretty much done with the first part of Capcom's showcase. The publisher's having a digital sale across various platforms right now if you're in the mood to sample its wares at a discount, and if you missed it, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-next-open-betas-will-let-players-fight-flagship-monster-arkveld-for-the-first-time">round-up of Capcom's latest Monster Hunter Wilds' showcase elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>.

Specifically <em>Diablo </em>– in which many suspect him of spending real money to enlist the services of a “booster” to grind his character gear, levels, and rank for him – but also <em>Path of Exile</em>, where he was caught even more red-handed, prompting <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/29/elon-musk-video-games-diablo-path-exile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an eventual confession last month</a>.</p><p>This is fitting, considering that Musk has only one real ability, and it is not "intelligence" – <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lhcfk62z7k2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whatever that means</a> – or even engineering, which he claims to be a generational talent at despite <a href="https://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2018/06/elon-musk-is-terrible-engineer-and-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidence to</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23458247/elon-musk-fires-engineer-correcting-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the contrary</a>. Instead, the man excels solely at finding loopholes in systems meant to maintain some semblance of order and ruthlessly exploiting them for his own gain.

			<p>There were some major announcements today during the Capcom Spotlight broadcasts, which was then followed by a Monster Hunter Wilds showcase that unveiled even more details about the upcoming game and what players can expect. It was also announced that there will be a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second Open Beta Test</a> for Monster Hunter Wilds later this month, where those who participate will be able to challenge Arkveld, as well as the opportunity to hunt the "White Wraith." There are some returning monsters, too. However, Monster Hunter Wilds wasn't the only thing that Capcom showed off during these showcases.</p>
<p>New details for <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> have been announced, as Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Director Satoru Nihei joined the show to give fans more details about the story. The title follows the story of a new protagonist who is wielding the Oni Gauntlet, and will have to fight off the demonic Genma. This title is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam in 2026.</p>
<p>Not only were there details for Onimusha: Way of the Sword, but it's also been confirmed that Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is receiving a remaster and is currently in development. Fans got a sneak peek of this 2002 title with enhanced graphics during the Capcom Spotlight with a trailer. The title will be coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam in 2025.</p>

<p>As of today, MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is now available via a digital download on Xbox One, where you can also purchase the game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>For more Capcom fighting goodness, it's been announced that the Capcom Fighting Collection 2 will be available as both a physical and digital title on May 16, with pre-orders for this game being available as of today. This collection will include titles like Capcom vs SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001 and Power Stone 2. There will be new features to help bring the games back to life, as well as online play with rollback netcode. In total, there are eight games in this package for you to play through.</p>
<p>On a slightly smaller note, Mai officially joins Street Fighter 6 tomorrow, so make sure to dust off your controllers and hitboxes as you learn Mai's combos and abilities on the streets. She will be the third Year 2 character for Street Fighter 6, with Elena being the last to join the roster. Additionally, the Street Fighter Capcom Cup event will be returning from March 5-9, 2025, with a grand prize of $1 million.</p>

These games are sent as Steam codes, which are yours to keep forever. You can even send them to a friend if you already have the game or want to gift one! For February, Immortals of Aveum is well worth the price of this package alone, receiving <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortals-of-aveum-review">an 8/10 in our review</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they’re definitely not dead yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these games, you can also score up to 20% off select games on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Store</a>. The longer that you have an active subscription, the more rewards you can unlock. 5% of each Humble Choice purchase also supports a charity that rotates monthly, with February's supporting United Negro College Fund, an organization that works to increase the total annual number of African American college graduates.

While that does mean there are only a few tangible additions, such as that new island and fruit, the team made sure to include a solid group of balance adjustments to help keep its swashbuckling Roblox experience smooth across the board.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/04/grand-piece-online-mini-update-1738634012107.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Piece Online February mini update adds new island, fruit, and balance changes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can find Turtleback Cave north of Rose Kingdom in the Second Sea. Those who make the trek will find a new boss: Juzo the Diamondback. Defeating the enemy rewards players with the Turtleback Armor and Turtleback Helmet, with kills also including a 5% chance to drop the Kira fruit and a lower chance to drop a Mythical Fruit Chest. There’s also a new player list that shows crew and player names, as well as a list of crew adjustments, which include five new crew shop items, eight total crew shop slots, and the option to purchase current and out-of-rotation battle pass outfits from the crew shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for those Grand Piece Online balance tweaks, players will find that Arena Storm has been removed in favor of a new countdown system. The change will see winners determined by damage dealt and stocks remaining at the end of the countdown. There have also been adjustments to Tori, Pteranodon, Buddha, Venom, Yuki, Gold, Zushi, and many more, as Grand Quest Games aims to level the playing field.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Piece Online launched all the way back in 2018, and although the patch does fall under the “mini update” category, it shows the team is still going strong as it sails into 2025. The last notable update brought Water and Travel changes on January 17, so while there is no date regarding when players can expect to see the next update run aground, we likely won’t have to wait too long for more news.

While a slew of leaks in the past few months spoiled some of the surprises, seeing him in action is an entirely different thing. He has a passive ability that is unlike any character we’ve seen before, with the ability to not only shield downed teammates while reviving them, but he can also drag them to safety. The shield’s power level increases if Newcastle is carrying a higher-tier knockdown shield, which adds another tweak to an often overlooked item.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058327/apex-legends-saviors-newcastle-ranked-battle-royale">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTAyNzgz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/28/22999936/apex-legends-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-warriors-update">Apex Legends next-gen console updates with 4K and HDR launch tomorrow</a></h2><div><p>Respawn Entertainment has confirmed that <em>Apex Legends </em>upgrades for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles will launch tomorrow <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/warriors-collection-event">with the new Warriors collection event</a>.

Now, <em>Apex Legends</em> is turning three, and in a conversation with <em>The Verge</em>, game director Steven Ferreira said that this year, players should expect to see the title do things that are completely unlike what we’ve seen so far while still keeping the battle royale as the core of the game.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917825/apex-legends-defiance-hands-on-interview-battle-royal-sandbox">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTE3MDMz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750879/apex-legends-escape-ash-storm-point-respawn-ea">Apex Legends: Escape takes the battle royale shooter on vacation at the perfect time</a></h2><div><p>In the years since Respawn and EA launched <em>Apex Legends</em>, the shooter has carved out its place among a crowded field of contenders. Other games have tried to enter the market and failed to make much impact alongside the other battle royale titans like <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, <em>PUBG</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>.

But the most pivotal addition to the battle royale game is its ranked mode.

It fixes almost every big complaint I’ve had about such modes in other games, giving me a rewarding way to spend my time in a way that never feels like a second job, as so many games-as-a-service titles like Bungie’s <em>Destiny 2</em> can feel. I’ve only just started playing, but can already see myself spending dozens to hundreds of hours here, so long as Respawn keeps it from growing stale and finds ways to combat the inherent toxicity ranked modes are infamous for. </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687943/apex-legends-ranked-mode-competitive-playlist-season-2-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTkwMDk3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18536028/apex-legends-iphone-android-mobile-ea-respawn">EA wants to bring Apex Legends to mobile</a></h2><div><p>Today EA released its quarterly earnings, and unsurprisingly <em>Apex Legends</em> was a big hit.

We already knew <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">two more Monster Hunter Wilds open betas were on the way</a> ahead of this month's launch, but Capcom has now shared a few more details - confirming they'll give players a chance to go up against flagship monster Arkveld for the first time.
</p>
<p>
That news came courtesy of Capcom's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFcgWM-D-oo">latest Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase</a>, which kicked things off with a fresh trailer. Notably, this offered a first look at the Iceshard Cliffs biome, which join Wilds' previously revealed Windward Plains, Scarlet Forest, and Oilwell Basin. It also unveiled new monster Hirabami - an ice-dwelling leviathan with the ability to float and a pincer-style tail - alongside confirmation of two more returning monsters: the spider-like Nerscylla and the Gore Magala, first seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> 4.
</p>
<p>
Capcom also took a few moments to hightlight some of Wilds' customisation features. It will, for instance, be possible to customise your pop-up camp, adjusting its layout, adding furniture, changing tent patterns and colours, selecting background music, and more. That's alongside the ability to alter your Seikret's colours and decorations as the story progresses.

<p>
Elsewhere, it sounds like layered armour is now automatically registered whenever players craft its original High Rank counterpart, rather than having to unlock it through other means - a boon for fashion fans. Additionally, Capcom revealed Guild Cards have been replaced with Hunter Profile, promising "more features than ever", and there's a photo mode - with settings including camera view and depth of field - that'll pause the game when used in online single-player mode.
</p><p>
That single-player online mode - designed for people who want to play without joining a lobby, and which can temporarily be turned to multiplayer by firing off an SOS flare - is one of the features that'll debut in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/obt/">two upcoming open betas</a>, alongside private lobbies and a new base camp training area for solo play.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, open beta players can confront Monster Hunter Wilds' new flagship monster Arkveld, AKA the White Wraith. This fearsome beast features "chain-like appendages extending from its wings", and will be available as part of a "special advanced quest" that's described as being "rather dangerous". February's open beta also include a new Gypceros hunt, and that's alongside the character creation, story trial, and Doshaguma hunt seen in last year's beta.
</p>
<p>
February's first open beta test runs for four days begining on 6th February at 7pm PT (that's 3am on 7th February in the UK) and its second runs from 13th-16th February, with timings remaining the same. Cross-platform multiplayer is enabled for both sessions, and players can transfer their characters (but not their progress) to the full game. Participants also get a bonus pendant and an item pass that'll unlock in the full release. Additionally, Monster Hunter World and Iceborne will receive Palico equipment and a name plate for their hunter profile if they pick up Wilds.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 28th February, and capcom has confirmed it'll start introducing limited-time event quests - featuring "special looks" as rewards - one week after its release. More updates will follow.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>It's been 25 years since Maxis first introduced us to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims/" data-ref-id="5000-326">The Sims</a> and began wasting so, so much of our time. EA, not too surprisingly, has taken advantage of this major anniversary to re-release both The Sims and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-2/" data-ref-id="5000-18273">The Sims 2</a>, with all DLC included and the games updated for modern computers. And as you take this dose of nostalgia, you may find yourself looking for some cheats to help you reacquaint yourself with the original classic.</p><p>We've got you covered. Since this re-release of The Sims 1 is just that--an updated version of the existing game, rather than a remake or remaster--not much has changed about how cheating works in the original Sims title. You don't have to mess with game files or command lines or anything like that. You simply fire up the game, and once you're in it, <strong>press ctrl+shft+C to pull up the console where you can enter codes</strong>--and then enter a code.</p><p>These days, in The Sims 4, we've got a metric ton of cheats of all kinds, but The Sims 1 was simpler. While the original game has a pretty massive pile of codes that will do under-the-hood technical stuff, there are only a relatively small number of useful cheats. And at least one of them does something completely different than you'd probably expect. Let's dive in.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Cheat code</th><th scope="col">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>rosebud</td><td>1,000 simoleons</td></tr><tr><td>set_hour [1-24]</td><td>Set time of day, using a 24-hour clock. So, 5 for 5am, and 17 for 5pm.</td></tr><tr><td>autonomy [1-100]</td><td>Set sim autonomy--the higher the number, the more they'll do what they want</td></tr><tr><td>sim_speed [1-1000]</td><td>Set the speed of Live Mode--800 is default</td></tr><tr><td>interests</td><td>Shows what the selected sim is into</td></tr><tr><td>freeall</td><td>All build items are free</td></tr><tr><td>visitor_control</td><td>Allows you to command other sims on the current lot</td></tr><tr><td>move_objects on</td><td>Allows you to pick up and move any item on the current lot</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are three things worth noting about this list. First: While the rosebud cheat isn't worth much, you can add to it by adding ";!" on the end--each instance of ";!" you add on the end repeats the cheat. So if you add nine of them, like "rosebud;!;!;!;!;!;!;!;!;!," you'll receive 10,000 simoleons instead of 1,000.</p><p>Second: As you might have guessed from the description, the "move_objects" cheat in The Sims 1 is not the same "ignore collisions in build mode" command that it is in The Sims 4. Here, this command only allows you to pick up any item and move it or delete it--it's a totally different concept.</p><p>And, lastly: The Sims 1 doesn't have any cheat code that will instantly fill your sim's needs. So don't bother scouring the list over and over looking for it. There simply isn't a code for that in the first game.</p><p>With that, you should be set to dive headfirst into The Sims 1, whether you're coming back to an old fave or trying it out for the first time. If you have use for them, we also have our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-sims-2-cheats-for-new-legacy-edition/1100-6529244/" data-ref-id="1100-6529244">all The Sims 2 cheats</a>.</p>

                <p>EA is partying like it's 2004--and that's because the publisher is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its juggernaut franchise The Sims with brand-new re-releases of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims/" data-ref-id="5000-326">The Sims</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-2/" data-ref-id="5000-18273">The Sims 2</a> that include all their DLC and work on modern systems. Since it's been quite a while since most of us have messed with The Sims 2--EA stopped supporting the title when it released The Sims 3 back in 2009, after all--we could use a bit of a helping hand as we revisit this old classic. Fortunately, we've still got plenty of The Sims 2 cheat codes to work with.</p><p>Fortunately, The Sims 2 has <em>a lot</em> more cheats than The Sims 1 did. Like a lot of first sequels, The Sims 2 is where the series really established most of its norms--meaning that the way you can cheat in The Sims 2 is pretty similar to how you can cheat in The Sims 4. Because of that, in general, The Sims 2 is a lot easier to go back to now than The Sims 1 is.</p><p>But there is one thing that has stayed the same from the start: You <strong>press ctrl+shft+C to open the console where you can type in your cheat codes</strong>. No need to mess with any game files or anything like that--the console works by default. Once you've opened it up, just type in one of the codes below and have fun. Just keep in mind that The Sims 2 doesn't tell you if you typed it correctly, and it can be case-sensitive about some of the codes, so be sure to enter them exactly as written below.</p><p>There are two kinds of cheats in The Sims 2, the first being the kind you type into the console, and the second being interface-based. We'll start with the codes.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Cheat code</th><th scope="col">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>kaching</td><td>adds 1,000 simoleons</td></tr><tr><td>motherlode</td><td>adds 50,000 simoleons</td></tr><tr><td>familyFunds [last name] [number]</td><td>sets the given family's funds to the stated amount</td></tr><tr><td>maxMotives</td><td>fills all needs for all sims on the current lot</td></tr><tr><td>motiveDecay [on/off]</td><td>toggles need decay for all sims on the current lot</td></tr><tr><td>aging [on/off]</td><td>toggles aging for all sims on current lot</td></tr><tr><td>disablePuppyKittenAging [on/off]</td><td>toggles aging for pets</td></tr><tr><td>aspirationLevel [0-5]</td><td>sets the selected sim's aspiration meter</td></tr><tr><td>aspiration points [number]</td><td>adds aspiration points to the current sim</td></tr><tr><td>unlockCareerRewards</td><td>unlocks items you'd normally have to level your career to earn</td></tr><tr><td>setHour [0-23]</td><td>set the time of day according to a 24-hour clock</td></tr><tr><td>slowMotion [1-8]</td><td>slows down the game--the higher the number, the slower it goes</td></tr><tr><td>stretchSkeletion [multiplier]</td><td>makes the selected sim taller or shorter--1.5 makes you 1.5x taller.</td></tr><tr><td>moveObjects on</td><td>allows you to pick up or delete any object--this is different from MoveObjects in The Sims 4</td></tr><tr><td>setQuarterTilePlacement [on/off]</td><td>allows much more granular placement of items in build mode</td></tr><tr><td>boolProp testingcheatsenabled true</td><td>enables cheats that you activate by shift+clicking on things</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As was the case with The Sims 1, the moveObjects cheat here is not the same moveObjects in The Sims 4, which lets you place build objects closer together than the game's grid normally allows. In The Sims 2, this cheat is instead for literally moving or deleting any object in the world.</p><h2><strong>Interface cheats in The Sims 2</strong></h2><p>That last cheat is of particular interest to us here. On top of the cheats listed above, there are a lot of other cheats in The Sims 2 that you can activate by holding shift when you click on a sim or object in the game--doing so opens a new, cheat-focused pie menu that will allow you to change all sorts. In order to access this other group of cheats, <strong>you'll need to enter boolProp testingcheatsenabled true</strong> in the console, and that will activate the ability to use these UI cheats. For the most part, you'll be using cheats that you find by shift+clicking on a sim or a sim's mailbox.</p><p>There are two additional console commands that unlock some extra options. There's <strong>addNeighborToFamilyCheat [on/off]</strong>, which will add an option to add a sim to a household when you shift+click them; and there's <strong>ageSimsCheat [on/off]</strong>, which will let you set a sim's age. Scroll on for a list of stuff you can do with this other type of cheat.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">What to click</th><th scope="col">Option</th><th scope="col">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Set age</td><td>choose the sim's current life stage</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Set birthday</td><td>makes today the day the sim ages up</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Set aspiration</td><td>change the sim's lifetime goal</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Add to family</td><td>adds the selected sim to your household</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Change suit</td><td>change the sim's outfit</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Kill</td><td>kills the sim</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Make vampire/Cure vampire</td><td>turns the sim into a vampire or back into a human</td></tr><tr><td>Non-household sim</td><td>Make sim my contact</td><td>adds the selected sim to your relationships list</td></tr><tr><td>Non-household sim</td><td>Make furious with this sim</td><td>makes your sim really mad at whoever you clicked</td></tr><tr><td>Non-household sim</td><td>Add to family</td><td>adds selected sim to your household</td></tr><tr><td>Any plumbing object</td><td>Set state of cleanliness</td><td>makes your toilets, sinks and bathtubs dirty or clean</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>House &gt; Make all happy</td><td>fills needs for everyone in your household</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>House &gt; Make all needs static</td><td>freezes needs for entire household</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>House &gt; Make all needs dynamic</td><td>turns needs back on</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Neighborhood &gt; Make me know everyone</td><td>adds everyone in the world to your relationship list</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Neighborhood &gt; Make friends for me</td><td>makes everyone on your relationship list your best friend</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Neighborhood &gt; Invite all neighbors</td><td>every sim in the neighborhood shows up at the current lot</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Make NPC</td><td>spawns an NPC of the specified type</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Make Pet</td><td>spawns a pet of the specified type</td></tr></tbody></table><p>And with that, you've got everything you need to get your Sims 2 dynasty up and running. If you need them, we also have a list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-sims-1-cheats-for-legacy-edition/1100-6529241/" data-ref-id="1100-6529241">all The Sims 1 cheats</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-working-major-apex-legends-update-after-battlefield/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A major overhaul of Apex Legends appears to be on the horizon from EA. During its earnings call on Thursday, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said that the studio is working on an update to the “broad game experience” for Apex Legends.</p>



<p>The trajectory of the business of that franchise has not been heading in the direction that we have wanted for some time,” Wilson admitted. “We do believe there will be a time where we need to do a more meaningful update of Apex as a broad game experience and the team is diligently working on that.”</p>



<p>Wilson <a href="https://ir.ea.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Q3-2025-Earnings-Conference-Call/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that the update</a> likely won’t come anywhere during the buildup or around the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the next Battlefield game</a>. Instead, players should expect something on that “post Battlefield”.</p>



<p>He then added that, even further down the line, there will need to be a larger update than what’s planned for this next major update.</p>



<p>“Our expectation is that Apex will be one of those franchises [that keep growing for years] and that some time, on a longer term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience, an Apex 2.0, if you will,” he said. “This will not be the final incarnation of Apex. The team remains incredibly committed.”</p>



<p>Wilson’s comments on the future of Apex Legends and an eventual Apex 2.0 come after he made note during October’s earnings call that an Apex 2 wasn’t in the company’s plans.</p>



<p>“[W]hat I would say is that typically, what we have seen — again in the context of live service driven games at scale is the Version 2 thing has almost never been as successful as the Version 1 thing,” Wilson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-2-not-in-eas-plans-company-to-continue-innovating-current-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said at the time</a>. </p>

<p>For Whom The Bell Tolls is one of the trickiest missions in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. If you’ve gotten around 10 – 12 hours into the game (depending on your playstyle), you might be stuck on this quest. Fear not – I’m here to provide a full For Whom The Bell Tolls guide, showing you the fastest way to get it done.</p>



<p><strong>Be warned – there are major story spoilers ahead. If you’ve not attended the wedding in Semine, do not read any further.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-for-whom-the-bell-tolls-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How To Complete For Whom The Bell Tolls in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>For Whom The Bell Tolls starts with Henry down on his luck in Trosky Castle, tasked with becoming a forced worker of sorts as a repentance for his misdeeds at the wedding in Semine. Immediately, players are plunged into a dire set of circumstances, having all their items stripped from them – including clothing, food items, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-saviour-schnapps-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">precious Saviour Schnapps potions</a>.</p>



<p>You’re also against the clock in this mission, and you’re in a location that’s riddled with guards, trespass zones, and other dangers.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to complete the mission, though – this is my full For Whom The Bell Tolls guide, step-by-step. It’s the fastest and safest way to complete the quest.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-start-at-the-gate">1. Start at the gate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is where you’ll be tasked with hefting sacks of coal, but if you dismiss that job straight away, you can get to work. It’s worthwhile completing some of the side missions and extra tasks littered around the castle for skill point gains, but you don’t <strong>need </strong>to.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-go-to-the-second-gate">2. Go to the second gate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Head inside the courtyard and make for the second gate, heading deeper into the castle grounds.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-get-the-lockpick">3. Get the lockpick</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>On the opposite side of the courtyard to where you enter, you’ll see this blacksmith area – there will be a box on this shelf with a lockpick inside. You’ll need this for later.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-go-through-the-archway-on-the-left-of-the-courtyard-and-through-the-right-hand-door">4. Go through the archway on the left of the courtyard and through the right-hand door</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s time to get sneaky. Head through this archway and along the path until you come to two doors – take the one on the right.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-go-up-the-stairs-and-through-the-green-door">5. Go up the stairs and through the green door</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>From this point, you’ll want to start sneaking.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-go-through-the-next-room-and-up-the-stairs-but-beware">6. Go through the next room and up the stairs – but beware</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>He’s not here in the image above, but this is exactly where you’ll see a guard as you come up the stairs. You <strong>need </strong>to go this way, so crouch and throw a rock against the window to distract him away from the staircase before proceeding up.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-go-up-into-the-roof-and-up-the-tallest-tower">7. Go up into the roof and up the tallest tower</h3>



<p>There are no restrictions here and you should be free to run up the many steps to the top of the tower. It’s here that you’ll meet Captain Thomas again. He can help you with your all-important task – but he has fallen ill and you’re tasked with securing a potion to help him out.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I can help you figure out how to do that.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-go-back-the-way-you-came-distracting-the-same-guard-away-from-the-staircase">8. Go back the way you came, distracting the same guard away from the staircase</h3>



<p>Once you’ve pushed past that guard, it’s almost plain sailing back into the courtyard.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-go-back-outside-and-past-the-courtyard">9. Go back outside and past the courtyard</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>You’ll now want to head up this staircase on the opposite side of the courtyard. Again, this section will require active stealth.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-keep-going-until-you-reach-the-stone-cave-room">10. Keep going until you reach the ‘stone cave’ room</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once you reach this room, you’ll want to keep heading up, up, up. </p>



<h3 id="h-11-enter-the-brown-door">11. Enter the brown door</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Go through this door – you shouldn’t encounter any guards here.</p>



<h3 id="h-12-go-to-the-room-on-the-right-and-deal-with-katherine">12. Go to the room on the right and deal with Katherine</h3>



<p>Katherine is back again, but aside from a light conversation, she offers almost nothing. You’ll need to solve this task by yourself.</p>



<h3 id="h-13-get-the-physician-s-book">13. Get the Physician’s Book</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>On the shelf here sits a Physician’s Book, which you’ll need to learn about the Fever Tonic, the thing you need to complete For Whom The Bell Tolls in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-14-lockpick-the-chest-very-easy-and-acquire-all-the-items-inside">14. Lockpick the chest (Very Easy) and acquire all the items inside</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This chest holds everything you need to make Fever Tonic in For Whom The Bell Tolls. If you’ve never performed any Alchemy before, it’s not all that tough. The game will walk you through it, so don’t fear.</p>



<p>While you’re here, don’t forget to check other Alchemy guides, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-belladonna-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-guide/">where to find Belladonna in KCD2</a>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve brewed the potion, it’s time to get moving.</p>



<p>You’ll want to repeat steps 4 – 7 to get back to Captain Thomas and give him the potion, easing his malady and completing For Whom The Bell Tolls.</p>



<p>That’s the fastest quest guide for For Whom The Bell Tolls that you’ll find online. Best of luck!</p>

                <p>The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> episode, Heresy, has arrived and with it plenty of big changes to classes. Tons of tweaks to the Arc subclass along with updates across the board have introduced some brand-new build possibilities. Here are three excellent builds for--one each for Titan, Warlock, and Hunter--that use some of the new features along with some different builds utilizing artifact perks. These include suggestions on which Exotic weapons, Fragments, Aspects, and Supers to combine for an effective and fun class setup.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Arc Warlock</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438953" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438953"></a><figcaption>An Arc Warlock build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The adjustments to the Arc subclass introduce a new mechanic known as <strong>Bolt Charge</strong>, which is a stacking elemental damage perk that unleashes a chain lightning burst when the stacks are full. Multiple sources of damage, including class abilities, will build up stacks of Bolt Charge. This build for Warlocks utilizes tons of Arc damage sources from both weapons and abilities to make the best use of it.</p><p dir="ltr">For armor, one of the best choices of Exotic is the <strong>Geomag Stabilizers</strong>. Extending the duration of your Chaos Reach Super will build up Bolt Charge stacks, and spreading Arc Damage around is crucial for making the most out of the new mechanic– these boots will help do just that. The patch released alongside the launch of Heresy changed Geomag Stabilizers to leverage Bolt Charge stacks: Sprinting while near maximum stacks will fill up the charges to unleash the attack from Bolt Charge.</p><p dir="ltr">The best weapon to pair with this build is the exotic Fusion Rifle <strong>Delicate Tomb</strong>. With its ability to generate Ionic Traces for Super energy and additionally adding more stacks of Bolt Charge. Delicate Tomb was also buffed for Episode Heresy with better chances to generate Ionic Traces, increased damage in PvE, and now the Tempest Cascade buff will last until the weapon is fired.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass to use for this build is <strong>Stormcaller</strong> with the <strong>Chaos Reach</strong> Super, the Ball Lightning melee attack, and Flashbang Grenade. For the Aspects choose <strong>Electrostatic Mind</strong> for increased creation of Ionic Traces when defeating Blinded or Jolted targets, and <strong>Ionic Sentry</strong> for the new autonomous turret. Defeating targets with Arc abilities or weapons will build up charges for an Ionic Sentry, which is then deployed by using a Grenade attack.</p><p dir="ltr">Class Fragments for this build should be <strong>Spark of Resistance</strong> for increased damage resistance while surrounded, <strong>Spark of Discharge</strong> which spawns extra Ionic Traces on Arc weapon final blows, S<strong>park of Beacons</strong> for blinding explosions on Heavy weapon final blows or special final blows, and <strong>Spark of Shock</strong> which debuffs targets hit by grenade attacks with Jolt.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Glaive Titan</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438951" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438951"></a><figcaption>A Void Titan build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This setup is for melee-loving Titan players. Utilizing the recent buffs to Destabilizing Rounds, which detonates enemies hit by Void weapons after dealing damage with Void abilities, this build centers around lots of close-quarters fighting.</p><p dir="ltr">The main Exotic armor for Titans using this build should be <strong>Synthoceps</strong>. When a player is surrounded by enemies, they gain buffs to melee and Super damage as well as faster weapon reload speed and weapon handling. While using a Glaive, the melee buff is further applied using the weapon's close-range attack.</p><p dir="ltr">An excellent Exotic weapon to combine with this build is the class-exclusive Glaive <strong>Edge of Action</strong> from The Witch Queen expansion. Glaives combine both ranged and melee attacks and because of the emphasis on being Surrounded, further buffs from Synthoceps will make this weapon even stronger. As the Glaive builds up energy from hits with the ranged component, the special ability, Remote Shield, is triggered on full stacks. The next shot fired will put down a small dome shield wherever it is aimed at the ground. Hop inside the shield for extra defense and any enemy that comes inside the shield bubble is blinded and slowed.</p><p dir="ltr">For the subclass, Titans will need to be using <strong>Sentinel</strong> with the <strong>Twilight Arsenal</strong> Super. The Super can be exchanged for any other, as this build is not fully dependent on it, but Twilight Arsenal is the best all-rounder for the way this build functions. For class Aspects, the main one to choose is <strong>Controlled Demolition</strong>, which debuffs a target with Volatile when they're hit by a Void ability or another Volatile explosion. <strong>Bastion</strong> is an excellent second choice for the Void overshield on use of the Void Super.</p><p dir="ltr">The Class Fragments for this build are <strong>Echo of Exchange</strong>, which grants grenade energy after a melee kill; <strong>Echo of Undermining</strong>, which weakens targets hit by grenade attacks; <strong>Echo of Persistence</strong>, which enhances Void-based buffs such as Overshield; and <strong>Echo of Leeching</strong>, which starts healing players and nearby allies upon a melee kill.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Prismatic Hunter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438958" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438958"></a><figcaption>A Prismatic Hunter build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This build leverages an underutilized and largely unknown synergy between two Exotic items for large area-of-effect damage combined with the new Bolt Charge mechanics. When used correctly, players can expect to clear rooms in a hurry and deal lots of damage to more hearty targets quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Exotics to use in this build, the two main choices are the <strong>Mothkeeper's Wraps</strong> gauntlets and the weapon <strong>Ex Diris</strong>. Mothkeeper's Wraps transforms the grenade ability into a bomb that releases two moths, one that applies a small Void overshield to you and a second that seeks a nearby target and explodes, causing the enemy to be blinded. Ex Diris is a special grenade launcher that shoots a large Arc projectile that detonates on impact. After a kill or rapid direct hits with it, its special perk spawns an additional moth that will seek nearby targets and explode, causing a blinding effect. Additionally, Ex Diris can shoot faster when dealing damage rapidly or the player takes sustained damage over time and survives.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass Hunters will want to use for this one is <strong>Prismatic</strong>. For the grenade slot, any grenade can apply here, but the best option is <strong>Strand Grapple</strong>. The melee attack for this build works best with <strong>Snare Bomb</strong>, which lets players throw a small smoke bomb at a target that deals damage over time and disorients them. Aspects for this build use <strong>Stylish Executioner</strong> and <strong>Threaded Specter</strong>. Stylish Executioner will turn players invisible upon a kill with either a grenade or a melee ability, and the next melee attack while invisible will weaken a target. Threaded Specter spawns a Strand clone of the player when they use the Hunter's dodge ability that attracts enemies to it that detonates after a few seconds.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Facet of Protection</strong> will boost damage resistance while surrounded and the effect is even stronger while using the Transcendence special ability. <strong>Facet of Dawn</strong> will grant players Radiance upon a powered melee kill, which increases weapon damage from Solar element sources and causes a heal over time. <strong>Facet of Purpose</strong> will grant an elemental shield based on the chosen Super's element. <strong>Facet of Dominance</strong> causes Arc grenades to Jolt targets, which is applied via Ex Diris and the Mothkeeper's Wraps special bombs.</p>

My name is Karawaki, and I’m producer on <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>. Thank you for tuning in.</p><p>“This title is the newest entry in Capcom’s sword fighting <a title="Genres > Action [2,459 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> series, <em>Onimusha</em>. To add some detail to what we showed in the video, in this game we are taking <em>Onimusha</em>‘s signature sword fighting action and dark fantasy elements, and using Capcom’s latest technology to make this new game as captivating as possible.</p><p>“We’re focusing on three core aspects:</p><ul><li>“Compelling characters, including a new protagonist and enemies that are interesting more than just visually.</li><li>“The setting of Kyoto, a location brimming with historic spots with mysterious and unsettling backstories.</li><li>“And lastly, the ultimate sword fighting action. These are the three core aspects we’re working to emphasize in our game.</li></ul><p>“Now, I would like to introduce the director of this title, Nihei.”</p><p><strong>Satoru Nihei, Director</strong></p><p>“Hello. I am the director of <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, Nihei. Thank you for your time.</p><p>“We decided to set this game in the Edo period of historic Japan. You’ll explore historic locations around Kyoto, such as Kiyomizu-dera Temple, in a heroic tale of a soul samurai fighting against hordes of twisted creatures known as Genma. The protagonist, due to a twist of fate, finds himself wielding an Oni gauntlet. Now in <em>Onimusha</em>, he sets about mowing down the monstrosities roaming the world of the living and feeding their souls to the gauntlet. Through gritty, bloody-soaked brawls, he searches for his reason to fight. What fate awaits at the end of his path?</p><p>“Adding our own touches to real-life historical figures, you will meet a cast of unique characters. And in addition to sword battles, drama will unfold in a beautifully eerie depiction of Kyoto.</p><p>“Now, to talk about the action of the game. With sword-to-sword combat, we put particular emphasis on the satisfaction of slicing through enemies. As you saw in the footage released, there’s also plenty of soul-sucking action with the Oni gauntlet. By absorbing souls, you can restore your health as well as use special moves. Deciding how to absorb the souls of your enemy in the heat of an intense battle will be the key to victory.</p><p>“We’re not trying to make an impossibly difficult game. Instead, we want to make a game where fans of action can experience thrilling sword fights and take satisfaction from slaying their enemies. We sincerely hope you look forward to what we are creating.”</p><p><strong>Akihito Kadokwaki, Producer</strong></p><p>“The footage we showed earlier was from a short version of the trailer. The full version is available right now on the game’s official website, so we hope you give it a watch. For some regions, gameplay footage was recorded with dismemberment disabled. But please note that dismemberment and blood will be fully featured in the game.”</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I got this from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1886765474119119040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1886765474119119040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel’s official social media accounts</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="ceffff81bbcedaa69b99c17609f59912" data-recommend-id="image://ceffff81bbcedaa69b99c17609f59912" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ceffff81bbcedaa69b99c17609f59912" data-recommend-id="image://ceffff81bbcedaa69b99c17609f59912" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While fans online have spotted a few discrepancies, the biggest red flag according to many is in the middle left of the image.

So does that automatically mean AI was used to create these posters? Well, I’m not sure about that. Let’s all put our pitchforks down for a moment, okay?</p><p>First off, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1886765476597911643&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1886765476597911643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the other three posters don’t seem to contain any obvious AI artifacts</a></span>. It would be odd to only use AI on one poster. Secondly, some of the other discrepancies in the poster (like the same woman’s face popping up twice) can be explained by someone assuming that people weren’t going to zoom in on every pixel of every human in the image. They likely had a set number of assets and limited time, and reused some stuff in Photoshop when putting the poster together. </p><p>As for the hand with four fingers, here’s my theory: It’s possible that the pointer finger is resting unseen behind the flag pole to stabilize it while waving. It’s an odd way to hold a flag, I grant you, but it would explain the missing finger. </p><p>Or maybe AI was used in the poster’s creation by one artist who didn’t tell anyone and Marvel isn’t lying but instead is not fully aware of the situation. I’ll be curious to hear more about Finger-gate soon. I mean, Marvel <em>did</em> use AI to create the awful-looking opening credits for 2023's <em>Secret Invasion.</em> </p><p><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>arrives in theaters on July 25 and kicks off the next phase of the MCU. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Valve Regional Standings, also known commonly as Valve rankings or VRS, are the primary factor that determines which CS2 teams go <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-counter-strike-major-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the illustrious Majors</a>. In previous years, Major participants were determined by the results of prior Majors and/or RMR qualifier events. But under the new system as of 2025, it’s VRS over anything else.</p>



<p>Checking out pro CS2 for the first time or returning after a while? Here’s a full breakdown of the Valve Regional Standings used in Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-valve-regional-standings">What are the Valve Regional Standings?</h2>



<p>The Valve Regional Standings are four sets of rankings for CS2 teams: one global standings, and three regional standings. Each of the regional standings ranks the teams from the three primary CS2 regions: Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific.</p>



<p>The standings themselves rank teams based on their performances in ranked tournaments and matches. Each match played features several different factors that determine how a match affects a team’s standing. The primary factors are the result of the match, strength of opponent, weight (importance) of an event, and recency. These rankings are updated weekly, usually on Mondays.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-are-the-valve-regional-standings-used">How are the Valve Regional Standings used?</h2>



<p>Valve Regional Standings are used to determine invites to tournaments and tournament qualifiers. For the more prestigious events, organizers will use the global standings to determine who’s invited to the event. Tournament organizers will also use the regional standings to invite teams to regional closed qualifiers.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Valve Regional Standings influence which teams are invited to the Major</a>. Specifically, the Major uses the regional rankings and the regional results of the previous Major to decide how many teams from each region are invited and what stage they start in. </p>



<p>For example, at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming BLAST.tv Austin Major</a>, the top six European teams according to the VRS will be invited directly to Stage 3, alongside the number one ranked teams from Americas and Asia-Pacific. The regional rankings will also determine which teams from each region are invited to Stage 2, and which ones that will be invited to the closed regional qualifiers.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-are-the-valve-regional-standings">Where are the Valve Regional Standings?</h2>



<p>The Valve Regional Standings are <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_regional_standings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted on a GitHub page</a> operated by Valve. From the main page, click on either the invitation or live folder, go to the current year, and select the regional standings page with the most current date. Sites like HLTV and BLAST also host the global and regional rankings, and update them each week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/should-you-replace-pebbles-in-kingdom-come-horse/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018), Henry of Skalitz has sat atop Pebbles, his trusty nag. While Pebbles isn’t the most attractive or capable horse at first blush, she’s a familiar sight in the series and has sentimental value. With that in mind, should you replace Pebbles in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 when you’re given the opportunity?</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to get your first horse in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and whether you should replace Pebbles once you’ve tracked her down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-is-pebbles">Where is Pebbles?</h2>



<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, players start the game alongside Pebbles, but a dire set of circumstances unfold, leaving Henry horse-less.</p>



<p>Not for long, though.</p>



<p>Once you’ve completed the opening sequences, you’ll want to make a beeline for Semine. When you’ve been released from the stocks in Troskowitz, you can speak to Bara (the red-clothed woman) and she’ll give you a tip on where to find a horse, recommending that you head to the Semine stables.</p>



<p>If you make your way there, you’ll be greeted with an idyllic location complete with a stables, and upon examining the horses, you’ll notice something strange – <strong>one of them is Pebbles</strong>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve identified Pebbles, you can speak to Groom Ballatay, attempting to buy Pebbles <strong>or </strong>convincing him to give Pebbles back for free. That’ll require passing a speech check or two, and you’ll have to convince him to ‘be reasonable’ to get Pebbles back.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-replace-pebbles">Should You Replace Pebbles?</h2>



<p>If you’re asking yourself, ‘Should I replace Pebbles,’ then I’m ashamed of you. This beautiful horse has been through the wringer and the first thing you want to do is replace her!</p>



<p>Here is the <strong>major reason why </strong>you don’t want to replace Pebbles in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eventually, you’ll unlock the ‘Good Old Pebbles’ perk, which boosts Pebbles’ skills immeasurably after a few hours of relying on her to get around. This makes her better than almost any horse you can buy.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you don’t like how Pebbles looks, you can customise her at a tailor or a saddler by selecting from a range of coats, covers, bridles, and saddles.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got Pebbles, make sure you’re firing from horseback with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/find-best-crossbow-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">best ranged weapon in the game</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s Light and Darkness Saga is poised to wrap up yet again this week, as part of a "final epilogue" developer Bungie is calling Heresy.  Notably, though, the studio has warned it won't be an all-singing, all-dancing finale - or an all-talking one, at least - given the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike means it's releasing with some of its voice lines missing.
</p>
<p>
Video game performers within the US actors union SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">voted to go on strike last July</a>, after negotiations with major game companies over the use of AI failed to result in a deal. And with the strike still ongoing, Bungie has confirmed "certain voice lines" in its Heresy update won't be voiced.
</p>
<p>
"With this being our final epilogue entry for the Light and Darkness Saga, our teams have been taking great care to deliver delightful narrative beats and story content for players to enjoy," it <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25">wrote in a blog post</a> shared on its website. "Due to the on-going SAG-AFTRA strike, you may notice certain voice lines being silent in-game."
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
To ensure narrative content can still be followed by players, Bungie says it's enabled subtitles in the Heresy update by default. All activities with missing voice lines will feature a warning beforehand, and the studio points players toward Destiny 2's subtitle customisation and accessibility options so they can "prepare for introductory sequences impacted by this change."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear if Bungie intends to patch in Heresy's missing voice lines at a later date if an agreement is reached with SAG-AFTRA.
</p>
<p>
Back in January, SAG-AFTRA confirmed over 130 games had signed to its Interim Interactive Media Agreement, giving companies "access to [its] members under fair and equitable conditions." However, as voice actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer at the time</a>, there were still hold-outs. "There are a couple of entities who want to protect their potential profits in the future and leave lots of doors open," she explained, "and those doors could potentially hurt us a lot."

At this year’s event on Saturday, a jampacked Locus Oil stadium in Indianapolis saw major returns like 16- time world champion John Cena and former Royal Rumble winner Charlotte Flair, who was looking to regain her dominance. We also witnessed the surprise return of the phenomenal AJ Styles and the multi-time world champion Alexa Bliss. There was no bigger surprise, however, than Jey Uso continuing his path to greatness and winning the Men’s Rumble match. Only one that compares is how brutally Cody Rhodes overcame his old friend  turned bitter enemy, Kevin Owens, and leaving the event still undisputed champion.</p><p>Winning the Royal Rumble guarantees an opportunity to headline WrestleMania.

Over the last month, Nia found herself in a feud with her longtime rival, RAW superstar and Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley. These two powerhouses clashed at WWE <em>Saturday Night’s Main Event</em> special; however, Jax was unsuccessful in her pursuit of the world title. Following this loss, the former multi-time champion set her sights on the Royal Rumble, hoping to headline the biggest show of them all—WrestleMania.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>After entering the Royal Rumble at #29, Nia Jax wasted no time dominating the field, first eliminating WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus. The 2024 Queen of the Ring showed no fear when the remaining competitors in the ring attempted to team up against her, but Jax ultimately overcame each opponent. She recorded nine eliminations in this year’s Rumble match, taking out notable names such as Iyo Sky, Liv Morgan, Raquel Rodriguez, WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella, NXT’s Stephanie Vaquer, WWE Women’s Tag Team Champions Naomi and Bianca Belair, and Zelina Vega.

On WWE’s massive debut episode of RAW on Netflix, Morgan lost the WWE Women’s Championship to The Eradicator and hasn’t been the same since. She has grown somewhat distant from her boyfriend, “Dirty” Dominik Mysterio, as well as the rest of her Judgment Day stablemates.</p><p>Perhaps Morgan was distracted by her aspirations of winning the Royal Rumble. Or maybe the former Money in the Bank winner soured on Judgment Day after Mysterio seemingly tried to worm his way back to Ripley—his former flame—following Morgan’s loss last month. Regardless, the intrigue surrounding her situation made Morgan a viable choice to win the Rumble.<br></p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>With the New Jersey native having recently held the World Championship, it was crucial for Morgan to have a strong showing in the Rumble match. She lasted over an hour—the second-longest time ever recorded in a women’s Rumble—proving that she remains a top competitor in the division.</p><p>Entering at #2, Morgan secured two eliminations, first taking out veteran Natalya and later eliminating the returning former World Champion, Alexa Bliss. She demonstrated her endurance and fighting spirit by attacking nearly every competitor who entered the match after her.

Rhodes emerged victorious, but the loss left his Canadian-born opponent furious. Following the match, Owens attacked Rhodes with his finishing move—the <em>package piledriver</em>—which had been banned in WWE until recently. He then stole the recently reintroduced winged eagle WWE Championship belt, effectively sidelining Rhodes for a few weeks.</p><p>During the buildup to the Royal Rumble, Owens repeatedly claimed he was the true World Champion and even attempted to recruit his longtime friend and fellow Canadian, Sami Zayn, to assist him in dethroning Rhodes. As tensions escalated, The American Nightmare made his return and engaged in multiple brawls with Owens on WWE TV. Their rivalry culminated in a contract signing for a ladder match at the Royal Rumble, where both the winged eagle title and the Undisputed Championship—still in Rhodes’ possession—would be suspended above the ring. The storyline leading into the premium live event (PLE) was compelling, with many fans believing Owens had a legitimate shot at dethroning Rhodes.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance:</strong> The WWE Champion found himself in an all-out war against a dangerous and determined Kevin Owens at the Royal Rumble. The two competitors brawled into the crowd before making their way back to ringside, escalating the intensity of the match. Owens, known for always delivering an entertaining performance regardless of the match type, did not disappoint.</p><p>Rhodes endured a relentless onslaught for most of the contest. Desperate to turn the tide, he attempted to climb the ladder to retrieve the titles, but Owens had other plans. The Prizefighter yanked the ladder from under Rhodes, leaving him hanging in mid-air, clutching the suspended championships—a thrilling moment that paid homage to classic ladder matches of the past. Owens capitalized on the situation with a brutal powerbomb variation.</p><p>In a critical moment, Rhodes attempted to superplex Owens from the top rope—an ambitious move that rarely succeeds. Instead, Owens countered with a devastating Avalanche Fisherman Buster onto a ladder, delivering one of the match’s most jaw-dropping spots. However, Owens’ downfall came after he was sent crashing through a ladder via an Alabama Slam, sealing the victory for Rhodes.</p><p>Despite the loss, Owens delivered a stellar performance, proving once again why he remains one of WWE’s elite competitors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1730ba476c839f4830be098b9098697" data-recommend-id="image://f1730ba476c839f4830be098b9098697" data-format="jpg" data-width="3582" data-height="2388" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="CM Punk entering ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="CM Punk entering ring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Andrew Timms/WWE via Getty Images</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1730ba476c839f4830be098b9098697" data-recommend-id="image://f1730ba476c839f4830be098b9098697" data-format="jpg" data-width="3582" data-height="2388" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="CM Punk entering ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Heading into the Royal Rumble, CM Punk was widely considered the odds-on favorite to win. However, there was no shortage of superstars determined to prevent that from happening. Since his WWE return in late 2023, The Second City Saint has reignited his longstanding rivalry with “The Architect” Seth Rollins, a feud that has spanned over a decade. Their tensions escalated further after Punk defeated Rollins on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-wwe-monday-night-raw-the-rock-john-cena-news-1851734142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wwe-monday-night-raw-the-rock-john-cena-news-1851734142">WWE’s Raw on Netflix debut</a></span> in January.</p><p>In addition to Rollins, Punk also had to contend with Drew McIntyre, who was fixated on avenging his loss to Punk inside Hell in a Cell. More intriguingly, Punk had an undisclosed arrangement with The Wiseman Paul Heyman before Survivor Series in November, which led him to assist The Only Tribal Chief Roman Reigns in his War Games match. </p><p>As the Royal Rumble approached, Punk’s in-ring promo with Cody Rhodes on the final <em>Raw</em> before the PLE added yet another layer to his ongoing storylines. With so many narrative threads converging, Punk winning the Rumble seemed like a natural outcome—perhaps even too easy. </p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance:</strong> Entering at #24, Punk had a lot to prove. Last year, the former multi-time champion suffered an injury during the match and ultimately finished as the runner-up. This time, he was determined to change the outcome. Upon entering the fray, Punk immediately clashed with Rollins before Drew McIntyre took his turn attacking him. Logan Paul also attempted to ambush Punk but was swiftly taken out with a crisp “Go to Sleep” finisher.</p><p>The defining moment of Punk’s performance came when he shockingly eliminated both Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns simultaneously—a feat that few could accomplish. However, his Rumble run came to an abrupt end when he was eliminated by Logan Paul. The chaos didn’t stop there, as all hell broke loose outside the ring. Punk and Rollins continued brawling at ringside before being forcibly separated by a swarm of WWE officials. </p><p>Although Punk didn’t win the match, his elimination of Reigns and Rollins set the stage for something even bigger. His story—especially with The Tribal Chief—is just beginning.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af952a7f9c2582e4233d0687b2471ed1" data-recommend-id="image://af952a7f9c2582e4233d0687b2471ed1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins coming to the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins coming to the ring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Georgiana Dallas/WWE via Getty Images<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af952a7f9c2582e4233d0687b2471ed1" data-recommend-id="image://af952a7f9c2582e4233d0687b2471ed1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins coming to the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>Is losing a match against CM Punk on Netflix really that bad?

Some fans even considered him a favorite to win the Royal Rumble.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>Much like Punk, Rollins’ most memorable moments occurred after his elimination. After being thrown out by CM Punk, Rollins became unhinged. Roman Reigns was outside the ring, and Rollins delivered an unprovoked Curb Stomp before engaging in another brawl with Punk. At every opportunity, The Revolutionary attacked a vulnerable Reigns, ultimately delivering a brutal stomp onto the steel steps.</p><p>The former World Champion showcased a vicious side, all but guaranteeing an intense and compelling story build as we approach WrestleMania.

However, “Main Event” Jey Uso proved he was too popular with the audience to lose any steam. Each week, the crowd chanted and sang along to Uso’s theme song while also doing the signature “yeet dance” with him. Jey wanted to prove he was not just the “right hand man” for Roman Reigns or the “other twin,” and that he could succeed as a solo (no pun intended) wrestler. For Jey, the Rumble match was the best opportunity to exhibit his skills and further elevate his value.</p><p><strong>Royal Rumble In-Ring Performance: </strong>The former intercontinental champion found himself in a favorable position, entering the match at number 20 as approximately 70,000 people reacted with loud Yeet chants. Something felt special about the multi-time team champion that night. Uso had an unforgettable moment with the mega star LA Knight in which they went back and forth with strikes that inevitably forced the crowd to chant “yeah,” which is Knight’s catchphrase, and “yeet.” Truly entertaining! What fans will remember the most about Jey’s performance, however, is his interaction with John Cena at the end of the match. In what is unquestionably the biggest win of his career, Jey Uso eliminated Cena to win the 2025 Royal Rumble. Uso will now get a well-earned, well-deserved push and headline WrestleMania.

<p>EA’s fiscal year takes place between April 1st, 2025 to March 31, 2026. Logically and historically, it means that the next Battlefield title is targeting an October – November 2025 release.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, EA announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a>, a brand-new community test environment to test the game ahead of its final release. At the moment, it seems like Battlefield Labs will focus on the titles multiplayer offering, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield is also poised to have a free-to-play Battle Royale experience</a> by Ripple Effect. </p>



<p>Also announced in a behind-the-scenes preview of Battlefield Labs was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return a Battlefield Portal</a>, which was first introduced in Battlefield 2042 and brings back classic maps, vehicles, weapons, and more.</p>

<p>The next Battlefield title is set to take the franchise to a “back to its roots” approach, taking the majority of its inspiration from Battlefield’s most popular days with Battlefield 3 and 4. Modern combat, a class system, and destruction are all poised to return.</p>



<p>Battlefield will now be led by Respawn Entertainment’s Vince Zampella as a part of the franchises restructuring following Battlefield 2042’s weak launch. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-vangaurds-update-35-adds-starting-questline-and-boss-rush-multiplayer-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anime-vanguards-roblox">Anime Vanguards</a> update 3.5 is here with four new units, multiplayer functionality for boss rush, a starting questline, and a collection of bug and quality-of-life adjustments for Roblox players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Kitawari unveiled everything in its <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16146832113/UPDATE-3-5-Anime-Vanguards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fate Boss Event</a> patch notes, pulling back the curtain with even more changes following the arrival of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-vanguards-winter-update-30-brings-lobby-revamp-and-new-portals-game-mode"><u>update 3.0</u></a> late last month. Topping the list of new content are four units – Sokora, Saber, Lilia, and Isdead – which can be found across different in-game challenges. There’s also a Saber boss event, which comes with its own rewards, including two Secret units, trait rerolls, gold and gems, and more that you’ll have to log in to see for yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Boss Rush overhaul includes multiplayer functionality for Roblox players looking to take on challenging tasks with friends, as well as normal and elite difficulty modes, tournament support, and boss event cycle changes. The Anime Vanguards Sand Village map has also gotten a full-on facelift that gives it a new design and enhanced visuals, and Worldlines have been reset, with additional resets coming every .5 update. Another new feature is one Kitawari says it added to address fan feedback: a starting player questline.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/03/anime-vanguards-update-3-5-1738623209703.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Anime Vanguards update 3.5 brings more fundamental changes alongside bug fixes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve acknowledged how overwhelming the early game may be for our new players,” Kitawari said. “To help with this, all new players will be greeted with a uniquely created questline which will guide them through the various elements of the game, and reward them with a Mythic Vogita Super upon quest end to start their journey in Anime Vanguards! We intend to create a great experience for all, and will continue looking into the various ways we can improve the gameplay for<strong> </strong>new as well as<strong> </strong>returning players alike in future updates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Vanguards update 3.5 brings plenty to keep players fighting off waves of enemies, but it’s only Kitawari’s latest content delivery. Last month, the team rolled out update 3.0, which focused on more winter-themed goodies to enjoy but also introduced a brand-new lobby and the Portals game mode. These changes and more are here to bolster the Roblox experience around the one-year anniversary of its original launch in January 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s currently no word regarding when Anime Vanguards update 4.0 will arrive, but at this rate, players may only have to wait a few weeks to learn more. For everything else on Kitawari’s anime tower defense game, you can see all active codes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-vanguards-codes"><u>here</u></a>. Finally, you can see the full update 3.5 patch notes, below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Anime Vanguards Update 3.5 Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fate Boss Event</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Features</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! 4 NEW UNITS!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update is coming out with <strong>4</strong> new units! These units will be found in:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Boss Rush</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Sokora, Sokora (Angra Mainyu)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Secret Evolution</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Saber (Alternate), Saber (Black Tyrant)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Mythic Banner Unit</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Lilia, Lilia And Berserker</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Worldlines Floor 50 Reward</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Isdead, Isdead (Romantic)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Saber (Alternate) Boss Event</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Sokora and the formidable Tyrant Saber (Alternate) have appeared! Dark Sokora plans to fuse with the malevolent Angra Mainyu; do you have what it takes to stop them?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss Rush Rewards Include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 New Secret Units</li><li>Trait Rerolls</li><li>Gold &amp; Gems</li><li>… and more!</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How to Obtain Saber (Alternate)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can obtain Saber (Alternate) by placing a Saber (King Of Knights) unit next to the A.W.E Boss that remains stationary at enemy spawn. The A.W.E Boss will spawn at Wave 15, and Wave 25, staying for 5 waves each time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon Unit Placement or Boss Spawn, all Saber (King Of Knights) units within range will become “corrupted” and transform into Saber (A.W.E.), with the interaction having a small chance of dropping the Saber (Alternate) unit, up to a maximum of 3 tries per match (up to 6 while using the Saber Servant Mechanic).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Servants Mechanic</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bring forth a fabled figure of choice to assist you in battle - each Servant offers unique mechanics, so be sure to read their ability descriptions with care, some may be better suited for your team than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>Unlocking Servants</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The powerful Berserker Servant is available for free, while the others must be purchased using the servant’s corresponding unit’s evolution item. Once acquired, they are permanently available for use in battle. Choose carefully, or acquire them all and unleash their power!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>Command Seal Activation</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can Activate or Empower your chosen Servant’s mechanic up to 3 times by pressing the red Command Seal button near the inventory. Use them wisely to turn the tide of battle!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Boss Rush Overhaul</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve made several changes to make playing boss rushes much more fun and meaningful! These include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Multiplayer Functionality</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re now able to play Boss Rush with your friends, or alternatively use Public Matchmaking to join other players from across the world!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Normal &amp; Elite Difficulty</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">We have split Boss Rushes into two separate difficulties, “Normal” which is a <strong>CO-OP</strong> gamemode that does not have access to tournaments, as well as an “Elite” <strong>Solo</strong> gamemode for those of you looking for a challenge, and to gain access to the Elite Tournament.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Elite Tournament</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re now able to participate in the Boss Rush Tournaments which will reset alongside the boss rush cycle. Aim to clear the Event in the least time possible, and compete against other players in your local bracket!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be careful when the bosses spawn–the waves automatically and immediately skip whenever the boss is alive!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Boss Event Cycle Changes</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with boss events cycling, your <strong>boss event currency </strong>of that cycle<strong> </strong>and <strong>boss event stock </strong>will now also <strong>reset</strong>! We will most likely include evolution items and other important items to the legacy shop, making your legacy tokens more valuable and immune to cycle resets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Public Matchmaking</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re now able to find matches with players to play your favorite game modes regardless of what server they are on through our brand new Public Lobbies system! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To join others, simply press the “Public Lobbies” button within the “fractures” UI and select any of the player hosted matches there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To host your own match, press the “Create Match” button instead, and then press the “Find Match” button within the stage you have selected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Worldlines Reset</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All players have been reset to Floor 1, and Soburo is no longer obtainable.<br> However, all the corresponding floor rewards have now returned, with <strong>Isdead </strong>replacing Soburo as the <strong>new Floor 50 reward</strong>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced in the Discord server, Worldlines will reset every X.5 update, with the next reset planned for Update 4.5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Sand Village Remake</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sand village remake has finally arrived, featuring entirely brand new designs and enhanced visuals! As one of the last remaining original maps from release, this overhaul finally brings it up to the standard of our latest maps. We hope you enjoy exploring the new and improved Sand Village map as much as we do!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Starting Player Questline</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve acknowledged how overwhelming the early game may be for our new players. To help with this, all new players will be greeted with a uniquely created questline which will guide them through the various elements of the game, and reward them with a Mythic Vogita Super upon quest end to start their journey in Anime Vanguards!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We intend to create a great experience for all, and will continue looking into the various ways we can improve the gameplay for<strong> new </strong>as well as<strong> returning </strong>players alike in future updates.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Changes &amp; QoL</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Added a visual timer when a unit gets stunned</strong></li><li>Added Visual Indicators for Enemy Spawn &amp; Friendly Base/End Of Path during the voting phase</li><li>Worldlines Leaderboard incorrectly had the same rewards as tournaments, this has now been fixed to match the other global leaderboards</li><li>An <strong>In-Game Elemental Reactions table</strong> has been added, making figuring out what each reaction does easier than ever! Furthermore, it comes with a “Show Only Elements In-Match” setting, which when on, will only show the reactions that can happen between your units and the enemies</li><li>You can now <strong>delete multiple portals at once</strong></li><li>We’ve heard your requests! <strong>Sukuno</strong> now applies <strong>bleed</strong> up until upgrade 9, which is then replaced by <strong>burn </strong>(this is unrelated to the plans stated in Sub Announcements on our server)</li><li><strong>Added Amount Sliders for purchasing items or summoning units</strong></li><li><strong>Increased game start time from 30 to 60 seconds.</strong> This helps players who take a longer time to load in, need more time to strategize and change their lineup, or just want to look around the map!</li><li>Added a “<strong>NEW</strong>” flair to recently obtained units, which goes away after interacting with them, in order to make newly-obtained units easier to spot</li><li>Added <strong>“NEW!”</strong> text next to world markers in areas where new major content has been added</li><li>Slightly revamped the Unit Traits Index UI, to easier tell what each trait does at a glance.</li><li>Unit circle indicators now change to <strong>purple</strong> when a unit is maxed.</li><li>The opening animation for windows is now smoother.</li><li>Added Sasori viewmodel to the Pass icon</li><li>Added background frames to all stat previews when hovering over units</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">         … and more!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bug Fixes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Fixed Valentine (AU) clones costing Yen to place</p><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Fixed Rogita 4 (Super) also taking money for his clone, effectively doubling his placement cost</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Emmie &amp; Emmie (Ice Witch) no longer freeze friendly summons</li><li>Fixed Sosora missing a cosmetic on both the Shiny and Non-Shiny variants.</li><li>Fixed Padoru familiar buffs stacking</li><li>Fixed being able to buy a mount more than once in shop</li><li>Fixed being able to apply the same potion effect despite already having one active.

thousands of players, presumably in the hopes of leading to a more positive launch than EA saw with Battlefield 2042. Among other things, the game saw a controversial change to its traditional class system and an increase to the max player count.</p><p>The first of these tests will be starting in the "coming weeks" and cover a range of specific areas, like gameplay loops and map layouts. Learnings from the tests will then be shared online at a later time. The game is said to currently be in a pre-alpha state; some brief <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-next-battlefields-gameplay-modern-setting/1100-6529196/" data-ref-id="1100-6529196">gameplay glimpses</a> can be seen in the video above. </p><p>This next Battlefield game is in development by Battlefield Studios, a new banner that spans multiple studios, including DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion, and Motive. With this being Criterion's focus, it sounds as if Need for Speed is on ice, though the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/need-for-speed-isnt-dead-but-criterion-is-focused-on-road-ahead-with-battlefield/1100-6529198/" data-ref-id="1100-6529198">franchise is not dead</a>.</p>
