<figure data-uuid="e69e1dd540cf3"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e69e1dd540cf3/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Game over screens — as a professional gamer, you understand — aren't something that I personally have a lot of firsthand experience with. Not through a lack of in-game skill, that's for sure.</p>
<p>However, as I'm also a highly learned and incredibly hirsute scholar of the interactive arts (also a compulsive liar), I <em>have</em> made it my very important business to die on purpose many, many times in order to familiarise myself with the very best and most important ways to come-a-cropper, as they say, in a video game.</p>
<p>Now, as we all know, there are some instant talking points within this particular topic, stuff that everyone is going to bring up immediately: your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">GTA</a> 'WASTED' screen; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">FromSoftware's 'You Died'</a>; and all of the very many unpleasantly hilarious ways you can be offed in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat</a> series. These are cool, but they're all a little bit obvious.</p>
<p>The same goes for that lovely Bond-styled death animation for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">GoldenEye</a> on the N64 (something that got me very excited about life back at the tail end of 1997), and all those very well-written little comments and asides from Arkham's finest criminals when Batman falls in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Rocksteady's spectacular series</a>. All great ways to go, and all available to enjoy (or rage quit over) from the comfort of a Switch console, no less.</p>
<p>Today, though, instead of going with the more obvious choices, I want to pick out a bunch of the weirdest (or what I consider to be the weirdest) game over screens out there - and available to experience on Nintendo systems, if not your Switch. What are the strangest, darkest, oddest, most confusing, unusually brutal, or just-plain weird Game Overs I've seen with my poor little peepers (for research)?</p>
<p>Let's find out!</p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="5759b23e8fa5f"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5759b23e8fa5f/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ZA/UM</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a> is up first here because it's sort of a cheat for this kind of list, given just how many ridiculous ways there are to get a game over screen, which is represented in-game as a newspaper clipping detailing your demise and/or downfall.</p>
<p>From ending a run because you got your tie stuck in a ceiling fan, or because a street urchin called you a slur, to taking too much psychic damage because of a romantic rejection, there's a lot to choose from. Honestly. Endless ways.</p>
<p>For me, though, the weirdest ending I've had is because I went to sleep in a dumpster. I mean, COME ON. I was tired.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine: Full Body (Switch)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="b85276161d45a"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b85276161d45a/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it's fair to say that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine: Full Body</a> is a terrifying game for many reasons. It's a weird one, a real oddball puzzler that had me squirming in my seat during sequences where demons are chasing me though my perverted, sweaty dreams. Or I've when I've suddenly turned into a very evil-looking goat.</p>
<p>However, it's the game over screen — which at a glance is totally unremarkable — that has stayed with me long after wrapping the game up.</p>
<p>Firstly, Vincent is lying in his pants (and they have hearts on them, cringe) in a pool of blood. Nightmarish enough, but then he also proclaims that "now's not the time to be dead" as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDLdwMI8xXU"><strong>Zigeunerweisen</strong></a> plays in the background and he resurrects.</p>
<p>What an absolute torturous nightmare of a scenario for the poor guy, a vicious circle of perverted poverty. Love is over, indeed.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/disneys_tarzan">Disney's Tarzan (N64)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="e51b759674685"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e51b759674685/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Eurocom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/disneys_tarzan">Disney's Tarzan</a>! Now what on earth is a game like this doing on a list of weird, oddball dark endings? A colourful family jaunt from the good old days that all the kids can play, as Tarzan makes his way through a lovely cartoon jungle full of friendly animaDIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! DIE TARZAN, DIE! DIEEEEEEEEEEE!</p>
<p>Sorry about that. But this is how it feels to die in this game, because the devs decided (and full marks by the way, it's a blinder of a surprise) to give us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0L9n89tJCY">a selection of game over screens</a>, the worst of which is your lifeless body being dragged away by a crocodile.</p>
<p>Yes, Tarzan, you are about to be dinner, and then toilet material. Dreadfully sorry, old chap.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie (Switch)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL</a> treats us to a wonderfully weird (and shifting) game over when we fail its tasks. No time is wasted before a very angry King of the Cosmos is shooting lasers at us whilst berating everything about us and wishing he'd chosen our stupid cousins for the mission instead.</p>
<p>Oh, and those lasers make you shrink. So be afraid.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger (SNES)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> served up a real eye-opener with a game over screen that displays "...But The Future Refused To Change" upon death at the hands of Lavos.</p>
<p>This stark message conveys, very brutally, that the future is doomed and there's not a damn thing you can do about it now. You are dead and you have failed in the biggest way possible. Ouch!</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/virtual_bart">Virtual Bart (SNES)</a></h2>

<p>In the classic slice of 90s chaos, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/virtual_bart">Virtual Bart</a>, you play a level as Bart who has turned into pig form. Die as said pig and you'll be treated to a game over screen that sees Homer tucking into a box of corndogs.</p>
<p>He picks out one shaped as Bart, then goes ahead and eats him, quickly followed by another regular one on top. That is cold, man.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight (SNES)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight</a> makes the cut here due to the sheer brutality of game over screens that see whatever character you happened to be pummelling everyone with tied to a pole. What's more, they are surrounded by dynamite which is about to explode.</p>
<p>So yeah. Punishment by being exploded. Wow.</p>
</div><div><h2>Friday the 13th (NES)</h2>

<p>This golden oldie was way ahead of its time in terms of cutting directly to the bleeding point (quite literally) by welcoming your demise with a game over screen that reads "You and your friends are dead."</p>
<p>I can tell you that, as a young child having a go at a game you probably shouldn't, that message certainly leaves an imprint.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goemons_great_adventure">Goemon's Great Adventure (N64)</a></h2>

<p>Okay, look. What if I just say, "Small pants muscle man rotating under disco lights, very small pants, sweaty...seems like it's going on in a dingy, smoky room. Please make it stop now."</p>
<p>Does that jog any memories? The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/mystical_ninja_starring_goemon">Mystical Ninja/Goemon</a> games have a tradition. They've got form with these weird game over screens, but they went a step further in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goemons_great_adventure">Goemon's Great Adventure</a>, getting the game over dancer right down to a very small pair of underpants. And he's dancing.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">The Punisher</a></h2>

<p>Brutal with a capital B, you can find <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/punisher">The Punisher</a> on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel vs Capcom Arcade Fighting Classics Collection</a> for Switch, and it's made the cut here because I have genuinely never forgotten it after having witnessed it first time in ye days of yore.</p>
<p>The scene in question involves you having CPR performed on your lifeless body by a desperate doctor as a timer counts down. Fail to continue and the doc is overcome with grief. Fairly dark stuff for a jaunt down the arcade, lads. Jeezo.</p>

<p>On January 12, EA <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/biowares-anthem-will-soon-be-completely-unplayable/">shut down the official servers for <em>Anthem</em></a>, making Bioware’s multiplayer sci-fi adventure completely unplayable for the first time since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/">its troubled 2019 launch</a>. Last week, though, the <em>Anthem</em> community woke up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPx5SJHFvGM">a new video</a> showing the game at least partially loading on what appears to be a simulated background server.</p>
<p>The people behind that video—and the <em>Anthem</em> revival project that made it possible—told Ars they were optimistic about their efforts to coerce EA’s temperamental Frostbite engine into running the game without access to EA’s servers. That said, the team also wants to temper expectations that may have risen a bit too high in the wake of what is just a proof-of-concept video.</p>

      Andersson799’s early proof-of-concept video showing <em>Anthem</em> partially loading on emulated local servers.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>“People are getting excited [about the video], and naturally people are going to get their hopes up,” project administrator Laurie told Ars. “I don’t want to be the person that’s going to have to deal with the aftermath if it turns out that we can’t actually get anywhere.”</p>
<h2>Keep an eye on those packets</h2>
<p>The <em>Anthem</em> revival effort currently centers around <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qfqe29/the_forts_forge/">The Fort’s Forge</a>, a Discord server where a handful of volunteer engineers and developers have gathered to pick apart the game and its unique architecture. Laurie said they initially set up the group “out of little more than spite for EA and Bioware around the time the shutdown got announced” back in July.</p>
<p>While Laurie has some experience with the community behind <a href="https://1379.tech/the-making-of-side-7-gundam-evolution-private-server-project/"><em>Gundam Evolution</em> revival project Side 7</a>, they knew they’d need help from people with direct experience working on EA’s Frostbite engine games. Luckily, Laurie said they were “able to catch the eyes of people who are familiar with this line of work [without] searching too much.”</p>
<p>One of those people was Ness199X, an experienced Frostbite tinkerer who told Ars he “never really played much <em>Anthem</em>” before the game’s shutdown was announced. When a friend pointed out the impending death of the title, though, Ness said he was motivated to preserve the game for posterity.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Initial efforts to examine what made <em>Anthem</em> tick “came up empty,” Ness said, largely because the game uses EA’s bespoke Frostbite engine differently than other EA titles. To begin mapping out those differences, Ness released a packet logger tool in September that let contributors record their own network traffic between the client and EA’s official servers. In addition to helping with reverse-engineering work, Ness writes on the Fort’s Forge Discord that players who logged their packets should be able to fully recover their characters if and when <em>Anthem</em> comes back in playable form.</p>
<h2>Catching Frostbite</h2>
<p>By analyzing that crowdsourced packet data, Ness said the Fort’s Forge team has been able to break <em>Anthem</em> down into three essential services:</p>
<ol>
<li>EA’s Blaze server: Used for basic player authentication.</li>
<li>Bioware Online Services (aka BIGS): A JSON web server used to track player information like inventory and quest progression.</li>
<li>The Frostbite multiplayer engine: Loads level data and tracks the real-time positions of players and non-player characters in those levels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Early efforts to emulate the Blaze and BIGS portions of that architecture helped lead directly to last week’s proof-of-concept video. Andersson799—who says he’s been tinkering with <em>Battlefield</em> and other Frostbite games since 2015—said he was quickly able to use his own logged <em>Anthem</em> packets to create a “barebones anthem private server” that served as a “quick and dirty” sample that he decided to share via YouTube.</p>
<p>“I basically made the tool to just simply reply with the packet captures that I got,” Andersson told me. That was enough to “get in to the game with player profiles loaded and everything.” And while Ness says there’s still some effort needed “to [make Blaze and BIGS] work well and smoothly in terms of quest progression, etc.,” the path forward on those portions is relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>It’s the Frostbite engine and its odd client-server architecture that forms the biggest barrier to getting <em>Anthem</em> up and running again without EA’s servers. “Due to how Frostbite is designed, all gameplay in a Frostbite game runs in a ‘server’ context,” Ness explained. Even in a single-player game like <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, he said, “the client just creates a separate server thread and pipes all the traffic internally.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“I feel like with <em>Anthem</em>, it heavily relies on online data that was stored in Bioware’s server,” Andersson added. “In my initial testing, the game couldn’t load into the level without that data.”</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLsHdqHR0-E?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p><div>
    
    <p><em>Anthem</em>‘s Fort Tarsis area loads its data from local files, rather than EA’s servers.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>There’s some hope that this crucial level data is still available and recoverable, though. Ness points out that Fort Tarsis, the game’s lobby area, already runs using offline data piped through a local “server” thread, meaning the rest of the game could theoretically be coerced to run similarly.</p>
<p>Just as important, he says, “as far as we have been able to discern, all the logic for the other levels, which when the game was live ran on a remote server, also exists in the client,” Ness said. “By patching the game we can most likely enable the ability to host these in process as well. That’s what we’re exploring.”</p>

<h2>“To be honest we’re not entirely sure…”</h2>
<p>While all that local level data should be usable in theory, seemingly random differences between <em>Anthem</em> and other Frostbite games are getting in the way of loading the data in practice. <em>Anthem</em> acts like a standard Frostbite game “for the most part,” Ness said, but at times will show unusual behaviors that are hard to pin down.</p>
<p>“For example, when we try to load most maps, no NPCs spawn, but in some maps they do,” he said. “And we have yet to determine why. Ness has some suspicion that the odd behavior is connected to the “fairly extensive amount of player data the game keeps as part of its online RPG nature,” but adds that “to be honest we’re not entirely sure how deep the differences go, other than that the engine didn’t behave how we expected it to.”</p>
<p>Ness said he’s about 75 percent confident that the team will be able to figure out how to fully leverage the Frostbite engine to power a version of the game that runs without EA’s centralized servers. If that effort succeeds, he says a playable version of <em>Anthem</em> could be back up and running in “months, or less even, depending on motivation.” But if the efforts to pick apart <em>Anthem</em>’s take on Frostbite hits a brick wall, Ness says “the amount of work increases fairly exponentially and I’m a lot less confident that we have the motivation for that.”</p>

<p>“I’m fairly confident that we can get this game to be playable again, like how it is supposed to be,” Andersson said. “It’ll just take time as most of us have our own life to manage besides this.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Laurie is still trying to manage expectations set by the somewhat premature posting of Andersson’s proof-of-concept video. “Please, do not expect frequent updates,” Laurie wrote in the Fort’s Forge Discord. “We had not anticipated releasing anything this early, nor should the expedience of this video’s release serve as any kind of benchmark for how fast we make progress.”</p>
<p>Laurie also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qfng76/comment/o06gfou/?context=3">took to Reddit</a> to publicly call the video “a really hacky thing so I want to ask people to manage their expectations just a bit. A lot of stuff clearly doesn’t work as ‘intended,’ and definitely needs at minimum, more polish.”</p>
<p>At one point last week, Laurie says they had to stop accepting new members to the Fort’s Forge Discord, “mostly to prevent an influx of people in response to… news coverage.” And while people with Frostbite engine modding experience are encouraged to reach out, the small team is being cautious about growing too large, too fast.</p>
<p>“We’re a little reluctant to add developers right now as we have no real code base to work from,” Ness said, describing their current efforts as “scratch work” maintained in separate forms by multiple people. “But once we firm that up (hopefully in the next weeks), we will look to add more [coders].”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m a Japanese RPG fan first, and a Soulslike fan second. Maybe third? Anyway, despite thoroughly enjoying games like </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> and the countless other similar games inspired by it, the Souslike genre isn’t one I’ve always gravitated toward. Imagine my surprise when Bandai Namco decided to combine the anime aesthetics of a JRPG with the demanding gameplay of </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span>. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-is-the-chillest-dark-souls-clone-1838481190"><i><span>Code Vein</span></i></a><span> was born. Finally something for </span><i><span>me</span></i><span> specifically.</span></p> <p><span>There aren’t many hybrids like this. Most games in the genre still go for a more realistic art style, like that seen in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-2-the-kotaku-review-1842270420"><i><span>Nioh</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-surge-2-is-a-bit-of-a-mess-but-i-cant-stop-playing-1838376079"><i><span>The Surge</span></i></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903"><i><span>Lies of P</span></i></a><span>. Last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-limit-soulslike-how-long-to-beat-short-hard-1851772663"><i><span>AI Limit</span></i></a><span> and, to a lesser extent, the cel-shaded </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><i><span>Khazan: the Last Berserker</span></i></a><span>, remain isolated examples of the hybrid approach. In this context, </span><i><span>Code Vein</span></i><span> stands out.</span></p>

 <p><span>Its sequel, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, expands on its predecessor by offering more flexible combat options, as well as a new open world to explore. It also oozes classic JRPG tropes about heroes forging bonds and the strength of friendship. Its enticing time-traveling story takes a bit to get going, but its characters are a highlight. Less brutal than its genre contemporaries, </span><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>emerges as a comfy mix between a Soulslike and a JRPG that makes for a satisfying entry point for folks who want to dip their toes into both genres.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is set in a post-apocalyptic future caused by the Resurgence a century before the events of the game. In order to stop the Resurgence, five heroes gave up their lives to seal away this mysterious force. But in the present, those seals are weakening, leading to the sudden emergence of the Luna Rapacis, a moon-like entity hovering in the middle of the city. This has turned human-like vampiric beings called Revenants into monsters called Horrors. And it’s up to you to travel back in time to change the fates of those original five heroes.</span></p>

 <p><span>The here story isn’t cryptic as one might expect from a game in the Soulslike genre. It’s standalone too, so you don’t have to play the first game to understand this one. With your time-traveling partner, Lou, you travel through the open world to search for each of the heroes’ cocoons, where they’ve been slumbering away for the past century. Lou sends you back in time to fight alongside each hero and at the end of their respective arcs, they hand you a sentimental item that you take back to the present to break the cocoon. This then culminates in a big boss fight against the hero themself, which weaves in a satisfying narrative finish to each hero’s storyline. Unlike with games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257"><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i></a><span>, I didn’t need to consult an hour-long YouTube lore essay to figure out what the hell was going on.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I also really enjoyed spending time with </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s characters. Lou starts off as little more than a tool used for her time travel powers. However, as you and she begin changing the heroes’ fates step by step, she begins to wonder if meddling more in the past might ultimately lead to a better future. Tension arises as the towering and voluptuous Lady Dimetescu-like mother figure and group leader Lavinia Voda warns her not to do so, as it could lead to unintended consequences. But by the end of the story, Lou begins to stand up for herself, and it’s exciting to see her come into her own. Many of the heroes and supporting characters go through similar redemption arcs, adding real emotional weight to the story.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663846"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663846">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>My favorite character has to be Zenon Gryfgote. At first, he’s depicted as some sort of immoral mad scientist. However, when you meet him, you quickly realize he’s just a goofball wife guy. You can even see it in his elaborate gold-plated costume, which is adorned with representations of his deceased wife. His helmet also looks like something you’d wear to an EDM concert, and his cape is layered with lights that help convey his emotions. Despite his hulking frame, his flashy design makes him relatable, funny, and down to earth. </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s larger-than-life cast brings vibrancy to a post-apocalyptic world.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is noticeably easier than most Soulslike games I’ve played. A large part of that is due to its NPC companion system. Basically, you can bring one character to fight alongside you at all times. Other Soulslike games usually require some sort of consumable to summon an ally, but there’s absolutely no cost here. They’re impervious to all damage, can draw aggro from bosses, and can even deal the killing blow on enemies. When you die, you even get a sort of </span><i><span>Sekiro</span></i><span>-like second wind. </span><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is practically a Fisher-Price toy compared to a game like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-2-the-kotaku-review-1842270420"><i><span>Nioh 2</span></i></a><span>, but that’s what makes it an entry-level and more approachable Soulslike.</span></p> <h2>Easy mode</h2> <p><span>Don’t get too comfortable, though, as you can’t just run away and let your ally handle bosses all by themselves. Bosses usually have an attack or two that easily closes the distance, so you’ll end up having to confront them directly anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Another way the game forces you to engage with bosses is through its Weapon Formae system. In order to use these flashy special attacks, you expend Ichor, which functions like MP in a JRPG. To recover Ichor, you’ll need to execute Drain Attacks via your equipped Jail. These come in the form of a giant claw, bat wings, and even a scorpion tail. They’re slow to start up, but vital if you want to continue inflicting huge damage. So you also have to strategically pick when to restore Ichor, like when a boss is recovering from finishing a powerful attack. You’re in this rhythmic cycle of attacking, draining, and attacking again, and you need to be up in the enemy’s face in order to do so, making </span><i><span>Code Vein 2</span></i><span> a surprisingly aggressive Soulslike.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, sometimes the camera is a pain to deal with in the midst of the game’s bigger boss fights. There were many instances in which my back would be against the wall, and the camera would zoom in so close that I couldn’t decipher the boss’s next attack, leading to a death.</span></p> <p><span>During my playthrough, I switched between my one-handed sword and hammer weapons. For the former, my go-to Forma was Phantom Ambush, which was super helpful for boss fights since I would disappear in a puff of smoke for a second, then slash the enemy twice. When timed right, I could avoid incoming attacks completely while being able to immediately strike back. My favorite hammer Forma was Gaia Impact, which activated a huge AOE shockwave when I slammed my weapon to the ground, perfect for crowd control. The Formae system makes the game feel a lot more like a typical action RPG, something like an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-arpg-review-guide-1851684251"><i><span>Ys</span></i></a><span> game but with Soulslike core mechanics. These attacks added a degree of cinematic flair that’s often missing from Soulslike games.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Dark Souls for weebs."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Bandai Namco</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game: </p>                 <p>Soulslike</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Charming cast of characters, plenty of customization, fun combat, great boss design.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p> Performance issues, funky camera, boring normal enemies, repetitive dungeons.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5 (played), Xbox Series X|S.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>January 29, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>played:</p>                 <p>45 hours. All characters arcs and most sidequests completed. Unlocked all three endings: normal, good, and true. Still have to find all hot springs and healing upgrades in the open world.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Central to the game’s customization systems are Blood Codes, which act kind of like character classes that you can equip to fit your playstyle. For example, if you like parrying, Lyle’s Blood Code is ideal since its traits include powering up its parry staggering capabilities. If you’re a more careful player, Holly’s Blood Code might suit you, as it restores some HP upon defeating an enemy. What makes Blood Codes flexible is that even though they have specific traits and boost certain stats, you’re free to use whatever weapons you like the most regardless of which one you have equipped.</span></p>

 <p><span>After mastering a Blood Code, you can extract a Booster from it, which are passive skills that you can equip. For example, mastering Zenon’s Blood Code rewards you with Halberd Mastery, which of course increases your attack strength when wielding Halberds. Between Blood Codes, Formae, and Boosters, there’s a large variety of customization options that make fights feel both extravagant and exhilarating.</span></p> <h2>The open road</h2> <p><span>Like many sequels before it, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> takes the predictable route in becoming an open-world game. The freedom this shift allows reminded me of </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span> in which, if I was stuck on a boss, I’d explore more, get stronger, and come back to tackle the boss again. This allowed me to still make progress somewhere else even if my attempts to advance in one direction had hit a wall. And that’s pretty much what I did throughout. Interestingly, this freedom meant that I accidentally skipped over what was intended to be the game’s first hero story, Josee’s, in the Sunken City area. Instead, I veered off a little too far into the northeast towards the Corroded Scar region and started Lyle’s first.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663847"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663847">©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After breaking Lyle’s cocoon, I couldn’t beat his corrupted form to continue the story. So instead, I went back to Josee’s location and finished her story arc. Since I was almost done with Lyle’s arc anyway, I was overpowered for Josee’s, defeating her corrupted form handily. This looser approach of story progression works in the open world’s favor. With side dungeons and mini-bosses to boot, exploration never felt like a waste of time. Every little thing I did made me stronger, which would eventually help me beat the bosses I’d initially had trouble with. Unfortunately, the dungeons grow a bit repetitive, and enemy variety is lacking compared to the extravagantly designed bosses.</span></p>

 <p><span>That said, you get a cool bike to speed exploration up, along with a generous amount of fast-travel points. On the downside, the joys of exploration are marred a bit by performance issues as you speed around the world with foliage constantly popping in and out, at least on PS5 Pro where I played the game.&nbsp; There was also one point at which I made the classic Soulslike runback from a save point to the boss and I skipped so many enemies that when they all started chasing me on the screen, the framerate slowed to a crawl.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> doesn’t just take a superficial anime aesthetic and use it as window dressing on a popular genre. Its story and charming cast elevate it to create a unique middle ground that will appeal to JRPG and Soulslike fans alike. It’s got its fair share of issues, such as the performance woes and boring enemy fodder design. Still, if you’re looking to ease into the Soulslike genre before hitting the big leagues, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> is worth spilling blood over.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has confirmed the line up for the February 2026 PS Plus monthly games, with subscribers getting four games as part of the subscription. These games will be available from February 3rd and there is a decent mix of titles on offer. The games are Undisputed, Subnautica Below Zero, Ultros, and Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown.</p>
<p><iframe title="Undisputed Launch Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4g44lARkFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Undisputed is going to be available for PS5. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/undisputed-review/">Undisputed review</a>, I said, “Undisputed is a valiant attempt by Steel City Interactive, bringing back boxing to the fore in video games after a long absence. The in-ring action is generally very good and the roster is well stacked. What is missing is good commentary and there are gameplay issues that need to be addressed, including lag and stuttering. Undisputed is not ready to be a title challenger yet, but updates may see it get there eventually.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Subnautica: Below Zero Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdix1XxaZyU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Subnautica is going to be available for both PS5 and PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/11/subnautica-below-zero-review/">Subnautica: Below Zero review</a>, Jason said, “Subnautica: Below Zero is a masterfully horrific experience that encourages you to push on despite your fears. It’s a fine balancing act of the horrors you’ll face underwater and the rewards you can get for evading them. It’s really very hard, but it’s also really very good.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ultros – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iloiRk1k3_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ultros will be available for PS5 and PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/ultros-review/">Ultros review</a>, Steve said, “Ultros is a true labour of love that has a lot to say about the balance between violence and peace, and exploitation and environmentalism, themes which are incredibly important and too often ignored in games, but this theme sometimes feels at odds with the basic game mechanics and can lead to early frustration. The game is quite clear that the first ending is a bad one due to the violence required to reach it, but I couldn’t justify the investment of time and energy to continue past this to complete the more acceptable approach. In a way, this feels appropriate to me as it demonstrates why true change is so difficult to achieve in wider environmental terms. I guess the gap between the message and the mechanics here is not as wide as I initially thought.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown - PS4/XB1/PC - Open Fire (Launch Trailer)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HnU9v1IE1nw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ace Combat 7 will be available for PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/18/ace-combat-7-review/">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown review</a>, Dom said, “In Ace Combat 7 dogfighting games have a new Top Gun. The VR sadly turned my stomach, but the series’ trademark action is bigger and better than ever, with the spectacular weather effects introducing a level of realism and drama that will win over any wannabe Mavericks.”</p>
<h4>What are the PS Plus January 2026 Monthly Games?</h4>

			<p><strong>Warframe</strong>, the free-to-play online action game developed by <strong>Digital Extremes</strong>, came up twice as I asked <strong>MMO</strong> industry veterans what the future of Western MMOs looked like. </p>



<p>Just yesterday, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-returns-to-cryptic-studios-exclusive-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an interview with <strong>Jack Emmert</strong></a>, who's returning as CEO of <strong>Cryptic Studios</strong> (he previously held the role from 2011 to 2015, when he left after 15 years at the company). As part of our conversation, I picked up his mind on the difficulties faced by Western developers looking to make a new game in the genre, and Emmert pointed out an example to follow: Warframe.  </p>



<p><em>It would be difficult for anybody to go to a Western publisher and ask for money to develop an MMORPG. The track record with Western publishers and MMORPGs is not very good for a lot of reasons. However, I think there's a lot of opportunity to launch a game that isn't necessarily an MMO at the start, but grows into something. A model like Warframe is a really good one; it is vastly bigger than it ever was when it first launched. That is a direction many games could go. A multiplayer story-based RPG could add an open-world component through an update or expansion. Instead of a hundred-million-dollar investment all upfront, you're making a series of $20 million bets so that at the end of five to seven years you have that big MMO, having paid for it and grown the community along the way.</em></p>



<p><em>I would not be surprised to see someone bootstrap a very small product, get some initial success, and continue to invest in it. Subnautica was like that, too. I think that's where you're going to see the new MMOs. To MMO fans, I'd say be patient; if you support a product and love it, just keep supporting it. It'll get there.</em></p>



<p>Anyone familiar with Warframe knows that the game that launched in March 2013 on PC was <strong>quite barebones</strong>. However, over time and with an ear constantly tuned to the community's feedback, Digital Extremes expertly introduced new content and features on a regular basis, <strong>making it one of the best examples of a live service game in the whole industry</strong> and securing an extremely loyal fanbase.</p>



<p>In 2026, Warframe <strong>is a whole different beast</strong>. It has a ton of content and activities to satisfy different playstyles, and it has also successfully expanded across all available platforms (the final one, Android, will get the game on February 18 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after a couple of months of Closed Beta testing</a>). Of course, someone could argue that Warframe is not quite an MMO in the traditional sense. Even so, the larger point holds: <strong>start with a solid 'minimum viable product' and build on it over time</strong>. The example is doubly fitting because Digital Extremes did everything on its own, developing and self-publishing the game, which is what a developer would have to do in the current absence of investments for MMO games.</p>



<p>Anyway, Emmert was not the only MMO veteran to point out Warframe to me when I inquired about the state of the genre in Western countries. <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview I published last month</a>, <strong>Greg Street</strong> (former World of Warcraft and League of Legends designer) told me:</p>



<p><em>The basic problem is that it's hard to start small with an MMO. You have to commit to a lot of systems and content to make it work. There are some notable exceptions, like Warframe, which started small and grew into an MMO.</em></p>



<p>Street and Emmert know each other quite well, so it's possible they spoke about this before and found they shared the same viewpoint. Their insight is particularly interesting because they both bashed their heads against the problems faced when making a new MMO game in the West: their companies, <strong>Jackalyptic</strong> and <strong>Fantastic Pixel Castle</strong>, were working on two new MMO games, one based on Warhammer and another on a new fantasy IP. </p>



<p>In both cases, they were funded by NetEase, which, however, changed its mind a couple of years later and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-warhammer-mmo-is-also-canceled-netease-shuts-down-jackalyptic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed both studios down</a>. This experience likely contributed to their conviction that <strong>a small game, like Warframe when it launched, can eventually become much larger</strong> and should serve as a model for future titles that do not have the budget to start big.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-release-date-february-2026/">After a second rumour</a> pointed to a current-gen <strong>PS5 version</strong> of <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> coming from developer <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> last month, the new version has been all but officially confirmed, with a <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP4062-CUSA07180_00-KCDGAME010000000"><strong>UK</strong> <strong>PlayStation Store </strong>listing</a> (spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3mdiqkxbtl225">Gematsu</a>) describing the features this unofficially announced PS5 version would include, like the game getting a resolution boost to <strong>4K</strong>, an <strong>improved framerate</strong>, and more.</p>



<p>This new version of the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/">first rumoured to be in the works back in October 2025</a>, before the aforementioned December 2025 rumour pointed to its imminent arrival, once again pointing to an early 2026 release, though last time the rumour went a step further to add that it would release sometime in <strong>February 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>The updated store page description doesn't include a hint as to when the new version will be available, or if this new version will be made available through a free update or if it'll be a paid upgrade. What it does include is confirmation that Warhorse has given the original release a good once-over, with updates to the graphics, framerate, and textures.</p>



<p>"<em>The PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful</em>," the updated description reads.</p>







<p>Hopefully, this means we can expect a reveal from Warhorse Studios soon, and while there's no guarantee that this will be a free update, the fact that we're seeing this reveal come in the form of an updated PS Store listing is probably an indication that it's just a major update, and not a full remaster or a separate release. </p>

            <p>
Last week, Ubisoft announced a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">major restructure</a> that saw multiple games cancelled, including the Prince of Persia: The Sand of Time Remake, and more concerningly prospectively put <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">layoffs on the horizon</a>. Now, following an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">agreement made by a group of organised Ubisoft workers</a> across multiple French unions, a call for an international strike across all studios at the company has been put out.
</p>
<p>
The five unions in question consist of STJV, CGT, Printemps Ecologique, Solidaires Informatique, and CFE-CGC, who through the firstmost put out a statement regarding Ubisoft's recent actions. Namely, the five unions are calling for a "massive international strike by all Ubisoft employees" across the 10th, 11th, and 12th of February next month.
</p>

Faced with the arbitrary decision of the CEO who doesn’t even dare talking to employees anymore, unions are calling for a strike on February 10th, 11th and 12th.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb/post/3mdiakqixmj2m?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb?ref_src=embed">@stjv.fr</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb/post/3mdiakqixmj2m?ref_src=embed">January 28, 2026 at 12:10 PM</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
This call to action comes in response not just to the recent structuring and prospective layoffs, but because of the return to mandatory in-office work. "These decisions are forcing us to act in order to protect those who keep this company alive," reads the statement. It goes on to note, "We are promised autonomy for Creative Houses, but what about the autonomy for employees? Five days of mandatory in-office work: we are treated like children who need to be supervised, while our management gets away with lies and breaking the law."
</p><p>
It's also worth noting that according to the statement, Ubisoft employees learned about the major restructure not through a private announcement, but at the same time as the public announcement, noting that "none of these changes had been discussed during the mandatory consultations with the works councils a few days earlier."
</p>
<p>
A half-day strike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-is-out-of-the-question-to-let-a-boss-run-rampant-ubisoft-workers-strike-against-disastrous-cutbacks">was held last week</a>, but this was only through Solidaires Informatique in France. According to Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us">about section on their website</a>, the studio currently has roughly 17,000 employees, meaning if international workers take part in the strike, it could feature thousands of staff members across the world. Solidarity to all those involved.

    <p>When people talk glowingly about the heyday of social media being good, what they’re really talking about is riffing. Before Donald Trump became the president and screwed up all posting that isn’t about him, people would iterate on the most absurd joke possible. For the last few days, a handful of people have been riffing on the idea of YouTube thumbnails but from the point of view of babies, and it’s mostly been good. For posterity, it is worth remembering this riff.&nbsp;</p><p>The bit is a riff on something we have all seen a million times: horribly condescending YouTube thumbnails with bait text. The original post comes from an artist called </p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jamie</u></a>. The first meme, “why I’m switching..…” shows a contemplative baby examining a bead maze next to a “greater than” sign and some toy blocks. From there, the rest was history.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social/post/3md7egs5bus2l?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>@lmaonadestand.bsky.social</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>“At the end of the day it’s been fun to see people enjoying it, especially in a time where [every] headline online has been miserable,” Jamie told me. “If this silly thing was able to brighten people’s day at all then I’m happy.

            <title><![CDATA[Scott Pilgrim EX Just Skyrocketed To The Top Of My Winter Game List]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-ex-release-date-trailer-2000663831</link>
            <guid>1418881</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Scott Pilgrim is taking on the world, again, in March. Capcom leans into Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover. And an old Kickstarter for a tabletop game reveals the worst outcome possible. It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Speaking of fan speculation and rumors, it’s never a good sign when the official franchise account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">responds to you with a GIF from <em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a>. The <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> remake was reportedly delayed, but hopefully the <a href="https://x.com/yosp/status/2016446516236562657">next game from indie standout Red Candle Games</a> is coming along smoothly.</p> <h2><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> has a release date and a new trailer</h2>  <p>It’s out March 3 and will include League of Evil Exes’ Matthew Patel and Robot-01 as playable characters. This spiritual successor to the 2010 brawler is a bit more RPG-lite with non-linear quests and exploration, according to the devs at Tribute Games. They recently helped launch <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, another excellent retro throwback with some neat tricks. Hopefully the team has put some cool surprises in <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> which, with today’s news, is now handily my most anticipated release of the winter.</p>

 <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fixes a bizarre DLC bug recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">unearthed by a modder</a></h2> <p><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-au/Ver.1.040.03.01.html">The new PC performance patch is out</a> and the notes include the following: “Fixed an issue where system load could increase around the Support Desk at Base Camp or the Grand Hub due to claimed content status checks.” Hopefully it brings the Steam version of the game more in line with the console version and turns things around in a meaningful way heading into the game’s one-year anniversary.</p> <h2><em>RuneScape</em> maker promises no genAI that players can “feel”</h2> <p>“We’ve got a pretty hard line stance with the team, which is a commitment that no generative AI will ever be present in any asset that a player can touch, hear or feel. There will be no generative AI in the game that they experience,” Jagex SVP of product James Dobrowski <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/runescape-maker-jagex-says-it-will-never-use-generative-ai-to-make-in-game-content">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. Tooling efficiency, which seemingly means coding, QA checks, and other process-oriented stuff, is another story.</p>

 <p>“Where we are open to the use of AI is in things like tooling efficiency; how do we make the way we work more efficient in order to make our staff’s lives easier and allow us to produce better content. But we do not want to be using AI to drive creativity,” he said.</p>

 <h2>Capcom talks about Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover</h2> <p>“We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals,” <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> director Koshi Nakanishi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/">told <em>Automaton</em></a>. “Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, The women developers at Capcom did a really good job&nbsp;(laughs).”</p> <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> hit by DDoS attack ahead of next patch</h2> <p>Players who were recently having connection issues now know why. Community lead Julia Ossen told fans on the game’s Discord that the studio has been “under extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks” which the team is addressing. “The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress,” she wrote. “But at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing.” The attack happened alongside the game’s new patch which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qobyp9/here_we_go_slient_nerfs_not_mentioned_in_the/">includes some stealth nerfs</a>.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Darkest Dungeon</em> board game is dead</h2> <p>Over 28,000 backers&nbsp;pledged&nbsp;<span>$5,657,479</span> to help bring this project to life and no more shipments will be going out. “We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> name,” Red Hook Games <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/">announced this week</a>. “We won’t mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> fans.” An ex-employee is providing the studio with the source files for all of Mythic’s work so players can make their own versions.</p> <h2>More indies are bailing on Xbox</h2> <p>Xbox versions of the stylish medieval combat game <em>1348 Ex Voto</em> and Nickelodeon’s<em> Splat Pack</em> have both been binned, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109896/two-indie-games-have-cancelled-their-xbox-versions/index.html"><em>TweakTown</em> reports</a>. “While we previously announced that the game would be released on Xbox consoles, we have the unfortunate news that this is no longer the case,” the developer behind 1348 Ex Voto <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_RrTmoWMAACEkw?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">said this week</a>. “As release approaches for the indie team, priorities are constantly evaluated and sometimes must shift to deliver the best experience possible.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/walmart-leak-gamecube-games-switch-online-metroid-pikmin-2000663430">More Switch Online GameCube games leaked</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527">Something <em>Highguard</em> gets right: mining crystals</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-parody-perfectly-captures-the-horror-and-absurdity-of-living-in-gotham-2000663597">Living inside <em>Batman: Arkham</em> would be terrifying</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Digital PC gaming storefront <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-anti-drm-cd-projekt-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2000659280">Good Old Games</a> is the latest video game-related company to be caught using AI-generated artwork. As you might expect, a lot of people aren’t pleased about this, including an artist who works at GOG.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gog-now-using-ai-generated-images-on-their-store/">As first reported by <em>GamingOnLinux</em></a>, someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qoigy5/ai_in_the_storefront/">Reddit spotted</a> what looks like AI-generated artwork being used to advertise an ongoing 2026 sale on GOG. The biggest giveaway that this art was generated using an AI tool or site is that a SNES-like console in the image seems to be melting. <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/page1">GOG users actually spotted this AI artwork last week</a> and began posting about it. For many, it was disappointing to see a company that <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">claims to care about preservation</a> and creators using AI to create a simple store banner.</p> <p>Likely in response to the hubbub surrounding the AI-generated banner, KosmicznaPluskwa, a GOG forums user who appears to be a graphic artist working at the company, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner?staff=yes">posted a lengthy response on the store’s forums on January 26.</a> And while KosmicznaPluskwa made it clear they aren’t a spokesperson for GOG, the artist confirmed that the image people were speculating was machine-created was indeed generated completely using AI tools, something that upset the artist.</p>

 <p>“OK, so to clear the air – current sale banner is fully AI. Not my work,” posted KosmicznaPluskwa. “This is all I can say on this. My team is much smaller now than it used to be, and the requirements for the role are completely different than it used to be.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted GOG about the art, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>KosmicznaPluskwa continued in their lengthy forum post and discussed how AI art is everywhere now and how it makes them sad to see.</p>

 <p>“It’s just miserable to think about how surrounded and how ever-present it all is now,” said KosmicznaPluskwa.</p> <p>“How will it affect us as the humanity. And no, I don’t think it will destroy art altogether but the omnipresence of it will not not go without its effect on us as a whole. Maybe it doesn’t matter some store put out sloppy work on promo banner – in the end everyone is just there to buy the product – but I know I enjoy seeing cool new artworks out there, when I’m out to buy new products as well. When I buy a new cool figure I like to keep the box around if it’s pretty – this is kind of the same, but on digital level. More cool art to see on top of buying art (video games in our case here) is always more cool art in the world and this is what I’m happy to have. So with everyone also feeling strongly in this thread – I’m with you. And continue speaking up – in the face of future we don’t like to see, complacency is not the way.”</p>

But after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/an-overlooked-disney-collection-from-digital-eclipse-has-been-rated-for-switch">an ESRB rating was spotted</a> recently, a listing has now appeared on <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000107124">the Japanese eShop</a> for both Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/disney-afternoon-collection-appears-on-switch-eshop-confirming-its-release-with-two-extra-snes-games/">VGC</a> spotted the listing earlier today and is listed for 2,300 yen (about 11 GBP, or 14 USD, so expect pricing to be a little higher in the West) on Switch 2, with a 10% pre-order discount and a release date of <strong>26th February 2026</strong>. At the time of writing, store pages have not gone up in other regions, but it's only a matter of time at this point.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067szhgup&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Looking at the key art and the game description (via Google Translate), 1993's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/goof_troop">Goof Troop</a> and 1994's <strong>Bonkers</strong> will also be part of the package. Neither of these games have been rereleased before, so that's pretty exciting!</p>
<p>Here's the full line-up of games in their NES or SNES versions for the Switch 1 &amp; 2 versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bonkers (<strong>NEW</strong>)</li>

The games will be made available on <strong>February 3, 2026,</strong> with the boxing game <strong>Undisputed</strong> and survival game <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> headlining the monthly offerings after PlayStation kicked off the year with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/"><strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong></a>. </p>

<p>With the above four titles set to arrive on February 3, that means you have until <strong>February 2, 2026,</strong> to add January's monthly PS Plus Essential games to your library, if you haven't already. If you're a PS Plus Extra or even Premium tier subscriber, then this is unfortunately another month where you're getting games that were already available to you in the Games Catalog, as Ultros entered the PS Plus Extra catalog when it launched back in February 2024.</p>



<p>At least PlayStation players at every tier of a PS Plus subscription and even those not subscribed to the service can <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/">reportedly look forward to a new <strong>State of Play</strong> event, currently said to be happening sometime during the week of <strong>February 12, 2026</strong></a>, if it's not on the 12th itself.</p>

I like playing a game where I get to defend myself from/ take down the likes of ghouls, ghosts, demons and other such and much paranormal, supernatural beasties, but how about a game where you're the one doing the haunting? Ghost Keeper! Is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>, puzzley game where you "lead your fearsome minions against the living" by attempting to scare them off, and just launched in early access today.
</p>
<p>
On the offset, Ghost Keeper almost looks like a Sims expansion, or perhaps incredibly dedicated mod, what with its top down view, exaggerated character animations, and semi-real but still kind of goofy in a fun way vibe. Taking place in a Victorian setting, with six locations to choose from as part of this early access launch, you control the likes of ghosts and various monsters, with the express goal of scaring off a group of humans called the Brotherhood who appear to be legally distinct Ghostbusters.

This might include some spectral floating plates, luring people in with a cute demonic kitty, or just giving them a tap on the shoulder to freak 'em out. Interestingly, the game is actually a story-driven one, though the early access release only offers a part of that right now. Upon beating what's currently available you do get access to a sandbox mode to play around with, though!
</p><p>
According to the game's Steam page, the plan is for it to be in early access for about a year, but right now a majority of the mechanics are already available. There are also plans for more creatures, abilities, areas and more in future updates. Also worth noting that as more updates roll out, the price will be gradually increased, so perhaps it's worth getting on the ground floor now if you're interested. You can check out, or wishlist, the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708880/Ghost_Keeper/">here</a>.

              <p><span>A long-rumoured PlayStation 5 upgrade for Warhorse Studios’ 2018 game </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> has seemingly been confirmed by mistake, as the PlayStation Store description listing now includes details for a “The PS5 version” version.</span></p> <p><span>Although this leak was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qpgd10/kingdom_come_deliverance_ps5_information/"><span>initially spotted</span></a><span> on the PlayStation Store Italia page for the title, the same PS5-specific information has since appeared on the </span><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/227410"><span>British PlayStation Store listing</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>It now states that the game will be “Updated for PlayStation 5” and that the “PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The background of the key art on the PlayStation Store has also changed, removing the militia seen in the original artwork and replacing the scene with a darker orange background. The opening paragraph has also been updated: “(Re)discover Henry’s saga, from the start!”</span></p> <p><span>Neither the PlayStation Store Italia nor the British pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated to specify a new release date, and still display the game’s original 13 February 2018 PlayStation 4 release date.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the “2017 Warhorse Studios” trademark information, which is still present on the US PlayStation Store Page, has since disappeared from both the Italian and British store pages.</span></p> <p><span>No word from any of the </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </span></i><span>social accounts or any sort of announcement from publisher Deep Silver on its legitimacy yet, but rumours of a PlayStation 5 version of the game can be traced all the way back to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mdsewq/kingdom_come_deliverance_1_may_be_getting_a/"><span>July 2025</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Those rumours have only ever mentioned a PS5 version of the game, and as of yet, none of the Xbox store pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated with similar information.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> is set to release soon on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and with that comes some concessions…and censorship.</p>



<p>Releasing on the console on January 29, Dispatch features moments of vulgarity and nudity during the story. While there is an option to self-censor the game should you not want to hear or see those moments, it appears that Nintendo has made the decision for players.</p>







<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Adhoc Studios confirmed the censorship, but says that the overall narrative and experience will remain the same.</p>



<p><strong>“Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually,”</strong> AdHoc said in a statement. <strong>“We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release.”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>First released with weekly episodes in October, Dispatch quickly became one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-insider-gaming-community-biggest-surprise-hit-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest surprise hits</a> of 2025. The game sold two million copies in its first month, and has since surpassed 3 million copies on PlayStation and PC combined. With the game now coming to Nintendo Switch 2, and possibly more in the future, that number is likely to rise even more. </p>



<p>As far as the future of the franchise is concerned, the team at AdHoc have said repeatedly that they’d like to do and see more from the Z-Team. Whether that ultimately happens, obviously, remains to be seen.</p>

            <guid>1418830</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There are plenty of Trinkets to find in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and looting them can be a great source of money, but there’s always been one that’s held dear amongst the community—the Rubber Duck.</p>



<p>These little guys are only Common loot and don’t sell for much at all, but some fans have enjoyed collecting them. Well, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820">Embark Studios</a> has upped the ante with the Headwinds update, as a host of new Rubber Ducks have been added to the game, and they vary in rarity.</p>







<p>If you’re looking to start a brand new Rubber Duck collection in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, then you’re in the right place. This guide will show you all of the new Rubber Duck variants, as well as how you can get your hands on them all.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-new-rubber-ducks-are-there-in-arc-raiders">How Many New Rubber Ducks Are There In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All from one raid. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds update</a> has added six new Rubber Ducks to ARC Raiders, bringing the grand total to seven, including the original yellow one.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know if you’ve found a new Rubber Duck variant not just by its rarity, but by its skin, too. Each new Duck has a unique aesthetic, ranging from a duck with cow markings to a green alien duck! The full list of new Rubber Ducks is listed below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tropical Duck</li>



<li>Gentle Duck</li>



<li>Alien Duck</li>



<li>Doodly Duck</li>



<li>Flashy Duck</li>



<li>Familiar Duck</li>
</ul>



<p>As fun as they are, they’re not just for show. Depending on the rarity, these Ducks can fetch a pretty penny, with the Familiar Duck selling for 7,000 Coins a pop! They can stack up to 15 times, meaning a full stack of Familiar Ducks is the most valuable group of items in ARC Raiders. If you’re looking to get rich, you’ll need to know where to find them first. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-new-rubber-ducks-in-arc-raiders">How To Find The New Rubber Ducks In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Check the chimneys! Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The six new Rubber Ducks can be found on the Buried City map, during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bird City</a> Minor Map Condition.</strong></p>



<p>They can’t be found just anywhere on the map, though, as you’ll need to take to the rooftops. Once you’re up high, search every chimney you come across; birds have made nests inside of them, and they’re prone to storing some valuable Trinkets inside.</p>







<p>As luck would have it, these birds have been stealing a whole variety of Rubber Ducks and stashing them in their nests. Who knows where they migrated from to bring these treasures to the Rust Belt, but your Coin collection should thank them. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since December, we've been <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-christmas-holiday-sales-down-europe-uk-us-nintendo-2000658223" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seeing</u></a> (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond"><u>and writing!</u></a>) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-sales-reportedly-struggled-over-the-christmas-period" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>headlines</u></a> <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-sales-slowed-over-christmas-down-35-in-the-us-compared-to-switch-1-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discussing</u></a> the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/seasonal-switch-2-sales-show-significant-slowing-as-annual-cycle-sunsets/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seeming slowdown</u></a> of Nintendo Switch 2 sales going into the holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that narrative feels right, doesn't it? We've seen prices on everything rise this year, and increasing economic uncertainty especially in the U.S. The Nintendo Switch 2 also didn't have a huge holiday game release (my apologies to Metroid Prime 4) to bolster sales through Black Friday and December. It just makes sense that holiday sales were down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's some nuance to this narrative, and not just because so many people seem to be taking this as a sign of doom for the Nintendo Switch 2. So I kicked off the new year by bugging all the analysts I knew for some further context on Nintendo Switch 2's holiday sales: if they were down, why they were down if so, and what it all means for the Switch 2's future.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Did the Nintendo Switch 2 actually have a bad holiday?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nah.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Were sales <em>slower</em> than they were earlier in the year? Sure. But that was neither shocking nor concerning to any analyst I spoke to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Manu Rosier, director of market intelligence at Newzoo, described the Nintendo Switch 2's sales thus far as having a strong initial surge of adoption, followed by "normalization." “There are signs of a Q4 normalization versus the launch window, reflecting a shift from launch-driven demand (scarcity, bundles, pent-up interest) to a more typical, steady-state demand mix," he said. This trend was echoed across the globe, with Rosier and several of the other analysts I spoke to all confirming something roughly similar going on in their respective tracked regions across the U.S., UK, and Europe.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there <em>was</em> a drop off in sales over the holidays from the initial launch surge. As Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and author of <a href="https://superjoost.net/playlist" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SuperJoost Playlist</u></a> explains, "The device is more expensive than its predecessors, for one, and went into the holiday season without a clear blockbuster title to incentivize audiences. Don’t get me wrong, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is well worth your time, but it lacks the cache held by Mario and Zelda titles. More so, everyone who was going to buy a Switch 2 at launch has had a chance to do so, especially since Nintendo had been stocking its new console for months prior to its release in anticipation of tariff-related volatility and potential supply chain issues.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as every single analyst I spoke to also said, this was extremely expected and normal, and not really an indicator of anything especially concerning. For instance, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-was-the-best-selling-console-of-2025-in-the-us-and-is-still-outpacing-the-nintendo-switch"><u>Circana's annual report on the U.S. games market</u></a> had the Nintendo Switch 2 as the best-selling console of the year in both unit and dollar sales. It sold 4.4 million units total for 2025 in the U.S., 94% higher than the Nintendo Switch 1 at the same point in its life cycle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting, of course, that the Nintendo Switch 1 launched in March in its release year, while the Switch 2 dropped in June. This means that the comparison point here, seven months into each console's life cycle, includes the holiday period for the Switch 2, but not the original Switch. And it's true that reporting suggests Switch 2 holiday sales underperformed Switch 1 holiday sales in some markets, especially the UK and parts of the U.S. So it's possible in the coming months we see that difference shrink.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Or, maybe not! The Switch 2 has one heck of a lead, and there's a good reason for it: supply. "Switch 2 sales [in 2025] were expected to be more front-loaded than other consoles historically due to the strong rate of supply early on," says Mat Piscatella, senior director at Circana. "Which, of course, is how the Switch 2 has been able to set the record as the US market's fastest selling console ever over the first 6 months in market. You can't sell units that don't exist, etc etc."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Switches 'Round the World</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the Switch 2's holiday wasn't on the slower side everywhere. In Asia, Niko Partners director of research and insights Daniel Ahmad says the Switch 2 had a good holiday. "In Japan, sales of the Switch 2 during the holiday period were in line with the Switch 1," he says. "Nintendo’s expansion in Southeast Asia is also paying off, with an official launch in the region earlier this year helping drive sales growth. While there is no official release in China, demand for grey market imports is high."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, backs this up too. "In the case of the Japanese market in particular, the numbers are very clear: Switch 2 sold like hot cakes over the holidays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One reason for that is supply. The Switch 2's initial sales success in the U.S. can be attributed partly to Nintendo ensuring there was an ample supply at launch, which also resulted in U.S. total sales being more heavily frontloaded than they would have otherwise. But the console has been difficult to come by in Japan, Toto says. That was true even over the holiday when supply improved, and he suspects the Japan sales <a href="https://sea.ign.com/nintendo-switch-2-unofficial-name/226929/news/nintendo-says-22-million-people-applied-to-pre-order-a-switch-on-the-my-nintendo-store-in-japan-alon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>would have been even higher</u></a> if there had been enough Switch 2s to go around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Piers Harding-Rolls, games industry analyst and researcher at Ampere Analysis, offered an in-depth take as to why the Switch 2 is in the position it's in right now. For one, the market conditions are different than they were when the Switch 1 came out. Not only is there more stock and fewer massive gamers as the other analysts mentioned, but the Switch 2 is also a "known quantity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When the original Switch launched it followed a failing Wii U generation - there was a lot of interest but hype and momentum built up in the run up to the holiday sales at the end of 2017," Harding-Rolls says. "This time around at the Switch 2 launch demand was predictably high because of the success of the Switch. Following a record launch, it’s not surprising that Switch 2 sales have not been able to maintain the same massive sales lead on the original Switch. For the record, Switch 2 shipments in 2025 should outperform the original Switch in 2017 and over a shorter period of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"...Then there is the whole macroeconomic situation, less disposable income and higher priced hardware. This may be softening demand to an extent especially as lots of new games are still available on the original Switch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Put all together, it sounds like there's a lot less cause for alarm(o) than some were making Switch 2 sales out to be.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Switch in Twenty-Six</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about the future?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harding-Rolls continues: "I’m expecting Switch 2 exclusives to become more plentiful in 2026 so this will drive upgrades for those sitting on the fence. Overall, Switch 2 games look pretty strong in 2026 so I remain quite bullish on the performance of the platform this year. Longer-term I don’t expect Switch 2 to outperform the original Switch as there were special conditions - primarily the pandemic - which supercharged demand for Switch later in the cycle and elongated it to an extent."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone else agrees 2026 will be a good year for Switch 2, though with some asterisks related to the broader global market. Toto thinks for the current fiscal year ending March 30, Nintendo will be closer to 20 million units sold than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/nintendo-full-year-operating-profit-falls-466-2025-05-08/#:~:text=%22Nintendo%20clearly%20wants%20to%20play,closer%20to%2020%20million%20units" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>their own forecast of 15 million</u></a>, contingent on them building a more impressive game line-up. Ahmad predicts that the Switch 2 will sell more than 50 million units by the end of 2027, which would be a similar amount to the Switch 1 over the same time frame. He's predicting a price hike, though, specifically a tariff-related one: "Tariffs were already squeezing margins last year, component costs are increasing rapidly, and we wouldn’t be surprised if Nintendo passes those costs on to consumers in one way or another."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Van Dreunen doesn't think we'll see component-related price changes that would discourage sales, saying that Nintendo has already priced those in and that he expects sales in Japan especially to remain strong thanks to regional discounts and a heavy focus on the domestic market. "If it looks like Nintendo is selling fewer consoles in the US, you can look to the current administration for an explanation."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Memory Goes Boom</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">But hardware pricing is a pretty big sticking point for James McWhirter, senior analyst at Omdia. He provided a fairly detailed breakdown of what he thinks is coming not just for the Switch 2, but for the entire console market, insofar as hardware pricing increases could eventually price consumers out of new purchases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McWhirter thinks that the big story for all console hardware this year will be the effect that demand for AI infrastructure is going to have on pricing. In his estimation, about six months ago, RAM in a base PS5 accounted for at least a fifth of the bill of materials. But by the end of 2025, that cost will have risen by at least 50%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Suppliers obviously have the upper hand with any new negotiations, so it’s only a matter of time until Nintendo – and Sony and Microsoft – run through their inventory of memory and renegotiate at higher prices," he says. "Any rise in the cost of console hardware will be passed on to consumers via multiple means: directly, or via a mix of increased software, services, peripherals pricing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Console Slideshow</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"But this comes at a tricky time for consoles – we are of course simultaneously seeing the spending power of middle-income households declining. This leaves Nintendo more exposed as they are keen on transitioning their Switch audience onto Switch 2 as quickly as possible, with no more cross-gen releases on the horizon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not just hardware that's impacted, he adds. He expects the "memory boom cycle" to impact Switch 2 software specifically soon, due to physical games shipping on NAND memory. "The rising cost of NAND memory places upward pressure on the cost of Switch 2 Game Cards. Switch 2, like its predecessor, is still a physical-first platform. When including bundled software, Omdia estimates 57% of Switch 2 games sold in 2025 were at retail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What about Game Key-Cards, you say? Sure, that would help, but they're controversial…and may not be enough anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The upward pressure on NAND memory prices mean Game Key-Cards will be here to stay - even Nintendo has begun experimenting with them starting with March 2026's Pokémon Pokopia. A publisher recently suggested Nintendo is introducing smaller capacity Game Cards, but the cost savings they provide may be eventually wiped out in future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">McWhirter expects that all of this will likely impact the "middle market" of gaming, people who purchase consoles sometime after their initial launch boom or general non-enthusiast gamers, may not be purchasing consoles in the same volume that they have in recent history. These are the people that pushed the Switch 1 to global sell-through of 151 million by the end of last year, but he's not so sure they're going to show up for the Switch 2, especially if it gets more expensive. He recalls the Nintendo 3DS, which had extremely frontloaded sales (17% of systems were sold in the first year on the market) compared to the Nintendo Switch 1 (9% in the first year). A similar scenario could happen again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are things Nintendo could do to stave that off. Switch 2 hardware bundles over the holiday providing a "soft" discount would help push sales. Regional discounts extended beyond just Japan would also probably work. He also posits a future docked-only Switch 2 Lite that would help reduce component costs and pass that savings on to consumers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does all this mean? It sounds like, as has been reported, 2025 was overall a fantastic launch year for the Switch 2, and that energy will likely continue for some time to come. But there are a number of hurdles the console needs to overcome in the next few years in order to maintain that success long-term. Some of them are obvious and manageable by Nintendo now: does it have a strong 2026 and 2027 game line-up, or not? But others, such as tariffs and component costs, are harder to predict and will require deft handling on the part of the hardware maker in order to drive the Switch 2 generation to a comparable level of success as its predecessors had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
