			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different game from every other game developed by FromSoftware, sporting the mechanics made popular by their Souls series. Instead of making co-op multiplayer an optional element that can make certain segments of the game easier, the experience has been designed around co-op, resulting in a game that is clearly best played together with two other players.</p>
<p>Despite this, <strong>the challenges that the land of Limveld offers can be experienced by lone Nightfarers not keen on teaming up with others.</strong> Doing so it's extremely simple. All you need to do is <strong>interacting with the big table found in the central area of the Roundtable Hold</strong> main hub, press the <strong>R1 / right shoulder button</strong> on your controller to access the <strong>Matchmaking Settings tab</strong>, scroll down to the Expedition Type option and press either left or right to change between Multiplayer and <strong>Single Player</strong>. Once the option has been set to Single Player, any expedition you choose to embark upon will be played solo.</p>

<p>While it is definitely possible to play Elden Ring Nightreign by yourself,<strong> should you do so</strong>? In terms of incentives, the game provides none, as the experience has been clearly balanced around co-op, so by playing solo, you will still have to handle a massive number of enemies, even during select boss battles, with only lower hit point values than in co-op mode. As such, playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo can often end up being a frustrating experience, and should be considered as an option only if you want to practice against bosses, find optimal strategies and prepare for multiplayer sessions. Completing certain Remembrances episodes can be faster in solo mode as well. So, if you want to truly experience the game at its best, you will have to team up with others.</p>

            <p>A sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> trope I quite enjoy is arboretums that provide oxygen to ships or structures, both because it's a nifty (<a href="https://www.rbg.ca/botanicult-fiction-plants-in-space-fact-or-fiction/">if spurious?</a>) idea, and because I like the concept of people who've only seen iron bulkheads for months staring wistfully at small trees.

<p>This one's a single-player bad place explorer 'em up where you play as a stranded astronaut, squirreling away supplies and making shelters for periodic life support shorts, crafting weapons, and traversing dangerous junglefied environs, while also trying to keep your morale up. Among the game's features is a novel 'asphyxiation or treats' system, where you'll pry open sealed doors, not knowing if there's valuable supplies or just a horrible bit of space on the other side. More features! More!</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Cut through jungle corridors in search of crafting supplies, exotic weapons, and rare decorations.</li>
<li>Pry open long sealed bulkhead doors — just pray the void of interstellar space isn’t waiting for you on the other side.</li>
<li>Patch up rotted spacesuits, lead lined radiation gear, and other protective garments to traverse dangerous new areas.</li>
<li>Stockpile for the next cold snap; life support is on the fritz after centuries of neglect, and you can never be sure when it might fail… for days or even months at a time.</li>
<li>The jungle is alive, and extremely hostile. Will you chance a run through the serrated tendrils of crawling plant life, or barricade up and hide somewhere safe?</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Dev team Manzanita Interactive have roots in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-zomboid">Project Zomboid</a> modding community, and they say they've carried this spirit of customisation forward. As such, the game will ship with a custom map editor and its Lua API. "A game made by modders, for modders, from modders". I might have added that last bit. Release date is still TBA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-what-do-you-get-for-defeating-the-fell-omen-in-the-tutorial/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In true FromSoftware fashion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> features a challenging boss battle against a familiar face from the original game in the tutorial that is meant to be lost, which delivers a straightforward message: the game is challenging. While this first fight against the Fell Omen can be difficult, it can be won using a relatively simple strategy, and you will also get a nice reward for your effort.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529133512_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As the tutorial features a set number of enemies and specific equipment, putting together a <strong>winning strategy is much easier than in the actual <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> experience</strong>. Make sure to defeat every enemy you encounter as you proceed and open every treasure chest. By doing so, you can get to level 6 and have the Cold Katar and Rogier's Rapier Armaments in your possession. Equip both of them to use the powerful <strong>Hoarfrost Stump</strong> skill and activate the <strong>Multiple Periodical Glintblades</strong> passive.</p>
<p>With these Armaments equipped, head over to the ruins where the Fell Omen awaits, <strong>bring the Duchess back to life</strong> as prompted, and wait for the enemy to appear. When it does, keep your distance, let the Duchess hold his attention, and <strong>use Hoarfrost Stump or attack repeatedly with the Cold Katar after he uses any hammer attacks to inflict frostbite</strong>. Once you have accomplished this, keep your distance and attack only after the boss uses hammer attacks, letting the Continual Glintblades deal some nice burst damage without doing anything else. If the Duchess dies, use the <strong>Wylder's Ultimate Art</strong> to bring her back instantly. Try as much as you can to defeat the boss without dying, as you won't have the Duchess' help during your second and final try, making everything much more challenging.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529133752_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After defeating the Fell Omen, sit in the chair to end the tutorial and begin the proper Elden Ring Nightreign experience. As you awaken in the Roundtable Hold, you will be informed of having been gifted the Fell Omen Fetish relic, which boosts your attack power when you switch weapons, improves throwing knife damage, and increases Vigor by 1. If you have not defeated the Fell Omen on your first try, you can<strong>&nbsp;replay through the tutorial</strong> by accessing the Visual Codex, selecting Guide, and pressing the Square/ X button.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-5-tips-to-conquer-the-night/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Though rooted deeply into the hardcore action-RPG mechanics made popular by the Souls series, Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different sort of experience from what FromSoftware usually offers in its games. With a focus on co-op play and a time limit, playing the new game from the Japanese studio can feel overwhelming for those more used to the slower pace of typical soulslike.</p>
<p>To help you better understand the unique take on the Soulslike mechanics featured in Elden Ring Nightreign, and to start having fun just a few Expeditions in, here are a few tips that will be helpful as you run from one side of the other of Limveld, trying to stay one step ahead of the Night.</p>
<h2>1 - Plan For the Whole Game</h2>
<p>With the first two in-game days lasting only 15 minutes, you must upgrade your character as quickly as possible in Elden Ring Nightreign. As such, you will want to start planning what to do right from the start of a game. While the spectral hawk is carrying you to Limveld, open up the map and locate the most critical upgrades to have an easier time later in the game, and plan around their locations. Flask charges, situated inside the churches with a gold outline, are a must for survivability, so grab them as quickly as possible, possibly clearing a few other locations along the way to level up and get your first few upgrades. If you can, prioritize locations on the edges of the map, as there's a good chance they will no longer be available for the day once the Night approaches.</p>
<h2>2 - Level Up As Much as You Can</h2>
<p>While it can be tempting to explore an enemy camp or an enemy stronghold near your landing point at the start of the game, it's not a very good idea to head into them at a low level. Look around your starting location, find some mobs, and take them down to get some runes and level up to at least level 3 to have a much easier time. In Elden Ring Nightreign, character level matters a lot, as it not only increases stats but also allows your Nightfarer to wield weapons of higher rarity, so you will want to make some quick preparations before heading into any location guarded by bosses. Dying will also make you waste time, which you don't have a lot of in the game.</p>
<h2>3 - Ignore Mobs</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250520003440_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Killing mobs at the start of a game in Elden Ring Nightreign is the way to go to level up enough to handle bosses, but after reaching level 3, it's almost always a good idea to ignore all those mobs that aren't getting in the way. After a certain point, the runes you get from defeating them are not worth the time you need to dispose of them, which could be used to take down bosses, which give plenty of runes and offer you one between three different upgrades, which may be more crucial to defeating a Nightlord than runes to level up. This holds even more true when going through the Castle in the center of Limveld. This location is filled with enemies that reward Nightfarers with upgrades, so ignore the mobs to get to them as quickly as possible to reap some beneficial rewards.</p>
<h2>4 - Get a Ranged Combat Option</h2>
<p>By pressing the Triangle or Y button with the map open, you will be able to get more information on the upgrades that can be obtained in each location in Limveld, and you will be surprised by how many bows and ranged weapons can be found. There's a good reason for this: ranged combat options work great in Elden Ring Nightreign, as you have infinite ammo and can spam attack from a safe distance. Having to resort to healing as little as possible, taking out enemies from afar is extremely important, so make sure to get a ranged attack option for your character, no matter how good they may be at using it. The same goes for all magic spells, as they can make your life significantly easier under certain conditions. Most Nightlords don't leave themselves open too often, so having a ranged attack option is a great help against these powerful enemies as well.</p>
<h2>5 - Don't Go Off on Your Own</h2>
<p>Going off alone in Elden Ring Nightreign can be tempting, especially if you have uncollaborative companions, but doing so is never a good idea. Always stick together with your fellow Nightfarers, as there's nothing that you can do by yourself that can help the team as a whole. For example, you may defeat some bosses by yourself, but your companions will not receive upgrades automatically, only runes, rendering your efforts almost useless, in the grand scheme of things. With more experienced Nightfarers and excellent team coordination, spreading out may be a viable strategy to take down multiple bosses and rush from one location to the next picking upgrades, but this requires a lot of game knowledge as well, which you will obviously lack at the start of your adventure in Limveld.</p>

This makes for a fast-paced game focused on combat and exploration that's easy to set up and learn, but still offers much of the customization, continuity, and replayability of pen-and-paper RPGs.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">The game originally launched in 1989 and was out of print for several years until it returned with the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HeroQuest-Tabletop-Immersive-Fantasy-Adventure/dp/B08Q4J1XHZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HeroQuest Game System (2nd Edition)</a></strong>, thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign. You can pick up a copy for $91.60 at Amazon, which is very close to the lowest price this year. Though the retailer briefly sold it for under $50 in early 2024, the price has trended up ever since--it hasn't dropped below $85 since Black Friday. The price has bounced between $90 and $110 throughout 2025 (so far). HeroQuest's MSRP is $135.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a cheaper path to accessing the new expansion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-and-marvels-collaboration-remains-strong-after-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-committed-to-making-three-games-based-on-marvel-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We learned yesterday that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">EA had canceled its Black Panther game and shut down the team that was working on it, Cliffhanger Studios</a>. This immediately put into question the status of EA's other Marvel-based projects, like Motive Studios' Iron Man game.</p>
<p>However, according to statements from Marvel and EA that were sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-still-making-at-least-3-marvel-games-even-after-black-panther-cancellation">IGN</a>, the collaboration between the two companies "<em>remains strong,</em>" and EA is still committed to making three games based on Marvel characters, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-marvel-games-partner-3-new-action-adventure-games/">previously agreed to in 2022.</a></p>
<p>Originally, the three games would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">EA Motive's Iron Man game</a>, Cliffhanger's Black Panther game, and a third unannounced title. The Iron Man game is still in development, and, as far as we know right now, is still planned to be released.</p>
<p>"<em>Our partnership with Marvel remains strong and our multi-title, long-term collaboration continues,</em>" said EA Entertainment president Laura Miele in a statement.</p>
<p>For Marvel's part, a spokesperson for the company said, "<em>The multi-title, long-term relationship between Marvel Games and EA, a creative collaboration focused on original storytelling with various, beloved Marvel characters, remains strong. Development of our console and PC titles, beginning with Marvel's Iron Man, is led by Motive Studios</em>."</p>
<p>So after the Iron Man game, it sounds like, at least for now, Motive Studios is on the hook for two more games based on a Marvel character. Whether we actually get those games is another question. If the Iron Man game flops, it wouldn't be surprising if the other projects are canceled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">Marvel's Avengers</a> definitively proved that putting big-name comic book characters in a video game does not guarantee success in today's MCU-led market.</p>
<p>But that's the less likely scenario, since Motive has an incredibly talented team and there are no signs that it will try to mash a bunch of unwanted live service-focused features into its <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">single-player</a> Iron Man game.</p>
<p>Which seemingly puts Motive Studios in a similar position to Respawn, with both studios locked into making three games based on Disney-owned franchises. Once the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">third Star Wars Jedi</a> title from Respawn and the third Marvel game from Motive are out, EA might finally move entirely away from making games based on licensed series, as chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">Andrew Wilson talked about</a>. Sorry to all <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront III</a> hopefuls.</p>

Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Scuf is adding drift-resistant Hall effect sticks to updated versions of its wireless Envision and Reflex controllers. The revised models include the $149.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/pc-controllers/scuf-envision-pro-steel-grey-he">Envision</a> and $199.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/pc-controllers/scuf-envision-pro-steel-grey-he">Envision Pro</a> for PC as well as the $249.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/playstation5/scuf-reflex-base-black">Reflex Pro</a> and $279.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/playstation5/scuf-reflex-fps-steelgray">Reflex FPS</a> for PlayStation 5 and PC. Those are all starting prices, of course, as the Corsair-owned brand offers a wide variety of customization options that can take each model to even higher prices.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">Hall effect</a> upgrade brings Scuf’s wireless offerings in line with its wired-only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/616019/scuf-valor-pro-hands-on-impressions-wired-xbox-controller">Valor Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price">Nomad</a> mobile controllers, replacing the original Reflex and Envision pads that first debuted in 2021 and 2023, respectively.</p><p>Scuf is getting with the program on Hall effect sticks at a time when the magnetic, drift-resistant sensing option has become commonplace in other brands like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo</a>, Razer, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911052/gamesir-t4-cyclone-pro-wireless-controller-hall-effect-joysticks">GameSir</a>, but hasn’t appeared in controllers from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">Nintendo</a>, Sony, or Microsoft yet. But some controller makers are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">already moving on</a> to a more power-efficient drift-resistant technology: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR sticks</a>.</p><p>Scuf controllers may be even pricier than premium controller options from Microsoft and Sony like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>, but in my experience they’re nice for those willing to spend the money. They’re some of the few native wireless options for Xbox Series X / S and PS5, and Scuf’s rear paddles and clicky hair-trigger options are some of the best feeling “pro” upgrades around. The lack of drift resistant sticks has made it a little more challenging to recommend them, though. Take, for example, our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s">Xbox controller buying guide</a> where the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s#:~:text=A%20formidable%20alternative%20to%20the%20Elite">Razer Wolverine Pro V3</a> knocked off the Scuf Instinct Pro I used to personally love.</p><p>Better late than never, Scuf.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While you can play Nightreign as a solo player, the game is focused on pairing you with two other players for you all to fight and explore together. Fortunately, both the single-player and multiplayer functions in Elden Ring Nightreign are easy to use, allowing you to minimize your time between expeditions into the Living Lands.</p><p>Below, we'll show you everything you need to know about how to start expeditions and how to set up both single-player and co-op multiplayer runs in Elden Ring Nightreign, as well as the lack of proper cross-play support.</p><h2 id="How_to_start_expeditions_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to start expeditions in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First and foremost, let's go over how to actually get into expeditions once you're past the tutorial of the game that occurs within the first 10 or so minutes.</p><p>After the tutorial, you'll find yourself at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">Roundtable Hold</a>, a familiar location for Elden Ring fans. At the Roundtable Hold, you can interact with a variety of NPCs, but the main area you'll spend the majority of your time in is right in the center at the table itself. When you approach the central table, you'll get a prompt to "Commence Expedition," which you want to press.</p><p>When you choose to commence an expedition, the boss menu in Nightreign will appear on your screen. This lists all the current bosses you can hunt down in the game, providing a brief background on each one so you know what you're up against. Before you choose a boss, though, you want to tab over to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-matchmaking-psa-guide/1100-6531878/" data-ref-id="1100-6531878">Matchmaking</a> Settings by using the bumpers on your controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498397"></a><figcaption>Starting an expedition with the first boss in Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png"></figure><p>On the Matchmaking Settings menu, you're able to invite members to your party, create a password for your friends to use and join your group, and even change your Expedition Type to switch between single-player and multiplayer.</p><h2 id="How_to_play_solo_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to play solo in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First up, if you want to play solo in Elden Ring Nightreign, all you have to do is change the Expedition Type from the default "multiplayer" to "singleplayer." These are your only two options, so switching the type once will do the trick.</p><p>Once you have switched your Expedition Type, you can head into the boss menu, select your boss, and then commence a solo expedition. As a note, you'll default to the class that you currently have equipped in the Roundtable Hold, as you have no teammates to go through the class selection screen with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498400"></a><figcaption>Going through Nightreign in a party of one</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png"></figure><p>Other than that, everything is the exact same as it is in the multiplayer expeditions. You can do the same things, fight the same enemies, and try to defeat all of the bosses to eventually reach the final boss. Of course, as a solo player, this is incredibly hard, and once you die a single time, you're dead for good since you can't be revived.</p><h2 id="How_to_play_multiplayer_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to play multiplayer in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now, let's get into playing Elden Ring Nightreign the way the developers intended. By default, your Expedition Type is set to multiplayer, so if you want to play with two random players, all you have to do is commence an expedition, pick your boss, and then the game will take care of the rest. You'll be automatically matched with two other real players, and then the character selection screen will appear.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401"></a><figcaption>The tutorial box for setting up team expeditions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png"></figure><p>Only one person can select any particular class, so if a player gets to your favorite class, you need to have a backup or two. Once the characters have been chosen, all three of you will drop onto a map together, and you can start playing from there. There's no limit to staying near your teammates, so feel free to do whatever you think is best. However, you'll eventually wind up with your teammates at the end of the day as the zone encroaches around the map.</p><p>On the flip side, if you want to play with your friends instead of random players, you can do that from the Matchmaking Settings menu as well. All you have to do is select the "Invite Members" option from the menu, which brings up a list of your online friends from your platform. If you invite players, they become members of your party, and you can all hop into an expedition when everyone has readied up. As a note, <strong>if some players haven't progressed to your point in the game, they'll still be able to play, but could experience content they haven't seen yet</strong>.</p><p>To bypass the inviting and joining process, you can also set a multiplayer password. This allows you to matchmake with players using the same password as you, which gives you the chance to play with people that you're not friends with on your platform. You can choose to set the number of players with the password who can join, with a maximum of three players, which fills out the entire party. If you select one or two players, then the remaining spots will be filled with random players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402"></a><figcaption>Setting a multiplayer password for others to join off</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png"></figure><p>Finally, you can also set up to five group passwords. These passwords are so you can more easily see bloodstains, phantoms, and victor records from others who are using the same password. Of course, setting up five passwords takes some coordination if you're planning to use them across a large friend group, so make sure all of your friends are using the exact passwords.</p><h2 id="Does_Elden_Ring_Nightreign_support_cross_play_">Does Elden Ring Nightreign support cross-play?</h2><p>Now that you understand how multiplayer expeditions work, you might be wondering if you're able to party up with your friends or other players who are on a different system. Unfortunately, Elden Ring Nightreign does not support cross-play at launch, meaning that you can only matchmake with players who are on the same system as you.</p><p>However, there is one caveat to that rule. Nightreign does support cross-generation play, which means you can party up with friends and players who are using the same console brand as you. For example, if you're on Xbox Series X|S, a friend on Xbox One can still matchmake with you for an expedition. The same goes for players on PlayStation 4 and 5.</p><p>So, while the game doesn't offer full cross-play, there is a silver lining for those who have a friend group with some mismatched last-generation and current-generation consoles.</p><p>And that just about does it for all of the ways to set up an expedition in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>

She's a self-sufficient magic caster who can maintain her own FP without using items and whose spell choice determines what additional abilities she can use.

Magic Cocktail is the most important part of the Recluse's skillset, as it restores her FP <em>and</em> gives her access to a broad variety of offensive and support spells, from fiery explosions to auras that raise everyone's maximum HP.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Magic_Cocktail_and_Elemental_Defense"><strong>Magic Cocktail and Elemental Defense</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">This is the Recluse's standard art. Use it when an elemental stain is present to absorb that element and recover FP. The Recluse stores three elemental stains, and when she uses Magic Cocktail with three stains, she casts a new spell that changes depending on the stored elements used. Magic Cocktail has no cooldown timer, and you need to use it regularly to restore the Recluse's FP so she can keep casting spells.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Soulblood_Song"><strong>Soulblood Song</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Soulblood Song is the Recluse's ultimate art. She attaches blood sigils to all nearby foes and deals magic damage to them. Allies--including the Recluse--who attack enemies with blood sigils will restore their HP and FP by a small amount with each attack.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Magic_dodge"><strong>Magic dodge</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">This isn't a named ability, but the Recluse's dodge has a slightly longer window of evasion compared to the standard dodge the other Nightfarers get.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The most important thing about Magic Cocktail, aside from learning its combos, is that the Recluse can absorb elemental stains from sources other than her own spells. If, for example, a teammate has a fire bow and attacks an enemy with it, it'll create a fire stain you can absorb.</p><p dir="ltr">The Recluse begins an expedition with a single weapon, the Recluse's Staff. It's a basic sorcery staff that lets her cast Glintstone Pebble, which is good for single targets, and Glintstone Arc, which can hit groups of enemies and potentially knock them backward. It's a humble set of spells, but the fully upgraded versions still make a dent in the HP bar of strong enemies.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Magic_Cocktail_combos">All Magic Cocktail combos</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502324-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502324" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502324-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502324"></a><figcaption>Every combo benefits the party, even if some of them don't deal damage.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502324-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The number of stacks is irrelevant except in cases where we specify otherwise. For example, the floating fireball spell works whether you have two fire and one standard or two standard and one fire.</p><p dir="ltr">Another point worth keeping in mind is that, like with other spells, Recluse combos take a second or two to cast. Make sure you have a safe space to cast them in, without a boss bearing down on you.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Three standard: Creates a swirl of magic that damages enemies at intervals</li><li dir="ltr">Three fire: Launches a spiralling bolt of fire at a target that explodes on impact.

Our guide for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-incantations-and-magic-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531836/" data-ref-id="1100-6531836">where to find magic and Incantations</a> has specifics about where to look.</p><p dir="ltr">The ideal scenario is one where you find lightning, fire, and holy spells, so you have the full range of Magic Cocktail combinations available to use. The easiest-to-use ones are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Flame Sling</li><li dir="ltr">Lightning Spear</li><li dir="ltr">Discus of Light</li></ul><p dir="ltr">All three have comparatively short casting times, and you can charge them for extra damage. Zamoor Ice Storm is another powerful sorcery, though it's rare, and you can end up with good results from any of the dragon communion Incantations. The drawback with using those is how long they take to cast and how difficult it is to target quick enemies with them. The best time to use a dragon breath Incantation is while a boss is immobile during a critical hit or if their attention is occupied elsewhere.</p><p dir="ltr">If you can't find the spells you want, it's worth keeping one or two weapons with elemental affiliations on hand. The Recluse isn't built for using greatswords and hammers, but a twinblade, dagger, whip, or sword with a useful affinity lets you use a wider variety of Magic Cocktail's combos even without magic.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_relics_for_Recluse">Best relics for Recluse</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502326-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502326-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502326"></a><figcaption>Spells have lengthy cast times, so make sure you have enough space between you and your target to cast them safely.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502326-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like with weapons, the random nature of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">finding relics</a> makes it challenging to recommend a combination that might be useful to anyone.

The only difference as you deplete this boss' health is that Libra starts using certain attacks more frequently, such as the clouds of madness, or makes them faster and more powerful, like with their madness sigils.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Staff_smash">Staff smash</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Libra performs a three-hit staff combo--two horizontal strikes, followed by a powerful overhead slam. The overhead attack has a slightly longer delay.

If you feel up to it, though, shatter the shield with an ultimate art, such as the Ironeye's or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-class-guide/1100-6531893/" data-ref-id="1100-6531893">Wylder</a>'s. Extended uses of dragon breath Incantations can also break the shield, though the Recluse is usually the only one with an FP pool large enough to pull it off</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Libra_weaknesses">Libra weaknesses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502816-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502816" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502816-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502816"></a><figcaption>Collect the orange crystals scattered around the arena to stave off madness.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502816-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The boss-selection menu tells you that Libra deals madness damage and is also weak to madness damage. While we never saw evidence that Libra suffers from the madness affliction like other enemies do--where they suffer extra damage after a period of buildup--it's true that the boss takes extra damage from madness weapons and spells.</p><p dir="ltr">Those are hard to find, though, and you might have more than a few runs without a madness camp showing up on the map. If so, or if the weapons you get from a madness camp don't suit your build, Libra is also prone to frostbite and blood loss. Ice weapons and spells, katanas, daggers with bleed effects, or, if you're lucky, a bow with the bloodloss effect, are all suitable choices.</p><p dir="ltr">By Day 2, if you don't have any weapons that take your fancy, spend time getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-smithing-stones-and-upgrade-weapons-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531840/" data-ref-id="1100-6531840">Smithing Stone 2 in Limveld's mines</a>. That way, you can upgrade whatever weapons you <em>are</em> using and dish out plenty of damage, even if you can't exploit Libra's weaknesses.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_team_combinations_for_Libra">Best team combinations for Libra</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502817-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502817-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502817"></a><figcaption>An ally with an offensive ultimate art can shatter Libra's shield before it finishes charging.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502817-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-5.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr">Three Ironeye</li><li dir="ltr">Two Ironeye, one Raider, Duchess, or Wylder</li><li dir="ltr">One Ironeye, one Recluse, one Wylder or Raider</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Libra moves quickly, but often targets just single teammate or uses close-range attacks. You want at least one ranged character who can maintain pressure while the beast is targeting a teammate or while you're out of their attack range. The other necessary component for this fight is an ultimate art that damages enemies--so, the Wylder, Ironeye, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-guardian-class-guide/1100-6531894/" data-ref-id="1100-6531894">Guardian</a>, or Raider. At several points during the fight, Libra will start to generate a shell that, if left unbroken, increases the boss's resistance to all attacks for several minutes. The Executor's ultimate is useful, but often not powerful enough to break the shell before it forms.</p><p dir="ltr">Ironeye is the best choice, since they're less reliant on lucky item drops and can still dish out quite a lot of damage just by upgrading their standard bow. One hit from their ultimate is also enough to shatter Libra's shell before it forms. The Recluse is also useful--doubly so if you manage to nab a madness-related spell or Incantation--though their reliance on item drops for stronger Magic Cocktail spells means you might get stuck with just Glintstone Pebble for the fight.</p><p dir="ltr">The Duchess is another worthwhile consideration. Her ultimate deals no damage, but her extra dodge and longer evasion window makes it easier to avoid Libra's staff strikes and escape from madness sigils before they activate.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for some extra support, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-guides-hub/1100-6531889/" data-ref-id="1100-6531889">Elden Ring Nightreign guides hub</a> which includes the best ways to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-best-ways-to-farm-runes/1100-6531844/" data-ref-id="1100-6531844">farm runes</a>, where to find <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-smithing-stones-and-upgrade-weapons-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531840/" data-ref-id="1100-6531840">smithing stones</a> to upgrade weapons, and how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-more-healing-flask-charges-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531698/" data-ref-id="1100-6531698">increase healing flask charges</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> matchmaking isn't as simple as pressing a button and letting the game take care of everything. That's especially true if you're looking to tackle specific fights against the Night Lords, or want to play with people from other regions.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-solo-and-co-op-explained/1100-6531697/" data-ref-id="1100-6531697">how to play solo and multiplayer</a>, there are a few matchmaking rules that aren't explained in too much detail. If you're only getting your bearings around the game, the process might lead to some frustrations. Fear not, though, as we'll explain everything you need to know about how matchmaking works in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Elden Ring Nightreign matchmaking works</h2><p dir="ltr">At its core, matchmaking in Elden Ring Nightregin is fairly straightforward. Interacting with the Table of Lost Grace at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">Roundtable Hold</a> opens up the Expeditions menu. From there, you can select which boss you want to tackle and immediately start matchmaking, which will search for two other available players who are on the same hunt as you are.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've enabled the cross-region network option, you might be matched with people from, well, other regions. I'm based in Argentina, and I've primarily played with people from the United States, but latency was rarely an issue.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, here's where matchmaking in Elden Ring Nightreign gets tricky: The first available Night Lord is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-tricephalos-boss-guide-how-to-beat-gladius/1100-6531888/" data-ref-id="1100-6531888">Tricephalos</a>. You won't gain access to other bosses until you've beaten it at least once. As such, if you want to matchmake with people who have other Night Lords unlocked, you'll first need to tackle that requirement. This <em>can</em> be bypassed if you're matchmaking through specific platforms' party invites, but it won't apply to random matchmaking with players outside your friends list.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502861-eldenringnightreign_20250519220916.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502861-eldenringnightreign_20250519220916.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502861"></a><figcaption>A party of Nightfarers arrives on day 1 in Limveld.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502861-eldenringnightreign_20250519220916.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Shifting Earth events are another condition. These are random instances that affect maps in an array of ways, which also become available after defeating our pal Tricephalos. Now, these are in rotation, and there are a few different conditions to unlock them all. You can matchmake with people who have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-shifting-earth-events-guide/1100-6531879/" data-ref-id="1100-6531879">Shifting Earth event</a> active, even if you don't, but you must have encountered it at least once before.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, there are also Character Remembrances. These lore snippets, which are different for each playable class, lead to unique objectives on your next expedition. If you have one active, you won't be able to matchmake with other players who also have an active objective. Once again, you can bypass this step by inviting folks through your platform's party system. If you do, only the first person to start the matchmaking process will have their objective on the map.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, if you're matchmaking with friends in Elden Ring Nightreign, you'll largely be able to join each other's games without too many hurdles. When trying to find matches with random people, however, it might be tricky. At the very least, the more progress you make, the easier this will become.

While From Software's latest might not be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-battle-royale-games/2900-6531/" data-ref-id="2900-6531">battle royale</a>, it does take a cue from the genre with a circle that gradually closes in on a specific map area.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're wondering about the inner workings of the Night's Tide and how it dictates the flow of every expedition, this guide covers how the Night's Tide works in Elden Ring Nightreign, as well as some tips to get around it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How the Night's Tide in Elden Ring Nightreign works</h2><p dir="ltr">The flow of an expedition in Elden Ring Nightreign is determined by the ever-increasing presence of the Night's Tide. In short, this is a deadly rain that gradually engulfs the map, closing in on a random area where a boss fight takes place. This happens at the end of Day 1 and Day 2--after the latter, you'll automatically move to a different area outside Limveld, where you'll do your last preparations before confronting the Night Lord chosen for the expedition.</p><p dir="ltr">Each day lasts for around 15 minutes. During that time, you'll notice how the blue circle outside of the map gradually shrinks. You'll get notifications on screen when this starts happening, but opening the map to periodically check its location and whether it's moving or not is a good routine to develop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502948-eldenringnightreign_20250521212124.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502948" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502948-eldenringnightreign_20250521212124.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502948"></a><figcaption>Open your map often while exploring Limveld to check the Night's Tide status.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502948-eldenringnightreign_20250521212124.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you come into contact with the rain, you'll slowly lose health. In the case that it completely drains your HP, you'll lose a level and your current runes to come back to life. There is a short window in which the Nightfarer will crawl on the ground, which is a window of opportunity for your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-revive-teammates-faster-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531891/" data-ref-id="1100-6531891">squadmates to revive you</a>, but it might be hard under the rain.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, bear in mind the respawn site is random and won't automatically move you toward your teammates, which can potentially lead to additional subsequent deaths until you're clear of the Night's Tide. While the rain is an annoying threat and can be difficult to deal with, you can use your flasks to replenish your health. Be mindful of Sites of Grace nearby, especially if you're moving toward a boss encounter, as you might end up with just a few flasks to use for the fight if you don't replenish them in time.</p><p dir="ltr">What happens with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-best-ways-to-farm-runes/1100-6531844/" data-ref-id="1100-6531844">runes</a> and the level you lost? If you were defeated inside the Night's Tide on Day 1, you're free to return to the spot on Day 2 and reclaim your lost runes, including the ones for the lost level. If this happens on day 2, the only way to recover them is if the death happened somewhat close to the boss encounter area. You'll be able to sprint toward the runes and reclaim them.
