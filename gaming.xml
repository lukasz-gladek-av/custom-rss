<p>This is the Raye</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Holiday season is almost upon us (this writer's local supermarket rolled out the advent calendars weeks ago), and Nintendo UK is equally keen to spread some festive cheer with its new TV ads.</p>
<p>This year's offering once again puts the record-breaking singer-songwriter star Raye front and centre, showing that even Brit-winners like to let off some steam with a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/nintendo-uks-latest-switch-advert-shows-just-how-little-we-know-about-pop-music">last year's affair</a>, which also starred Raye, the ads focus on the family-friendly joy of a Nintendo system, as if to say, "forget the Brits, Grammys and Forbes list, only a Switch 2 can make you <em>this</em> happy". And once again, we'd be lying if we said that Raye doesn't do a good job of selling it — that's the face of someone who knows the joys of smashing a Crockoid in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Sure, it's cheesier than a Christmas cheese board, but nobody's after gritty realism from a holiday ad.</p>
<p>While Raye is this year's returning face, it's the <em>first</em> festive ads for the Switch 2 — hence all the GameChat and Mouse Mode. Expect to see similar shots of merry, bright faces playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> via a Switch 2 Camera for years to come...</p>

Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

Like all good horror games, silence and loneliness are your worst enemies, and that's true in ROUTINE – except for the part where you discover a foe who thinks the primary threat is, in fact, you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Eight years on from its initial announcement, the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is now just a month from launch — and today, fans can watch a fresh trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due to launch on December 4, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond remains mysterious, with Nintendo keeping details of its much-delayed first-person shooter largely under wraps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly how it picks up the story of the Metroid Prime trilogy, 18 years later, we have no idea. All the areas Samus will visit? Not a clue. Chozo lore? Dark Samus? Phazon? Other bounty hunters? Time will tell. (Though, as of September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-has-a-release-date-while-samus-has-a-motorbike">we know Samus somehow has a motorbike</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This year, in particular, has seen Nintendo fans fret over the continued wait for more information, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-metroid-prime-4-beyond-delay-rumors-nintendo-recommits-to-2025-launch">rumors of a delay spread</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-reportedly-set-for-september-as-metroid-prime-4-release-date-and-mario-40th-anniversary-speculation-mounts">the wait for a release date dragged on</a>. Glimpses of the game to date have not prompted an outpouring of excitement, either, with a fairly mixed response to the Switch 2 event demo (to be fair, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-metroid-prime-4-beyond-first-hands-on-preview">linear and not overly exciting section from the game's opening</a>) and brief showing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">September's general Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan eyebrows have been raised, too, by the apparent lack of marketing dedicated to the game. Where Kirby Air Riders has been featured in two lengthy dedicated Nintendo Directs, Metroid Prime 4 has had none.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is still time for the Metroid Prime 4 hype machine to kick into gear. And now, 30 days from launch, fans are celebrating today's new trailer doing just that. While there are no standout reveals in the video, it does an entertaining job of showing Samus in action, highlighting baddie Sylux, and revisiting more of the game's setting: the planet Viewros.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Metroidvania Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Trailer felt like, 'Yes, we've heard you all about the marketing. Please have this,'" wrote Metroid fan Jawmuncher on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-beyond-survive-trailer.1343221/page-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "I approve. This is a trailer I could use to sell someone on the game. The last trailer I could not unless they REALLY like motorcycles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Finally a good trailer," agreed AppleKid. "Still want to know more but this trailer at least isn't hype deflating like the last 2. Game looks great!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But still, there are calls for a dedicated Metroid Prime 4 deep dive, via a dedicated Nintendo Direct. "Kirby Air Riders got two," noted Khanimus. "The game people have been actively anticipating since it was announced 8 years ago probably should get one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>
Just weeks after Japan rejected Nintendo's initial efforts to patent a variety of Pokémon-style monster capture and throwing mechanics - a patent that might prove critical in the company's ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> - the US has taken the "rare" step of re-examining a previously granted Pokémon patent, believing it could be invalid.
</p>
<p>
Back in September, the US Patent and Trademark Office <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">granted Nintendo a new patent</a> (Patent No. 12,403,397, applied for in March 2023) covering gameplay mechanics relating to the summoning of a sub-character to battle an enemy. However, as <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">reported by Games Fray</a>, USPTO director John A. Squires has now "personally ordered" the organisation to re-examine that patent following the discovery of prior art references in two older patents.
</p>
<p>
In his <a href="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/25-11-03-Director-Initiated-Order-for-Ex-Parte-Reexamination-397-Patent.pdf">re-examination order</a>, Squires says he has "determined that substantial new questions of patentability have arisen" in relation to certain claims in Nintendo's granted patent. These claims broadly reference controlling a player character on a field in a virtual space based on movement input; causing a sub-character to appear on the field based on input; using a sub-character to battle an enemy placed in the same location based on input; placing a sub-character into an unoccupied location and having its movements controlled automatically, plus situations where battling unfolds automatically.
</p>
<p>
However, Squires' order specifically cites two earlier patents - one filed by Konami in 2002, the other by Nintendo in 2019 - both relating to the manual and automatic control of players and sub-characters in a virtual field and in battle. "Therefore," the order continues, "a reasonable examiner would consider [the patents] to be important in deciding whether the claims are patentable, and [each] raises a substantial new question of patentability."
</p><p>
Games Fray notes Squires' order (seemingly the first such re-examination order since 2012) doesn't automatically mean Nintendo's patent will be revoked, but it does make it "highly likely" this will occur. Nintendo has two months to respond to the order, and third parties are also able to present their own challenges within that timeframe.
</p>
<p>
All this follows the Japan Patent Office's recent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-palworld-triumph-over-pokemon-in-lawsuit-japans-rejection-of-nintendo-patent-might-make-things-more-interesting">reject an application filed by Nintendo in March last year</a> - attempting to patent certain capture and item-throwing mechanics - on the grounds "claimed invention(s)" already existed "in Japan or other foreign countries prior to the filing of the patent application". The rejection - which isn't final - was based on documentation provided by an unnamed third-party (believed to be Palworld developer Pocketpair) pointing to instances of similar mechanics existing prior to the filing in games such as Monster Hunter 4, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched its controversial lawsuit against Pocketpair last year</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month">Palworld's wildly successful launch</a>, accusing the studio of infringing "multiple" patents. In response, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight the legal action</a>, saying it wanted to ensure small studios could not be "hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".

			<p>Today is November 4, 2025, making it officially one month until the release of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. A game we've been waiting on for years now is a few short weeks, days, away from being in the hands of players on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, and its latest gameplay trailer feels like it is meeting the moment.</p>



<p>The new "<em>Survive</em>" trailer showcases more of the new world players will explore in Metroid Prime 4, but mostly shows off the new enemies and dark challenges Samus will face.</p>



<p>With a few undeniably cool shots of Samus <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-vi-o-la-motorcycle-details/">on her new motorcycle for good measure.</a></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition – Survive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3fN5zFkeA4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Metroid Prime 4 arrives on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 devices in a month's time, on Switch 2 it'll be playable at 4K/60 FPS, or at 1080p/120 FPS. It'll be the latest cross-generation release from Nintendo that'll likely highlight just how far behind the OG Switch is compared to the Switch 2, though hopefully that doesn't mean it's a mess on the OG Switch.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4 was first announced in 2017, and two years after that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/">development was completely rebooted</a>. Nintendo started from scratch, and now, almost a decade later, we're finally going to see what all the waiting was for.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Nathan Birch previewed the game earlier this year,</a> he wrote, "<em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way</em>."</p>

                <p>The next big addition to Fortnite generated some big complaints, but fortunately, you can raise those directly at developer Epic Games in a new survey from the studio.</p><p>With the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">mini-season based on The Simpsons</a> comes the debut of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-will-let-you-buy-pet-sidekicks-next-month/1100-6535822/" data-ref-id="1100-6535822">Sidekicks, adorable pets that accompany you</a> (and offer no gameplay advantage) on your battle royale bouts. But a closer look at the fine print reveals that the base appearance of these cute cosmetic creatures can only be customized once they have been obtained.</p><p>That means if you purchase a Sidekick from the Fortnite item shop, you only get one chance to determine its basic look, and you won't be able to change it afterward. If you want the same Sidekick but with, say, a different fur color, you'll have to buy it again. You can change the names of your Sidekicks at any time, however. Players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1ok0yco/sidekicks_sound_fun_until_you_read_the_fine_print/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leveled complaints online</a>, accusing Epic Games of greed.</p><p>A new <a href="https://epicgames.questionpro.com/a/TakeSurvey?tt=B4iH6pExGWwECHrPeIW9eQ==" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">survey from Epic Games</a> sent to players addresses this point head-on, explicitly asking participants about their familiarity with Sidekicks and how they feel about having to buy an entirely new Sidekick for different basic features. Survey participants can only answer through multiple-choice bubbles, with responses ranging from "Strongly Dislike" to "Strongly Like."</p><p>From a certain perspective, having the basic appearance of Sidekicks is somewhat logical--you can't just change how your real-life pet looks at any time, and their base features are forever part of their identity. On the other hand, Fortnite is a video game, and players desire to do whatever the heck they want. Plenty of games let you change your physical appearance at any time.</p><p>Sidekicks will be available in the item store starting November 7, costing 1,200 or 1,500 V-Bucks, which is around $10 to $13.50 USD. They'll include a dog named Spike and a raptor named, uh, Lil' Raptor.</p><p>Until then, the only Sidekick you can obtain is the banana-like puppy Peels, who you can earn through unlocking the current battle pass. Peels comes with its own progression track that includes outfits, accessories, and emotes.</p><p>This mini-season of Fortnite lasts until November 29, after which the battle royale's Chapter 7--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-teasers-hint-at-kill-bill-collaboration/1100-6535910/" data-ref-id="1100-6535910">rumored to include a Kill Bill collaboration</a> -- commences.</p>

                <p>Nintendo's litigation against <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair is becoming increasingly complicated by the day, with one recent patent granted to the Pokemon franchise now under review by the United States.</p><p>According to <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new Games Fray report</a>, the new head of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), John A. Squires, has ordered a reexamination of Nintendo’s <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US12403397B2/en?oq=12%2C403%2C397" rel="nofollow ">Patent No. 12,403,397</a>. Filed in January 2023, granted to Nintendo in September 2025, and dubbed the '397 patent, the listing is oftentimes oversimplified to "summoning characters and making them fight." It's for this reason that Squires's office is seeking to determine if such a feature is even patentable.</p><p>"I have determined that substantial new questions of patentability have arisen as to claims 1, 13, 25, and 26 of U.S. Patent No. 12,403,397 B2 (the '397 patent')," Squires wrote in his order, citing two older applications filed by Konami in 2002 (Yabe) and Nintendo in 2019 (Taura) as justification for the patent's reexamination. "Thus, a reasonable examiner would consider each of Yabe and Taura to be important in deciding whether the claims are patentable, and Yabe and Taura each raise a substantial new question of patentability. I hereby order [the] reexamination of the '397 patent."</p><p>Konami's Yabe patent revolves around a sub-character battling with you either automatically or manually. Nintendo's Taura patent refers to the same thing.</p><p>So, in Squires's view, Nintendo's '397 patent doesn't constitute <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-argues-game-mods-arent-prior-art-in-palworld-lawsuit/1100-6534882/" data-ref-id="1100-6534882">the "prior art" argument</a> the company put forth against Palworld because games that came out before the patent was filed and awarded contradict that. The "summon character and let it fight" mechanic is an oversimplification of the patent's language, with The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/779062/nintendo-pokemon-summoning-battle-patent" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">describing</a> it as closer to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/" data-ref-id="5000-559213">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's</a> "auto-battling" system. However, with other games like the Digimon franchise, the Persona series, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> letting you summon characters that fight alongside you, Squires wants to relitigate what exactly is patentable in the first place.</p><p>Nintendo has two months to respond to the USPTO's order. Games Fray believes there may not be any more legal developments this year, but decisions are expected to be made next year, with presiding judge and leader of Tokyo District Court's patent division, Motoyuki Nakashima, being closely watched for a ruling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a331f14a956ca"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a331f14a956ca/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The world of video games hasn't provided much respite from global issues recently, not for those of us who love games and the people who make them. The issues facing the industry and players post-COVID — including mass layoffs, cancelled projects, questionable acquisitions, the encroachment of generative AI, rising prices, an unstable economy and a cost-of-living crisis — mean it's easy to assume there's no going back.</p>
<p>But just when you catch yourself pondering whether the good ol' days of games as an artistic medium and pastime are numbered, just when it looks like we're hurtling down a F2P, games-as-a-service slide greased with AI-generated turds, Nintendo goes and proves that there's life in the old console model yet.</p>
<p>All the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">hardware numbers following launch</a> have been encouraging, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">today's financial results</a> give a much better picture of Switch 2's status, including figures from its first full quarter on the market. Any console from the big platform holders would be expected to sell well early doors, but numbers from July to September have maintained good momentum throughout a summer period where sales traditionally dry up in the biggest gaming territories.</p>
<p>To recap, Switch 2 has sold 10.36 million units since launch, causing the company to bump up its first-year sales forecast from 15 to 19 million ahead of the holidays. Software forecasts have also been bumped from 45 to 48 million.</p>
<figure data-uuid="061603600aafb"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/061603600aafb/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193371 @ 1762281054 -->
<p>As you might expect, especially when its successor offers very broad backwards compatibility with performance improvements, Switch 1 numbers have plummeted 60% year-on-year. Yet 1.89 million isn't a bad figure either, and Nintendo still thinks it can sell 4 million OG Switches this financial year, half a million fewer than previous forecasts. Switch 1 is just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">10,000 units away from DS' all-time console record</a>, with only the PS2 ahead of that. And despite the hardware decline, S1 software forecasts have gone up by 20 million to 125 million. More positive news for Nintendo's accountants.</p>
<p>Games-wise, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle worked wonders (with most people presumably avoiding the $80 standalone price), with 9.57 million copies of the game out there as of 30th September. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold 3.49 million units to date. Not Mario Kart numbers, but healthy for a non-bundled release; around a third of all Switch 2 owners also have a copy of DKB. It's never going to trouble MKW's current, colossal 92% attach rate, but the ape is holding his own.</p>
<figure data-uuid="931c4e78e3c32"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/931c4e78e3c32/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>High prices and uncertainty in the US made it a tricky launch; with Microsoft and Sony increasing hardware prices this year, Nintendo had a tricky needle to thread with its pricing. But despite the hashtags and general dismay at an $80 Mario Kart — at present, Nintendo's only non-NS2 Edition game at that price point — and increased accessory costs, the numbers speak for themselves. They threaded that needle well enough.</p>
<p>The system could have been rushed out last year, but again, holding back and stockpiling hardware to satisfy demand has paid dividends, with the ball rolling nicely over the summer months. Despite industry trends and suboptimal circumstances, Nintendo has proved that the market is still there, the appetite still healthy. People <em>are</em> still willing to pay for quality. The slow and steady approach has paid off. The strategy is working.</p>
<p>The third-party support has been excellent, too. Sure, multiplatform gamers may have played a lot of these games before, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a> discontent is real, but looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-best-nintendo-switch-2-games">the best games on Switch 2 so far</a>, 'old' games or otherwise, the quality is undeniable.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ecc82dfd0fd1"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ecc82dfd0fd1/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wider problems with the games industry surround us still. While PS5 is selling well, Sony's hardly had the most exciting generation, benefiting as Microsoft lurches between <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/price-increases-are-never-fun-for-anybody-says-xbox-exec-defending-game-pass-changes">PR disasters</a> and makes Xbox a less viable option by the day. Price increases across the board, however, seem to be making the value proposition of gaming hardware and subscription services worse all the time.</p>
<p>Yet here's Nintendo putting out a little tablet console that, against the odds, is tracking very favourably with its trailblazing predecessor. Switch 2 certainly isn't cheap, and it's arguably still lacking its truly killer app, its 'I <em>must</em> own a Switch 2 to play Game X!' Mario Kart was a great opening salvo. Bananza is brilliant, but it's not a Mario. Switch 2 doesn't have its Breath of the Wild yet. (In fact, you could argue that, weirdly, Switch 2's BOTW <em>is</em> BOTW, but that's another article.)</p>
<p>What it does offer, though, has been enough for more-than-enough people. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go">The launch had its stresses</a>, but Nintendo has maintained the momentum beyond that opening month and is very well-placed to get stuck in over the holidays and into the new year with a packed and varied lineup. Next quarter's results — the October-November-December crop — will include figures for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>.</p>
<p>That's four brand new games, including two S2 exclusives, and we already know that Pokémon had a monster-sized launch, scoring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-scored-us-biggest-physical-game-launch-since-totk">the US' biggest physical launch since</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Packed, varied, and super effective indeed - and that's just the first-party-published stuff.</p>
<figure data-uuid="41c00c3939cc3"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/41c00c3939cc3/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the past few months, I've pondered if peppering umpteen NS2 Edition upgrades between its brand new S2 exclusives would be enough to get people on board and sufficiently excited to splash out on a pricey console, despite the pent-up desire for something new. For all the buzz, the next Animal Crossing is, well, the 'old' Animal Crossing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">with some Bells and whistles</a>. Will that be enough? Will the inevitable 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Hyper Fighting Dash Dojo EX' keep this ball rolling?</p>
<p>All evidence points to 'Yes, absolutely.' Well played, Nintendo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has announced the first batch of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the month of November 2025, with the big ticket of the month being Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is only available to PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, but will still undoubtedly make the biggest splash.</p>



<p>Surrounding Call of Duty is a slew of indie games, almost like Xbox didn't want to go out and grab anything too major for November for fear of overshadowing its golden goose. That's just some joking speculation, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-far-behind-battlefield-6-pre-order-sales/">it would be difficult for any game, no matter how big, to overshadow a Call of Duty release</a>.</p>



<p>That said, the games you'll be able to check out on Xbox Game Pass include Pigeon Simulator, a game where you play as a pigeon that is a member of a top-secret unit that has orders to deal with dangerous anomalies harming New Squawk City. Winter Burrow is a woodland survival game where you play as a mouse coming back home for the winter. Dead Static Drive is an indie survival horror game with Eldritch themes while carrying a spooky tone underneath it all.</p>



<p>All of those games, along with Black Ops 7, are available on their launch days, and as day one releases are only available to those at the Game Pass Ultimate tier.</p>



<p>For those not at the top tier, you'll be able to add Sniper Elite: Resistance, Voidtrain, Great God Grove, and Lara Craft and the Temple of Osiris to your gaming time this month.</p>



<p>Here's a full list of what's coming to Xbox Game Pass in November 2025, and which tiers they'll all be available for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dead Static Drive - November 5 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Sniper Elite: Resistance - November 5 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Egging On - November 6 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Whiskerwood - November 6 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>

<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - November 14 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, with games entering the subscription service, there are games leaving. This month, five games will leave the service, a couple of them being major departures. The departures are:</p>



<ul>

              <p>The computer role-playing game, most widely known as the RPG, turns 50 today! Well, as close as we can pin it, anyway. Happy birthday, RPGs!</p> <p>In 1974, the year <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> began publication, a couple of guys at Southern Illinois University called Gary Whisenhunt and Ray Wood became interested in programming in the TUTOR language for the educational computer system PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations). PLATO was kind of extraordinary: a network of around a dozen mainframe computers running processes for several thousand terminals around the world. And like all educational devices, the University of Illinois’ PLATO was frequently misused by students, in this case to create a role-playing game on that proto-internet. That game was to be <em>The Game of Dungeons</em>, more commonly known—because of its filename—as <em>dnd.</em></p> <p>In 1975, a University of Illinois resident called Rusty Rutherford—aware of the as-yet unfinished <em>dnd</em> but not involved—spent a handful of weeks creating his own RPG for PLATO. His was called <em>The Dungeon</em>, but again due to filenames became known as <em>pedit5</em>. Due to the speed with which Rutherford worked, <em>pedit5</em> would release first, and as such take the mantle of the first-ever RPG.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, at the Claremont University Center in California, student Don Daglow (the person responsible for the first-ever baseball game in 1971, <em>Baseball</em>, and the first-ever RTS game in 1981, <em>Utopia</em>) worked on a game for the DEC mainframe computer, the PDP-10, also based on 1974’s breakout pen-and-paper hit <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. It was called—wait for it—<em>Dungeon</em>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_(video_game)">Wikipedia</a>, it’s unknown whether the game released in 1975 or 1976, but given Daglow’s propensity for being first to genres, the former seems more likely. (He also made the first MMO in 1991, <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>.)</p>

 <p>Oh, and on November 4, 1975, another PLATO-based RPG—this time multiplayer—was released by John D. Daleske and Gary Fritz among others, with the groundbreaking title of…<em>Dungeon</em>.</p> <p>So whether&nbsp;<em>The Game of Dungeons</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon,</em> or&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> was first, what we know for sure is that they appeared in 1975, 50 years ago, and one of them on this exact day. Which is plenty of reason to mark today as the day to celebrate the birth of the genre.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641119"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641119">© John D. Daleske et al</figcaption></figure> <p>It seems to be generally accepted that Rutherford’s&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em> was the very first of them all, a game about wandering through a single floor of a dungeon while doing the two most important RPG things: killing monsters and collecting treasure. There were spells to cast, with randomly generated enemies and loot, and a battle and leveling system based on the rules of the brand new <em>D&amp;D</em>. It was all there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162725/http://armchairarcade.com/neo/node/1948">albeit limited to around 50 rooms and only 20 stored characters across the whole network</a>, due to the hefty limitations of the system. That name, <em>pedit5</em>, <a href="https://insight.ieeeusa.org/articles/going-rogue-a-brief-history-of-the-computerized-dungeon-crawl/">came from the area in which the code was stored</a>, sectioned off for Rutherford’s department of the Population and Energy Group. The group had five slots, the first three used for relevant programming, while the fifth stored&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em> and the fourth contained its manual. As a result, the university naturally deleted this frippery to make room for “proper” programs, but Rutherford persistently re-added it.</p>

  <p><em>dnd</em>, meanwhile, was a story as old as time: a game with large ambitions that was thus delayed and scaled back before eventually being “released.” The intention had been for the game to be a graphical multi-user dungeon (MUD), but this was never achieved, and the game eventually emerged as a more complex version of&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>. From my reading, there appears to be a fair amount of confusion over whether developers Whisenhunt and Wood created their game contemporaneously with&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>, or whether it eventually became an embellished version of the earlier game. Either way,&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> offered a multi-layer dungeon called Whisenwood, in which players sought a mystical Grail and Orb. Once again, it merrily ripped off <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ core rules, leveling and spells, although didn’t feature <em>pedit5</em>‘s randomization. But it also boasts two extremely important firsts of its very own.</p>

 <p>The first first for&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> is nonlinearity: Players were able to return to previously explored levels, approaching the game in their own preferred order, relying on the fixed position of enemies and items to let the computer network to store all that data. The second first, and perhaps the more significant, is that this was the first game to feature a boss encounter. Heck, this post could easily have been titled “Happy 50th Birthday, Boss Fights.” Each dungeon’s exit was guarded by a high-level monster, including the Golden Dragon that protected the Orb.</p>

 <p>Then, come November 4, we get the release of the PLATO network’s&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> which,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/101218/dungeon/">according to <em>Mobygames</em>,</a> is considered one of the first-ever MUD games. However, there’s a weirdly small amount of information out there about this one other than that, none of which supports its being multiplayer. The <a href="https://crpgadventures.blogspot.com/2014/08/dungeon-1975.html">wonderful obsessives over at&nbsp;<em>CRPG Adventures</em></a> have been similarly stumped, unable to get it running at all.&nbsp;<a href="https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2021/06/brief-everything-we-know-about-1970s.html"><em>CRPG Addict</em> also had no joy</a>, finding the game missing from many retrospectives, but noting that it was <a href="https://www.daleske.com/plato/plato-games.php">marked by co-creator Daleske</a> as “incomplete,” and also as a “predecessor to <em>Moria.”&nbsp;</em>That would appear to be 1975’s PLATO <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/100905/moria/"><em>Moria</em></a> by Kevet Duncombe and Jim Battin, yet another RPG from that year, but this one able to have ten players joining in together. It was played in the most basic form of first-person you can imagine, but that’s enough for it to claim the title of first 3D RPG! All in that same year!</p>  <p>Obviously none of these games were technically “released,” instead being stored on university servers and spread by word-of-mouth among students and staff. This had been the case since the early 1970s, with text-based adventures already proving popular on the same systems. Others took over development of some of the games mentioned above, elaborating on them through the late ’70s as the technology improved, but it wouldn’t be until 1980 and the arrival of <em>Rogue</em> as a commercial product that anything like an RPG could be considered as becoming mainstream as opposed to mainframe.</p> <p>But it remains undeniable that 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of the RPG as a computer game, and with&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> (PLATO)’s November 4 release, today as good as any date on which to recognize it.</p> <p>Happy birthday, RPGs! 50 years old and still one of the most popular types of games on the planet. From <i>dnd </i>to&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the impact of the <em>D&amp;D</em>-inspired genre on video games cannot be overstated.</p>

data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers we spoke with described different scenarios where key decision makers did not understand the nitty-gritty details of making games. 3D rigger Sol Brennan said they've witnessed experienced leads decide to skip the "grey-boxing" step of level design and dive straight into art production, not recognizing how much of that work would need to be redone whenever a necessary change came to the level design.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a

- Game Developer Podcast Ep. 55</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, an anonymous game designer said they worked under project leads with outdated expectations of the development process </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> leads with zero experience at all. This designer described how at multiple studios, project leads would approve content to go in production, then throw it out after review, sometimes just because they'd become bored with playing it over and over again.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They called it "circular iteration," as often the final content would be so similar to discarded earlier versions. These leads were also the most likely to be irritated when encountering bugs in a build, seeming to forget they would be hopefully removed in the final version.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They sometimes demanded extra work because they couldn't picture what their colleagues were pitching them. "Frequently, management staff don't come from dev backgrounds and won't be able to understand what they see unless it looks like a final game," explained producer Masao Kobayashi. To appease these leaders, developers produce what he called "fancy concept art and highly-polished, super early demos."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Usually all of this is fake and is thrown out as soon as it is made," he said. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-">As we noted last time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, ever-improving graphical fidelity standards have made this a more lengthy process—and time spent on that wasted content is time not spent on making the final game.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kobayashi also said that across the multiple games he's shipped, leaders often have poor understanding of project timelines and departmental dependencies—the kind that can leave some teams spinning their tires while others are overwhelmed by poorly-scoped tasks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Failure to trust employees">Failure to trust employees</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An anonymous game writer we spoke with said that across their work in triple-A games, double-A games, and indie games, it was leadership on triple-A games that seemed to actively distrust their employees. They described one big-budget project where every department needed sign-off on their work not just from department leads, but leads from departments who had little-to-no experience on the work they were reviewing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whenever these leads couldn't come to a consensus, it led to weeks of work hanging in limbo, as these individuals were (justifiably) busy and difficult to get in the same room at the same time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This to me was a lack of trust in the people who worked for them," they said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The industry's dismissive attitude towards quality assurance as a discipline can also lead to leaders ignoring colleagues who are the first to ring the alarm bell. Community manager and QA specialist Rose Whitcomb recalled a project where developers deprioritized bugs centered around less popular selectable characters. "The dev played into community favorites and would prioritize those while directing QA to focus on them despite the piling issues for the others," she said. Some of these bugs triggered hard crashes when underplayed characters were paired together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then the game launched—after those under-loved characters had been improved and were more likely to be selected for missions. The team lost precious time hotfixing an issue that could have been cleared up months before.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Treating developers as interchangeable">Treating developers as interchangeable</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time and again, Kobayashi and the other employees we spoke with watched their employers greenlight games or shift direction solely on the basis of what was commercially successful in the last quarter. Setting aside the fact these games weren't as safe a bet as companies believed, they also were dangerous projects because studio leads didn't understand their employees may have little-to-no experience in the new genre they were chasing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, developers used to family-friendly platformers can't quickly pivot to making a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like MOBA. MOBA developers may struggle to understand third-person "hero shooters," even if there's design overlap. And developers experienced with hero shooters may struggle when working on family-friendly platformers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studio leads might also dig their heels in when it comes to refusing pay or promoting key employees, observed Brennan. That refusal would come back to haunt the team when said employees when searching for better-paying jobs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That interchangeability gets worse when you consider what happens when developers leave the studio—either as a result of being laid off or because they received a better offer at a competitor. This phenomenon is only growing more frequent as studios rely on external development studios like Keywords or Virtuos, said Kobayashi. "With the massive layoffs and increased reliance on external co-dev partners, these previously-solved problems became novel problems that cost more and take more time to solve," he said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The failure of slow decision-making">The failure of slow decision-making</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another anonymous developer recalled their experience making games in the 2000s where for unexplained reasons, their department lead was incapable of making decisions. "He was confoundingly incapable of making decisions," this developer recalled. If the team presented this lead with three options—all equally executable—it would sometimes take them months to make a final call.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What was this unnamed team lead doing while his team waited in frustration? Apparently obsessing over minor details of the game's story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This trait can be another consequence of top-heavy approvals process like the kind discussed by the anonymous game writer. Even if individual leads can make decisions on a feature, the requirement for consensus bogs down the project. Whether it's one person or a committee—the refusal to make a decision can have massive downstream effects on development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Providing useless or unclear feedback">Providing useless or unclear feedback</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers we spoke with said one of the most frustrating moments they encountered was when their leads criticized their work, but offered vague guidance on how to improve it.

On the team culture level, the developers we spoke with described how "no-crunch" policies began driving conflict between developers when some workers would be vigilant about their work hours while others pushed into overtime. Not only did they see some colleagues express resentment for their decision to leave on time, they felt pressure from leadership to crunch anyway despite stated policy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Companies that employ hourly workers can create a codified version of this by capping out the number of workable hours.

And there is no one way to improve leadership across the video game industry. Sometimes educating how much power a small group of individuals can have over the project will clear mid-development blockers. In other occasions, leaders who plan early and stick to decisions made early in the process, changing course only when needed, can turn studios into game-making powerhouses. Change what "power" means in game development, and you can change what it "reveals" about those who hold it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are those in leadership who, when given power, will always reveal themselves to be unworthy of it.

		<p>Nintendo has dropped a new trailer for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and called it Survive, showing snippets of combat gameplay in different scenarios including on the motorbike. Samus Aran is on the planet Viewros which is home to strange creatures and the remnants of an ancient race. Without further ado, here’s the new trailer.</p>

<p>Back in April, we went hands of with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, saying, <em>“For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.”</em></p>
<p>You can watch our video preview too.</p>

			<p>In Ninja Gaiden 4, Yakumo can use, at the end of the campaign, five different weapons all coming with unique properties and attacks, which are further expanded by their Bloodraven forms.While all of these weapons have their own unique uses, and are fully viable to complete the game at any difficulty, using some of them is going to make your life much easier. Here are the best of them.</p>

<h2 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Dark Dragon Blade is the best weapon in Ninja Gaiden 4</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-dark-dragon-blade">Dark Dragon Blade</h3>



<p>The Dark Dragon Blade is undoubtedly the <strong>overall best weapon</strong> Yakumo can use. Its damage output is only slightly lower than Ryu's Dragon Blade, but it combines that power with exceptional <strong>ease of use</strong> and high utility.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Damage &amp; Speed:</strong> Features very high base damage and one of the fastest light attacks in its Bloodraven/Shadow-gleam form.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Utility &amp; Crowd Control:</strong> Offers great utility with its circle motion input skills. Has an unblockable launcher to easily set up <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Izuna Drops</strong> and a powerful area-of-effect (AOE) ranged attack (B/Circle) in Shadow-gleam mode.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Defense:</strong> The fast Shadow-gleam form light attack can reliably stop most Power Attacks, making it excellent for boss battles as well.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> The only true downside is the time required to unlock it, as you<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/ninja-gaiden-ultimate-guide-dark-dragon-blade-unlock/"> must complete the game once and clear all of the Boss Trials challenges</a>. This effort, however, is well worth it.</p>



<h3 id="h-kage-hiruko">Kage-Hiruko</h3>



<p>Being the only ranged weapon in the game, the Kage-Hiruko grants great long-range combat capabilities that are extremely effective in the hands of expert players.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ranged &amp; Launchers:</strong> Excellent for long-range engagements and features a wealth of launcher attacks, including a quick light-heavy attack (X/Square - Y/Triangle) laucher string.</li>



<li><strong>Unique</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Flying Swallow:</strong> Has a unique version of the ever-useful Flying Swallow technique that also functions as a launcher.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Excellent Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The Nocturnal Rain AOE attack (A/Cross - X/Square) is massively useful, launching multiple enemies in a wide radius. The fast Bloodraven form light attack is perfect for stopping Power Attacks and break guards at all ranges.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">:</strong> The Kage-Hiruko loses out to the Dark Dragon Blade due to lower damage and moveset complexity.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Takeminakata twin blades are balanced weapons that hold their own at any difficulty level</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-takeminakata"><strong>Takeminakata</strong></h3>



<p>The twin blades are Yakumo's starting weapon, but they should absolutely not be dismissed. While their damage output is only acceptable, the weapon's strength lies in its <strong>incredible versatility and utility</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Provides quick access to multiple launchers and a handy area-of-effect (AOE) attack (circle motion - Y/Triangle).</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Offers amazing crowd control in Bloodraven Form. This includes the two heavy aerial attacks, which are easier to charge than ground attacks, and the Rising Stance: Spin technique (A/Cross - X/Square), which can decimate multiple enemies in a single strike while in Berserk State.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides</strong>: While utility trumps damage, the Takeminakata's lower damage makes it a less reliable choice at high difficulty levels, where fights must be ended quickly.</p>



<h3 id="h-magatsuhi">Magatsuhi</h3>



<p>Heavily reminiscent of the glorious Lunar Staff in Ninja Gaiden 2, the Magatsuhi staff is a solid weapon that deals <strong>good damage</strong> via its ground multi-hit combos.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Thanks to the staff's hitboxes, these combos work well as crowd control attacks, hitting enemies behind and to the sides of Yakumo, making it invaluable against enemies that swarm Yakumo in greater numbers.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The massive hammer into which the staff turns into in Bloodraven mode has surprisingly fast and strong attacks. By pressing A/Cross, Yakumo can also launch high in the air to escape pressure and unleash damaging downward AOE attacks.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong>: The Magatsuhi staff doesn't have easy access to a basic launcher attacker, mostly forcing a grounded playstyle. Its most damaging combos also require long execution times which are often interrupted at Hard and Master Ninja difficulties.</p>



<h2 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Yatousen isn't a bad weapon, but every other weapon in the game does what it does, and better</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-yatousen">Yatousen</h3>



<p>The Yatousen rapier is an interesting weapon characterized by its exceptional <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mobility and speed</strong>. However, its overall usability is extremely limited by a few core design conflicts.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Mobility: Many of the Yatousen combos have great mobility, which can help Yakumo get out of danger while keeping up the pressure</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides:</strong> The lack of a quick launcher to set up Izuna Drops, the low attack power in base form and the limitations of Bloodraven form, which requires Yakumo to stand still to deal max damage in any combo string, make it a situational weapon that works best against bosses only in Bloodraven form.</p>

              <p>Those familiar with Nintendo are likely aware of the company’s litigious proclivities (that is, except when <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222">a certain governmental body is using its intellectual property</a> to promote the brutalization of human beings). And <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">scoring a patent for summoning monsters</a> and having them fight on your behalf, known as the “397 patent,” was an essential victory in Nintendo’s battle against “<i>Pokémon</i> with guns” survival game <i>Palworld</i>. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/5-game-mechanics-legally-protected-by-the-companies-that-made-them/">Patenting a game mechanic</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/5-game-mechanics-legally-protected-by-the-companies-that-made-them/">is nothing new</a>, but this particular patent has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patent-pocketpair-court-2000640115">regarded by many as, well, <i>absurd</i></a>, and acquiring it hasn’t exactly been the victory the Pokémon Company seems to have been hoping for in its quest to deal <i>Palworld</i> an irreversible loss.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patent-pocketpair-court-2000640115">Nintendo Was Just Dealt A Big Blow In Its Battle Against <i>Palworld</i></a></p> <p>Joining the chorus of folks saying “this is silly” is Trump nominee John A. Squires, director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-patent-office-boss-orders-reexamination-of-nintendos-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-which-ip-lawyer-claims-further-undermines-credibility-of-its-case-against-palworld">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). Squires has highlighted two older patent applications from Konami and Nintendo as “prior art” that might invalidate Nintendo’s claim to owning the concept this particular patent focuses on. As a result, Squires has ordered the merits of the controversial 397 Patent to be reconsidered.</p>

 <p>It doesn’t look good for Nintendo’s aggressive efforts.</p> <p>Some, such as <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/"><i>Games Fray</i>’s Florian Mueller</a>, are describing this move by Squires as a major loss for the company. As Mueller notes, Squires has not ordered the patent to be yanked. Reexamination orders, according to Mueller, “can result in a patent being upheld.” But this specific <i>Pokemon</i> case seems unlikely to be one of those situations. Nintendo has two months to respond to the reexamination, and in that time other companies are free to challenge the merits of the patent.</p> <p>These days it feels hopeless to expect any sort of fairness or equitable decision-making to come out of the federal government, but it seems like, at the very least, Nintendo’s power grab might be reined in.</p>

<p>We’d like to think that everyone regularly showers to keep clean and healthy. While you may be sitting down for long Battlefield 6 sessions, we should be keeping that shower active. Players are reportedly being told by Battlefield 6 itself to take a shower, with the keyword being ‘reportedly.’</p>



<p>It can be hard to take anything for granted at face value in 2025. The overwhelming influx of AI means that so much of what we see online is up for debate. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-ps4-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> is an excellent shooter, and it’s easy to lose yourself, as Eminem once told us. But you definitely shouldn’t miss your opportunity to go outside, touch some grass, and keep on top of your personal hygiene!</p>



<p>Allegedly, EA is reminding you that this is the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-battlefield-6-s-take-a-shower-screen">What Is Battlefield 6’s ‘Take A Shower’ Screen?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>To stink or not to stink, that is the question. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An image circulated on social media of a Battlefield 6 player’s screen featuring a simple message: “Take a shower.” They were allegedly banned for a “few hours” as a result.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the alleged Battlefield 6 in-game message in its entirety:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Take A Shower. You have been playing for 16 hours straight we cannot allow you to continue on Battlefield 6 servers. We have restricted your account for a few hours please take a break. We have an obligation to keep our players and community safe. This ban is only temporary polease try again soon.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This would be quite an unprecedented message from a developer to stop the community from enjoying their game. Still, because the image is out there, it’s raising questions about its legitimacy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-s-take-a-shower-screen-real-or-ai">Is Battlefield 6’s Take A Shower Screen Real Or AI?</h2>



<p><strong>We can’t officially confirm if the message is fake, but all signs and evidence point to the Take A Shower screen being a semi-convincing case of Photoshop or AI.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, we haven’t had a single session of Battlefield 6 for 16 hours or more. Officially, we can’t debunk this. But there are several factors that should reinforce that this isn’t a real image.</p>



<h3 id="h-grammar">Grammar</h3>



<p>Where do we even start with the grammar? There’s a random space before “You” begins the paragraph, there are missing commas galore, and the sentence’s construction feels very sloppy and inorganic.</p>



<h3 id="h-qr-code">QR Code</h3>



<p>Quite simply, the QR Code doesn’t work. That’s about as big a telltale sign as you need, really. Unless our device was malfunctioning when we tried to scan it, it highlights that this image probably isn’t real.</p>



<h3 id="h-restricted-button">Restricted Button</h3>



<p>We’ve allegedly been told about the ban, why it’s happened, and that you can’t play anymore. It makes sense to have a “Quit” button, so why would there be a “Restricted” option? It reeks of an AI prompt that hasn’t fully grasped the initial request.</p>



<p>Feel free to make up your mind on the Take A Shower Screen. We don’t advise this, but if you desperately need clarification, there’s an easy way to test this: Either play the game for over 16 hours, or keep it running for that time.</p>



<p>If you manage to do any of this, let us know. Send us a picture, or go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, so we can solve this bizarre mystery once and for all!</p>

                <p>One of the most terrifying things you'll ever see in life is a fresh ding or a scrape on your car, but Wreckfest 2 developer Bugbear Entertainment is embracing this horror with the next update for the game. Whereas other car games allow you to create four-wheeled art with their livery editors, Bugbear is instead focusing on hurting the resale value of your digital jalopy with its car editor, fittingly dubbed the "CRAP-IT" toolset.</p><p>As demonstrated in the video below, you can create crimes against pixels by ruining the body of your car with bumps, watch the paintwork decay as rust sets in, and make car collectors lament the fate of your vehicle when you attempt to cover up the damage with badly placed decals.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hWHQ2GpVjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-hWHQ2GpVjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to the new feature that allows you to craft your very own car culture sins, the update has also improved the game's tire physics--"boing"--introduced faster loading times, added a new track called Crash Canyon 2.0, and introduced a new car in the form of a Volkswagen Beatle--an awful vehicle that deserves to feel the full force of the CRAP-IT system.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wreckfest-2-will-bring-its-penchant-for-destruction-to-early-access-in-march/1100-6529218/">The early-access journey for Wreckfest 2</a> kicked off in March this year, and the game is scheduled to be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S eventually. The original Wreckfest was a big hit with racing-game fans thanks to its impressive damage models at the time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wreckfest-2-officially-revealed-with-road-rage-fueled-trailer/1100-6525492/">and the sequel was first unveiled in August 2024</a> with a road-rage-fueled trailer during the THQ Showcase.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has unveiled a new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond trailer titled Survive, showcasing what awaits Samus Aran on the planet Viewros. The roughly 70-second video features the bounty hunter's gunship in aerial combat and a pretty slick motorcycle move by Samus that's an homage to <a href="https://x.com/GameSpot/status/1726305588693389790" rel="nofollow ">the Akira slide</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Metroid Prime 4 trailer--seen below--also highlights a variety of locales on the mysterious planet. Samus finds herself in a lush jungle, outside a spiky black building that would look at home in The Matrix, and what we can only assume is the obligatory lava area at one point. The bounty hunter also scans a new enemy mechanoid called a psy-bot soldier as well as fights the boss Aberax (previously highlighted during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/metroid-prime-4-beyond-17-minutes-of-official-gameplay-nintendo-switch-2/2300-6465874/">a Nintendo Treehouse stream</a>).</p>

Wowhead estimates Blizzard could have made around <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-likely-earned-over-15-million-with-a-single-mount-traders-gilded-361569" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$15 million</a> selling the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur, and if that's the case, it's hardly a surprise the developer would offer it up again for those who didn't bite the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">When the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur will return isn't clear at the moment, but it could make its way back to the in-game shop in time for WoW's 21st anniversary event that begins November 16. The datamine doesn't indicate what the mount might cost this time around, but it's hard to imagine it becoming cheaper, lest those who bought it the first time around feel like they've been tricked.</p><p dir="ltr">In other WoW micro (macro?) transaction news, another datamine indicates <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-looks-to-be-getting-a-new-premium-currency-for-housing/1100-6535888/" data-ref-id="1100-6535888">Blizzard will introduce a new premium currency for housing</a>.

<p>In addition to that historical retrospective and a 12-page Dragon Quest Reimagined cover story, which features my thoughts after playing the game for two hours alongside words from the game's various development leads, this issue is jam-packed with excellent features. Senior Associate Editor Marcus Stewart spoke with Edmund McMillan, the creator of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>, about his new game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>. Freelancer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/imluisgutierrez.bsky.social">Luis Joshua Gutierrez</a> plugged a hole in <em>Game Informer </em>coverage with an awesome look at the culture surrounding the mega-phenomenon that is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/05/17/five-nights-at-freddys-2-gets-december-2025-premiere-date">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>. The entire GI crew banded together to create a round-up of the best co-op games to play during the holidays!&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of holidays, Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller scoured storefronts to bring you 10 pages of great gifts for the gamers in your life. Elsewhere in this exciting issue, we have a look at the history of games that <em>Game Informer </em>has awarded the prestigious 10/10 review score (because this issue features a review for a game we gave a 10!), the top five dragon quests, a look at Riot's upcoming League of Legends card game, Riftbound, a look back at 2025 aka The Year of the Ninja, and even a post-launch <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> interview with Sucker Punch Prodcutions.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you haven't seen it yet, here's another look at the beautiful and vibrant Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover, which features Prince Keifer, Hero, and Maribel avoiding the gaze of a stone golem in the game's unique visual style, which is based on real-life dolls Square Enix created:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which shows off more gameplay for the game on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer, which can be watched below, showcases both in-game cinematics as well as gameplay segments. Combat, scanning, and navigation are displayed on the latest Nintendo console, as well as a small glimpse of the motorbike segments too.</p>
