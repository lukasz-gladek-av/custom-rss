            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has added prices to the online store pages for Nintendo Switch 2 Edition game upgrades in the UK, confirming that there will be multiple price points, depending on the games.</p>
<p>For more straightforward upgrades like Breath of the Wild, Nintendo will be charging £7.99 / €9.99 / $9.99, while Switch 2 Edition games that also gain a significant amount of DLC content, such as Kirby and the Forgotten Land will be priced at £16.99 / €19.99 and likely at $19.99 in the US.</p>


<p>The four games with live listings are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack</a> – £7.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack</a> – £7.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV </a><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html"> Upgrade Pack</a> – £16.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-2787773.html">Kirby and the Forgotten Land – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Upgrade Pack</a> – £16.99</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I feel like the worst effect that these Switch 2 upgrades has had is to make the game titles practically unreadable. Did the Super Mario Party Jamboree content really need to be called Jamboree TV again, and have a ‘Nintendo Switch 2 Edition’ sandwiched right in the middle of it? at least ‘Star-Crossed World’ sounds like a DLC expansion, but Jamboree TV sounds like the marketing department got lost mid title and wrote it again.</p>
<p>But you pay extra for those additional words, because they add a bunch of extra stuff to each game. Jamboree TV has new camera and Mouse-Con mini-games, while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/13/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-switch-2-edition-preview/">Star-Crossed World remixes the original game with new frozen world elements</a>.</p>

<p>Given this pricing, we would expect that future cross-gen Nintendo games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which has new graphics modes and mouse controls, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which is a more straightforward resolution and performance bump, will have a £8 price bump over the Nintendo Switch versions.</p>
<p>This also suggests that third parties will likely have a good bit of freedom to price upgrades how they see fit, especially as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo is also making free updates</a> for a number of games from the Switch back catalogue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/nintendo-clarify-that-physical-switch-2-editions-will-not-feature-download-codes/">Switch 2 Edition games will be sold as Switch 2 cartridges physically</a>, though it will likely be more cost effective to buy the Nintendo Switch version and then the upgrade separately, which will work with either digital or physical copies of each game. Kirby, for example, is priced at £66 all-in on the eShop, but would be £55 if you buy the Switch game from Argos for £38 and then upgrade.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-in-the-works-from-slapface-director.1172856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Horror work sim&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, and it'll star&nbsp;<em>Arrow</em>'s Willa Holland and&nbsp;<em>House of Cards</em>' Paul Sparks, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-willa-holland-paul-sparks-1236376119/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, the movie will be produced by Epic Pictures' horror label Dread, which is also the publisher of&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>via its gaming wing DreadXP. The company will co-produce the movie alongside Traverse Media.</p>

<p>Story-wise,&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>will proceed pretty much exactly as you'd expect it to if you've played the game. Holland will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as a mortuary assistant. Sparks will play her boss Raymond Delver, who Deadline describes as "a mentor, but also a potential threat".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-game-shot.jpg?itok=Igk2-TZ6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-game-shot.jpg?itok=YRHlwycb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than a straight adaptation, however, Deadline says the movie will serve as "a new chapter in the story that will expand on the game's world and mythology", so even if you've already played&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant</em>, you should still get something from this.</p>

<p>Helming the adaptation is Jeremiah Kipp, a director who's worked on horror properties before. Perhaps his most well-known project is&nbsp;<em>Slapface</em>, an indie horror movie from 2021 that won the Cinequest Film Festival's Audience Award.</p>

<p>Speaking to Deadline, Kipp said that he and&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>game creator Brian Clarke "respond to character-driven storytelling within a disturbing horror space" and that the movie's creation process has "organically felt like an expansion of [Clarke's] unique gameplay".</p>

<p>For his part, Clarke says he's "extremely fortunate" to see a&nbsp;<em>Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>movie to get made, and that he "can't wait for fans to see [the game] expand into new territory".</p>




<p><em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games to be getting film adaptations in the coming years. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow">an<i>&nbsp;</i><em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>movie</a> from producers Michael Bay and Sydney Sweeney, as well as Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">live-action&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie</a>&nbsp;and a film <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">based on Hazelight's hit&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>.</p>

			<p>Developer Heart Machine's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-preview-lo-fi-roguelite/">Hyper Light Breaker</a> launched at the top of the year in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/">Early Access</a>, and the studio has officially announced that its first major update, Buried Below, will arrive on <strong>April 29, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding what's new in the update, a new Breaker called Rondo will be added to the game, who comes with a new SyCom with two perks, a new crown called Maw, two new melee weapons, and new environments to run through, such as caves.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The rest of the major changes are quality-of-life updates and significant changes to the run structure. In a press release, Heart Machine calls it "<em>the most significant feature overhaul yet with a complete rework of the game's run structure</em>."</p>
<p>Players will now have one life per run, losing items in their inventory and resetting the Overgrowth when they die. Heart Machine says this change will allow the team to "better adjust difficulty and make the game easier to get into<em>&nbsp;but harder to master</em>."</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Along with this change comes a few new gameplay loops, including introducing more ways for players to leave the Overgrowth, SyComs following more of a class-like system with character customization being redesigned, and streamlining vendors and player inventory.</p>
<p>The final significant aspect of the update is an improved onboarding path. Once the update is live, first-time players will be thrown into a tutorial that will take them through the game's core mechanics and explain a few key aspects they'll need to know with Hyper Light Breaker. Heart Machine hopes that this new tutorial will be useful to first-time players and even returning players who may just want a refresher on the basics.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As part of the new update being revealed, Heart Machine is providing Wccftech 20 game keys to giveaway beginning&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, May 7, 2025</strong>, a week after the update will have gone live. Make sure to follow Wccftech's and Heart Machine's social channels to be prepared for the giveaway so you don't miss it.</p>

It was literally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-3-could-launch-as-early-as-2027-with-an-untitled-larger-scale-11-bit-game-planned-for-2029">only last week</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> announced a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> was on the way, even saying that it could have a release date "as early as 2027." Yet, here we are now, with the reveal of what it actually is. It's not Frostpunk 3, it's not a spinoff, it's Frostpunk 1886, a "reimagined" version of the original game. Yes, that basically just means that it's a remake, though it does sound like it's got a bit more going on from it than the original.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, Frostpunk 1886 is being made in Unreal Engine as opposed to 11 bit's homegrown Liquid Engine. For the most part that won't matter much to you or me, except for the fact that this version of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game will actually have mod support. This isn't something that was possible in the original game due to "technical limitations", says 11 bit in a press release.

<p>
11 bit also notes that this won't just be a visual upgrade, as there'll be new content, mechanics, laws, and even a new Purpose path. No details on what any of that new content will actually be, but it sounds like a reasonable amount effort was put into make sure they're not just selling you a remake of a game that won't even be a decade old by the time 1886 releases (11 bit reaffirmed that it's slated for a 2027 release date, and that development has already started).
</p>
<p>
Currently 11 bit are still working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>, which had a bit of a rocky start, though seems to be in a bit better shape these days. Oh, and don't worry, the devs also said that Frostpunk 1886 and Frostpunk 2 will "evolve side by side", so it's not a complete do over.

Fortunately, he happens to be quite good with both. How could he not be? That mustache is just giving “will duel at ten paces at a Starbucks”.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515">Grab These Skills First In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>As for starting skills, he’s the first in your crew to have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-skills-gustave-lune-maelle-1851777515">the ability to Mark enemies using Marking Shot</a></span>, a lightning-based skill which sets baddies up to take more damage on the next hit. It’s a tool you gotta wield carefully to get the most out of it, but an important one. The most crucial one, for reasons you’re about to find out, is Lumiere Assault, which is a snazzy five hit combo. It doesn’t do massive damage on its own, but mostly it’s because it’s your best primer for.</p><h2 id="h770216"><a id="overdrive"></a>Special mechanic: Overdrive</h2><p>So, this here is your main event, the thing you should be working towards with Gustave at all times. See, every time you attack, dodge, or parry an enemy, his Winter Soldier-brand prosthetic arm gains a charge, up to 10. Overdrive then allows Gustave to release the charges for a huge amount of damage, which can also break enemies if their meter’s built up at least halfway. Naturally, the more you can stock up, the better—especially in the early going, a fully charged Overdrive is basically game over for every enemy you meet. But that still means getting 10 Overdrives and having the AP in stock to unleash it. <br></p><h2 id="h770217"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds/synergy</h2><p>Here, my friends, is where Lumiere Assault comes in. You come pre-equipped with a skill that gives you five charges for Overdrive right up front—as long as you hit the QTEs. It’s also extremely useful for enemies with shields, since taking down five shields at once will make the job extremely easy for the rest of your crew. However, you’re still going to want to give Overdrive as much a chance for total devastation as possible before you drop the hammer. You’ll get a skill early on called Powerful which increases damage output for the whole party, but you’ll mostly want to use Pictos/Lumina. </p><p>Focus on perks that grant extra AP after killing an enemy or dodging (e.g. Dodger, Dead Energy) so you’re not caught out there with a full charge, but no way to capitalize. Critical Burn is also a nice one to slap on after Lune’s in your party. Set enemies on fire, and then at least one of your Overdrive hits will be absolutely devastating. <br></p><h2 id="h770218"><a id="skills"></a>Skills to aim for</h2><p>Once you’re a bit further down the road, Strike Storm and Shatter wind up becoming your best friends. Strike Storm is basically a better Lumiere Assault, which can give you eight charges if you hit it right, and Shatter can break enemies without having to drop the Overcharge just yet. Also, From Fire is extremely useful once both Lune and Maelle are with you, since it’s basically a bespoke way for Gustave to heal himself without dipping into your collection of tints, or taking the others away from the important work of burning everything alive. </p><hr><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a></li>    </ul>

    
    <p><span>Introducing a new boss and major quality of life updates.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Arc Games [101 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arc-games">Arc Games</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Heart Machine [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/heart-machine">Heart Machine</a> will release the “Buried Below” update for the Early Access version of <a title="Genres > Open-World [618 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <a title="Genres > Co-Op [254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> <a title="Genres > Roguelite [240 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelite game</a> <em><a title="Games > Hyper Light Breaker [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a></em> on April 29, the companies announced. <span id="more-960765"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Arc Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Content</strong></p><p>On the content front, Buried Below will bring a new Breaker, “Rondo”—a Breaker who comes from the same region as the recently-debuted Breaker, Ravona, and has a new SyCom with two SyCom perks—a new Crown, “Maw”—the biggest and most menacing Crown yet, two new melee weapons and new environments to explore, including caves. For the new Crown, Early Access players have seen glimpses of her in a couple of ways—as she’s shown as a Crown that’s possible to fight when readying up to enter the Overgrowth and players have entered her arena in the hostile crystalscape of the Jeweled Spire. The Heart Machine team’s been working hard on getting Maw ready, and they’re thrilled the time has come for players to face her in just a few days!</p><p><strong>Change in Run Structure</strong></p><p>Since Early Access launch, the Heart Machine has taken to heart all of the player feedback they’ve received across the board. Inspired by player feedback, the upcoming update will introduce the most significant feature overhaul yet with a complete rework of the game’s run structure, as players will now have one life for each run and when they die they will lose items in their inventory, and the Overgrowth will reset. This change was made to balance the game around a more traditional roguelike experience, turning each run into a more consistent and rewarding “zero to hero” adventure than before. This change also allows the Heart Machine to better adjust difficulty and make the game easier to get into, but harder to master, and addresses much of the feedback the team has received from players since Early Access launch.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This shift in run structure will introduce a few gameplay loops and progression changes to make runs easier, better and ultimately more enjoyable for all players, including veterans and newcomers alike, than before.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_960766"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Extraction</strong> – More Options for Players: Instead of only one way to leave the Overgrowth (via the Telepad), players will be able to extract at any Shrine in the Overgrowth and there’ll be no waves of enemies to defeat like before. This change will make it so players can extract more often, making the game easier as a result which was one of the main requests from players to change the game’s difficulty.</li><li><strong>SyComs</strong> – Follows a Class-Like System, More Loadout Potential: Character customization has been redesigned giving each Breaker one assigned SyCom with fixed stats, and players have the option to equip a perk to the SyCom that gives the Breaker a new passive ability. For instance, Rondo’s SyCom has an equippable perk called “Bladedancer” that increases Rondo’s damage and attack speed. Players can develop their SyCom stats further at Shrines in the Overgrowth with extended upgrades unlocked through meta progression. This change, inspired by player feedback, will make it so each Breaker is similar to a “class” making each Breaker feel different from one another, and make it so players can come up with distinct builds per Breaker.</li><li><strong>Inventory and Vendors</strong> – More Streamlined: The Vault system will be changed as when you die, the inventory in your Vault will no longer carry over between runs except for Golden Rations, the main meta progression currency in the game. This will allow players to focus solely on acquiring new gear during their runs instead of having to focus on managing their inventory so often like before. Additionally, vendors in the Overgrowth and Cursed Outpost will also have new roles, with Bright Blood and Materials now used for purchases and upgrades. While gear sales have been removed from hub vendors, players can still use them to enhance equipped items.</li></ul><p><strong>Improved Onboarding</strong></p><p>The second major addition in the upcoming patch is a brand-new onboarding tutorial that launches automatically the first time players start the game after the update, regardless of save status. This guided experience introduces core mechanics through a structured level that leads to the Cursed Outpost hub. From there, players will gain access to a dedicated space for learning and practicing advanced combat techniques such as dash attacks and parries. Designed to align with the game’s reworked structure and expanded mechanics, this revamped introduction provides a smooth and informative entry point for both new and returning players.</p></blockquote><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [22,979 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 has seen tremendous growth since launching in 2020. Originally littered with bugs, Night City is now better than it’s ever been--thanks to dozens of updates from CDPR and the brilliant Phantom Liberty expansion that transformed the world and strengthened the narrative. Nintendo users weren't able to play the open-world RPG on Switch, but they will be able to play it on Switch 2 on June 5, which is the same day the console launches. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Cyberpunk+2077+Nintendo+Switch+2+Preorders+Are+Live+-+Full+Game+Is+On+The+Cart&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-24+09%3A11%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-24+09%3A11%3A23&amp;fnarticle_id=6531086&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2%2F16204669929%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-game-cartridge-preorder-walmart%2F1100-6531086%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> is now available to preorder for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. </p><div title="[Various] Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch 2" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3427" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch 2" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2\/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2\/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value">$70 | Releases June 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the only version of the game up for preorder.

                <p>EA Sports has announced a new paid season pass for FC 25, the first of its kind for the soccer series, and the developer anticipated fans having a lot of questions about this.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc25-premium-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, EA Sports said the paid season pass is "purely additive," but many believe it's just the latest example of EA trying to squeeze even more money out of players beyond the microtransaction-heavy Ultimate Team mode. The FC 25 "Premium Pass," as it's called, can be purchased with FC Points or UT Coins at a cost of 1,000 FC Points ($10 USD) or 500,000 worth of in-game earnable UT Coins.</p><p><span>As for what's included, players get tradeable packs and Season Points boosters, along with more player items, evolution consumables, retro-themed cosmetics. The graphic below shows everything included with the paid expansion pack, and some of the content is exclusive to the Premium Pass.</span></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4482027-screenshot2025-04-24at11.00.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482027" data-ratio="0.56" data-width="1025" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4482027-screenshot2025-04-24at11.00.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482027"></a><figcaption>The new Premium Pass includes all of this content.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4482027-screenshot2025-04-24at11.00.04am.png"></figure><h2><strong>What's In The Premium Season Pass</strong></h2><p><em>Descriptions written by EA</em></p><ul><li>Tradeable Packs  <ul><li>For the first time, we’re including Tradeable Packs as part of Seasonal Rewards through the Premium Pass.</li></ul></li><li>SP (Season Points) Boosters  <ul><li>Receive 10,000 SP at level 20 of the Premium Pass, unlocking up to 10 levels of the Premium and Standard Pass Seasonal ladder.</li></ul></li><li>Player Items  <ul><li>TOTS Flashbacks.</li><li>TOTS Honourable Mentions (based on 2024/25 performances).</li></ul></li><li>Evolution Consumables  <ul><li>Earn Evolution Consumables that provide Role++ and Playstyle+ improvements  <ul><li>In the Standard Ladder, the requirements for the Playstyle+ Evolutions will be: Max 94 OVR, Max 8 Playstyles, Max 3 Playstyle+.</li><li>In the Premium Pass, the requirements for the Playstyle+ Evolutions will be: Max 95 OVR, Max 8 Playstyles, Max 3 Playstyle+.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Retro Cosmetic Evolutions  <ul><li>Similar to the Cosmetic Evolutions introduced during FUT Birthday, we’ll be introducing more retro shell designs from Football Ultimate Team history and this time they’ll be TOTS themed.</li></ul></li></ul><p>FC 25 already has a Standard Pass, and the rewards for that track will continue "as if there was no Premium Pass," EA said. The company said the paid pass is "purely additive," going on to note that EA will not move rewards from the Standard Pass to the Premium Pass.</p><p>EA went on to mention how it plans to monitor fan feedback about the new Premium Pass "to. make sure we deliver the best experience possible," encouraging fans to submit their feedback in the <a href="https://discord.gg/easportsfc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA Sports FC Discord</a> or through the <a href="https://signin.ea.com/p/juno/login?execution=e301423801s1&amp;initref=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.ea.com%3A443%2Fconnect%2Foauth%3Fdisplay%3DjunoWeb%252Flogin%26response_type%3Dcode%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsurvey.alchemer.com%252Fs3%252F8028603%252FPlayer-Feedback-Portal-Beta%26client_id%3DALCHEMER_WEB_APP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Player Feedback Portal.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA Sports FC subreddit</a> is already filled with people talking about the Premium Pass, with many comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1k5f2pe/anyone_defending_a_paid_season_pass_for_this_game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expressing frustration</a> over its introduction.</p><p>EA's games in general, and its sports titles specifically, are known to be filled with microtransactions--these prove to be lucrative for the company. For EA's latest quarter, the company made <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$1.3 billion from "live services,"</a> compared to $600 million for full-game sales.</p>

                <p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders for the Switch 2</a> in the US hit late last night, and it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/" data-ref-id="1100-6531084">as chaotic as you'd expect</a>. Retailers suffered from technical issues and available supply sold out quickly, with some customers even finding their orders canceled. Over on eBay, the predictable wave of US Switch 2 preorder resales has now begun, but some listings aren't what they appear to be, and are instead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fed-up-with-switch-2-scalpers-nintendo-fans-are-fighting-back/1100-6530806/" data-ref-id="1100-6530806">seemingly part of an anti-scammers/bot resistance</a>.</p><p>Sold listings show numerous people have now paid almost double the console's original retail price--$449, or $499 with Mario Kart World--to secure their console. However, as you scroll through the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=nintendo+switch+2&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;_odkw=switch+2&amp;_osacat=0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listings</a>, you'll find more than a handful of fake Switch 2s. Going through the listings, some posts have already been taken down. It should be noted that eBay rules state that preorder listings have to be for things coming out within 40 days. June 5, however, is just out of reach at 42. So it's a possibility that maybe these will be removed outright and relisted later.</p><p>While browsing, you'll see a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/205444784624" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 listed a few bucks less</a> and if you go read the description, it tells you point blank this is not what you're looking for.</p><p>"PRE-ORDER SCREENSHOT ONLY PLEASE NOTE!!!!!: You are ordering a picture of the Nintendo Switch 2. This listing is to fight bots and scalpers. No refunds. You will receive a png image of a switch 2. No console. Message me with any questions or offers!"</p><p>These listings almost outnumber scalpers who are selling at marked-up prices.</p><p>The actual Switch 2 consoles all have a similar description as well, saying the console will be in hand and delivered around June 11. The cheapest I was able to find this morning <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/326548391576" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was about $715 or best offer</a>, and that's the console and Mario Kart World bundle. For just the console, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/335927772445" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$650 seems to be as low as it goes</a>. Restocks are expected in the coming days and weeks, and Nintendo's own store will open preorders in May for certain eligible customers. We'll be tracking all of the availability in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 restock guide</a>.</p><p>Preorders were originally scheduled for earlier this month, but were delayed for the US as Nintendo had to reconfigure the dates after President Trump upped tariffs. There was also some initial concern that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">the price would change for the console</a>, but only <a href="https://fandom.slack.com/archives/C07QX8B2GNN/p1745508506556539?thread_ts=1745507990.523329&amp;cid=C07QX8B2GNN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some Switch 2 accessories'</a> prices were raised to balance the hit.</p>

"There was a little bit of mixed goals when we were working on that stuff."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After spending time with Epic, Stray Kite expanded its list of clients, eventually reuniting Hellquist with his former colleagues at Gearbox on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Co-development allowed Hellquist and Patel to intimately see how different studios are run, offering a rare opportunity to compare and contrast different ways of making games and picking the ones that worked for their shop.

The pair said it's a product born of their loves of system-driven games to drive player agency. But peeking over their shoulder, you can see a bit of that Fortnite Creative energy still lingering on the product—because as the pair explained it, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> mashes together genres, systems, and themes that don't work well together at first glance.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Wartorn'"><span>Wartorn'</span>s real-time strategy and roguelike gameplay</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a single-player strategy game as inspired by Bungie's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Myth: The Fallen Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as it is modern roguelikes like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Players take on the role of two siblings building an army of fantasy creatures to lead a caravan across a war-ravaged country and reunite with their family. Hellquist says Stray Kite is releasing the game in Early Access not just for economic reasons, but because the game is a "genre blend" that needs player feedback in development to properly mix together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know that we don't know everything we need to know," Hellquist said, accidentally </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">invoking an infamous Donald Rumsfeld quote.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "Having players be on that journey with us helps us understand what they need and what they want out of this kind of experience."</span></p><p>Image via Stray Kite Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair explained that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> balances their desire to push "player agency." Sometimes through familiar means, like a systems-driven elemental system that lets players experiment with cause-and-effect (and react to what goes wrong). Some of it is in conventional choice-driven narrative that balances the needs of the caravan against morality, evoking the mechanics of 11 bit studios' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This War of Mine </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and Stoic Studios' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Banner Saga.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even if the pair want players to make their own choices and tell their own stories, they want those choices to take place against the backdrop of real-world struggles. The game's story of two young heroes fleeing a region racked by war is a personal one for Patel, who described how his parents fled Tanzania under the threat of violence. His mom had to abandon the dog that protected her from thieves and his father literally buried gold near his home in the hopes of one day returning to reclaim it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He never did. "There's some gold buried in Tanzania you can go get," Patel joked. "We've got this extremism that happened here, and it's personal to me...and it's personal for so many people in the world and throughout all of human history."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wartorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a case study of where developers can rely on the "familiar" to experiment with something new. While Stray Kite pushes the boundaries on the game's setting and core gameplay, it's relying on familiar fantasy conventions and the popularity of roguelike progression to help players ground themselves. It's also an ambitious choice to tap the real-time strategy genre—though Patel said he prefers to think of it as "real-time tactics" given the smaller focus. "We've started calling this a real time tactics game, because it's a little closer to that," he said. "We're trying to distance ourselves from that expectation [that there will be] base building and managing people, gathering berries and things like that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One might wonder if blending a dormant genre with roguelike mechanics (something that's not really been done successfully, as Hellquist noted) is a wise choice for a small team trying to stay financially afloat. But the pair hope other developers can join them in making these unusual blends of games. "I'm afraid we as an industry are going to stagnate," Hellquist said. "We don't feel like we can explore in the triple-A space the way he used to. I'm not sure a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be made any more."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Financial survival doesn't have to translate to taking the safest choices possible. Stray Kite Studios is trying to show the game industry that taking risks isn't just about fulfilling the creative spirit—when well-grounded, it can be what helps your team evolve and grow instead of remaining stagnant.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
Evercade seller Funstock has become the first notable hardware retailer to freeze orders for US customers due to the country's ongoing trade war with China.
</p>
<p>
At the start of April, sweeping international tariffs enacted by US president Trump have caused stock markets to falter and left companies struggling to react as the situation fluctuates daily.
</p>
<p>
Now, retro console and handheld seller Funstock, which handles sales of the Evercade in the UK and internationally, has said it will be taking "a cautious approach to the situation" by "temporarily stopping any new orders and pre-orders for US customers".
</p>
<p>
"Until we know more, we do not want to put our customers at risk of unexpected charges," Funstock said in a statement emailed to existing customers this afternoon, as seen by Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"As soon as the situation is clearer, we'll release a statement on our shipping policies going forward. This pause in service will be effective from Monday, 28th April and means that customers in the US will not be able to make new orders on our website."
</p>
<p>
Existing US customers still awaiting pre-orders will need to sit tight for now, Funstock continued. 
</p>
<p>
"We are exploring all available options to ascertain what our customers can expect with their pre-orders and will update you on any changes by 17th June," the company concluded. "We will advise all customers with existing pre-orders what to expect by that date."
</p>
<p>
Orders to customers in Canada are unaffected, Funstock noted.
</p>
<p>
Funstock is far from the only video games company which has reacted to the US tariffs. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Nintendo delayed US Switch 2 pre-orders until today</a> while it reassessed the situation and ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raised the prices of Switch 2 accessories in response</a>. PlayStation, meanwhile, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">raised the price of PS5 in various countries, including the UK</a>, citing "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".

However, shortly after 11:30AM ET, it appears some people started to be able to complete orders, including one <em>Verge</em> staffer.</p><p>Right as the clock rolled over to 11AM, many of us at <em>The Verge</em> experienced issues with the website. At first, GameStop’s website showed me a mostly-blank page – the only text on it was “Oops…Something went wrong” [sic] and a refresh button. Soon after, myself and other <em>Verge</em> staffers often saw Cloudflare notices on GameStop’s website instead, including error notices that said the “web server is down” or that the site is experiencing a “bad gateway.”</p><p>Occasionally, the online listing for the Switch 2 and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle has loaded for me, but the preorder button will be grayed out. One colleague also got the console-only option listing to load, but with a “not available” button in place of a preorder one.</p><p>GameStop’s mobile app has also been showing error messages for me, including one that vaguely says “activity paused,” when I try to open it.</p><p>At 11:34AM ET, deals-hunter Wario64 posted that GameStop’s Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1915429174073774270">were actually live</a>. A few <em>Verge</em> staffers were then able to get a console in their cart, and one was actually able to make a purchase. However, as of about 12:30PM ET, they haven’t received a confirmation email, the order isn’t on their order list, and their card hasn’t been charged.</p><p>Another staffer thought they had the console in their cart, but when their cart actually loaded, GameStop said it was out of stock. Since then, none of us at <em>The Verge</em> have been able to try and check out a Switch 2 on GameStop’s website.</p><p>“We’re seeing overwhelming demand for Switch 2, which is causing some site issues. In-store preorders are open and running smoothly,” GameStop said on <a href="https://x.com/GameStopHelp/status/1915429914641350721">its support account on X</a>. “Our team is actively working to fix it.

            <p>Wombo Games - that is to say, the new studio from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> co-founder and ex-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> chief creative officer Janos Flösser - has unveiled its first title.</p>
<p>It's a "pulse pounding" top-down roguelite called Raiders of Blackveil, with a focus on "mastering champions, combining synergistic perks and acquiring powerful loot".</p>
<p>It's all set in a dystopian industrial fantasy world full of oppressed animals. Who is oppressing these poor beasts? Well, humans, of course. They have formed a mega corporation known as, you guessed it, Blackveil.</p>
<p>"You will join the animal rebellion as they aim to thwart Blackveil’s attempt at enslaving nature and enforcing a mindless consumer society," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">reads the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Raiders of Blackveil includes a range of MOBA-inspired champions, "each with unique abilities, playstyles, and personalities". Roles, meanwhile, include Tank, Damage Dealer, or Support.</p>
