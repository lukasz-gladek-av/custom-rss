<p>Nintendo officially launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> on the Switch 2 this week, and since then, some video comparisons have now popped up online.</p>
<p>One of these has been shared by the <a href="https://youtu.be/MUO1BRWZ8wQ">YouTube channel 'ElAnalistaDeBits'</a>, which not only presents a side-by-side visual comparison of the Switch 2 Edition next to the existing Switch release, but also shows other improvements such as game's loading times.</p>
<p>As Nintendo has previously noted, the Switch 2 Edition is "4K" in docked mode. As for handheld, it's 1080p (so everything looks sharper), and both versions of the game run at a consistent 30fps. There's also a demonstration of the improved load times. Similar to the resolution bump, you may or may not notice the difference when you're actually playing the game.</p>
<p>In this particular video demo, you can see in one example on Switch 2 how it takes eight seconds to get from the title screen to the game, while the Switch version takes around 17 seconds. And going all the way from the system HOME Menu to actually gameplay takes 16 seconds on the Switch 2 and about 30 seconds on the original system.</p>
<p>We've also shared our thoughts about the Switch 2 version's resolution, frame rate and load times, so if you haven't already read our review be sure to check it out.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/raising-my-daddy-rank-at-a-london-gyoza-bar</link>
            <guid>1407856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="504b9ee386419"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/504b9ee386419/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>My gaming life can now be cleanly split into two sections: the period before I had heard the phrase "Daddy Rank", and the period after it.</p>
<p>It's one of the key features of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> that Sega was kind enough to show me at a fancy gyoza-joint-turned-preview space in London this week, and in the days since, I haven't stopped muttering it to myself whenever I do a small piece of housework.</p>
<p>Kiryu's Daddy Rank is the bread and butter of Kiwami 3's new 'Life at Morning Glory' side content — an expansion on the 2009 original's opening locale, where the ex-Tojo Clan tough guy swaps his knuckledusters for a pair of marigolds and cracks on with some chores around his self-made orphanage.</p>
<p>Yakuza is a series renowned for its constant flip-flopping between serious and silly, dark and delightful, and it always plays best to me when it leans into the latter of the two camps and embraces the brooding protagonist's softer side. Life at Morning Glory is about exactly that.</p>
<h2>What's the story, Morning Glory?</h2>
<p>The children need help with a series of tasks, and it's up to the Daddy of Dojima (as I will now <em>insist</em> on calling him) to come to the rescue.</p>
<p>In my preview, I sped through a multiple-choice questionnaire to assist young Ayako with her science homework, followed the lines of a sewing minigame to knock up a new dustcloth for Taichi, farmed and planted crops in the garden, then chopped, mixed, and scum-skimmed them into a curry for Koji's dinner.</p>

<p>At the end of each task, Kiryu holds up his handiwork (a test paper/piece of fabric/steaming plate) and smiles directly into the camera in much the same way that your avatar might in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> after catching a fish. In the game world, this is all a process of improving Kiryu's bond with each child and working out where he stands as a father figure; in the real world, it's a chance to play some super sweet minigames, then smile as a big green Daddy Rank bar ticks up the screen with each success.</p>
<p>The preview was hosted entirely on PS5, but I can't wait to take this silly little side mission on the go with me on Switch 2. It's just a taxi ride away from the open streets of Ryukyu and Kamurocho, too, so you just know that I'm going to be putting off all the brutal murders, clan wars, and shady deals to beat my stitching record back on the beaches of Okinawa.</p>
<h2>From Daddy to Baddy</h2>
<p>While I'm on the open streets, let's touch on some Baddie Battles. No, much like Daddy Rank, I'm not making this up. In another of Kiwami 3's fresh storylines, Kiryu becomes the surprise chairman of the Haisai Girls, an all-female biker gang that's engaged in a turf war with the larger-than-life Tokyo Night Terrors.</p>
<p>A lot of this 'Bad Boy Dragon' gameplay circulates around massive squad battles between the two teams, where you can put either Kiryu's classic Dragon of Dojima fighting style or the snappy new weapon-focused Ryukyu style to the test. It's also about team management. You can save people in peril on the streets of Okinawa and recruit them to your biker squad, each bringing their own skills to the baddie lineup — be that powerful attacks, rallying cries or healing abilities. Then, before diving into a head-to-head against another clan, you choose which characters will make up your squad, balancing their quirks to suit the situation.</p>

<p>In short, it's the crew recruitment system from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/like_a_dragon_pirate_yakuza_in_hawaii">Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> transposed onto a biker gang, but that's no bad thing! I was informed that you can also customise Kiryu and his crew with snazzy uniforms, bike designs and banners, but I never got to see these tools in the preview — which is probably for the best, because I can guarantee that it would have gobbled up <em>all my time</em>.</p>
<p>When I wasn't recruiting baddies, the streets of Downtown Ryukyu were expectedly packed with distractions — karaoke, arcades, golf, bowling, you know the drill. There's also side missions galore, bounties to be hunted, and the chance to head back over to Morning Glory and stay on top of that aforementioned Daddy Rank. I'm not obsessed, I promise.</p>
<p>It all looks and plays wonderfully on PS5, and given how impressed I've been by the three Yakuza titles available on Switch 2 already (gosh, Sega really has been churning them out, huh?), I'd be surprised if this entry is any different. Yakuza 3 is often viewed as one of the lesser titles in the series, so seeing the whole affair brought to RGG's slick Dragon Engine with some nips, tucks, and new fighting styles, pushes this one excitingly close to the territory of being an entirely new game rather than a standard remake.</p>
<h2>Tying things up</h2>
<p>Oh yes, speaking of an "entirely new game", I should probably touch on Dark Ties, too. This came right at the end of my preview, and I've left it to the end here, too, because it felt like the addition I already knew the most about. Sega has been showcasing this prologue story starring the base game's antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, for a good few months now (our sister site, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/its-mines-time-to-shine-in-yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Push Square</a>, went hands-on with it back in September), and, shockingly, it feels like more Yakuza.</p>
<p>Mine's athletic moveset is a lot of fun — a special attack that lets you jump kick off one opponent's chest, flinging yourself into an aerial attack on another, is a particular highlight — and the underground Hell's Arena fight club gave me a good chance to see it in action.</p>

<p>Other than that, it was business as usual on the streets of Kamurocho. The Kanda Damage Control side content peppered the open world with tasks for me to complete and up my 'Kanda Rank' in the process (it's all 'Ranks' in this game) by improving Tsuyoshi Kanda's street cred, but it all felt very Yakuza-y otherwise. This is no criticism, mind you; it's always great to have more hot content to dive into.</p>
<p>I left the preview with a belly full of gyoza and the words 'Daddy Rank' still playing on my mind. From what I've seen, this feels like the biggest step up for a 'Kiwami' remake so far, packed with new content, combat styles, and with an entirely new story bolted onto the side.</p>
<p>Does it all still feel a little overwhelming? Of course it does! But come on, we wouldn't have Yakuza any other way.</p>

                <p>It's been three months since the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties/" data-ref-id="5000-696295">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a>, the highly anticipated remake of the 2009 classic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-3/" data-ref-id="5000-37569">Yakuza 3</a>. After seeing how gorgeous the game looks and plays smoothly in the Dragon Engine, on top of the newly added Mine Saga "Dark Ties", I've been desperately waiting for more content to be revealed, especially when it comes to Kiryu's island life. Last week, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced some of the new features coming to Yakuza Kiwami 3 that gave me even more hope that this is going to be another awesome Yakuza game, and afterward, I finally got a chance to go into full island dad mode with an extended preview demo that left me even more excited for this remake.</p><p>Unlike all the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games out so far, Yakuza 3 sees Kiryu living a somewhat peaceful life. After the conflict with Omi Alliance in Yakuza 2/Kiwami 2, Kiryu moves to Okinawa to run the Morning Glory Orphanage with his adoptive daughter, Haruka. The first half of the game focuses on his relationship with the kids at the orphanage, watching sunsets with Haruka, and engaging in silly substories as a father figure.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 10 Minutes of Yakuza Kiwami 3 Gameplay | TGS 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Although it would seem like seeing Kiryu let his guard down and go into dad mode would be enjoyable, I found the orphanage content to be pretty disappointing in the original game. Slowly walking around the house felt clunky and outdated even back in 2009, where opening every door welcomed a new loading screen--it got pretty irritating, pretty fast. It was a slog having to interact with each kid, an activity that came with very little reward. I remember finishing the game and wishing there was a better focus on Kiryu's life on the island, considering it's one of the only "wholesome" parts of Kiryu's saga we get to witness.</p><p>While I didn't get to see much of the story in the part of Kiwami 3 that I got to play, I had a blast messing with the newly added "Daddy Rank" and seeing how it changes the ways Kiryu can interact with the kids in the orphanage. That's right, you read that correctly--Yakuza Kiwami 3 now gives players the full dad experience! Hawaiian shirt, silly chores, and cheesy Kiryu puns included. Not only is Yakuza Kiwami 3 packed with more content focused on the orphanage, but Daddy Rank is where you can increase your dad stats through minigames like helping with homework, sewing clothes, cooking meals, playing board games, and completing silly side quests. Having the ability to increase your rank to bond closer with the orphans is a more rewarding experience for the players and feels more meaningful compared to Yakuza 3.</p><p>In our hands-on gameplay, we start out in Chapter 3, where the ultimate dad activities begin. After Kiryu sees Haruka burnt out from doing all the chores around the orphanage, he puts his father foot down and steps in to help her out. Our first challenge is to help Ayako with her homework, which Kiryu is adorably nervous about. The homework minigame is similar to what's in the vocational school in Like a Dragon and Infinite Wealth, where you answer timed multiple-choice questions. This time, it's basic elementary-school science; I had to answer questions about different types of flasks used in science projects. It was oddly intense, but luckily, I had just rewatched Breaking Bad for the third time and managed to pass with a 70% grade. It was mildly embarrassing that I barely made it--even Kiryu broke out in a sweat at the end of the minigame. Let's just say, I am not smarter than a fifth grader.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635333-yakuza-kids.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635333" data-ratio="0.56162361623616" data-width="1355" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635333-yakuza-kids.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635333"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635333-yakuza-kids.png"></figure><p>After helping out with homework, which ended in a very adorable interaction between Kiryu and Ayako, it was time to create a new bag for Taichi in the brand-new sewing minigame. The sewing is a bit intimidating at first; you have to follow the stitch line within a thin path, speeding up to beat the timer while slowing down around tight corners, sort of like a chaotic racing game. Like most of the minigames in Yakuza/Like a Dragon games, the sewing gives off major WarioWare vibes, and Kiryu's signature "serious but silly" competitive nature really shines: ultra concentration face, full shrimp position mode, disappointing grunts at every minor mistake.</p><p>Once the homework and sewing festivities are over, it's time to cook a meal for all the kids. Not only did the developers add more challenges to how the franchise handles cooking at this point--cracking eggs and flipping multiple pans in what feels like a Whac-a-Mole-type game--but you also have your own farm and garden for growing and harvesting food, plus the ability to fish for seafood.</p><p>The little cutscenes in each minigame are so wholesome; you can tell Kiryu really enjoys helping around the house, even if he's terrible at it, because he knows what it's like to grow up in an orphanage. Morning Glory went from having very minor features to play around with to becoming almost a full cozy game in itself. I'm definitely looking forward to spending 90% of my gameplay maxing out my Daddy Rank and becoming the ultimate protective father.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635334-yakuza-city.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635334" data-ratio="0.56351550960118" data-width="1354" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635334-yakuza-city.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635334"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635334-yakuza-city.png"></figure><p>After we got a preview of Kiryu's domesticated life in the orphanage, we moved on to Chapter 4 to bring dad mode to the city.</p><p>We immediately jump into a cutscene in which Kiryu witnesses an all-male gang beating up a group of young women, one of whom ends up with bruises on her ribs. It turns out the male bullies are the Tokyo Night Terrors, a dangerous bike gang from the mainland sent to Okinawa to recruit new members, and the women are members of the Haisai bike gang, a local gang of women who protect the city from dangerous criminals. Of course, Kiryu despises any man who lays a finger on a woman and immediately steps in to fight the Tokyo Night Terrors.</p><p>It was refreshing, and oddly nostalgic, to jump back into Kiryu's original beat-'em-up style of fighting. You can tell that Kiryu is a lot younger and stronger in this game when it comes to fighting; he moves with more agility compared to Like a Dragon Gaiden and has a quicker reaction time. As someone who played through all of Gaiden as a 50-year-old Kiryu, who starts to lose his spunk in battle, this mildly tore at my heartstrings. I'm pretty familiar with his Dragon of Dojima style--I just spam Tiger Drop and throw bikes at everyone, of course--so this time I messed around with the new Ryukyu Style. I had fun trying some of the different movesets and weapons, and I love that it's inspired by Okinawan martial arts. It'll be really cool to see what ridiculous combos I'll come up with in the full release, but let's be honest--I still just want to throw bikes at everyone.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635335-yakuza-confront.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635335" data-ratio="0.56213017751479" data-width="1352" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635335-yakuza-confront.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635335"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635335-yakuza-confront.png"></figure><p>After Kiryu beats up the Night Terror members, we head to Chura Bar with the Haisai girls, which is owned by the father of their leader, Tsubasa. The girls feel so safe with Kiryu around, they decide to recruit him to help drive the Night Terror gang out of Okinawa and find other "baddies" to join Haisai. They even named him "Chairman Kiryu", which I'm sure Kiryu felt a bit nostalgic for. Kiryu is now officially part of a girl bike gang, and I'm really looking forward to him going dad mode on the streets in his purple gang suit.</p><p>I spent the rest of my playtime exploring Okinawa and Kamurocho to see what other fun activities I could quickly get into. Yakuza 3 is known to have some of the best side stories in the series, and Kiwami 3 added some really silly ones, such as Kiryu finding a naughty magazine on the beach and hiding it before he gets caught by Haruka. There are a couple "dad" side stories I ran into as well, which seems to become a recurring theme in this remake. Aside from all the essential minigames, like Heaven's Golf, karaoke, and casino and bar games, the developers brought back bowling and added a Sega Game Gear in Kiryu's room that lets you play full-length games.</p><p>Once we were finished with our Kiwami 3 demo, it was time to move on to my most anticipated addition to the remake: Yoshitaka Mine's side story "Dark Ties." The new content focuses on Mine's backstory that leads up to the events in Yakuza Kiwami 3: After Mine loses his business, he seeks to make a name for himself in the criminal underworld by connecting with a Tojo clan member, Tsuyoshi Kanda.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635336-yakuza-fighting.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635336" data-ratio="0.56226971260133" data-width="1357" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635336-yakuza-fighting.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635336"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635336-yakuza-fighting.png"></figure><p>After the trailer for Dark Ties revealed that it focuses on Mine and Kanda's relationship, many fans, including myself--who played the original Yakuza 3--were concerned about Dark Ties "humanizing" Kanda. He's a considerably vile scumbag of a character and one of the few Yakuza antagonists with zero redeeming qualities, not to mention that he's not even hot.</p><p>Luckily, in Dark Ties, Kanda's horrible reputation is unchanged, which makes Mine's main side quest pretty hilarious. Similar to Kiryu's Daddy Rank for completion points, Mine has "Damage Control," which increases by putting out Kanda's fires and getting more involved with the community through side quests and minigames. The ranks are hilarious, going from "Super Trashy" to "Trashy," and it's quite funny to have Mine clean up and constantly apologize for Kanda's actions. It's also very relieving to know that Kanda is still a garbage human in this game.</p><p>When we played Dark Ties, we started out on Chapter 2 in Kamurocho, where we are first introduced to the Damage Control mechanic and meet Zenba, Kanda's assistant, who gives you assignments to help with your rank. The first task is to investigate the underground fighting club and make your way through "Survival Hell," a maze-like battle arena similar to the underground dungeons in Like a Dragon, where you can use different weapons and hire mercenaries to survive each level. Mine's aerial kicks and "shoot boxing" fighting style are pretty fun when fighting large groups of enemies, as is triggering his "Dark Awakening" against bigger enemies and bosses.</p><div

and unlocking the underground fight club, it was time for me to roam around the city to find other ways to increase my rank. We had very limited time in Dark Ties, so I figured anything connected to the story wouldn't be revealed yet, but engaging in typical Yakuza minigames as Mine is pretty funny. Hitting a strike in bowling and completing favors for civilians as our beloved emo antagonist is already pretty hilarious, but inviting Kanda to join is even more entertaining. I invited Kanda to duet in "Bakamitai", but it just ends up being Mine singing while Kanda yells at him. I can't wait to see what other shenanigans Mine is forced into to cover for Kanda and how their relationship develops before their final interaction in Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p><p>I'm very happy that Yakuza Kiwami 3 is going to be packed with both silly and heartwarming side content for Kiryu, as he deserves to enjoy the little peace he has in his life. I'm also looking forward to playing as Mine and seeing how all the events will unfold in the final chapters in each game. Thankfully, I don't have to wait all that long. Yakuza Kiwami 3 launches on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch 2, and PC on February 12.</p>

                <p>If you've been hoping for some sweeping balance changes among the Nightfarers in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, then the day has arrived. From Software has released a new Nightreign Version 1.03.2 update that re-balances some of the weaker Nightfarers into more formidable heroes across all consoles and PC versions of the game.</p><p>As laid out on the official page for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1032" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring</a>, Guardians received a damage negation buff as well as an increase to the Guard Boost ability. Raiders now have faster attacks with the exception of jump attacks of dual-wield attacks. Additionally, Raiders' attack range is extended when using the Ultimate Art "Totem Stela."</p><p>Revenants are getting more attack power when using the Ultimate Art "Immortal March" or the "Summon Spirit" skill. Executors got the most love from this update, with increased attack power, guard boost, stagger damage, and reduced stamina reduction when using the "Cursed Sword" character skill. Executors also received a handful of other buffs as well.</p><p>This update was primarily focused on balance adjustments for Relics, Equipment, Sorcery, and Incantations, as well as a long list of bug fixes that went with them. This is one of the biggest updates Nightreign has received since The Forsaken Hollows DLC launched last month. If you need help navigating the DLC's new characters and new bosses, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows/1100-6536650/" data-ref-id="1100-6536650">guide to starting The Forsaken Hollows</a>.</p><p>You can find the full patch notes for the new update below.</p><h2>Elden Ring Nightreign Patch Notes Version 1.03.2</h2><h2>Balance Adjustments and Feature Updates</h2><h3>Nightfarers Adjustments</h3><h3>Duchess</h3><ul><li>Adjusted the visibility of the phantom when Duchess's skill "Restage" is triggered.</li></ul><h3>Guardian</h3><ul><li>Increased damage negation for physical and various elemental attacks.</li><li>Increased Guard Boost when guarding.</li></ul><h3>Raider</h3><ul><li>Increased the speed of various attacks, except dual-wield and jump attacks, and adjusted the movement distance of some attacks when using weapons of the Greataxes, Great Hammers, or Colossal Weapons categories.</li><li>Added an effect to the passive ability "Fighter's Resolve" that increases attack power for a certain period when HP is significantly reduced.</li><li>Expanded the attack range when activating the Ultimate Art "Totem Stela".</li></ul><h3>Revenant</h3><ul><li>Increased the attack power of the special attacks performed by summoned spirits when the Revenant's Ultimate Art "Immortal March" is triggered with active summoned spirits.</li><li>Increased the attack power and damage negation of spirits summoned through the skill "Summon Spirit" in the Deep of Night mode, scaling with the depth level of Expeditions.</li></ul><h3>Executor</h3><ul><li>Increased the attack power of critical hits while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Increased the Guard Boost while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Increased the stagger damage upon successful deflection while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Reduced the stamina reduction upon successful deflection while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Running out of stamina after a successful deflection no longer result in a guard break while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Changed the specifications to apply the effects of "Improved Skill Attack Power" and "Improved Melee Attack Power" to weapon arts while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Increased the power of attacks - except for "Roar" - while the Ultimate Art: “Aspects of the Crucible: Beast” is active.</li><li>Increased damage negation when performing the L2(PS5) /LT (Xbox) / Q (Steam) skill attack while the Ultimate Art: "Aspects of the Crucible” transformation is active, and added a short window where it is not possible to become critically wounded even if your HP reaches zero.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marios-voice-actor-debunks-weird-online-narrative-about-nintendo-directs/</link>
            <guid>1407799</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mario’s modern-day voice actor, Kevin Afghani, debunks a rumor about his involvement with Nintendo before taking on the role of voicing several iconic Nintendo characters. He’s also discussing what it means to him to carry on the legacy of Mario, Luigi, and others.</p>



<p>Kevin Afghani began voicing Mario and Luigi with the 2023 release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder on the Nintendo Switch. He also voices the nefarious Wario. He replaced the retired Charles Martinet, the legendary voice actor who had voiced the characters for decades. However, he recently stated that, despite an online narrative, he had never worked for Nintendo before 2023. Specifically, he denied ever narrating the Nintendo Direct presentations.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll give you one. I was never in Nintendo Direct,” he told <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>. There’s this weird narrative online I was in Nintendo Directs, I narrated Nintendo Directs. I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario.”</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-kevin-afghani-has-nothing-but-respect-for-the-og-mario-charles-martinet">Kevin Afghani Has Nothing But Respect For The OG Mario, Charles Martinet</h2>



<p>Discussing his fandom that led him to this dream role, he says he’s living his dream, but he has nothing but respect for the man who came before him, and in his mind, Charles Martinet is Mario.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Look, Charles, as far as I’m concerned, IS Mario. He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn’t nervous, then I’m the wrong guy,” he said. “I’m the second guy who’s doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kevin Afghani will be back in the roles of Mario, Luigi, and Wario in the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game, set to release in February 2026 on the Nintendo Switch 2. Learn more about that upcoming release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-unveils-new-features-and-characters-in-mario-tennis-fever-gameplay-overview-trailer/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft says its recent upload of the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag soundtrack to Ubisoft Music’s YouTube account was due to technical issues with some of its videos.</p>



<p>On January 14, 2026, the Ubisoft music account on YouTube uploaded 18 songs from the Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag soundtrack. Naturally, the move excited fans and sparked speculation that the game developer may be preparing to announce the much-anticipated remake of the 2013 game, dubbed Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag Resynced.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has now commented on the uploads, stating in <a href="https://t.co/WYPZTZZtZW">a community post on their music YouTube channel</a> that the songs were re-uploaded due to technical issues with some of their prior videos.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hi there music lovers! We encountered some technical issues with a few of our videos, which we had to reupload. Apologies for the trouble, and hope you enjoy the music.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-where-things-stand-with-ubisoft-s-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake">Where Things Stand With Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</h2>



<p>In January 2024, it was first reported that a remake of the game was in development. Insider Gaming later confirmed that the Remake, codenamed Obsidian, was on track to be released before April of this year. Sources familiar with the situation originally said that marketing for the release was scheduled to begin this month, with the release set for March. Learn more about where things stand with the forthcoming remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leaks-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at this link.</a></p>



<p>Ubisoft is also working on a Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake. Check out the latest news on that release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-rated-by-esrb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-showcase-january-2026-5-things-we-learned</link>
            <guid>1407736</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I'm gonna need a second opinion.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Capcom is holding a Resident Evil Showcase event set to feature "brand new gameplay and news" for Resident Evil Requiem, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase is taking place at 2pm PT, 5pm ET, and 10pm UK, with a post-show discussion stream to follow, though it's unclear exactly what that will be about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Reqiuem is just a few weeks away, and we've already seen quite a bit of it, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-finally-confirms-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-the-game-awards-2025-ign">long-awaited reveal of Leon S. Kennedy</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-reveal-how-much-well-play-as-leon-and-say-the-survival-horroraction-contrast-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna">who is apparently going to be playable as well</a>, and what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-reveals-bustling-city-location-in-a-what-looks-like-a-huge-departure-for-the-survival-horror-series">seems to be a tease of an open world</a>...or at least a pretty big shift in how the series has historically treated its settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the showcase itself is over, it turns out it was actually...pretty thin as far as new information. It was entirely related to Resident Evil: Requiem, and almost fully focused on stuff you can buy in connection with the game. Here's a quick rundown of the five big takeaways from the showcase today:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-6-28-screenshot-1768516637347.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Resident Evil: Requiem's Difficulty Settings</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Requiem will have at least three different difficulty settings, and one in particular seems pretty cool. There's a Casual mode for those who just want to focus on the story, and it comes with an aim assist. And there's a Standard mode, which is just what it sounds like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the really neat one is Standard (Classic) difficulty, which is the Standard difficulty but with an added challenge, where Grace will need to collect ink ribbons for typewriters in order to save her game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-5-38-screenshot-1768516607693.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Bloody It Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A new game mechanic was revealed today related to the crafting system. In RE: Requiem, a number of items are only craftable using infected blood, which is obtained by killing zombies. Though Grace isn't much of a fighter, she does have a gun on her (appropriately called Requiem) that she uses to get out of tight jams, and she'll need to use it to take down zombies so she can get their blood and craft more useful survival tools.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-8-30-screenshot-1768516563208.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">There's a Lot of Stuff You Can Buy, If You Want</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A surprising amount of today's showcase was dedicated to stuff you can buy in real-life that ties in with the game. There's a watch collaboration with Hamilton for two different watches, one for Grace and one for Leon, that they'll wear in-game, and only 2,000 of each watch are being made for sale. There's the amiibo, which we already knew about, and a special Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller themed around Requiem. There are special Resident Evil orchestra concerts coming, and obviously, the Deluxe Edition of the game and all its bonus content. And Capcom is releasing figurines of both Grace and Leon. If you're interested in buying any of that stuff, it's all easy enough to find, but this section of the video really did feel a bit shopping channel given the circumstances.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">These Zombies Are...Different</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There's something different about the zombies in Resident Evil: Requiem. Rather than just violent and lurching, some of them seem to have other personality traits, and have carried over characteristics from their lives before. For instance, one custodian zombie continues to clean the building even after being turned. There's another man frantically pushing elevator buttons. And at the end of the trailer, there's one that straight up talks to Grace. Like, seems to be holding a normal, smooth, human conversation. What's going on here? Is this a different virus than the usual one? Mysteries!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-14-29-screenshot-1768516505500.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Elpis</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">What? Pipis? No, you said Elpis? Okay, sure. At the end of the showcase, there was a mention of some sort of "secret" Leon is carrying, referencing something called "elpis." We have...no idea what that is! We know now that it's potentially related to the murder of Grace's mother, Alyssa, and we can maybe guess that it's connected in some way to that zombie bite mark fans keep seeing on Leon in trailers. But this is another mystery that will need further investigation. Or, as Leon S. Kennedy put it in the trailer, a second opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Requiem is coming to Xbox, PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-showcase-coming-thursday-includes-brand-new-requiem-footage/1100-6537372/" data-ref-id="1100-6537372">Resident Evil Requiem Showcase</a> didn't reveal much about the story, but it did go into detail about how the game will change depending upon which character you're playing, and the title will also introduce new difficulty settings to the franchise. The new heroine, Grace Ashcroft, will represent a more classic, horror-focused approach to gameplay, similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-2/" data-ref-id="5000-448874">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-6/" data-ref-id="5000-82753">6</a>. But when players are in control of Leon S. Kennedy, the tone of the game will shift to a more action-oriented style like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/" data-ref-id="5000-565525">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p><p>It doesn't sound like players will get to choose which character they will control, since certain parts of the story are meant for one or the other. Although Grace is physically weaker than Leon, she will have some abilities to make up for that. She will be able to craft weapons using the blood of the infected. And when Grace needs to shoot her way out of trouble, she'll have a powerful gun called Requiem to fall back on. To keep players from relying only on Requiem, the ammo will be limited.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil Requiem - 3rd Trailer (With Leon)</p>
      </div>
<p>RE Requiem is also introducing some new difficulty settings. The easiest mode is Casual, which lets players concentrate on the story and gives them an aim assist. Standard difficulty is a little harder, while Standard (Classic) won't let players save their games without finding a limited number of ink ribbons to use. That's a throwback to the save system in the older games in the franchise.</p><p>Another departure from the series' norms are more human-like zombies. Some of these poor lost creatures find themselves still working their dead-end jobs even after their death simply because their bodies remember how to do them. Players can sneak past some of these zombies or closely observe their actions for clues about how to proceed.</p><p>At least one of the infected zombies seen in the showcase was human enough to converse with Grace. It's unclear if that's simply a random zombie or a more important character to the narrative.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 27.</p>

<p>Launching alongside the game on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, the two models are featured in the game itself and are (conveniently) worn by both protagonists: Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. They also cost enough to make RE4's merchant break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>The models in question are:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Classic Pan Europ - £1,170</li>
<li>Khaki Field Auto Chrono - £1,800</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sign up for more information over on the official <a href="https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-gb/resident-evil-requiem">Hamilton website</a> right now. Regardless of price, these things will likely disappear pretty quickly, so if you're genuinely interested, then definitely head on over there ASAP.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zombies-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-but-now-theyre-more-terrifying-than-ever">Resident Evil Showcase</a> revealed a bunch more information about Requiem, including key gameplay mechanics for both Leon and Grace. It'll launch day one on Switch 2 alongside both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard Gold Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-resident-evil-showcase-capcom/</link>
            <guid>1407718</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-showcase-to-air-this-thursday/">Resident Evil Showcase</a></strong>, which was announced earlier this week by <strong>Capcom</strong>, delivered on its promise to show off more information on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong>, with the game's director, <strong>Koshi Nakanishi</strong>, taking players through the different gameplay styles players will experience with between playing as <strong>Grace</strong> and <strong>Leon</strong>.</p>



<p>The showcase did not, however, live up to fans' speculation, as people believed the mention of "<em>games</em>," as in more than one game, being shown amounted to nothing more than references to <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/"><strong>Resident Evil VII</strong> and <strong>Resident Evil Village</strong> making their way to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. The showcase did not include, as players hoped, the reveal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ports-of-every-re-engine-game-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/"><strong>Resident Evil 2 </strong>and <strong>Resident Evil 4</strong> remakes</a>, making the jump to Nintendo's latest console.</p>



<p>Back to what it did include, Nakanishi began by addressing the fact that, after months of rumours, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/">we now know that <strong>Leon Kennedy</strong> is in Resident Evil Requiem</a> as the second playable character alongside Grace. "<em>So, I never said he wasn't going to show up</em>," Nakanishi said before breaking out into a short laugh. "<em>Seriously, I didn't say that at all</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Resident Evil Showcase | January 15, 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9HIc7GZLa0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nakanishi then went on to explain <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-grace-ashcroft-series-most-fearful-character-leon-kennedy-series-strongest/">what we've heard before since Leon was confirmed for the game</a>. Capcom wasn't confident it could deliver a horror game centred entirely around Leon, because players don't know him as a character who gets frightened. </p>



<p>Grace is therefore the balance and contrast between Leon, as the more timid, fearful character, whose gameplay stays closer to that of Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil VII, while Leon is the action-forward character we know and love, with his gameplay more akin to Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>"<em>In this title, it's like you're playing completely different games with Grace and Leon,"</em> Nakanishi says. "<em>Grace's parts are more similar to Resident Evil 2 and 7. Really entrenched in the horror aspects of the gameplay. Whereas Leon's part is closer to the thrilling tension featured in Resident Evil 4. Full-on action that doesn't focus as much on the horror aspect. It may be a survival horror game, but I think we've made an experience that suits Leon."</em></p>



<p>"<em>By combining Grace's horror and Leon's action and allowing you to play them side-by-side, we created an experience with an emotional range unlike any other Resident Evil title to date."</em></p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Nakanishi continued, "<em>The gap between tension and release is one of the things that makes Resident Evil so interesting.</em> <em>However, getting to experience the terrifying and atmospheric sections of Grace's gameplay, then switching to the dynamic, high-action Leon gameplay, offers a huge sense of catharsis. In a broad sense, each part is ordered to offer the ultimate balance of tension and release</em>."</p>



<p>Beyond divulging more about the gameplay ethos of Resident Evil Requiem, Nakanishi offered a couple of story-related hints to better place where Requiem takes place in the timeline, but didn't offer anything particularly revealing. He did, however, put special emphasis on Elpis, which clearly seems to be key to the story.</p>



<p>We also got a look at some updates to the game's crafting system and some of the changes to the zombies, like how zombies will now retain some of the characteristics from their lives. An example shown was the building's custodian continuing to clean, even while undead.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>As for the crafting changes, while Leon is able to clear a path in front of him with an array of weapons and deadly roundhouse kicks (he can even pick up an enemy's weapon and use it against them), Grace has to stealth her way through situations and find other means of dispatching zombies.</p>



<p>That's where the new crafting comes in. If you do manage to take down a zombie as Grace, you can use a sample of their blood to create Specialized Injectors that you can jam into a zombie. In the example shown in the trailer, one such concoction makes the zombie explode.</p>



<p>The showcase also showed off some of the differences between playing on its easiest difficulty versus standard, before getting into two collaborations Capcom has done for the game. One with Porsche, to design a car for Leon to drive in-game that's also been made into a real vehicle. </p>



<p>The other is with the watchmakers at Hamilton, which will sell two watches, one for Grace and one for Leon, inspired by their characters in the game. Both watches will be available in a limited supply, with only 1,000 of each being made, and they'll be available to buy the same day the game comes out on <strong>February 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Capcom also confirmed that Resident Evil Requiem will be available on <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> when it arrives next month, so you can expect it to pop up in an upcoming GeForce NOW Thursday blast. Requiem will also support NVIDIA's DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Lastly, the showcase ended by running through some of the bonuses you'll get by pre-ordering and purchasing the deluxe edition of the game instead of the standard, like additional costumes for Grace and Leon, one of which makes Grace look like Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil Village.</p>



<p>There are also new figures of both Leon and Grace being made that will be released sometime in Fall 2026. Capcom also has a Requiem-themed Switch 2 controller coming, and some Requiem Amiibo, though we unfortunately didn't get a look at the latter. The showcase also revealed a concert series, Resident Evil: Symphony of Legacy, that will feature performances across Japan, North America, and Europe.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#950)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 16]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-16-950/</link>
            <guid>1407706</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday – you made it! As another week ends, hopefully your NYT Connections streak <strong>doesn’t</strong>. If I can help you out today, I’ll consider my day a success, and to facilitate that, I’ll direct you to the clues and solutions below. To answer today’s NYT Connections challenge, simply scroll down and tick those boxes.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-16">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 16)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #950:</p>



<ul>
<li>PANAMA</li>



<li>ALABAMA</li>



<li>BATH</li>



<li>BAHAMA</li>



<li>SANTANA</li>



<li>BANANARAMA</li>



<li>SLAM</li>



<li>PAJAMAS</li>



<li>PIANO</li>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders’ Confusing New Skin Makes Sense, It Seems]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-skin-makes-sense/</link>
            <guid>1407703</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, Embark Studios unveiled the ‘Abyss’ skin bundle in ARC Raiders, introducing an outfit that fans had been waiting for since the game came out. It featured a unique, armored skin that was shown in earlier marketing materials, and the company dubbed it ‘highly anticipated’ when it dropped.</p>



<p>However, the <strong>lower portion </strong>of the skin had fans disappointed. It featured what many described as ‘leg corsets’, and the memes and AI rewrites flowed within minutes of the bundle being revealed. As it turns out, the Abyss outfit is pretty damn accurate.</p>







<h2 id="h-abyss-skin-is-an-old-fashioned-anti-g-suit">Abyss Skin is an Old-Fashioned Anti-G Suit</h2>



<p>The Abyss bundle was added to the ARC Raiders store for a premium price recently, rewarding those who’d waited an age (read: a couple of months) to get their hands on it. It’s a unique outfit that includes a bizarre, otherworldly helmet, a mess of tubing, pouches, and small machines, and of course, the <strong>leg corsets</strong>.</p>



<p>Each leg is adorned with a tightly-laced wrap, open at the knees to allow for a range of movement, and admittedly, it looks pretty ridiculous.</p>



<p>But a little internet sleuthing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1qd1jis/just_gonna_leave_this_here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by eagle-eyed fans</a> has uncovered a fact about the Abyss outfit.</p>



<p>It’s actually accurate, and it’s based on an old-fashion ‘anti-g’ suit, worn by pilots to ensure high levels of compression along the legs when sitting and flying for long periods of time. It would ensure optimum blood flow to the brain and prevent pooling in the legs. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The running theory is that the suit applies to those raiders leaving Speranza in their high-speed capsules, rocketing along rails at breakneck speed. That doesn’t necessarily make sense, given the fundamental purpose of the ‘anti-g’ suit.</p>



<p>That’s the topic resolved, then. It might look silly, but no, the ARC Raiders Abyss skin <strong>is not </strong>some kind of gimp suit or skewed, sexy lingerie. It’s a legitimate, retro-futuristic element based on something that genuinely existed – and in some ways, continues to exist today.</p>



<p>Case closed.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,647 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released new information, footage, and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Resident Evil Requiem [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em>, including new gameplay, additional details on the game’s Porsche and Hamilton collaborations, and more. <span id="more-1019594"></span> </p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Gameplay and Story</strong></p><p>FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft and Legendary <a title="Platforms > DS [55 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/ds">DS</a>O agent Leon Kennedy star as the dual protagonists of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, offering players a unique combination of death-defying <a title="Genres > Action [3,329 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and spine-tingling <a title="Genres > Survival [502 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Horror [804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>. As revealed previously, both protagonists will be playable in first-person perspective for deeper immersion, and third-person perspective for more dynamic action, swappable at any point during the game.</p><ul><li><strong>Leon Kennedy</strong> – Leon, experienced in both hand-to-hand combat and firearms, is investigating a series of suspicious deaths. While navigating this deadly situation, he’s able to wield a variety of weapons and execute close-quarters combat maneuvers with the all-new hatchet. Perfect Leon’s skills as you time your moves to parry enemy attacks, turn the tables as you attack with a chainsaw seized from an enemy, and pull off exhilarating finishing moves to deliver the final blow.</li><li><strong>Grace Ashcroft</strong> – Grace begins her survival journey in a sanatorium overrun with zombies, requiring fierce judgement when deciding which enemies to fight and which to avoid. Limited resources and carrying capacity force the player to make critical decisions that can mean life or death. Acquiring a special device allows Grace to craft vital items using infected blood, unlocking the opportunity to diversify your attack strategies. The Requiem assault revolver, a special nod to the game’s name, is a custom gun boasting immense power and will likely be your last resort for survival. With limited ammo, will you use it right away or save your ammo for the horrors ahead?</li><li><strong>Zombies</strong> – The zombies in this game have lost their minds, however some seem fixated on actions from their lives before death. A chef obsessed with <a title="Genres > Cooking [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>, a singer who keeps singing, a janitor who polishes mirrors endlessly…Could you exploit their behaviors to outmaneuver them?</li><li><strong>Elpis</strong> – Elpis is the keyword that connects everything: the death of Grace’s mother, Alyssa Ashcroft; Grace’s own past; and the story connected to Leon. It’s up to you, the player, to unravel the mystery that leads to the truth behind the events depicted in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>.</li><li><strong>Difficulty</strong> – Players can choose from multiple difficulties when experiencing the horror and action. Casual offers aim assist, plus more forgiving player health and enemy durability. Standard (Classic) heightens the tension, requiring Ink Ribbons for each save while playing as Grace, demanding strategy not only in resource <a title="Genres > Management [36 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> but also when to save.</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Resident Evil Requiem comes out next month, and fans have been frothing at the mouth for more news about it, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/leon-kennedy-takes-the-stage-in-resident-evil-requiem" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cc2d9a57-fdac-435d-a254-c1664b22eeab" data-entity-substitution="canonical">especially since seeing the Game Awards trailer that confirmed Leon's playability</a>. Today's Resident Evil Showcase gave us exactly that, with director Koshi Nakanishi breaking down the gameplay styles of both protagonists, Leon and Grace, amidst other tidbits of information about the game.</p><p>Capcom wanted to bring Leon back into the main series, especially after the success of the Resident Evil 4 Remake, but Leon's inherent combat skills and action hero vibe make him ill-suited for a full-on horror game. Grace Ashcroft is the solution to that, as her relative lack of experience makes her much more vulnerable and afraid of her encounters with zombies. Her sections play more like Resident Evil 2 or 7, Nakanishi says, while Leon's gameplay is very reminiscent of the remake of 4.</p>

<p>For example, Leon can parry again, but instead of his trusty combat knife, he now has a hatchet. Mechanically, it looks identical, and can be sharpened to maintain its durability. Leon can also take weapons from fallen foes – the showcase shows him parrying a massive chainsaw, shooting its wielder, and then grabbing it for himself. The footage also gives extra focus to how shooting specific body parts can be strategically helpful, like blasting out a zombie's kneecaps to stun them for a hatchet swing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Grace has much slower gameplay. We see her explore some kind of mansion, and while she has a weapon, ammo is much more scarce, so combat is worth avoiding if possible. That weapon, a large caliber assault revolver, is called "Requiem", which explains the game's title. Grace also shows off a new crafting system that requires zombie blood, so while fighting is especially deadly, the rewards might be worth it. One concoction is later injected into a zombie's neck, causing it to explode in a splatter of blood. Gross!</p><p>After showing some gameplay, the showcase moves on to remind players that either Grace or Leon's journeys can be played in first- or third-person, though footage typically shows Grace's camera perspective as the former and Leon's as the latter. There will also be a Casual difficulty option, which includes heavy aim assist, and a Classic option, which requires the player to find ink ribbons to save the game while playing as Grace.</p><p>The back half of the showcase is less gameplay-focused, explaining the game's collaboration with Porsche and watchmaker Hamilton, giving slightly more details about the deluxe edition, detailing the game's compatibility with GeForce NOW, announcing an upcoming worldwide concert series, and showing off some figurines of the protagonists.

This means you'll see zombies attempting to complete tasks like cleaning the environment, albeit in a completely deranged manner.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The showcase explains that careful observation of your enemies will allow you to either sneak around them or get the drop on them. If you're playing as Leon, you'll be able to parry attacks with a hatchet and execute brutal finishing moves while also picking up weapons dropped by the zombies. And yes, this includes a chainsaw. Grace's gameplay, meanwhile, is more akin to classic survival horror, placing emphasis on limited ammo.</p>
<p>Crafting also makes a return, and you'll actually need to extract blood from your fallen enemies to create specialised injectors. The description for one of these says "Prevents corpses from mutating", so it seems reasonable to assume that we might see some enemies similar to the Crimson Heads from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> remake.</p>
<p>The showcase also revealed three default difficulty levels for Requiem. Casual will add in auto-aiming to allow newcomers to ease into the experience, while Standard comes in both Modern and Classic forms. The latter brings back the Ink Ribbon items during Grace's gameplay, meaning your ability to save is finite. It's likely that a more difficult 'Hardcore' option will be available upon completion of the main game, but this wasn't mentioned.</p>
<p>It was also reiterated that you can change between first and third-person perspectives at any time during gameplay. Meanwhile, a Requiem Pro Controller will launch for the Switch 2 alongside the game next month, while amiibo will also arrive later in the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE">Hardware Unboxed</a> reported that Asus is winding down production of its RTX 5070 Ti, saying, Asus “explicitly told us this model is currently facing a supply shortage and, as such, they have placed the model into end-of-life status.” They added that the same applies to Asus’s 16GB RTX 5060 Ti, and mentioned how retailers in Australia have had trouble sourcing the product.</p><p>Nvidia’s director of global public relations for GeForce, Ben Berraondo, confirmed in a statement to <em>The Verge</em> that it’s still producing these GPUs: “Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability.”</p><p>Hardware Unboxed specified <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxjULwwm0m16AH8zznJZ34D2OVVGWEl3Ub">in a follow-up post</a> that this only applies to Asus, and added, “Whether or not AIBs actually receive enough supply to justify continued production is another question. Asus don’t seem to think so.” Asus did not immediately respond to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>This may not be the case for all manufacturers. For instance, PNY public relations representative Michael Farino confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that the Dual-Slot Slim (DSS) RTX 5070 Ti, <a href="https://www.pny.com/company/press-center/pny-press-releases/pny-announces-new-dual-slot-slim-models-for-nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series">which was just announced at CES</a>, is still on track to “start shipping [in] February, and will be at all the usual retail suspects,” including Best Buy, Micro Center, and Amazon.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s not surprising to see constraints hitting the more affordable versions of 50-series GPUs first. Christopher Moore, Micron’s VP of marketing, mobile and client business unit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">said to <em>Wccftech</em></a> last week that “What we’re doing now is trying to run as few pieces of silicon as possible to max out, few differentiated DIDs as possible to max out the output… We’re saying, you know, I know you used to wanna go from 12 gigabyte to 16 gigabyte, or 16 gigabyte to 24 gigabyte. Those changes actually drop our output. So we’re working with them to try and get our demand as steady as possible so that we can get our supply as steady as possible and maximize the output.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/863000/asus-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-5060-ti-supply-rumors]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Lenny Kravitz has commented on the inspiration for his character in 007: First Light and has given some insight into the recording process.</p>



<p>In December 2025, IO Interactive confirmed that Lenny Kravitz would voice one of the game’s main villains, an exclusive character named Bawma. The Grammy award-winning artist is now providing some insight into his inspiration for the role and the process of recording lines for the character.</p>







<h2 id="h-lenny-kravitz-pulls-the-curtain-back-on-bawma">Lenny Kravitz Pulls The Curtain Back On Bawma</h2>



<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8M3Xc-RBv-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During an interview with IGN,</a> Kravitz explained that some of the inspiration for the character came from some of the people he grew up around.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I grew up in the Bahamas as well as New York City. There were guys that had that vibe and that were doing things in the islands that I’d known, so I had a little bit of reference,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revealed that he did not have the opportunity to record lines alongside the rest of the cast. Instead, he just had the direction from those leading the project.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I hadn’t seen any other footage or heard any other voice-overs. So it was really sort of just in the dark, you know? They know, thus the director knowing kind of what he wants, because they know the balance, they know what all the other people are doing. I didn’t get to hear that.”</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[I'm Not That Nicole Carpenter]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/nicole-carpenter-modern-newsstand-mcclatchy-mystery-byline/</link>
            <guid>1407673</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On Jan. 7, I received an email from a Royal Caribbean International communications person asking for a correction to a story. The request said that I had used an image of Royal Caribbean's Liberty of the Seas cruiseliner in a story about a death on the Carnival Horizon ship, and asked if I could replace the image given that Royal Caribbean wasn't involved. A fair ask, for sure, but not something I could help with: The story was one I didn’t write, on a website I don’t write for.</p><p>When I clicked the link included in the email, I was surprised to see the byline was indeed Nicole Carpenter. The story appeared on MSN, Microsoft’s news aggregator, but was connected with the Tri City Herald, a McClatchy publication. There was no link to see what else Nicole Carpenter had written, nor was there a contact email attached. Just a note at the bottom: "This story was reported by content partner Modern Newsstand LLC."</p><p>I am somewhat familiar with the other Nicole Carpenters of the world. I've looked at the various online profiles that come up when I've Googled myself. Besides Nicole Carpenter the reporter who covers the video game industry (me), there's Nicole Carpenter the actor, Nicole Carpenter the women's leadership advocate, Nicole Carpenter the realtor, Nicole Carpenter the beach volleyball player, Nicole Carpenter the pest control expert. It's typically me and Nicole Carpenter the actor who take up the majority of the space on Google's first page of results, at least when I search.&nbsp;</p><p>I was intrigued to learn that there was another Nicole Carpenter the journalist. But after spending the last week or so looking for her, I'm not sure whether Nicole Carpenter the other journalist is even real.&nbsp;</p><p>Modern Newsstand has no online presence, but a company of the same name is registered as an LLC in Delaware and was incorporated in 2024. I reached out to Justin Levine, who lists himself as the CEO of Modern Newsstand on LinkedIn, to tell him that I'd been contacted by a confused communications person. He responded in a LinkedIn message: "Yes, this has come to our attention. Given your success and prominence in the industry, we have advised our writer to update her byline, bio and contact info for greater distinction. We will either use a middle name or make further adjustments." I asked him to confirm that she's a real person, and he hasn't responded.</p><p>But in the days after I reached out to Levine and then to McClatchy's communications person, rather than update Nicole Carpenter’s byline, all of her stories were removed from MSN. The pages now read, "This story is unavailable," and not only has Nicole Carpenter not posted a news story since, but it seems like Modern Newsstand has stopped posting on MSN as well. I don't know if stories being removed is common with MSN-syndicated stories, because I've found other links that don't work. Some of Nicole Carpenter's stories remain on another syndication service, NewsBreak, and they're all the same as what <em>was</em> on MSN. I've reached out to Microsoft, which owns MSN, and they haven't responded.&nbsp;</p><p>While Nicole Carpenter’s MSN-syndicated stories are connected to the Tri City Herald and other McClatchy publications, none of them appear on the actual Tri City Herald website, nor does her byline show up there. I reached out to McClatchy on Jan. 7, after the Royal Caribbean communications person emailed me. On Jan. 15, I got a response from McClatchy chief revenue officer Tony Berg. Berg didn't have much information about the Modern Newsstand operation, but he confirmed that McClatchy had a deal with the company to post content, tied to its brands, to syndication platforms like MSN and NewsBreak, and that McClatchy gets paid per views on those syndication platforms. He said that McClatchy had no control over the stories. (Previously a McClatchy spokesperson, in an email acquired by Aftermath, had said the stories were "produced by Modern Newsstand but reviewed by McClatchy editors.")&nbsp;</p><p>Berg also told me that in the past week or so McClatchy had stopped working with Modern Newsstand and that it's no longer a vendor of the media company. "We have no tolerance for people that are not following policies of what our vendor agreements are, and in this case, that was not being done," Berg told me.&nbsp;</p><p>Berg didn’t say what policies Modern Newsstand didn’t adhere to. And I’m not sure whether McClatchy learned of the issue through my email or had concerns previously. I asked Berg if Modern Newsstand used artificial intelligence to write the stories, and he said he didn’t know and said I'd have to ask Modern Newsstand. Berg said McClatchy didn't remove the stories from MSN, because the company has no control over the stuff that's published there.</p><p>There seems to be a small stable of bylines under Modern Newsstand, and the majority of them have the names of other verifiable journalists. I haven’t been able to find a profile or portfolio using any of those names that list Modern Newsstand, and I didn’t receive a reply from any of the verifiable journalists who shared names with Modern Newsstand writers who I reached out to. At the same time, many of the Modern Newsstand names are ones that are at least somewhat common, making it hard to tell whether this overlap is intentional. Many Modern Newsstand stories are still available on MSN; it's largely the Nicole Carpenter ones that have gone entirely missing. No new stories were published this week, however, which makes sense, since McClatchy cut ties.&nbsp;</p><p>The stories that Nicole Carpenter and the other Modern Newsstand journalists wrote are largely about national politics. They're very short, and always based on another publication's work with no backlinks to the source. They make heavy use of quotes, which sometimes comprise the majority of the story. They're not particularly well-written or interesting, though some of them get a ton of comments on MSN and NewsBreak. I haven't noticed any egregious errors, but I did find a user on Bluesky who had reached out to McClatchy after claiming to spot an error in a Modern Newsstand story that described Kamala Harris as the president, which they thought was weird, and possibly an AI mistake. (That story is no longer available to read.) They’re not the sort of stories I'd expect to see on reputable, local newspapers and publications.</p><p>I don't know a lot about what's going on here, but I do know that these are not stories I want associated with my byline. On MuckRack, which is a website that automatically makes portfolio pages for journalists, MSN is listed under my "As seen in" section, which might cause someone to think I wrote those stories. However, some of my actual stories have also been syndicated on MSN, through Polygon.&nbsp;</p><p>At best, this is all a very weird misunderstanding, and there's simply another journalist named Nicole Carpenter who has no online presence whatsoever, and works for a very mysterious content provider. At worst, Modern Newsstand is using the names of verifiable journalists to make its work look trustworthy. Somewhere in the middle, Modern Newsstand chose random pseudonyms to publish some of its stories under, one of which happened to be the same name as mine. And if, for some reason, Modern Newsstand chose to use my name, why? I don't cover national politics, unless they relate, somehow, to the video game industry. I'm not particularly well-known outside of my own beat. It doesn't make sense. (Nicole Carpenter the other journalist, if you are real and reading this, I'm sorry I said your work isn't particularly well-written.)</p><p>While I still can’t say for sure what’s going on here, the whole strange situation feels like it highlights the ways it’s harder than ever to know what news sources to trust. And while there’s no indication that Modern Newsstand’s stories are created by AI, I definitely wondered. McClatchy itself has <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/12/23/80385841/the-mcclatchy-news-group-is-pushing-ai-their-union-is-pushing-back?ref=aftermath.site"><u>been accused of using artificial intelligence</u></a> to create curated listicles summarizing McClatchy stories, which its union is pushing back on. Earlier this month, the day I got the correction request, media publication <a href="https://www.status.news/p/mcclatchy-newspapers-ai-reporting-policy?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Status reported</u></a> on a meeting with McClatchy leadership and the union in which the company "blindsided" the journalists with "the company's desire to aggressively integrate artificial intelligence into its workflow."&nbsp;</p><p>I still have a lot of questions, so if you know anything more about Modern Newsstand, please reach out. It’s hard not to look at this whole situation and just long for a human journalist, with a byline and photo, writing an article at a real outlet. It's a bad time out there for real journalists.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>GDC Awards</strong>, similar to the<a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/"> <strong>DICE Awards</strong></a>, are an awards show voted on entirely by game developers and industry professionals. Also similar to the DICE Awards, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">every other major</a> video game-related <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">awards show for that matter</a>, is the fact that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></strong> leads the pack with the most nominations, including a nomination for <strong>Game of the Year</strong>.</p>



<p>In fact, Clair Obscur is nominated in almost every single category included in the GDC Awards. To be fair, it's not a grand list of 20+ categories; there are only <strong>nine</strong> categories included in the GDC Awards. That said, Clair Obscur has been nominated in eight of those nine categories, which is still impressive, and a sign of just how much respect and adoration people inside the industry have for the game.</p>



<p>Out of the nine categories, the only nomination Clair Obscur is missing is a nod in the Social Impact category. As for other games that got multiple nominations, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">Ghost of Yōtei</a></strong> runs just behind Clair Obscur with five nominations, while <strong>Blue Prince</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a></strong> all have four nominations. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></strong> and <strong>Dispatch</strong> both walked away with three nominations.</p>



<p>What is different about the GDC Awards compared to other shows is that it lists Honourable Mentions for each category alongside the nominees. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> didn't receive a single nomination, but it did get three honourable mentions. </p>



<p>The GDC Awards will take place on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> and will be the day after the IGF Awards, unlike previous years, where both shows would take place on the same day during GDC.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of nominees, and the honourable mentions for each category:</p>
