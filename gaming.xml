            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-rayasianboy-n-word-kai-cenat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rayasianboy/video/2263792530?filter=clips&amp;range=30d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent broadcast</a>, Rayasianboy, a Taiwanese Twitch streamer who’s close with current Twitch king Kai Cenat and who has over one million followers himself, <a href="https://x.com/nojumper/status/1840901909965914471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divulged his greatest fear</a>: “Imagine saying the N-word, and your whole career's gone, bro. … Being a streamer, this is the hard part, bro. If you're not Black, bro, this is the hardest part of all time.”&nbsp;</p><p>In fairness to Rayasianboy, he was discussing this issue in the context of spending ample time around Cenat’s AMP crew, whose members are Black and who regularly use the N-word (not that that gives him a pass). He wasn’t just saying this in a vacuum. But in the past, non-Black streamers <a href="https://kotaku.com/top-twitch-streamer-ninja-rapped-a-slur-leading-to-a-f-1824157259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins</a> have recovered from ill-advised slur slippages, and as it turns out, so has Rayasianboy.</p><p>A cursory Google search turns up numerous clips of Ray saying or seeming to say the N-word, both alongside friends like Cenat and in isolation. Some are pretty undeniable, like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaicenat/clip/TiredCourteousAardvarkHumbleLife-9caOIT238eYkh-7H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this moment from a few months ago</a> where Cenat said “bitch ass [N-word]” and then Ray immediately parroted it back, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/P2a-OHY2PbU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another from 2023</a> in which he and Cenat sang a song together that contained the N-word. Others are less clear, like when Ray, whose first language is not English, didn’t even seem to recognize that he’d <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ktJbI9Nxpp0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pronounced parts of the word</a> during Cenat’s reverse-engineering of the Stanford Prison Experiment in 2023. In all these instances, Cenat laughed it off. Ray’s N-word usage has become enough of a meme among fans that they’ve <a href="https://m.twitch.tv/rayasianboy/clip/MagnificentSourNostrilOMGScoots-889zYIDfXa1TE-lC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused him of saying the word</a> even when he appears to be speaking his native language and using a phrase that just sounds similar to the N-word.</p><p>During the recent broadcast in which he voiced his concerns about the N-word, Ray jokingly almost said a word that sounded like the N-word before denying that he ever says it off stream and accusing viewers in chat of using it. Moments later, Ray <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxbNxnlrGqw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied to a video</a> in which Duke Dennis, an AMP member, called him “Ray-men Noodle” by coming up with racially-motivated jabs of his own including “Duke Fried Chicken,” “Duke Kool-Aid,” and “Watermelon Dennis.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, Ray’s career seems to be doing fine. Hope that clears things up.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shattered-space-suffers-from-a-lukewarm-launch-that-has-left-fans-disappointed.999117/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shattered-space-starfield-launch-disappointing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Starfield’s first major expansion was released in recent days, but it has been a less-than-stellar delivery that has left many fans with a sour taste in their mouths. Collectively, we’ve waited more than a year for the first expansion to be released by Bethesda Game Studios, but now that it’s here, fans have been quick to criticise it.</p>



<p>From low reviews to diehard fans voicing their disappointment on social media, and from a failure to gain traction on streaming platforms to a complete lack of hype for what comes next, Shattered Space has failed to soar.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shattered-space-didn-t-turn-things-around">Shattered Space Didn’t Turn Things Around</h2>



<p>It was a few weeks ago that I put a question to the community: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-shattered-space-save/">‘Will Shattered Space save Starfield?’</a></p>



<p>I’d say the answer is up there in black and white now that we’ve had a couple of days to sit with the expansion.</p>



<p>On social media, fans have been seriously critical of the first major Starfield expansion, which at best offers a few meagre hours of entertainment plagued by the same issues that garnered mixed reviews for the base game over a year ago. Even prolific personalities and top-shelf creators have found plenty of problems with Shattered Space.</p>



<p>For instance:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It took me 5 hours to finish Starfield Shattered Space's main story.</p><p>One of the most baffling story dlc's Bethesda has ever done. No where near the quality of Far Harbor. Feels more like cut content from the base game, a lengthy side quest. Very disappointed. <a href="https://t.co/BGBAkOv3SU">pic.twitter.com/BGBAkOv3SU</a></p></div>— Michael (@LegacyKillaHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/LegacyKillaHD/status/1841261735816081622?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Or how about a take from MrMattyPlays:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'll have my review out tomorrow, but to put it bluntly: </p><p>Starfield: Shattered Space is not good. At all.</p><p>The exploration is still (somehow) extremely lacking, the main story is ridiculously short, it ran like crap on Series X performance mode, there isn't any new companions,…</p></div>— MrMattyPlays (@G27Status) <a href="https://twitter.com/G27Status/status/1841383054381600863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Also on Twitter, user Luke Stephens wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Finished Shattered Space, accidentally, in an afternoon. I thought there’d be a lot more, but the main story is VERY short. Simply, it’s more Starfield. The writing is painfully dry, the characters act like they don’t want to be here, and the lack of optimization is painful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the biggest issues is that users are comparing Shattered Space to expansions released for Fallout 4 and Skyrim. It’s not even a fair contest at that point – some expansions, such as Skyrim’s Dragonborn DLC or Fallout 4’s Nuka-World, offered a huge amount of gameplay and plenty to explore, but Shattered Space doesn’t come close.</p>



<p>In the light of these impressive expansions, Shattered Space couldn’t ever put up a fair fight.</p>



<p>Another issue is that it took so long to deliver Shattered Space. It’s tough to see what took so long to piece this together, especially as updates for Starfield have been relatively few and far between over the last year. It took Bethesda Game Studios almost a year to add <strong>a rover </strong>to the game.</p>



<p>To throw another figure into the mix, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721670/Starfield__Shattered_Space/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shattered Space’s Steam reviews</a> are currently sitting at 58% negative, with many users complaining that it’s too expensive for what you’re getting.</p>



<h2 id="h-even-the-playing-star-field">Even The Playing (Star)Field</h2>



<p>To give a little credit to Shattered Space, it’s not <strong>all </strong>bad. On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/starfield-shattered-space/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>, some positive reviews have been secured by the expansion. For example, XboxEra gave the expansion a score of 9/10, stressing that the DLC is an ‘adventure you do not want to miss.’ Elsewhere, GAMINGbible gave the expansion an 8/10.</p>



<p>It kind of goes downhill from there, though – aside from some glowing community reviews from genuine players.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Looking at the numbers, Starfield didn’t exactly move mountains when Shattered Space was released. For instance, on streaming platforms, there wasn’t much growth at all. The game went from a peak viewer count of around 12,000 to just 38,000 on Twitch, and by today, that number has almost reset to where it was a week ago. </p>



<p>It’s a <strong>bit </strong>of an unfair comparison, but Elden Ring’s first expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, was released a few months back. That took peaks from around 30,000 – 40,000 to more than 400,000 users. When Destiny 2’s The Final Shape expansion dropped in June, the viewer count went from floating around 10,000 to 250,000 in a matter of hours.</p>



<p>Given the numbers that Starfield secured at launch, both in terms of sales and viewership, it comes as a dramatic surprise that Shattered Space has performed so badly one year later.</p>



<p>Starfield was a flash in the pan. It was dropped by many players mere weeks after it had been released, and even the ‘unique endgame mechanic’ failed to impress gamers. </p>



<p>From bizarre and boring NPCs to unforgettable factions, and rinse-and-repeat environments to a slew of bugs and performance issues, Starfield might have blasted off well in those first few days, but it broke up short of punching through the stratosphere, and that’s such a shame.</p>

Not only that, but the glasses then use that information to track down other details about the stranger including their address, phone number, past photos, and family members. According to the two students, AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio, they did this to raise awareness of what is possible with current tech and they have no plans to release it publicly. </p><p> Nguyen and Ardayfio call the project I-XRAY and showed a demo of it in action earlier this week on social media. In the video posted to Twitter, the pair were able to identify multiple strangers without asking them for any details, though some of the data proved to be inaccurate when the duo talked to the people. </p><p>“The motivation for this was mainly because we thought it was interesting, it was cool,” Nguyen told <em>404 Media</em>. Apparently, other people they showed it to also thought it was “really cool” and some suggested it could be used for “networking” or to “make funny videos.” However, thankfully, someone also mentioned to them how incredibly dangerous this tech could be in the wrong hands. “Some dude could just find some girl’s home address on the train and just follow them home,” said Nguyen.</p><p>As pointed out by <em>404 Media</em>, this kind of smart-glasses-facial-scanning tech has been around for a few years now.

            <p>
Crow Country, the acclaimed PS1-inspired survival horror adventure from Snipperclips developer SFB Games, is bringing its retro scares to PS4 and Switch on 16th October.
</p>
<p>
Crow Country - which launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in May - catapults players back to 1990 and the titular theme park of Edward Crow, a man who disappeared in mysterious circumstances two years prior. "Don’t be deceived by the whimsical surroundings," teases SFB, "something is awfully wrong in Crow Country."
</p>
<p>
Discovering what that something might be is precisely the task at hand as players, in the role of Special Agent Mara Forest, explore the theme park and investigate its long-abandoned rides, solving puzzles and riddles, chatting with the park's strange inhabitants, and battling the strikingly monstrous creatures roaming its confines.

<p>
And for those who'd rather focus on the mystery of Crow Country's story and its engaging puzzling, rather than dealing with the stress of its (slightly rubbish) combat, there's also a comparatively more tranquil Exploration Mode.
</p>
<p>
"Stuffed with silly jokes, relatable one-liners, and a self-aware irreverence that's surprisingly refreshing," Eurogamer's Vikki Blake wrote in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crow-country-review">four star review</a> back in May, "Crow Country doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, it packs in many of the tropes and conventions so associated with old-school horror, but it's not afraid to poke a little fun at them from time to time, too. Mara is at once both befuddling and beguiling, and a perfect companion as, together, you try to piece this puzzling mystery together."
</p>
<p>
And if a cheerful slab of clever retro-inspired horror sounds like just the ticket as spooky season gets underway, Crow Country will be available for Switch and PS4 on October 16th.

                <p>The Lego Nintendo Entertainment System set is a lot of fun to build and looks great as a retro display piece, but it's also quite pricey. The $270 set released over four years ago, but like many Nintendo games, you wouldn't know it based on its stagnant price at major retailers. Plus, even at full price, the NES and CRT TV model set is often sold out. But if you've been waiting for an excuse to finally pick up the 2,646-piece set, you can save a bit of cash at <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flegos-nes-and-crt-tv-model-kit-discounted-alongside-even-better-lego-mario-deals%2F1100-6526872%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a></strong> ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Big Deal Days</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fl%2Ftarget-circle-week%2F-%2FN-7196o&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flegos-nes-and-crt-tv-model-kit-discounted-alongside-even-better-lego-mario-deals%2F1100-6526872%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circle Week</a>.

NES cartridge as well. The end result is an intricate display piece., full of interactive elements like a working cartridge slot, rotating dials on the CRT TV, and a crank-operated screen that emulates a Super Mario level. It also has a very charming secret that will delight long-time fans.</p><p>If you thought this Lego set could be purchased for less than $270 at one point, you'd be correct. Released in 2020 with a launch price of $230, the Lego NES was one of many sets that received substantial price hikes in 2022. For the past two years, the Lego NES has remained at its $270 price--when it's available to purchase at all. Major retailers--sometimes all of them--are constantly sold out of the Lego NES.</p><h2>Lego Super Mario: More Display Models for Adults</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-World-Collectible/dp/B0CYM2V9FS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi (1,215 pieces)</a> -- $130 | Also at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fsuper-mario-world-mario-yoshi-71438&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flegos-nes-and-crt-tv-model-kit-discounted-alongside-even-better-lego-mario-deals%2F1100-6526872%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) at Amazon (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $255 (<del>$270</del>) | Also at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flegos-nes-and-crt-tv-model-kit-discounted-alongside-even-better-lego-mario-deals%2F1100-6526872%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Mighty-Bowser-Building-Collectible/dp/B0B2Y3WNH4?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Mighty Bowser at Amazon (2,807 pieces)</a> -- $234 (<del>$270</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXQ3M8JH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piranha Plant at Amazon (540 pieces)</a> -- $48 (<del>$60</del>) | Also at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F71426%2F2651673420%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flegos-nes-and-crt-tv-model-kit-discounted-alongside-even-better-lego-mario-deals%2F1100-6526872%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario 64 Question Block at Amazon (2,064 pieces)</a> -- $200</li></ul><p>If you find yourself scoffing at this deal, maybe you'll be interested in the more substantial discounts on two other Lego Mario display models for adults.</p><p>The 540-piece <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXQ3M8JH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Mario Piranha Plant is 20% off at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F71426%2F2651673420%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flegos-nes-and-crt-tv-model-kit-discounted-alongside-even-better-lego-mario-deals%2F1100-6526872%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>, which drops the price from $60 to $48, matching the all-time low.

Both builds have the same foundation, but about halfway through the process, you pick whether to create the Breath of the Wild or Ocarina of Time version of The Great Deku Tree. The Breath of the Wild build uses more pieces, so if you want to try both, the Ocarina of Time build is the easier of the two to both build and disassemble.</p><hr>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-kill-team-faction-rules-are-available-digitally<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, Games Workshop announced a new edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000-kill-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em></a>. This update to the skirmish-based spin-off game will begin proper with the release of the <em>Hivestorm</em> starter box. But for fans who already have their main team, Games Workshop has released updated <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> faction rules for free on their app.</p>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/xfV8vUOg/download-the-kill-team-app-and-faction-rules-today/">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop went into detail about the updated <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> faction rules. It opens with them putting the game into perspective. There are 33 playable factions in this smaller scale <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> spin-off game, available through boxed sets and issues of White Dwarf.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-kill-team-faction-rules-app-image.jpg?itok=fZS-HFNs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-kill-team-faction-rules-app-image.jpg?itok=FPqfvMWM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Since a new edition means these factions are getting a rebalance. Every one from the Novitiates to the Blades of Khaine to the Hunter Clade have gotten buffs and nerfs. Even the new <em>HIvestorm</em> factions, the Tempestous Aquilons and Vespid Stingwings, are included.</p>
<p>In addition, the updated <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> faction rules.are available through a newly launched <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em>. The app is available on iOS and Android platforms. It supports English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will allow players to download <em>Kill Team</em> Lite rules,updated faction rules, and print and share reference information straight from the app.</p>
<p>The app will also contain universal equipment rules. It contains the latest tactical information about ladders, barricades, grenades, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, the <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> app isn't a total replacement for the core rulebook or new faction books. If you want the full experience, you will need to pick up the new books or the new <em>Hivestorm</em> boxed set.</p>
<p>According to our official review of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>HIvestorm</em></a> boxed set, the newest edition of <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> does a good job streamlining the rules. This includes simplifying movement and defense, as well as implementing a new Counteract action. It even includes a new solo/coop mode called Joint Ops.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows currently has a co-op mode in development, which is scheduled to release post-launch.</p>



<p>The new co-op game mode, codenamed LEAGUE, is under development at Ubisoft but doesn’t have a set release date due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s recent postponement</a>, which is affecting the entire Assassin’s Creed pipeline. However, sources tell me that LEAGUE was in development long before the postponement and that this wasn’t an addition because of the delay. </p>



<p>While specific details on what the game mode actually entails are slim, presumably, the co-op mode will see Naoe and Yasuke fight side-by-side, using their different combat abilities to take out enemies. </p>



<p>That isn’t the only multiplayer Assassin’s Creed experience to hit players’ hands within the next 18 months, either. It’s understood that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-invictus-will-be-a-fall-guys-like-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Invictus</a>, a fully-fledged multiplayer experience, will come in 2025. </p>



<p>Other Assassin’s Creed games in development include an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake under the code name Obsidian and Codename Hexe, which has been described as “the darkest Assassin’s Creed to date”.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Insider Gaming reported on behind-the-scenes details on what happened with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think of Assassin’s Creed Shadows having a co-op mode? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

There are numerous pictures of him posing next to classic arcade games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/history-of-awesome-arcade-1982-history">Donkey Kong, Missile Command, and Space Invaders</a>, and he's been involved in various video game-related projects over the years, including directing the film adaptation of Ready Player One.</p><p>But while many adults lose their passion for gaming as the grow older, Spielberg is apparently still at it. There's just one thing: he doesn't like controllers.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/02/spielberg-arcade-1727894756903.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Steven Spielberg with the Maneater arcade game in 1975. Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"He loves story games and I'm always trying to get him to play Uncharted because it's Indiana Jones and I'm like, 'Hey, you'd appreciate this.' But he's like, 'I can't do controllers. I can only do keyboard and mouse,'" said his son Max Spielberg, himself a game developer, in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoDqKVExzkU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with MinnMax</a>.</p><p>His aversion is apparently strong enough that when Spielberg's son showed off his game, a co-op roguelite published by Dreamhaven, he had to be the one demo it because his father wouldn't pick up the controller. Hey, at least Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves has mouse and keyboard support on Steam, right?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's always a Call of Duty. He loves Call of Duty. He plays the story campaign</p></div><p>In any event, Max says that gaming is a big point of bonding between the two. "He loves gaming. He's the one who got me into it. He plays games. He's a big PC gamer. So that's kind of our bonding point as well. He's like, 'Hey, what's good? What Call of Duty should I be playing? Send me a list of the top five shooters and I'll get them downloaded, then we can play them together when you come over to the house."</p><p>He adds, "It's always a Call of Duty. He loves Call of Duty. He plays the story campaign."</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Max shares some more stories about Steven Spielberg's connections with the games industry, including the time he received a Wii Sports demo from Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto. Steven Spielberg, for his part, is hard at work on his next movie, which is said to be about UFOs and is due to release in 2026.</p><p><em>Photo by Marc Piasecki/WireImage</em></p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

			<p>Red Barrels has recently confirmed that they were the victim of a cybersecurity incident. Red Barrels are known for making the notorious Outlast games, with their most recent game being the multiplayer title, The Outlast Trials. Red Barrels has confirmed that no player data has been compromised in the cybersecurity incident, but there will be significant delays in production, as the incident targeted the development team. It appears that<a href="https://x.com/AlvieriD/status/1841558903836049813" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nitrogen Ransomware</a> committed the attack.</p>
<p>"The Red Barrels team regrets to announce that its internal IT systems were recently impacted by a cybersecurity event involving access to some of its data." While they weren't working on developing a new game publicly, they have stated that the development has affected their content plans for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-announces-brand-new-killer-and-map/">The Outlast Trials</a>.</p>
<p>"As soon as the event was detected, measures were deployed to secure the systems and the information confirmed therein. A group of leading external cybersecurity experts have been mandated to conduct an in-depth investigation into the incident. We also notified stakeholders potentially affected by the event and relevant authorities." The statement made by the Red Barrels team also makes sure to note that the employees have been offered "appropriate support."</p>
<p>Authorities and cybersecurity have already investigated the incident, and the statement reassures players that they have not been impacted in any way by the event. However, the team has noted that some of the content they were planning on releasing soon will have to be delayed, as it was significantly impacted by the event. While they can't share too many details at the moment as they continue to learn more information about the cybersecurity incident, they have commented saying that they will share more details in the near future.</p>
<p>"Faced with a constantly evolving cyber threat, the studio will continue to implement appropriate measures guided by the best practices to ensure a secure environment for our employees, partners and players." Red Barrels have stated that they are continuing to focus on The Outlast Trials, and the future of the multiplayer title.</p>
<p>Since this event is still fresh, they aren't able to provide more information about what exactly happened as thorough investigations need to be done, but they will give more information in the new future about what exactly has been impacted, and what delays players can expect in the future.</p>

You hunt monsters. To be more specific, <em>Monster Hunter </em>games let you and friends join up to hunt down large creatures in a sprawling fantasy open world. You collect gear and resources as you take down progressively tougher enemies solo or in co-op. Each entry shares this basic structure, with slight iterations on the formula. </p><p>While <em>Monster Hunter: World</em> isn’t the most recent release—that would be 2021’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-rise-is-tough-to-get-into-as-a-newcomer-1846579126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-rise-is-tough-to-get-into-as-a-newcomer-1846579126"><em>Rise</em></a></span>—it is still the best entry point for those wanting to dip their toes in. One of the hurdles new <em>Monster Hunter </em>players encounter has always been how slow the games are to start. It’s not an uncommon sentiment that the real fun of <em>Monster Hunter</em> begins in the post-game, which…isn’t a very convincing argument for those not already invested. <em>World </em>removes the slow start and immediately gives you and your friends reasons to want to learn more. </p><p>Some people might be particularly inclined to enjoy <em>Monster Hunter</em> this year thanks to the success of <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, another Capcom action-RPG all about long battles against impressive enemies. If you enjoyed the epic battles of <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, you’ll probably enjoy <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>. In <em>World</em>, even while you haven’t yet mastered combat, you’ll still have a great time swinging a massive club at a giant lizard to beat the crap out of them. At the end of the day, that’s what<em> Monster Hunter</em> is all about, and <em>World </em>is the best way to help you experience that. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai has announced he'll be wrapping up his acclaimed YouTube series Creating Games on 15th October, bringing his regular video uploads to an end.
</p>
<p>
Sakurai <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/masahiro-sakurai-launches-new-youtube-channel-on-game-development">launched his YouTube channel</a> back in August 2022, with the aim of helping "make games around the world a little more fun". His Creating Games series, available in both Japanese and English, saw Sakurai sharing his decades of expertise on "good" or "fun" game design, and was intended to be as accessible as possible.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Sakurai has uploaded an impressive 265 videos for his Creating Games series, covering everything from UI design and tips for using audio to marketing and work ethic. It is, in other words, an incredible resource from a world-renowned designer, and it's popped out more than a few gems of wisdom and fascinating tidbits along the way.

<p>
Back in 2023, for instance, Sakurai shared the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-kid-icarus-game-seems-unlikely-masahiro-sakurai-says">frankly upsetting</a> news a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kid-icarus-uprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a> was "unlikely", and he more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-smash-bros-director-so-sorry-to-fans-playing-for-thousands-of-hours">jokingly apologised</a> to Smash Bros. players for the "hundreds or even thousands of hours" they'd poured into the series thanks to his design.
</p><p>
But all good things must come to an end, and  - following advanced warning of Creating Games' impending demise earlier this year - Sakurai has now <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1841424960151228598">confirmed</a> the series is expected to end on 15th October. Of course, all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en/videos">existing videos</a> will remain available, and Sakurai has teased "a special finale episode to come afterward", with more details to be shared in the future.
</p>
<p>
As to what's next for Sakurai after his YouTube series ends, he hasn't explicitly said. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-smash-bros-ultimate-sequel-will-take-time-sakurai-says">comments made by the designer last year</a> suggest he's returning to Smash Bros. "What happens next time?" he pondered in one of his videos at the time. "I mean whatever comes after Smash Bros. Ultimate. One option would be to separate the series from the original creator. But for now, at least, I can't really imagine a Smash Bros. title without me."
</p>
<p>
"Smash Bros. is a massive, important title for Nintendo, so it's fair to assume there will be another one at some point, but it's going to take some work to figure out exactly how to make that happen. For my part, I'd like to keep working with Nintendo however I'm able."

It seems many are happy just to have received the follow-up to the previous <em>God of War </em>game after more than two years of waiting.<br></p><p>However, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-steam-framerate-network-login-1851654888&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-steam-framerate-network-login-1851654888">PC version isn’t without some problems</a></span>, as is commonly the case with these PlayStation ports. Though <em>Ragnarök </em>appears to be one of the more stable of the bunch, there have been mixed arguments about the game’s performance. Some claim to be playing the game with very little issue on systems that are several years old, while others who sound like they have suped up PCs have complained that the port still demands even more of them. Your mileage may vary, but it should kind of go without saying that if you’re expecting to run one of these blockbuster high-fidelity games, you should have quite the powerhouse PC. Even then, it might not be the most optimized experience.</p><p>There’s also a contingent of people in the Steam reviews making a big stink over something else, and it’s probably the dominating critique of the whole forum: PSN logins.
