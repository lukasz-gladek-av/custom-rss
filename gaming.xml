            <p>A new update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has been released to finally tackle issues with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> performance.</p>
<p>A new Balanced graphics mode has been added to combine Quality mode settings (and raytracing) with Performance mode resolution, targeting 40fps. It requires a display capable of achieving 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<p>The Performance mode has been adjusted for a more consistent framerate, while raytracing in Quality and Balanced modes will have a less noisy image. Perhaps more damning is the ability to switch off the PS5 Pro's PSSR entirely.</p>

<p>PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, is Sony's AI upscaling technology, but it appears to be causing issues for some developers - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/improvements-to-alan-wake-2s-ps5-pro-patch-still-not-ready">Remedy included</a>. Bloober also appeared to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-silent-hill-2s-ps5-pro-patch-is-another-update-with-glaring-image-quality-issues">issues with it for its Silent Hill 2 remake</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">latest patch</a> is available on PS5 as well as Xbox Series X/S and PC. On those other platforms, a couple of minor fixes have been implemented as well as other optimisations.</p>

			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently participated in the virtual <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/2024-annual-shareholder-meeting?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annual Shareholders Meeting</a>, answering questions on a variety of topics that involve the corporation's activities. Usually, on these occasions, gaming is largely ignored, being a relatively minor portion of Microsoft's revenues.</p>
<p>However, this time around, Nadella was actually asked about the early ROI (return on investment) on the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and about progress made in 2024 on the overarching gaming strategy outlined by Microsoft. Nadella was very positive in his reply, and he also touched upon some of the brand's changes related to multiplatform releases.</p>
<p><em>I’m feeling very, very good about where we are in gaming. In fact, right now, this is like the peak season for gaming, obviously with Black Ops and the new Call of Duty, and it’s just been fantastic to see the launch and the marketing around it, the buzz around it and the love for gaming.</em></p>
<p><em>If I think about it, right, we chose the secular growth category in entertainment, which we think is gaming, and said, let’s double down on it, let’s – and it’s been a passion for Microsoft ever since.</em></p>
<p><em>In fact, I think Flight Simulator launched before Windows or Office even, and so it’s like one of the longest franchises in this company. And so we said, let’s take that joy of gaming everywhere. And that’s why even these ads with Xbox now, where we are redefining what it means to be an Xbox fan, it’s about being able to enjoy Xbox on all your devices.</em></p>
<p><em>So our strategy with Activision content now is in full force. We feel fantastic about the progress we’ve made. And more importantly, I think, long term, as a company, we can bring the best of AI innovation, cloud innovation, console innovation, PC innovation to build the best games that can be enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</em></p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards 2024, Xbox fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that another of the former exclusives, The Outer Worlds 2, would launch day and date on PlayStation 5, too, after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/outer-worlds-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> only for PC and Xbox Series S|X back in 2021. It's another hint that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-exclusives-are-gone-for-good-says-jez-corden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> about Microsoft abandoning exclusives for good might be true. While fans may riot at the idea, it certainly makes financial sense, at least on paper.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has stated the company's belief that unique creativity is more important than development costs.</p>
<p>Discussing the rising cost of game development in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf">investor Q&amp;A</a>, Miyamoto admitted the company's development expenses have increased each year. "Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable," he said.</p>
<p>However, creative and intriguing ideas are most important, a view shared by other members of the Nintendo board.</p>

<p>"We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with," said Miyamoto. "With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System.</p><p>"Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing. However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings."</p>
<p>As a result, Nintendo aims to nurture developers who "take this unique concept to heart", allocate funds as necessary, and release games "only after we are confident in the product".</p>
<p>Miyamoto added it's "possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs".</p>
<p>"We believe that not all products require large costs," he continued. "Even in the case of video games, with the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time. We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective."</p><p>Senior managing executive officer and corporate director Shinya Takahashi commented: "I believe unique titles that are small in scale, but worth polishing can be created by expanding on the ideas of a small number of developers, rather than spending large sums of money on every game. While overall research and development costs are rising, there are certain products for which expenses remain relatively stable, depending on our approach."</p>
<p>Ko Shiota, senior executive officer and corporate director, added the merging of home console and handheld console for the Switch allowed Nintendo to integrate its development environments, which will continue with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Because we are already familiar with Nintendo Switch, maintaining a similar basis for development environments in the future will allow us to carry over the experience we have already built, which should lead to a reduction in research and development costs over time," he said.</p>
<p>The investor question follows high profile and expensive flops from the past year, including the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> from Warner Bros. and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-initial-development-deal-was-reportedly-200m-though-its-financial-and-human-cost-was-far-higher">cancelled Concord</a> from Sony.</p>
<p>Nintendo, meanwhile, is gearing up for its Switch 2 launch. While reports have suggested its graphics could be comparable to the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the ability to run Unreal Engine 5, its specs are likely to be less powerful.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In this modern world of £700 consoles and iterative updates it’s easy to forget the extra expenses involved in gaming – especially when it comes to controllers. When even basic controllers cost upwards of £50 apiece, any kind of local multiplayer becomes extra expensive. Multiply those costs by the various competing consoles and you have a wallet-busting experience. Gamesir have become increasingly engaged in the console and PC accessory space in recent years and their latest controller promises to solve the dilemma of multiple expensive controllers by offering one that works across PC, Switch, and mobile gaming, at an accessible pricepoint.</p>
<p><iframe title="GameSir Tarantula Pro - Pro by Name, Pro by Nature | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/20y-q2OJBag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Multi-format controllers are not a new idea. My 8Bit-Do Pro is my go-to for Switch and emulation but the Tarantula offers a few new tricks and has swiftly become my main choice for PC gaming. Opting for a Playstation layout with two parallel analogue sticks at the bottom of the controller, the Tarantula feels immediately familiar and comfortable in the hand. The sticks themselves are TMR (tunnelling magnetoresistance) – an even more precise magnetic system than Hall Effect – rather than the more widely used potentiometer system and feel far smoother and more responsive than the main console competitors. The huge advantage TMR has over traditional controllers is the lack of moving parts subject to drift – a factor that is a real blight on both Xbox and Playstation pads. Alongside the sticks we have a mechanical D-pad that feels satisfying to use.</p>


<p>The default button layout for the Tarantula echoes the Xbox standard and even shares the colour coding system. However, one of the coolest options here is the ability to switch between controller profiles and adjust the button layout accordingly. Holding the mode button and the requisite face button operates the mechanism that changes the button layout to the alternative Switch standard. This mechanism is visible through a transparent section and is the kind of satisfying design that would have Alan Partridge purring.</p>


<p>Other than the transparent window revealing the gears that work the switch mechanism the controller has a dark camouflage pattern that is unobtrusive if a little underwhelming. There are RGB effects across the pad as well as the illuminated button layout but the colours and brightness of these are easily adjustable if you want a plainer controller. Aside from the main face buttons there are multiple programmable buttons that by default act as Start and Select (or the system equivalent). The increased options available through these buttons are an interesting addition but I didn’t really find myself using them that much.</p>
<p>More useful are the programmable back buttons that are becoming a more popular choice on controllers. Even better here is the fact that you can lock them using a physical switch and prevent them from being pressed accidentally. The increased functionality on the back of the pad continues with more physical switches that can adjust the triggers to be either analogue or microswitched. This is a really nice addition as it enables the controller to be quickly altered to suit different genres with the microswitches being perfect for shooters and action games whilst analogue better suited to driving games.</p>

<p>The Pro version that I’ve been using also comes complete with a nifty charging stand that sits nicely on my gaming desk and keeps the pad ready for action. It can be connected via USB-C if preferred as well as offering both Bluetooth and dedicated dongle connection. I opted for the latter and have had no issues with latency or lag throughout my time using it.</p>
<p>So far so positive, and as mentioned earlier the Gamesir Tarantula is my new main PC controller but I did encounter some odd problems when trying it out on Switch. Initially connecting the controller didn’t work unless the Switch was in handheld mode – a weird glitch as that is not really the ideal use case for a pad. Once the connection was made however it remained connected on the Switch mode and could be used without issue. I’ve decided to carry on using my 8Bit-Do pad for Nintendo gaming but that’s more to do with my own addiction to multiple controllers than anything being particularly wrong with the Gamesir pad. The instructions link to a Gamesir app but this appeared to only be in Chinese and didn’t seem to include the pad under review at time of testing.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gamesir Tarantula Pro is a fantastic pad that can work across multiple devices and offers a comfortable and responsive option. The Playstation layout may prove to be a divisive choice but for those that prefer parallel controls this represents a perfect solution for PC, Switch and mobile gaming. Even without the many hidden tricks and programmable buttons, this pad comes highly recommended.	</p></div>

<p>Game Science’s CEO and founder, Yocar-Feng Ji, recently discussed Black Myth Wukong not winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Yocar-Feng Ji took to the Chinese social media platform, <a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/5111567333196223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a>, to express his dissatisfaction with Black Myth Wukong losing out on GOTY at TGA 2024. Feng Ji first spoke about how the award ceremony came along simultaneously with their ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatively large update</a>‘ for the title and how this project has spanned 7 years. He then talks about how the game was nominated across four categories and won the Best Action Game and Players’ Voice award, with the latter being more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji reveals that he had “a sense of loss and regret” (as translated by ChatGPT on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1he81dp/game_producer_of_black_myth_wukongs_post_after_tga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/PS5</a>) with Wukong not winning GOTY and states that the games nominated “were all exceptional”. However, he “can’t determine the criteria” for GOTY this year. Feng Ji said that he feels he came all the way to Los Angeles “for nothing”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji added that he was very confident about Black Myth Wukong winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024, so sure that he had written his acceptance speech “two years ago”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Black Myth Wukong has been a massive success for Game Science, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 10 million copies</a> and breaking several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurrent player records on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Black Myth Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed China’s gaming industry to new heights in 2024</a>. Also, check out the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boss Rush update</a> for the game.

<p>The Kappa secure container is one of the items that the game’s most die-hard fans aspire to unlock after every wipe (read: game reset). It takes a huge amount of effort to grab one, but after completing this relatively simple quest from Battlestate Games, you can get your hands on one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-temporary-greatness">Temporary Greatness</h2>



<p>The only drawback to this event is that you’ll lose Kappa when the game wipes in the coming weeks – but for those weeks, you’ll feel like a legend. Typically, each new wipe brings around a ‘race to Kappa’, with many streamers participating to see who can unlock the aspirational item the fastest.</p>



<p>It’s a beast of a task that requires collecting several rare items and completing dozens of in-game quests. The average player will never get within sniffing distance of Kappa before the game wipes, which is an event that takes place around once every six months.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-kappa-in-tarkov">How to Unlock Kappa in Tarkov</h3>



<p>To get Kappa, you’ll need to complete the new ‘Dark Times’ quest, given to you by Fence, one of Escape from Tarkov’s traders.</p>



<p>Dark Times requires players to venture into Factory at night and kill 30 targets using nothing but a TOZ-16, one of the game’s most cumbersome and pointless weapons. That being said, if you put the right ammunition into it, there’s no reason why you couldn’t get this task done in just a few raids.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you need to eliminate 30 <strong>targets</strong>, and not just PMCs. That means you can run in, blitz through fields of Scav enemies, and then hey presto, you’ve unlocked Kappa for the remainder of the wipe.</p>



<p>Have fun while the secure container is in your possession – it’ll be gone soon. Perhaps the added stash space will motivate you to chase Kappa next wipe, who knows?</p>

<p>In a blog post on the Call of Duty site, Activision has expressed what’s next for Team RICOCHET, the providers of COD’s anti-cheat mechanics. The post addressed the launch of Black Ops 6 and the subsequent release of Ranked Play, which was marred by an influx of cheaters that made grinding a miserable, impossible experience.</p>



<p>In a line, the team admitted that the anti-cheat systems used in Black Ops 6 simply weren’t good enough.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-missing-the-mark">Missing the Mark</h2>



<p>In the blog post on the COD site, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, <strong>we did not hit the mark</strong> for the integration of RICOCHET Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 – particularly for Ranked Play.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On social media, pro players worldwide were lamenting the state of Ranked Play, revealing clips showing them constantly brushing up against cheaters and malicious operators.</p>



<p>Further to the statement above, Activision went on to mention the obvious:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, several key changes are now being implemented. In addition to the 19,000 accounts already banned, the team is promising ‘increased velocity’ on suspensions, to kick cheaters from the game much faster. Team RICOCHET has also started to provide ‘further training’ for AI-based detection systems.</p>



<p>RICOCHET’s kernel-level driver and server-side protections are set to receive some serious upgrades that’ll be deployed alongside Season 02 and Season 03 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/12/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-december#:~:text=After%20a%20series%20of%20updates,01%20%E2%80%93%20particularly%20for%20Ranked%20Play." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post was closed</a> out with a request to keep reporting cheaters whenever you see them because, after all, there’s only so much these automated systems can do.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-dev-social-media-pegi-rating/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-dev-takes-to-social-media-to-reflect-on-18-pegi-rating.1063104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-dev-social-media-pegi-rating/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro secured the award for the Best Indie Game of 2024 at The Game Awards, a success that came just after the game shipped more than 3.5 million units. It has been a great year for Balatro, which was pieced together by a solo developer by the name of ‘LocalThunk’.</p>



<p>Recently, LocalThunk took to social media to rue the PEGI ratings change that was applied mere weeks after the game hit the market in February 2024. On Twitter, he compared Balatro to games like EA Sports FC, suggesting that he could drop his 18+ rated game to a 3+ rating if he added loot boxes and microtransactions to his game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-red-logo-looks-kinda-dope">‘The Red Logo Looks Kinda Dope’</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that LocalThunk doesn’t disagree with the 18+ PEGI rating that was given to his game in March 2024. He’s more ‘irked’ by the games that are given a lower rating despite having similar – or ‘worse’ – mechanics.</p>



<p>He uses EA Sports FC as an example, pointing out that they feature real gambling in the form of loot boxes and other, similar microtransactions. For the longest time, courts worldwide have debated the existence and purpose of loot boxes, and some territories have banned them entirely.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Since PEGI gave us an 18+ rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC</span></p></article></div>







<p>After posting this message on Twitter (now ‘X’), LocalThunk wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just to clear it up – I’m way more irked at the 3+ for these games with actual gambling mechanics for children than I am about Balatro having an 18+ rating</p>



<p>If these other games were rated properly I’d happily accept the weirdo 18+. </p>



<p>The red logo looks kinda dope</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=balatro&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-HRGPPBlRm8v8y6E9psaIxVdwU7I9vn_KrpZcbPWoxww&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the PEGI platform</a>, the strong rating is justified by saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game teaches – by way of images, information and gameplay – skills and knowledge that are used in poker. During gameplay, the player is rewarded with ‘chips’ for playing certain hands. </p>



<p>The player is able to access a list of poker hand names. As the player hovers over these poker hands, the game explains what types of cards the player would need in order to play certain hands. As the game goes on, the player becomes increasingly familiar with which hands would earn more points. </p>



<p>Because these are hands that exist in the real world, this knowledge and skill could be transferred to a real-life game of poker.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Balatro is one of 2024’s strongest games, and it has pulled in remarkable reviews throughout the year.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s an inherent issue with games like EA Sports FC receiving such low ratings despite featuring loot box-like mechanics? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 reached its highest ever concurrent player peak this past Sunday, confirming to all that the iconic first-person shooter from Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very much not dead</a>. This peak came less than 24 hours after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the trophy was lifted at the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>.</p>



<p>While this latest peak isn’t the highest in the history of Counter-Strike itself, it’s an incredible accomplishment for CS2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-upward-trajectory">Upward trajectory</h2>



<p>The Counter-Strike 2 player peak reached 1,740,261 concurrent players this past Sunday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/#48h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. This is the highest number of concurrent players on CS2 ever, roughly 180,000 more than the peak that was set when the sequel officially launched in September 2023. With the exception of June and July, the concurrent player peak has gone up every single month of 2024. Both monthly concurrent player peaks and player averages are up now compared to where they were when the year began.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new CS2 player peak did fall a few hundred thousand players short of the all-time peak set in May 2023. The all-time CS2 player peak of 1,818,773 concurrent players was brought on by both the release of the BLAST Paris Major viewer pass and the ongoing CS2 limited test. CS:GO player numbers jumped following the CS2 limited test announcement as players tried to increase their hours in hopes of getting access.</p>



<p>The Major typically brings in more players throughout its duration, as players make Pick ‘Ems selections, redeem souvenir packages, and open sticker capsules. Following Team Spirit’s victory, the players’ championship autographs will become available for purchase soon.</p>



<p>Despite widespread player concerns about the amount of content and the state of anti-cheat, among other issues, CS2 is showing no signs of slowing down or a diminished player count. It still remains the most actively played game on all of Valve by a considerable margin, and that likely isn’t changing anytime soon.</p>



<p>Is any game ever going to surpass CS2 on Steam? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast informed players about the upcoming <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list update. For those that play Standard, Vintage, Alchemy, Historic, Timeless, and Brawl format, no changes have happened.</p>

Wizards of the Coast state that Modern needs the most help. This is fair considering the last major shake-up happened in August with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-ban-list-update-bans-nadu-from-modern" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the banning</a> of <em>Nadu, Winged Wisdom</em>.</p>

<p>This latest <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list includes the popular card, The One Ring from the Universes Beyond set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-revealed-for-lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth</em></a>.</p>

<p>The reason for this is the precious card has been used in a wide number of deck strategies in the competitive scene. It's a colorless artifact, allowing to work with any color deck, provides creature protection and the ability to draw cards, providing a card advantage. Finally, it synergizes well with the current dominant strategy of Modern: Boros Energy.</p>

The reason for these bans all relate to making Boros Energy strategies less viable in the current meta.</p>

<p>But some cards are coming off the ban list with this decision. Four cards will return to Modern: <em>Mox Opal</em>, <em>Green Sun's Zenith</em>, <em>Faithless Footing</em>, and <em>Splinter Twin</em>.</p>

<p>According to Wizards of the Coast, the competitive scene of the game has changed so much, the strategies leading to these cards bans aren't as viable anymore. Hopefully, this leads to continued health in the current meta.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of recently-announced virtual pet simulator game Catly has responded to allegations that the game's trailer and marketing was produced using generative AI, saying that no such technology was used in its announcement at The Game Awards, nor in the game itself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement shared with IGN, a PR representative authorized to speak on behalf of developer SuperAuthenti said that generative AI was not used to produce the trailer, nor the game. Furthermore, the representative said the developer was "very surprised by such speculations," adding that "We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PR representative also showed IGN a version of the trailer from The Game Awards that showed in-progress shots interspersed alongside the final version, which did seem to confirm the lack of AI use in the actual trailer production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the PR representative said that other allegations suggesting that Catly was a blockchain game were similarly unfounded. They said that there has been "zero blockchain technology" involved in Catly or the company behind it, SuperAuthenti, and similarly there are no NFTs. "Our company/project has never issued any blockchain currency and any NFTs. Our company does not and has never owned any blockchain currency and NFTs."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Catly Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The spokesperson confirmed to IGN that Catly is being made in Unreal Engine 5, and said the developer uses "various software" to produce hyperrealistic fur and hair. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assertions that Catly was using generative AI technology began to circulate almost immediately after its trailer debuted at The Game Awards last week. The trailer itself featured hyperrealistic cats with brightly colored fur and features bounding around a fantasy playspace and interacting with a human wearing various detailed, high fashion outfits. The art style present was flagged by many critics as reminiscent of the hyperrealistic style often produced by generative AI. That said, Catly's statement is consistent with the current reality that game trailers of this quality are not within the reach of current generative AI technology without significant, obvious artifacting and other issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, others pointed out that while the trailer may be legit, the other aspects of Catly's promotion are still giving some off vibes. For instance, the game's Steam description awkwardly reads, "A Cat Open World, with Beautiful Cats. Hyperrealism, Actions, Cuddle, Speed, Islands, Fashion, Dreams, Snow, Robots, Plants -- all with and via Cats."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a few of the game's promotional art pieces had odd details similar to AI artifacting, such as the odd paws and nose of this cat:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/catly-tga-poster-1734378475267.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And the text on the wall inside the right-hand side of the building in this image:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/catly-scenery-poster-1-1-1734378505910.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/comment/m1zej2e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unearthed more images</a> from the official Catly website that have since been removed, but which appear to raise even more questions about their veracity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 5:57pm: </strong>A previous version of this story claimed the website had been down all weekend, but the URL for the official website provided to IGN was incorrect, and the website has remained live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While SuperAuthenti confirmed to me that it did not use generative AI in either the trailer or the game itself, it did not respond to my question about its promotional images on Steam or on its website.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for web3, speculation of the game's ties to the technology surfaced as individuals unearthed the studio co-founder, Kevin Yeung's, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/catly_has_direct_ties_to_ainftblockchain_gaming/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ties to other blockchain games</a>. Additionally, the game's Steam page features a glowing quote from League of Legends and Arcane producer Thomas Vu, who himself is a prominent web3 investor. However, it also contained a quote from Hearthstone and Marvel Snap creator Ben Brode, who has taken to Bluesky to say that he's heard nothing about either AI generation or web3 involved in Catly, and that his interest is sincere. "I saw 20 [minutes] or so of gameplay footage a few months back and thought it looked cool so they asked me for a quote," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social/post/3ldbyrd72z22h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it does seem that SuperAuthenti is telling the truth about the Catly trailer at The Game Awards, though the question of whether or not, or how much, generative AI has been used in Catly's overall development and promotion remains to be seen. Generative AI is becoming an increasingly popular tool for game companies, too. Call of Duty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">reportedly sold an "AI-generated cosmetic"</a> for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in late 2023, and fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">accused Activision of using generative AI again for a loading screen this year</a>. EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">AI was "the very core" of its business</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, as the technology becomes both more prevalent and more complex, it seems likely it will become increasingly difficult to tell the difference between AI-generated and human-crafted work. In Catly's case, we'll have to wait for 2025 to find out more about what exactly is behind those hauntingly rainbow cat eyes from the trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>A crossover between Helldivers 2 and the Killzone franchise has seemingly been leaked, potentially featuring new armor and weapons.</p><p>According to Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1867412305195282746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1867412305195282746%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iron_S1ghts</a>, the crossover is reportedly called Righteous Revenants Warbond. The user has been datamining the game for months on end, and has previously leaked the designs of the new enemy faction, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellDiversLeaks/comments/1c7cyq1/illuminate_adept_mage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Illuminate</a>.

The other one is called AC-2 Obedient, which has the same passive ability, but offers less protectional in exchange for more speed and stamina recovery. Sony has not made any official announcement yet.</p><p>Arrowhead Studios said earlier this year that it'd be open to crossovers but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-devs-are-open-to-crossovers-but-only-if-they-make-sense/1100-6522756/" data-ref-id="1100-6522756">"only if they make sense."</a> Given that Helldivers 2 and Killzone both have fascist themes, this particular crossover seems like a great match.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/day-of-the-jackal-river-udc-redmayne<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Peacock’s <em>The Day of the Jackal</em>, a new adaptation of the novel by Frederick Forsyth, is pretty great television. There’s just one part that makes no fucking sense and causes me to laugh hysterically every time I think about it.</p><p><em>The Day of the Jackal</em> is an enjoyable cat and mouse game about a terrorist and a counter-terrorist operative trying to stop them. Eddie Redmayne stars as the Jackal, using his uncanny valley qualities appropriately to portray an exacting assassin who always gets his target, slipping in and out of new identities and leaving the scene without a trace. Lashana Lynch is an absolute revelation as the MI6 agent hot on his trail, struggling to balance her dedication to her job with the havoc it wreaks on her personal life. The only real problem with the show is the Jackal’s target: a tech entrepreneur with a killer app that does… something.</p><p>The motivations for the hit on this target make perfect sense. Ulle Dag Charles, or UDC, played by Khalid Abdalla, is like a reverse Peter Thiel in that he’s a weirdly menacing gay tech billionaire who, instead of ruining the world for his own benefit, wants to take down his fellow billionaires. The billionaire class has taken note, and they’ve hired the Jackal to kill UDC before he can do any damage.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Day of the Jackal | Official Trailer | Peacock Original" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shsIx-ZVL0E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It’s just that UDC’s methods don’t make sense—and not only that, the show seems determined not to clarify them. UDC aims to change the world by releasing a killer app, River, which will… like, and, such as? Sometimes characters on the show say it will “provide economic transparency,” though they do not say how. Often UDC implies that it will allow people to look at anyone’s bank account, which simply raises more questions than it answers (like: why? We are already painfully aware that rich people are rich? Also I have some privacy concerns). In one scene, UDC describes the purpose of River as revealing the flow of money, which, again, is something that is already possible to track, though it can take a little leg work.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever UDC gets close to describing what River will actually do, the show interrupts him. In one very funny moment, just as UDC is about to launch River, literally the moment when he is about to explain what River even is, a second, non-Jackal assassin appears and fires at him, scattering the crowd and ending UDC’s launch event. It’s made all the more comical because if I am interpreting the show I half watch while stoned with my husband correctly, River doesn’t actually do anything or reveal any information that the billionaire class would be worried about. We know rich people are rich—they truly aren’t trying to hide that! We know that they use that money to do terrible things and that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/02/1248693512/boeing-whistleblower-josh-dean-dead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-whistleblower-john-barnett-suicide-police-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things</a> seem to happen to those who call them out.</p><p>I know that <em>The Day of the Jackal</em> is more about spy nonsense than whatever UDC is doing, which is why I can let it all slide. Redmayne and especially Lynch have two compelling performances that rise above whatever silliness is going on with River. Still, I hope the writing team can create a stronger target for the Jackal in their second season. There’s plenty out there that scares the ruling class. Why not try a charismatic Italian-American who’s been denied a healthcare claim?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/australian-video-game-list"><h3>You Should Play An Australian Video Game, Many Of Them Are Very Good</h3></a><p>From Plucky Squire to Wild Bastards, some of 2024's best games came out of Australia</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After Valya catches her up on the Sisterhood losing its hold on the royal palace with Emperor Corrino refusing to have a Truthsayers, Francesca returns to sway Emperor Corrino in favor of appointing Constantine as the leader of his new fleet, without him knowing he was being manipulated to do so.</p><p>However, Valya doesn’t simply order Francesca to do so with the Voice or with threats, but rather by appealing to Francesca’s love of her son. Francesca is the trump card she’s playing now that her previous attempts to remind Emperor Corrino of the order’s influence on him have backfired. Remember, Valya’s ultimate plan is to have Emperor Corrino’s daughter Ynez (Sarah-Sofie Boussnina) study to become a Bene Gesserit so that the Sisterhood can have one of their own sitting on the throne of the Imperium to protect them from any impending trouble. For an unspecified (but clearly lengthy) period of time, Francesca wasn’t able to be around Constantine. Speaking with <em>Kotaku</em>, Tabu says she thinks that is what underscores the character’s hidden power.  </p><p> “I think she was purposely kept away from the son because for Valya, it could have been dangerous if Francesca was lurking around in the palace. Francesca has a very powerful position if she wants to utilize it. She can play her take-the-son card anytime she wants because  he is the natural heir to the to the throne.”</p><figure id="" data-id="6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-recommend-id="image://6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Attila Szvacsek/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-recommend-id="image://6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>She reasons that Francesca was kept away so “she does not become powerful, put her son on the throne, and turn against Valya.” Judging by the way Emperor Corrino nearly leapt on her in a moment of passion the minute he saw her, Francesca has a strong hold on his heart, which means she can control him. Her mere suggestion that the Emperor give his son more responsibility was enough to lead him to appoint Constantine the leader of his new fleet. If she’d been around during her son’s upbringing, who’s to say Francesca couldn’t have swayed Javicco to let Constantine be the next leader of the Imperium?</p><p>That question becomes harder to answer when you factor in how she refuses the Emperor’s romantic advances in the beginning of the episode, before submitting to them near the end. This could easily be looked at as typical Bene Gesserit sexual manipulation. However, the woman who plays Sister Francesca doesn’t think it’s so easy to determine. “She says she does not want to come between him and his wife, but she has very strong feelings for the emperor. She also wants to secure a place for her son,” she explains. “I don’t think she was just playing him for the sake of the Bene Gesserit.”</p><p>No Bene Gesserit is more closely tied to the throne than Francesca, which makes her one of the most powerful members of the sisterhood on the show in terms of influence. We’ll have to wait until the final episode to see if that influence helps or hurts Valya in the end. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft-wants-to-change-the-%E2%80%98far-cry-formula%E2%80%99-with-far-cry-7-and-maverick.1062879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2023, Insider Gaming had several reports on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry series throughout the year.</a> Notably, the Far Cry series currently has two games in development, which were both originally under the same game and codenamed Talisker. Its next mainline title is now under the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">codename Blackbird</a>, and an extraction-based shooter is under the codename Maverick. Both games are still in development at the time of writing, but their release dates have been pushed back internally from 2025 to 2026 due to complexities in development.</p>



<p>Moving from Dunia to Snowdrop and under development at Ubisoft Montreal, both games are set to move away from the ‘Far Cry formula’. Maverick, which takes place in the Alaskan wilderness, will see players fight one another, animals, and the harsh weather to survive. On the flip side, Blackbird will now see the player have to rescue his family (NOT played by Cillian Murphy), who have been kidnapped by a conspiracy cult who have been performing hallucinogenic experiments on animals and children. It’s said that the player has 24 real-life hours (72 hours in-game) to rescue their family, and the timer is reflected in-game by the player wearing a watch on his wrist.</p>



<p>But it isn’t just the gameplay loop of both games changing. It’s understood that both games have had a significant overhaul to their movement systems, too, including the addition of tactical spriting, sliding, vaulting, and more. Seemingly, this is due to both projects originating from the same game and sharing similar movement mechanics, with the similarities of both games bleeding into one another. Other aspects, including the inventory system and looting, also appear to bleed from the extraction-based shooter into Blackbird, too, with sources outlining that it doesn’t affect the mainline entry. “I’d argue it makes a lot of sense given your desperation to rescue your family,” said one source when asked.</p>



<p>Internally, Ubisoft Montreal and its supporting studios on Blackbird are optimistic, but some concerns over Maverick and its future loom given recent events at the publisher. Ubisoft has been attempting to do a Far Cry multiplayer for the best part of a decade, and while an extraction shooter could make a lot of sense for the Far Cry universe, it was ultimately greenlit to chase trends, and the genre doesn’t seem to have attracted the player’s numbers that the industry thought it would. </p>



<p>Defiant’s recent cancellation and subsequent layoffs felt like the beginning of a downward spiral, said some staff, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=yves" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yves’ internal memo</a> following the announcement of its cancellation not inspiring much confidence in those already unsure about their project’s future.</p>



<p>For now, though, Ubisoft is seemingly trying to break its own trend of chasing trends, and Far Cry 7 (or whatever it’s called) and Maverick seems to be a step in the right direction, albeit a considerable risk. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Throughout the entirety of 2024, it was a three-horse race to see who would be the best of the best Counter-Strike 2 players in the world. Three superstars, two of which are still in their teens, put up dominant performances during the most prestigious CS2 events all year.</p>



<p>By the end of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, and thus the 2024 CS2 calendar, one name stood the tallest amongst the best CS2 players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-of-2024">Best CS2 Players of 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-danil-donk-kryshkovets">Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</h3>



<p>Thanks to a historic performance at the Shanghai Major <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/">culminating in his first Major trophy</a>, Team Spirit’s 17-year-old donk is the unquestionable best CS2 player of 2024. In Shanghai, donk <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/">posted the highest ever player rating at a Major ever</a> while becoming the youngest MVP ever. Donk’s mastery of crosshair placement, crouching, and the “donk slide” combined with his utmost confidence has been nearly unbeatable all year. And he’s just getting started.</p>



<h3 id="h-ilya-m0nesy-osipov">Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another special young talent that dominated 2024 is G2’s star AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov. After a breakout 2023, m0NESY showed no signs of slowing down, and is still the most lethal player in the world with the AWP in his hands. He has amazing aim and reaction speeds, but also the game sense of a veteran. Even though the AWP is the most dangerous tool in his arsenal, he can also produce highlights or clutches with a rifle if pressed to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-mathieu-zywoo-herbaut">Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>ZywOo feels like the elder statesman when comparing him to actual teenagers like donk and m0NESY. But the prodigy and multi-time HLTV Player of the Year winner is still one of the best Counter-Strike players of the year. He put up nearly identical numbers as his younger adversaries <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at big events</a> all year, and has grown more dangerous with the rifles after dominating with the AWP earlier in his career. He always delivers in big moments for Team Vitality, and the guy who’s been dominating Counter-Strike for half a decade is still only 24 years old.</p>



<p>Which of these three deserves to be called the very best CS2 player of 2024? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>
