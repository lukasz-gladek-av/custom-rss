		<p>Rockstar Games has announced it is acquiring the Australian based game developer Video Games Deluxe, though it has not disclosed the fee. Video Games Deluxe has been a long time partner studio of Rockstar Games, having worked on the re-release of LA Noire and LA Noire: The VR Files, along with updating Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. Going forward, the name Video Games Deluxe will be dropped and the studio renamed to Rockstar Australia.</p>

<p><em>“After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia,</em>” said Rockstar Games Head of Publishing, Jennifer Kolbe in a statement.</p>
<p><em>“It’s been an honor to work closely with&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;this past decade,”</em> said Video Games Deluxe founder&nbsp;Brendan McNamara. <em>“We are thrilled to be a part of&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.”</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe was born out of the ashes of Team Bondi, developer of LA Noire, and was founded by Brendan McNamara. We do not know what this means going forward. It could be that Rockstar Australia will support with content and updates for Grand Theft Auto VI, or it could be a signal of intent by Rockstar to have another studio out there that can create more games.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">GTA 6 is currently slated for a release in 2025</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, with the reveal trailer that arrived back in December 2023 confirming the game is taking us back to Vice City, and introducing us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist.</p>

After playing a few hours of Sandfall Interactive’s dark fantasy RPG, I can say that <em>Expedition 33 </em>grasps the melodrama of modern <em>Final Fantasy</em> and marries it with the tactical turn-based combat fans of that series have been craving a return to for decades. On top of this, the game also has a <em>Paper Mario</em>-like timing mechanic to make that combat about more than just picking which attacks and items you use during a turn. Sandfall Interactive is cooking with some excellent ingredients, and the small taste I’ve gotten has me eager to try the full meal.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195840" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Take A Tour Through Halo Infinite's Newest Arena Maps" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="284" data-playlist="195840,196789,195624" data-current="195840"><div><p>Take A Tour Through Halo Infinite's Newest Arena Maps</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21353.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If I wasn’t already on board for the incredible voice cast led by standouts like <em>Daredevil</em> actor Charlie Cox, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s Jennifer English, and Clive Rosfield himself, Ben Starr, I would have been pulled in by <em>Expedition 33</em>’s tragic premise. In this world, a malevolent sorceress paints a number each year, and everyone in the world who is of that age is Thanos-snapped away. The titular expedition is made up of people who go on a journey to try and stop her, but even in thee early hours I played, there’s little hope that they’ll actually succeed. The expedition seems more concerned with carving a path for those who eventually can. No one hopes for much in a world where everything you know and love can be gone in the stroke of a paintbrush. Growing old is so improbable that meeting a senior citizen is like finding a member of an endangered species. The world of <em>Expedition 33</em> feels so far gone to the cast trying to save it that the act of trying feels like a futile suicide mission. It is deliciously dreary, like listening to the most heartbreaking emo song I’d ever heard on a loop, reveling in the melancholy just to feel something.</p><p>In the short time I got to play <em>Expedition 33</em>, it introduced plenty of lore and jargon that I hope will make more sense when seen in the context of the full game, but even if I don’t know what all its proper nouns mean yet, I’m already intrigued by how the game commits to a broken world that feels beyond saving. And yet, the party moves forward anyway. It’s tantalizing, and luckily the turn-based combat is just as compelling.</p><figure id="" data-id="e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-recommend-id="image://e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A turn-based battle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A turn-based battle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-recommend-id="image://e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A turn-based battle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Expedition 33 </em>has most of the standard pillars of a turn-based battle system such as elemental weaknesses and party members who specialize in different roles. But there’s a refreshing blend of active combat systems to make fights feel more involved and less repetitive. Each character has original mechanics; as he uses standard attacks, for instance, the swordsman Gustave builds up a reserve of stored power which you can unleash after you’ve charged up enough for your liking, while the mage Lune makes use of “stains” that can be inflicted upon foes and used to increase the power of certain spell combinations. But in between those strategic decisions, you also have quick time events to juice up attacks, ranged attacks that you aim by hand to target weak points, and a dodge and parry mechanic to waste your opponents’ turns. I enjoy these defensive options in premise, but I’m not sold on the execution of them just yet. Some attacks that enemies dish out have a rhythmic quality that makes them easy to read and execute dodges or parries. Others feel more clunky, arbitrary, and difficult to react to. Some of that game sense will likely come with more time, but it was still a frustrating obstacle in some of the more difficult boss fights.</p><p>That small wrinkle aside, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> oozes drama, tactical depth, and style. I can’t wait to dive into it when the game launches on April 25. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rockstar Games will acquire Video Games Deluxe and rename the studio to Rockstar Australia, it has been announced.</p>



<p>In the press release announcement (via <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250303172250/en/Rockstar-Games-to-Acquire-Video-Games-Deluxe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">businesswire</a>), it was said that Rockstar Games will acquire the studio, but did not disclose the sum.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-champions-release%E2%80%94platforms-everything-we-know.1123728/</guid>

<p>Whisper it, but the release of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions instantly gives a Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling. The Pokémon&nbsp;Company surprised everyone with its announcement, but now it’s out in the wild, it’s time to prepare yourself for battle.</p>



<p>Older Pokémon&nbsp;fans will remember the glory of Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium 1 and 2. The larger-than-life titles focused on the series’ core combat and head-to-head encounters. Exhilarating battles brought to life in huge arenas with flashy visuals and sizzling sound effects. The last 25 years have seen a slew of Pokémon&nbsp;titles, but none similar to Stadium. </p>



<p>Say hello to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon&nbsp;Champions</a>—a seemingly spiritual successor to the Stadium years. It’s an entirely new AAA release, and its launch might surprise you for a couple of reasons.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-pokemon-champions-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stadium vibes. Credit to The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions doesn’t have a release date or an estimated window. All we know for sure is it’s “Now in Development,” and updates on its progress will arrive as and when they are ready.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Pokémon&nbsp;Presents</a> showcase is where we first learned of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions. A new Pokémon&nbsp;title was rumored to be shown off during the presentation. But it was expected to be another remake or perhaps a remaster. </p>



<p>Instead, a full trailer for Pokémon&nbsp;Champions was revealed—showing off its glitz, glamor, and gameplay. You can check out the debut announcement trailer right here.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-champions-platforms">All Pokémon&nbsp;Champions Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is a multi-platform release for Nintendo Switch and mobile.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not just an exclusive Nintendo release and that’s it. Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is also coming to mobile platforms too. The official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik6IGiCzFzQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube trailer</a> announcement’s description confirms as much.</p>



<p>“Look forward to cross-platform battles alongside your favorite Pokémon on Nintendo Switch and mobile, with a variety of different modes available for your desired experience,” it says.</p>



<p>For now, we presume it’s the Nintendo Switch, but a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release is likely on the cards as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-pokemon-champions">What is Pokémon&nbsp;Champions?</h2>



<p>Even though a lot of the content is quite cryptic, there’s a definite Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling with big-time battles in large arenas again. It also looks like Pokémon&nbsp;can turn into Tera Types too. </p>



<p>It’s also confirmed Champions “Will feature familiar mechanics such as Pokémon types, Abilities, and moves, creating an environment conducive to rich and varied strategies for new and experienced Trainers alike.”</p>



<p>We’re sure we’ll learn much more about Pokémon Champions as time passes.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games made a big announcement today--but it seemingly has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. The company announced that it has acquired the Sydney, Australia-based game developer Video Games Deluxe, a studio with ties to LA Noire. Going forward, the studio will be re-named Rockstar Australia.</p><p>Video Games Deluxe had a long history of working with Rockstar prior to this acquisition, as the studio teamed up to help co-develop LA Noire and GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara previously established the Australian studio Team Bondi, which created LA Noire for Rockstar Games.</p><p>McNarmara said in a statement, "We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible."</p><p>Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p><p>As for Team Bondi, the Sydney-based studio named after the iconic beach, released LA Noire in 2011 with Rockstar Games as the publisher, and it was the company's one and only release. The game was a success by some measurements, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-at-odds-with-team-bondi-report/1100-6322180/" data-ref-id="1100-6322180">Rockstar and Team Bondi reportedly butted heads</a>.

Warner Bros. was signed on as the publisher of the project, before backing out, leading to the game's cancellation.</p><p>Rockstar's global network of development studios are understood to collaborate on big games, so it's possible Rockstar Australia is also working on GTA 6. Nothing is confirmed, however, and Rockstar is known to be one of the more secretive gaming companies. Officially speaking, there is no word on what Rockstar Australia is working on.</p><p>Rockstar's new development studio in Australia joins the company's <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big network of international studios</a>. These include:</p><ul><li>Rockstar Dundee</li><li>Rockstar India</li><li>Rockstar International</li><li>Rockstar LA</li><li>Rockstar Leeds</li><li>Rockstar Lincoln</li><li>Rockstar London</li><li>Rockstar New England</li><li>Rockstar New York</li><li>Rockstar North</li><li>Rockstar San Diego</li><li>Rockstar Toronto</li></ul><p>GTA 6 is set for release this year on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

            <p>
LA Noire boss Brendan McNamara is back within GTA developer Rockstar, as the head of the newly-acquired and retitled studio Rockstar Australia. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar announced today it had bought McNamara's Sydney-based developer Video Games Deluxe, following a decade of close collaboration on various Rockstar re-releases. 
</p>
<p>
It was Video Games Deluxe - now re-named Rockstar Australia - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/boss-of-developer-behind-gta-trilogys-original-poorly-received-launch-laments-being-removed-from-games-credits-even-though-he-wasnt">swooped in to update the recent GTA Trilogy port</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-it-pulled-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-from-sale-on-pc-to-remove-files-unintentionally-included">earlier work by another studio that was widely-criticised for its poor performance</a>.
</p>
<p>
Video Games Deluxe also worked with Rockstar on the 2017 re-release of LA Noire, as well as the game's VR Case Files version.
</p>
<p>
Of course, McNamara was responsible for the original version of LA Noire - he was its director, and the founder of its developer Team Bondi. 
</p>
<p>
LA Noire was a commercial success and its technical ambition was praised, but Team Bondi closed less than a year after the game shipped following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/la-noire-developer-investigated-by-igda">allegations of a toxic workplace and crunch culture during its seven-year development</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-staff-cut-from-la-noire-credits">furore over more than 100 people who worked on the project deliberately being left out of its credits</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The expectation is slightly weird here, that you can do this stuff without killing yourself," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/la-noire-dev-responds-to-controversy">McNamara told IGN back in 2011, addressing the accusations of exploitative working practices</a>. "Well, you can't, whether it's in London or New York or wherever; you're competing against the best people in the world at what they do, and you just have to be prepared to do what you have to do to compete against those people."
</p>
<p>
McNamara next tried to get a new game off the ground, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sounds-like-team-bondis-whore-of-the-orient-is-long-dead">named Whore of the Orient</a>, though a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-bondi-staff-sacked-whore-of-the-orient-development-on-hold-report">publishing deal with Warner Bros. Interactive collapsed and the project was canned</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It affects the company, yeah, definitely," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brendan-mcnamara-id-rather-people-just-ring-me-up-and-tell-me-to-f-off-interview">McNamara told Eurogamer in 2011, discussing the impact of the accusations</a> surrounding LA Noire's development on Team Bondi's ability to get another project off the ground. "It affects my reputation. But it also affects people's opportunities in Australia.
</p>
<p>
"People are entitled to their opinion. I'm perfectly happy for people to say they don't like working with me or I'm a bully or I'm this or whatever," he continued. "The part that annoys me is people do it anonymously. I'd rather they just ring me up and tell me to fuck off, right? Or people want to print your company emails on the internet. I'm like, what is that about? That could happen to any company in the business."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what Rockstar Australia will be working on specifically now - though with the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> on the horizon, it's unlikely to be much else.
</p>
<p>
"It's been an honour to work closely with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> this past decade," McNamara said in a statement today. "We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible."
</p>
<p>
Rockstar parent company <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">narrowed down GTA 6's release date to an autumn 2025 window</a>.

			<p>Today, Rockstar Games announced the acquisition of Sydney-based developer Video Games Deluxe. The studio was founded in 2013 by former Team Bondi founder Brendan McNamara. Since its inception, Video Games Deluxe has collaborated with Rockstar on the re-release of L.A. Noire and the 2017 VR-only game L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files. More recently, the developer has worked on improving Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games Head of Publishing Jennifer Kolbe said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia.</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara added:</p>
<p><em>It’s been an honor to work closely with Rockstar Games this past decade. We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.</em></p>
<p>The acquisition price remains undisclosed. In July 2020, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/l-a-noire-creators-working-on-aaa-open-world-vr-game-for-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for an open world VR game to be made for Rockstar. However, given the complete lack of growth for virtual reality gaming, it is highly unlikely that the project is still being worked on. It is far more conceivable that the former Video Games Deluxe will bolster Rockstar's output with the upcoming massively anticipated launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, planned for this Fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-awaited free Grand Theft Auto V update</a> that's set to introduce technical improvements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>AMD FSR1 and FSR 3</li>
<li>Ray traced shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, and global illumination</li>
<li>Faster loading times using SSD and DirectStorage on supported devices and configurations</li>
<li>Enhanced support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher frame rates</li>
<li>DualSense controller support, with adaptive triggers</li>
<li>Enhanced audio with support for Dolby Atmos and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch will drop tomorrow and can already be preloaded on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-video-games-deluxe-la-noire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>studio Rockstar has announced that it will acquire Video Games Deluxe, the studio founded by former Team Bondi head and&nbsp;<em>LA Noire&nbsp;</em>director Brendan McNamara.</p>

<p>In a press release, Rockstar confirms the acquisition and also announces that Video Games Deluxe will be renamed to Rockstar Australia. The two studios don't reveal what they'll be working on together.</p>

<p>For his part, McNamara says his studio is "thrilled" to be a part of Rockstar and that the newly-minted Australian wing will "continue [its] efforts to make the best games possible". Rockstar publishing head Jennifer Kolbe, meanwhile, says it's "exciting" to add Rockstar Australia to the studio's lineup.</p>

<p>The studio is also responsible for creating that same year's&nbsp;<em>LA Noire: The VR Case Files</em>, which serves as a sort of remake-slash-reimagining of the original&nbsp;<em>LA Noire</em>. It follows the same story, but its cases are unique and built from the ground up for VR.</p>

<p>Along with its work on&nbsp;<em>LA Noire</em>, Video Games Deluxe also worked on the mobile versions of the ill-received&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition-announced-by-rockstar-games" rel="nofollow"><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</em></a>, although it's not the developer originally responsible for creating those remasters.</p>

<p>Last we heard, Video Games Deluxe was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/la-noire-devs-working-with-rockstar-on-aaa-open-world-vr-game" rel="nofollow">working on an open-world game</a> for Rockstar, although we haven't heard much about that project since it was first unveiled back in 2020. It isn't mentioned in the press release, either, so presumably the two studios aren't ready to reveal it yet.</p>




<p>As for Rockstar, the studio is currently gearing up for the release of tentpole sandbox game&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">currently expected to land in fall</a> (although no official release date has been given for the game yet).</p>

<p>The <em>GTA&nbsp;</em>publisher&nbsp;also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-5-pc-update-ps5-xbox-series-xs" rel="nofollow">released a long-awaited update</a> for the PC version of&nbsp;<em>GTA 5</em>, adding previously console-exclusive features and technical improvements to the game.</p>

The studio began with literary adaptations and family-friendly films like <em>Old Yeller</em> and <em>The Parent Trap</em> before moving on to more experimental fantasy with <em>Tron</em> and <em>Escape to Witch Mountain</em>. After the quirky comedies of the late 1980s and 1990s, such as <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em> and <em>The Santa Clause</em>, Disney began recreating its iconic animated masterpieces from the Golden Era to the Renaissance Era to capitalize on millennial nostalgia.</p><p>This new phase of Disney filmmaking shows no signs of stopping, with live-action versions of <em>Moana</em> and <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> set for release in 2025 and 2026. Maybe we’ll reach the point where every Disney animated film has a counterpart! But for now, let’s rank these Disney live-action remakes that add a human touch to our cherished animated favorites—excluding any sequels, prequels, or spin-offs.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-recommend-id="image://c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="4266" data-height="2306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom Hanks talking to Pinocchio " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tom Hanks talking to Pinocchio " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-recommend-id="image://c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="4266" data-height="2306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom Hanks talking to Pinocchio " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tom Hanks knows how to tug at our heartstrings as the lonely toymaker Geppetto, who yearns for a boy of his own. While he tries his hardest to forge a bond with the titular puppet, the CGI animation makes Pinocchio, along with other famous characters like his trusty sidekick, Jiminy Cricket, and the manipulative Honest John, seem lifeless. They look jarringly out of place against the equally artificial settings; what is meant to be an idyllic European town is obviously a fake movie set. The disability representation with the new addition of Fabiana and her ballerina marionette, Sabina, is a nice touch—certainly better than the cringeworthy, Scuttle-like Sofia the seagull. The original <em>Pinocchio</em> is a mesmerizing work of art, so any remake had big shoes to fill. Using actual puppetry could have made this version feel more authentic and visually pleasing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-recommend-id="image://7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nala and Simba embracing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nala and Simba embracing " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-recommend-id="image://7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nala and Simba embracing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Lion King</em> is an odd part of this live-action trend because there are zero human characters, and it’s still animated—just with computers, nearly shot-for-shot in many instances. The special effects are incredibly detailed and true to life, but in a story where a little lion cub has to react to his father’s death in a stampede, it feels soulless. That’s why the anthropomorphic versions of the characters, with their bigger eyes and larger expressions, worked so well for this profound tale of life and death. Here, the characters are barely able to react, their expressions flat and lifeless because the design focuses so much on capturing real life. Timon and Pumbaa especially look frightening. This new version of <em>The Lion King</em> feels pointless and gives little reason for existing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-recommend-id="image://6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two dogs on the porch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two dogs on the porch" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-recommend-id="image://6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two dogs on the porch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Released straight to Disney+, this update of the 1955 original is a fine, if unnecessary, remake. There’s a more developed romance between Jim Dear and Darling (Thomas Mann and Kiersey Clemons) that leads to the birth of their baby, which the regal cocker spaniel, Lady, believes is her impending doom. The clear draw here is, of course, the adorable dogs in the titular roles and their sidekicks. The new <em>Lady and the Tramp</em> blends CGI with real-life rescue dogs, avoiding the uncanny valley. It’s hard not to love these furry, four-legged stars as they trot through their quaint town, even if it looks like a studio set and lacks the beauty of the original’s hand-painted backgrounds of Victorian homes and gaslit streets.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-recommend-id="image://1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aladdin getting the lamp" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aladdin getting the lamp" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-recommend-id="image://1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aladdin getting the lamp" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Ottoman-style designs in Guy Ritchie’s version of <em>Aladdin</em>—golden domes of an ornate palace, intricate patterns, and flowing, rainbow-colored silks—set against the vast, sandy landscapes create an absolutely gorgeous live-action version of Agrabah. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott share an earnest connection as Aladdin and Jasmine, supported by their soaring singing voices. Will Smith could never match Robin Williams’ brilliantly chaotic, motor-mouthed portrayal of Genie, but he deserves credit for making it work with his own swagger. Still, this <em>Aladdin</em> adaptation is more of a feast for the eyes than for the heart.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-recommend-id="image://3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mulan ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mulan ready to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-recommend-id="image://3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mulan ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Mulan</em> doesn’t have the same spark without Donny Osmond singing about getting down to business and defeating the Huns. Without the music, the focus shifts more to the action sequences, which are grand in scale and set against sweeping mountain backdrops. Disney often finds itself in a bind with these live-action remakes—damned if they stick too closely to the animated original with shot-for-shot recreations, and damned if they stray too far with unnecessary originality. The remake of <em>Mulan</em> removes Mushu and Cricket for being too fantastical, yet the changes they make still take away any authenticity. There’s the addition of Xianniang (Gong Li), a witch who can shapeshift into a falcon—far less scary than the actual soldiers in the original—and Mulan’s (Liu Yifei) ability to use qigong to explain her martial arts talent, rather than letting her transformation come from strength and perseverance. This version of <em>Mulan</em> tries to add magic in all the wrong places.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-recommend-id="image://7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-format="png" data-width="1523" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Weird characters in Alice in Wonderland" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Weird characters in Alice in Wonderland" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-recommend-id="image://7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-format="png" data-width="1523" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Weird characters in Alice in Wonderland" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tim Burton’s vision of a topsy-turvy world filled with whimsical creatures and curiosities is far spookier than the 1951 original. Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter resembles a deranged circus clown with his pale face and wild hair; Helena Bonham Carter’s Red Queen has a giant, computerized bobblehead. Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas) have sunken eyes with vacant stares. Alice takes on a feminist twist as a soldier in the fierce final battle, wielding a sword and wearing silver-plated armor, but the dull, gray cinematography makes the scene feel bland. The bizarre aesthetic and darkness take away from the, well, wonder of it all.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-recommend-id="image://e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-format="jpg" data-width="620" data-height="300" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dumbo laying down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dumbo laying down" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-recommend-id="image://e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-format="jpg" data-width="620" data-height="300" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dumbo laying down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tim Burton’s carnivalesque visuals and fascination with oddities who don’t fit in—like an elephant with giant ears—seem perfect for remaking <em>Dumbo</em>. Unfortunately, the film takes a one-hour children’s romp and stretches it out by nearly another hour with boring material. We’re meant to care about the handsome Colin Farrell as a one-armed veteran and his children (Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins), who are charged with taking care of Dumbo, but we just want to get back to the main attraction. The live-action version also critiques the capitalistic exploitation that lurks beneath a mammoth theme park, Dreamland (a not-so-subtle nod to Disneyland), but it’s overly grim and never lands. The only real positive is Dumbo’s design, with adorable big eyes that strike the right chord between realistic and cartoony.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-recommend-id="image://ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peter Pan and friends looking over a cliff" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Peter Pan and friends looking over a cliff" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-recommend-id="image://ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peter Pan and friends looking over a cliff" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There have been tons of live-action adaptations or retellings of <em>Peter Pan</em>, from the filmed stage production starring Mary Martin to the star-studded Steven Spielberg epic and the ethereal 2003 version. David Lowery’s <em>Peter Pan &amp; Wendy</em> doesn’t have enough pixie dust, especially since Peter Pan (Alexander Molony) is no longer an impish scoundrel with a zest for life but a mopey little boy, while Tinkerbell (Yara Shahidi) has lost all of her sassiness. One of the most positive changes is making Tiger Lily (Alyssa Wapanatâhk) a strong warrior who helps Peter and the Lost Boys fight Hook and the pirates while removing any racist mocking of her Indigenous background. For all the beauty and mystery of Neverland’s misty rolling hills and towering waterfalls, the film lacks the sense of awe that should define <em>Peter Pan</em>’s world.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-recommend-id="image://47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beauty and the Beast dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beauty and the Beast dancing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-recommend-id="image://47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beauty and the Beast dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original animated <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> from 1991 is gorgeous and one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. Unfortunately, this live-action version does not live up to it, mainly because of its design choices. Lumière, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts look scary with their teeny-tiny eyes and mouths, making it difficult to read their expressions. While Dan Stevens’ rich, booming voice and stately presence suit his role as the Beast—especially in his rousing ballad <em>“Evermore”</em>—the CGI looks too artificial. The Beast should have been created with practical effects and makeup so that audiences could literally see the humanity underneath that Belle connects to. The biggest disappointment is Belle’s golden dress; in the original film, it had rows of curtain-like fabric on her hoop skirt, but the new <em>Wish</em>-like version is flat and a cheesy bright yellow. Emma Watson’s wafer-thin voice doesn’t help her portrayal of the beloved bookworm either.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-recommend-id="image://a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man and woman kissing among wolves" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man and woman kissing among wolves" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-recommend-id="image://a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man and woman kissing among wolves" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s an earlier remake of <em>The Jungle Book</em> that draws from Rudyard Kipling’s novel as much as the Disney animated film. Unlike the current wave of Disney remakes, director and co-writer Stephen Sommers does not have to follow the same story beats, choosing to explore an adult Mowgli, played by the expressive Jason Scott Lee. This version of <em>The Jungle Book</em> is more of an <em>Indiana Jones</em>-style adventure, where Mowgli helps a British captain search for treasure while falling for the spirited Kitty, who knew him as a child. Unlike Jon Favreau’s film, there are real animals rather than photorealistic ones, and they do not talk or sing. This version of <em>The Jungle Book</em> is certainly not the closest to the Disney original, but it has an old-fashioned, B-movie charm.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-recommend-id="image://10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-format="webp" data-width="750" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cruella De Vil smiling deviously " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cruella De Vil smiling deviously " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-recommend-id="image://10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-format="webp" data-width="750" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cruella De Vil smiling deviously " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is one of the few Disney live-action remakes from the 1990s. Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil is deliciously diabolical in her over-the-top performance, clashing with Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson as the sweet couple who (very quickly!) fall in love. While we can admire the wrangling of so many Dalmatian puppies—who are known for being a stubborn breed—the story feels as scattered as the dogs’ spots. Written by John Hughes of <em>Home Alone</em> and <em>National Lampoon’s Vacation</em> fame, <em>101 Dalmatians</em> jumps around from lighthearted romantic comedy to slapstick mishaps with Cruella’s henchmen.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-recommend-id="image://a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maleficent ready for war" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maleficent ready for war" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-recommend-id="image://a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maleficent ready for war" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Maleficent</em> might be the Disney live-action film that departs the most from its original source material, retelling the story of <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> (1959) through the villain’s eyes. Angelina Jolie is pitch-perfect as the regal fairy, draped in black, with green eyes that pierce into your soul. The film reveals a rich, dark history behind the kingdom and Aurora’s father, Stefan (Sharlto Copley). There’s plenty of revision, especially in the reimagining of true love’s kiss as a deeper bond that goes beyond mere romance. This unique angle adds dimension to a fairy tale that originally followed a simple good vs. evil structure. Visually, it’s hard to match the vibrant beauty of the original, but this film’s blue and yellow tones, the neon glows of the fairies, and its ornate medieval-style set design are captivating in their own way.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-recommend-id="image://9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ariel singing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ariel singing " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-recommend-id="image://9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ariel singing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Halle Bailey delivers a show-stopping performance as Ariel. Her voice is the kind a sea witch would want to steal—soulful and melodic, with powerful belts that send full-body chills. The sea creatures she calls friends are not as expressive as in the animated film, but their personalities still shine through in little details, like Sebastian’s perpetually shocked eyes or Flounder’s tininess. <em>The Little Mermaid</em> stands out as one of the few Disney live-action films that thoughtfully expand on the original story and characters. Despite their language barrier, Ariel and Eric bond over their shared love of stargazing, cartography, and dreams of adventure, making their connection feel deeper than just surface attraction. Eric now lives on a Caribbean-inspired island with a culture that holds both respect and fear for the ocean and its mysteries. This dynamic makes the harmony between the humans and mermaids at the end of the movie feel more earned.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-recommend-id="image://3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cinderella posing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cinderella posing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-recommend-id="image://3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cinderella posing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kenneth Branagh helms this enchanting remake of the 1950 classic. Cinderella was always a bit of a dull princess, her personality mostly defined by her compassion for animals and patience for chores. But Lily James adds depth to the role, bringing a quiet inner strength that motivates her unrelenting kindness and positivity despite terrible circumstances. Her mantra, “Have courage and be kind. For where there is kindness, there is goodness, and where there is goodness, there is magic,” feels even more resonant today. Cate Blanchett also brings emotional intensity to the wicked stepmother, portraying a more genuine and lacerating cruelty. This <em>Cinderella</em> outdoes the original’s famous dress, with layers upon layers of gossamer fabric creating a dazzling, billowy masterpiece that quickly becomes every little kid’s dream to wear.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-recommend-id="image://508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy embracing bear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Young boy embracing bear" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-recommend-id="image://508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy embracing bear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jon Favreau directs an adaptation of the 1967 classic about a little boy, Mowgli, raised by wolves, who makes his way through the labyrinthine jungle. Along the way, he crosses paths with the laid-back bear Baloo, who loves snoozing as much as he loves honey, and the pragmatic panther Bagheera. They serve as his friends and guides as he faces the menacing tiger Shere Khan. The photorealistic, computer-generated animation of the animals and surrounding environments—the lush greenery and bubbling waterfalls—is breathtaking. <em>The Jungle Book</em> was filmed entirely on a green screen, meaning the actors never actually stepped outside, and often, the young actor Neel Sethi was interacting with puppet heads of animals or nothing at all! Yet nothing feels artificial. <em>The Jungle Book</em> is stunning, and even with its digital updates, it never loses the endearing personalities of its animal characters.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-recommend-id="image://95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creature staring at young boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Creature staring at young boy" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-recommend-id="image://95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creature staring at young boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The 1977 live-action/animated film is one of Disney’s goofiest yet most tedious outputs, hardly seeming like a frontrunner for a live-action adaptation. However, David Lowery’s version transforms the boy-meets-dragon tale into a gentle coming-of-age story with emotional heights that evoke Steven Spielberg’s <em>E.T.</em> Pete (Oakes Fegley), raised in the woods by his trusty, furry green dragon, Elliot, must save him from hunters from the outside world. <em>Pete’s Dragon</em> boasts a strong ensemble cast, including Bryce Dallas Howard, Robert Redford, Wes Bentley, and Karl Urban, who portray humble, everyday characters just seeking connection. The animation is incredible, with Elliot depicted as a puppy-like creature with expressive eyes and playful gestures. The dragon becomes a representation of the universal need for companionship and understanding, and his adventure is guaranteed to make you cry.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-40m-concurrent-users</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-passes-40m-concurrent-users-for-the-first-time.1123644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-40m-concurrent-users<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC gaming platform Steam has broken another major concurrent player milestone, and this one's a big one, likely driven by the success of games like the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>As spotted by the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1896195019419111562" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, Steam passed 40 million concurrent players over the weekend, with 40,017,061 players being logged into the platform at one point yesterday. That, naturally, is an all-time record.</p>

<p>Back in August, the release of Soulslike action game&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>helped Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-37m-user-milestone-wukong" rel="nofollow">break the 37 million concurrent user barrier</a>, so it's impressive that this weekend's total represents a three million increase on that, especially given&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">popularity</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-40m-players-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=KWdMFCbL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-40m-players-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=Zqr7iyME 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has proven a big success story on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>As SteamDB points out, 12.6 million of those players were currently playing games at the time the site logged the new concurrent player record, which means around 27.4 million were either enjoying other features or idling.</p>

<p>Still, 12.6 million people playing games on Steam at the same time is pretty impressive, and I'm sure Valve will be happy that its digital distribution platform still doesn't really seem threatened by its increasing number of rivals.</p>

<p>So, what games helped Steam reach the 40 million count? Perhaps one of the biggest contributors is Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">attracted over a million players</a> at its peak, going on to become the game with the fifth-highest player peak in Steam's history.</p>

<p>Others include many of the usual suspects;&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>has enjoyed 1.75 million players over the last 24 hours, and other big hitters like&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>all hit peak player counts in the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-steam-40m-players.jpg?itok=F7GXgCeB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-steam-40m-players.jpg?itok=4ziorc4F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has a pretty respectable 24-hour player peak on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>In other recent Steam news, Valve has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-early-access-update-warning-feature" rel="nofollow">implemented a new feature</a> that informs you if it's been a while since an Early Access game received an update, although the feature seems a little temperamental at the moment.</p>

<p>The latest Steam Next Fest is also underway, and our own Don has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-best-demos-february-2025" rel="nofollow">compiled a list of some of the best demos</a> the event has to offer.</p>

With two considerable zones to explore, nearly 100 side-quests and activities, and main story missions that take hours to tackle apiece, it’s a slog in some spots. You’ll likely require a palette cleanser afterward, but a familiar one, and we have the perfect recommendations!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-recommend-id="image://b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Morgan involved in a robbery in Red Dead Redemption 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arthur Morgan involved in a robbery in Red Dead Redemption 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstart</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-recommend-id="image://b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Morgan involved in a robbery in Red Dead Redemption 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Few open-world story-driven experiences compare to <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. I will stand by the Wild West tale as one of the most perfect forms of entertainment. When you think about it (not too deeply), there are a lot of similarities between protagonists Henry and Arthur. They both ride horses, for example, and sometimes, they even fight bandits. But more importantly, it’s a tale that sticks with you long after the credits roll—the type of experience you tell your non-gaming parents about at a family dinner.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-recommend-id="image://28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A combat scene involving knights and Vikings in Mordhau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A combat scene involving knights and Vikings in Mordhau." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Triternion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-recommend-id="image://28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A combat scene involving knights and Vikings in Mordhau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In my opinion, the <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> series’ combat is one of the most challenging aspects. It’s frantic, complex, occasionally rewarding, but primarily annoying. That said, if you can’t get enough one-on-one combat against the NPC bandits and knights wandering the world of Bohemia in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, <em>Mordhau</em> proves an excellent battleground to refine your combat capabilities further. It offers a similar fighting style, with directional-based strikes, and since you’re facing real-world players you can grow accustomed to frenzied fighting styles relatively fast.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-recommend-id="image://5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of a siege from Kingdom Come: Deliverance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of a siege from Kingdom Come: Deliverance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-recommend-id="image://5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of a siege from Kingdom Come: Deliverance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s the most obvious choice when discussing what to play after <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>. If you have the time, finishing up or starting the first game will allow you to better understand the sequel’s story, the world of medieval Bohemia, and the characters themselves, many of whom return for the sequel, such as Henry and Sir Hans Capon. All that said, <em>KCD </em>requires a significant investment, as it can take up to 100 hours to finish. I know, I know! Who didn’t play the first game before beating the second? Me, it’s me.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-recommend-id="image://e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A large cavalry charge in Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A large cavalry charge in Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TaleWorlds Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-recommend-id="image://e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A large cavalry charge in Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another title with similar combat, but a bit more depth than <em>Mordhau</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is<em> Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em>, the long-awaited action RPG from TaleWorlds Entertainment. With similar, albeit more forgiving, directional combat, <em>Bannerlord </em>thrusts you into a vast sandbox set in a fictional medieval land full of knights and lords, with trade caravans to raid and men and women to woo. It’s the type of open-world experience that doesn’t hold your hand, allowing you to craft a story and rise to legendary status.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-recommend-id="image://8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The in-game map of territories in Crusader Kings 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The in-game map of territories in Crusader Kings 3." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paradox Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-recommend-id="image://8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The in-game map of territories in Crusader Kings 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you enjoy a game like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> because of its setting more than its gameplay, then <em>Crusader Kings 3</em> offers a revisionist take on the medieval ages. You choose your noble house, build a dynasty, form alliances, gather troops, and send them to raid or conquer your neighbors, while making decisions in pop-up events that change the course of your life and your family. It’s the perfect medieval game for those who prefer medieval times’ strategy, romance, and politics more than the nitty-gritty blood-n-mud.</p><hr><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> launched February 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fortnite recently released its new anti-cheat policy, which revealed that players with lifetime bans will be offered a second chance in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-cheaters-will-receive-a-second-chance">Fortnite Cheaters Will Receive a Second Chance</h2>



<p>Fortnite has confirmed that players who have received a lifetime ban for cheating in the game and have been banned for more than a year can return to matchmaking in April 2025, when the new update rolls out. Players who have cheated in tournaments will not be able to participate in competitive events; however, they can also enter matchmaking in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in April, Fortnite’s lifetime ban policy for cheaters will change. First-time offenders will now receive a year’s ban, after which they will receive a second chance to return to the game. However, if they cheat again, a lifetime ban will be enforced. Players who sell cheats or break other rules, resulting in a lifetime ban, will not receive a second chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s new <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">anti-cheat policy</a> also introduces new PC requirements for tournaments. Players should have an Account Level of 350 or higher to participate in tournaments and enable TPM and Secure Boot while playing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players wonder whether they will see the return of popular content creators who received lifetime bans for cheating. Jarvis, who was banned in 2019 for using cheat software while live-streaming, has also <a href="https://x.com/liljarviss/status/1895161943725613220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to Fortnite’s recent announcement about giving cheaters a second chance.</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite’s Lawless season introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cowboy-bebop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cowboy Bebop collaboration</a>. Also, Epic Games recently banned a Fortnite cheater and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-bans-fortnite-cheater-forces-them-to-apologize-and-give-back-winnings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced them to apologise and return their winnings</a>. What are your thoughts on Fortnite offering cheaters a second chance?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

To put it in other words, Cena, the WWE's superstar ‘good guy,’ the Make-A-Wish world record holder and all-round much-loved wrestler and actor, became a WWE ‘bad guy’ before we got GTA 6.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/03/gettyimages-2202199096-1740999762452.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">For the first time in over 20 years, John Cena is a WWE bad guy.

No, that doesn’t mean Cena has just leaked his role in GTA 6 (although wouldn’t that be something!). Rather, he’s just leaning into the meme for a bit of social media fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s clear that Cena’s a GTA 6 memer at this point, there’s still some speculation that his Instagram post is some cryptic hint about the game itself.

Ubisoft says its goal for the game was to stay as close as possible to the philosophies of mastery and martial arts, as players will be able to focus on investing points in the Mastery skill-trees and gaining ranks in Knowledge.</p><p>Mastery features a traditional gameplay system of earning experience points by leveling up your character through the normal course of play, eliminating targets, and defeating unique enemies like samurai Daisho who lurk inside fortified castles. By earning enough points, players can expand their skills by learning new combo attacks, increasing their proficiency with weapons, and by unlocking new abilities. Yasuke will gain new samurai abilities, while Naoe will gain new stealth-focused skills that will turn her into a lethal assassin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4452762-ac-shadows-progression.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4452762-ac-shadows-progression.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452762"></a><figcaption>A closer look at Naoe's Mastery tree in Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4452762-ac-shadows-progression.jpg"></figure><p>What's important to note here is that Naoe and Yasuke share their progression, so if you focus on playing as one character specifically, the other won't be under-leveled when you decide to tag out. "With the unique Mastery trees, we want to give players the freedom to dedicate themselves into a specific weapon, playstyle, or archetype, and ensure they can deepen their mastery of it," associate game director Julien explained in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/1uXFMBPEpXS1vSH7lPICnN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>. "The points you invest in a Mastery tree also unlock additional bonuses for that weapon or archetype, further reinforcing your progress."</p><p>Mastery essentially allows you to specialize the direction in which a character grows, but if you ever get tired of the archetype you've developed, these builds can be reset at any time and you can funnel the refunded points into different skills to change up your playstyle.</p><p>When it comes to Knowledge, this can be upgraded by exploring the world around you through non-violent activities. The higher your rank, the better the upgrades you'll unlock for Yasuke and Naoe. Some of the activities you can take part in include finding Lost Pages in temples, praying at shrines, doing some Kuji-kiri Meditation for Naoe, or learning new Kata for Yasuke. Any Knowledge gained by one character will be shared with the other, letting both of the Shadows leads benefit from the exploration done by their counterparts.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-reveals-why-game-was-delayed-a-second-time/1100-6528995/">After a few delays</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows will officially launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 20. If you're looking to avoid spoilers, you might want to steer clear of social media as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-out-assassins-creed-shadows-is-out-in-the-wild-spoilers-abound/1100-6529667/">physical copies of the game have made it into the wild</a> and several people are posting spoilers online.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/visions-of-mana-director-reveals-new-studio-sasanqua.1123599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Kenji Ozawa has announced that he's founded his own studio by the name of Studio Sasanqua.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-dev-from-netease-games-ouka-studio-establishes-his-own-company-that-wont-push-the-responsibility-of-management-onto-developers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, the website for Studio Sasanqua went live yesterday, along with a teaser trailer (which is entirely in Japanese) announcing the studio and its name. The studio will apparently begin by working on smaller-scale projects before transitioning to larger games.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Ozawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix" rel="nofollow">left his previous employer</a>,&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>developer Ouka Studios, back in December. His departure came after the studio reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow">laid off a large amount of its employees</a> on the day of the game's release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-new-studio-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua.jpg?itok=Zt_82rBS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-new-studio-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua.jpg?itok=SdUr78gS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Kenji Ozawa has founded his own studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking to Automaton, Ozawa said that he was moved to start Studio Sasanqua because he frequently saw managers not taking responsibility for failed projects. Ozawa believes that "management needs to protect creators", and that seems to be what he's intending to do with Studio Sasanqua.</p>

<p>According to Automaton, Ozawa will begin by developing small-scale games in Unreal Engine, but eventually, the goal is to transition to "full-blown, original PC/console games" (that's Automaton's wording, not Ozawa's).</p>

<p>You can check out the brief teaser trailer for Studio Sasanqua right here. Again, be aware that the whole trailer is in Japanese, and there aren't any English subtitles, so you might have to do a little interpretation if you don't speak the language.</p>




<p>Ozawa's previous employer Ouka is just one NetEase-funded studio to be hit with layoffs, project cancellations, or outright closures in recent months.</p>

<p>Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Worlds Untold</a>, the studio run by BioWare veteran Mac Walters, as well as&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>creator Christofer Sundberg's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a>. Neither studio has released, or even properly announced, its first game yet.</p>

<p>NetEase also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for working on<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Marvel Rivals</em>, despite the fact that the game has attracted 40 million registered users since launching in December. Sadly, it seems NetEase isn't quite the industry veteran haven it seemed a year or two ago.</p>
