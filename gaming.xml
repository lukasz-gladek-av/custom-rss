		<p>Naming your game after one of the tastiest foodstuffs on the planet is one way to strike a tone. Named after the beautiful Indian pancakes you’ll find at the best street food markets, it’s immediately clear that tasty treats lie at the very heart of Dosa Divas. That said, the colourful wrapper created by Outerloop Games is hiding something even more delicious inside.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOSA DIVAS - Release Date Trailer - Steam Demo Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bogYlMcNb80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There aren’t many games that give you the option to pout, photo modes notwithstanding, but that’s exactly what we found during the opening of our hands-on with Dosa Divas. We’re pouting because our sister Amani refuses to cook us some food, and once she gives in, that’s our first quest here. Collect some ingredients. The difference in Dosa Divas is that we’re going to do it in a mech.</p>


<p>It’s one heck of a mech, too. Goddess has the front end of a yellow Tuk Tuk, an old-school folding canopy, and at least one stick-on paper flower. It’s awesome. AND, it flaps its arms like a chicken to double jump. You can forget Gundam; this is the coolest mech of 2026.</p>


<p>Samara and Amani are the Dosa Divas, former restaurateurs turned Spirit-mech pilots, and who are able to enter the Preparation Realm to craft food and consumables through a series of mini-games. You select the ingredients – that’s a Bell Pepper here for the base, before added Basil for flavour. The pronunciation of “bay-zil” upsets me, but that’s the only wrinkle in an otherwise fun and tasty diversion.</p>
<p>The pair are about to set off on a road trip to see their parents – their first after Amani has been away for ten years – before they’re rudely interrupted by their other sibling, Lina, and her floating LinaMeals food billboard. Which she uses to insult the pair. Sam smashes the billboard up, and between that and a spot of sulking, it’s clear that a lot has happened, both in the last ten years, and between the sisters.</p>
<p>Perhaps most obviously, Lina has become a food-based overlord, controlling the populace with her LinaMeals and banning everyone else from actually cooking. She’s even got lawyers out and about to make sure everyone follows her rules. Fortunately, Samara and Amani aren’t about to let that stand, with a spot of turn-based combat coming into play whenever you’ve got someone standing in your way.</p>

<p>This is turn-based combat in the vein of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Expedition 33</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario</a>, rewarding extra damage or defence if you can time the right button press with the action on screen. I really think that this has become my favourite feature in turn-based games, keeping you on your toes and giving you some much-needed interaction during battles.</p>
<p>The culinary influence continues into combat, whether that’s Sam using a massive Karahi wok to pummel enemies or needing to match your attacks to the enemies’ food weakness. There’s a handy readout like in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/octopath-traveler-0-review/">Octopath Traveller</a>, so you can easily remember that they’re weak to spicy or sour attacks, and just like Octopath, there’s also a boost function that lets you add extra attacks to your chosen action. It all comes together really well, and if you’re a fan of modern turn-based combat, Dosa Divas is doing it right.</p>

<p>Dosa Divas also looks and sounds absolutely brilliant. Its chunky, vibrant art style brings bags of character to the world, and everyone in it, with a real penchant for slightly off-kilter food-based visual gags and details. That’s all ramped up by funky, rock-infused riffs that are melded with more traditional Indian tones. The exceptional vibes are less surprising when you find out it’s coming from Outerloop Games, the Washington-based, minority-led team behind the incredible Thirsty Suitors and Falcon Age, and they’ve brought that same spirit to bear on Dosa Divas.</p>
<p>There aren’t many games that immediately lodge themselves in your psyche in the way that Dosa Divas has. Perfectly struck turn-based combat, killer art direction, and a sibling rivalry that’s enslaved the world set the tone for what looks to be one of 2026’s most intriguing indie releases.</p>
<p><em>Dosa Divas is launching on 14th April across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 1 &amp; 2 and PC, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4316300/Dosa_Divas_Demo/">check out a demo now on Steam</a>.</em></p>

            <guid>1444507</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Xbox</strong> founder and creator <strong>Seamus Blackley</strong> has just released <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an explosive interview to GamesBeat</a>, in which he doesn't mince words against <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s current strategy and also shares his opinion of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly appointed Xbox CEO</a>, <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>. According to Blackley, who first came up with the idea of a Microsoft console back in 1999, her mandate will be the same as a palliative doctor, ultimately sunsetting the whole division as Microsoft refocuses on its new core AI business.</p>



<p><em><strong>Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted</strong>. They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, <strong>her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] The natural consequence of the focus on AI is that AI abstracts every problem from the minds of the executives who believe in it. We’re abstracting the problem of games as well. <strong>There’s a core belief, and you can see it in what Satya said, that AI will subsume games like it will subsume everything</strong>. The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI. That’s what you’re seeing here.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] It would have been shocking if they had somebody in there in a meaningful role who was passionate about games, passionate about the creator-driven business of games, because it would be in direct conflict with everything else Microsoft is doing. <strong>Microsoft is a company that is now about enabling its customers by enabling AI to drive things. That’s at odds with the auteur model of any art, but specifically of games</strong>. Microsoft doesn’t have the problem that Apple does, or that Netflix does, where they have an auteur-driven content model to manage. Games are the only place where they have a content business.</em></p>



<p>His fears are compounded by the fact that Asha Sharma <strong>previously served as president of Microsoft's CoreAI product portfolio</strong>. It doesn't help that some gamers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-ceo-targeted-supposedly-using-ai-bot-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have already accused her of using an AI bot to interact with followers on X</a></strong>, though she rejected those accusations, and she previously stated that she doesn't want to flood the Xbox ecosystem with "soulless AI slop".</p>



<p>Xbox gamers have been mostly worried about Microsoft sunsetting its console hardware business, <strong>which is definitely a more real concern</strong> given dwindling sales and the multiplatform strategy. At this stage, it seems a little premature to think about the whole division being axed, though of course, it could still happen at some point in the future. For now, though, Microsoft <strong>is still planning to release a new Xbox console</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possibly next year</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In case you missed it, Friday saw news arrive of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-gaming-head-phil-spencer-is-retiring-replaced-by-an-ai-exec-who-promises-no-soulless-ai-slop">substantial corporate reshuffle at the top of Microsoft's gaming division</a>. CEO Phil Spencer was revealed to be retiring at the same time Xbox president Sarah Bond was revealed to have resigned, leaving new boss and former president of Microsoft CoreAI Asha Sharma to don the crown of green plastic.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IkpYeERHeWF6NUwiLCJwIjoiL3RlY2gvODgzMDE1L21pY3Jvc29mdC14Ym94LW5ldy1jZW8tc2hha2V1cC1ub3RlcGFkIiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMjkwNjAwLCJpYXQiOjE3NzE4NTg2MDB9.getJ-3kspePX7CrVmely9uWHy0nEaJuj6YCKKbJMCfU&amp;utm_medium=gift-link">The Verge</a> has now offered a bit more detail as to how all this chair-switching went down, and unsurprisingly, it reads like an account from a struggling kingdom whose ruler's just announced plans to abdicate.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the report, Spencer's spitting out to whichever planet retired execs live on had been in the works since last year, with "months of careful successor planning". All that careful planning ended in chaos when the announcement leaked a few days early on Friday, leaving Microsoft playing catch-up. Hence departing president Sarah Bond's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430753683912531968/">lengthy and bland departure post</a> not arriving at the same time. </p>
<p>As to why Bond's departed, rather than ending up as Spencer's successor, the report paints a picture of her as taking the lion's share of the blame for a much-disliked '<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">This Is an Xbox</a>' marketing push/wider strategy, which has seen Xbox emphasise their presence across multiple platforms and devices. Basically, rather than trying to herd folks towards Xbox consoles, the company have experimented with shouting that you can play Xbox games through apps on PC, handhelds, phones, and tellies.</p><p>The Verge report this campaign "offended many Xbox employees internally", and has subsequently been questioned in the face of Microsoft's decining hardware revenue. Now, we get to the bit of the report which to me reads most like the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/id/44736507/lakers-luka-doncic-not-spoken-mavs-gm-nico-harrison-says-criticism-dallas-painful-want-talk-back">sort of thing</a> sports teams put out to control the narrative if, for example, behind-the-scenes drama between execs and star players requires a public scapegoat.</p>
<p>The report cites most current and former Xbox employees as being "relieved that Bond is leaving Microsoft", with more than one source alleging she's "been tough to work with, and built a team structure that meant if you didn’t follow the vision or questioned it, you were out". That said, Bond's ability to strike up relationships with companies and devs has gotten good reviews.</p>
<p>As the report notes, Bond was implementing the 'This Is an Xbox' strategy/ads while operating under Spencer's leadership, so it's noteworthy that she appears to be taking most of the flak for it. While the clandestine nature of machinations at behemoths like Microsoft likely means we'll never truly know who had the most hand in these calls, Bond being judged in stronger terms than the retiring senior exec she was once <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-happened-to-xbox-president-sarah-bond-amid-phil-spencers-retirement-and-asha-sharmas-promotion-long-term-protg-resigns">tipped to replace</a> - amid a lot more <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2026002196375195891">positive eulogising</a> of his time at the top, and after years of being PR-spun as a relatable gamer-boss - is a bit eyebrow-raising.</p>
<p>That's not to say Bond - who, unlike Spencer, wasn't mentioned in the corporate email memos of Microsoft big boss Satya Nadella, new boss Asha Sharma, or newly promoted exec Matt Booty - didn't have a large hand in strategy, or behave in the way the Xbox staffers cited by The Verge claim. It all just seems rather convenient to pile the outgoing regime's failures at her door, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">a rough few years for Xbox</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, new CEO Asha Sharma's reportedly facing concerns from some staff over her AI background, and whether her tenure'll see the company move away from consoles for good, with both being things she moved to reassure folks on in her email memo upon taking the gig.</p>
<p>So, there you go. A new face is on the throne. The old regime have been shown the door in whichever form was deemed acceptable to the baying crowds beyond the keep. The Microsoft gaming arm is dead, long live the Microsoft gaming arm.</p>

			<p>South Korean developer and publisher <strong>KRAFTON</strong> announced another step toward expanding its AI R&amp;D framework: the appointment of <strong>Kangwook Lee</strong> as the company's new Chief AI Officer (CAIO). Lee has actually been at Krafton since 2022 in the role of Head of KRAFTON AI; the promotion is a sign of the company's continued investment in AI research and development. As a reminder, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ai-first-pubg-publisher-krafton-reaches-all-time-high-2b-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company has been calling itself "AI First"</a></strong> for a while now.</p>



<p>Lee has already led major initiatives, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the collaboration with NVIDIA to develop CPCs (Co-Playable Characters)</a></strong>, AI-driven companions designed to enable real-time interaction between players and in-game teammates. Those debuted in KRAFTON's life simulation game<span>&nbsp;<strong>inZoi</strong>, featuring the so-called <strong>Smart Zoi</strong> NPCs, which can adapt to the environment and respond to events</span> around them.</p>



<p>Soon, the technology will also be introduced in PUBG with the <strong>PUBG Ally</strong> system, built on NVIDIA ACE technology and running an SLM (Small Language Model) on-device. <strong>PUBG Ally NPCs can discuss strategies with players and adapt their playstyle accordingly</strong>. The NPCs can bring over requested items, assist in reviving teammates, and make independent decisions during looting, combat, and survival situations. They also work with voice-based interaction and already support English, Korean, and Chinese, with the first tests planned early this year in <strong>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS Arcade</strong>.</p>



<p>Under Lee’s leadership, KRAFTON’s AI strategy will focus on three core areas:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Elevating gameplay:</strong> KRAFTON will continue developing AI features to enhance immersion, responsiveness, and player interaction. <strong>Technologies such as CPCs complement human-designed gameplay systems, enabling studios to maintain full creative ownership and final decision-making authority</strong>. AI will be applied where it meaningfully enhances the player experience, while preserving the handcrafted elements that define each title.</li>



<li><strong>Supporting development teams:</strong> KRAFTON is investing in AI tools <strong>to help streamline repetitive or technical tasks, enabling developers to spend more time on creative planning, storytelling, and design</strong>. The company views AI as a means of <strong>supporting its workforce by reducing friction in production workflows and empowering teams to focus on their craft</strong>. AI-driven analytics and development tools operate using authorised and responsibly managed data in accordance with applicable privacy standards.</li>



<li><strong>Exploring long-term research opportunities:</strong> Building on its experience operating large-scale physics-based virtual worlds, <strong>KRAFTON is conducting long-term research into physical AI and robotics</strong> through a newly established entity, <strong>Ludo Robotics</strong>. This entity has operations in the United States and Korea. This research is in the early stages and focuses on software intelligence, using simulation environments to test and validate complex systems. <strong>Games remain KRAFTON’s core business</strong>, though, and future research initiatives are designed to build on the company’s foundational strengths in interactive technology.</li>
</ol>



<p>Most gamers still aren't on board with this, as evidenced most clearly <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the controversy sparked by Larian's usage of AI in the development of Divinity</a></strong>, but KRAFTON appears to have chosen its lane without much hesitation. Only time will tell whether they made the right move.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-24-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 24, 2026</h2>



<p>Without giving away today’s Contexto answer, here are a few helpful hints to get you thinking in the right direction:</p>

<p>Here's the developer's notice in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Notice of Release Postponement]</p>
<p>LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP Nintendo Switch 2 Edition had been scheduled for release on March 26, 2026. However, due to the need for significant updates not only to the Nintendo Switch 2 version but also to the currently released Nintendo Switch version, we have made the difficult decision to postpone the release.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to all fans who have been eagerly awaiting this title. We will announce the new release date as soon as preparations are complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Dragami's previous update in January, the "Upgrade Pack" for this title (at least in Japan) is set to be a paid release.</p>
<p>When the Switch 2 version does eventually arrive, it will apparently include graphical enhancements, as well as improvements to the performance. Joy-Con 2 mouse support has also been announced and will be featured in an exclusive arcade-style mode, where you'll face off against waves of zombies using Juliet's Chainsaw Blaster and a turret.</p>

<p>Following a surprise announcement at the end of last week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> from the Game Boy Advance generation are making a grand return on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of conversation online about the Switch eShop versions, which are priced at <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each. Some trainers are ready for battle, but others are still questioning why Nintendo didn't make these classics available via the Switch Online service (or give fans both options).</p>
<p>Despite all this back-and-forth, it seems both titles are already making bank on the Switch eShop. Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-preloads-are-now-live">preorders going live last week</a>, we've now taken a look at the eShop, and at the time of writing, these GBA titles have already topped the Switch charts in the US, UK, Japan and Australia. <em>So, there's definitely some interest!</em></p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fokzysq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As you may have already guessed, Pokémon FireRed (repping the Fire/Flying type Charizard) is leading the charge, with Pokémon LeafGreen in second place.</p>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed these Switch versions of the games will contain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">the same content as the original releases</a>, and you can expect some modern solutions for the connectivity features. Support for <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon Home</a></strong> has also been confirmed, and these titles can be played while using the GameChat feature.</p>
<p>Although these releases might be easy money for Nintendo, this doesn't necessarily guarantee we can expect to see other first-party retro titles on the eShop. According to an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">official FAQ</a>, this is a special case marking Pokémon's 30th anniversary, and there are seemingly no plans to revive "Virtual Console types of offerings".</p>
<p>Nintendo says it intends to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-seemingly-rules-out-virtual-console-revival-says-it-remains-focused-on-offering-classics-via-switch-online">remain focused on offering retro releases</a> for its Switch Online subscription service going forward.</p>

<p>April is the new March</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The noir-style cartoon detective FPS <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a> was scheduled to arrive on Switch 2 next month, but it seems there's been a slight delay.</p>
<p>Instead of its 19th March 2026 release, this title will launch for Nintendo's new hybrid system (and other platforms) on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>. In a new <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/2026046752693092801">notice on social media</a>, Fumi Games &amp; PlaySide Studios says it wants to deliver the best game possible and just needs a few more weeks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As we approach the final stages of development, we want to ensure we are taking the extra time and care needed to make Mouse: P.I. for Hire an experience to remember. We remain unwavering in our goal to deliver you the best game we can, and that will take just an extra few weeks."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The same update mentions how the team is excited to share "more of the game" with followers in the lead-up to the release, so expect more updates soon! This isn't actually the first time Mouse: P.I. for Hire has been delayed. It also follows the announcement of the Switch 2 version in October last year.</p>
<p>You can find out a little more about this game in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/vintage-shooter-mouse-p-i-for-hire-blasts-onto-switch-2-in-march-2026">our previous story here on Nintendo Life</a> and an official developer "deep dive" documentary below. When it arrives, players can apparently expect "fast-paced FPS combat" and a thrilling single-player campaign with over 20 levels.</p>

<p>With this in mind, today it's added an absolute banger - it's the soundtrack for the 1992 Game Boy title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land_2_6_golden_coins">Super Mario Land 2 - 6 Golden Coins</a> starring Mario (and Wario). This album features tracks like "Mario Land" and "Star Course". It offers <strong>35 tracks</strong> and has a total runtime of 30 minutes.</p>
<p>This soundtrack was composed by the one and only Kazumi Totaka, who is known for his famous song <a href="https://youtu.be/_cfBw8cnWgg">"Totaka's Song", which appears as an easter egg</a> in many Nintendo games. He has also voiced Nintendo characters such as Yoshi.</p>
<p>Here's the full soundtrack for this latest Nintendo Music update:</p>

<p>It's a more "challenging production process"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="675381b58be4e"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/675381b58be4e/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this month, Square Enix confirmed it would be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> to the Switch 2 in June 2026.</p>
<p>Compared to the first entry, part two is a significantly larger game with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">small but intricately detailed open-world zones</a>. Despite this, the target goal apparently remains the same, according to the trilogy's director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/we-ask-final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-naoki-hamaguchi-about-the-switch-2-versions-hair-problem-why-does-it-happen-and-can-it-be-avoided/">Automaton</a> recently, he mentioned how the team's engineers are targeting 30fps "wherever possible". This will apply to not only Rebirth, but also the third installment in the trilogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> "We’re consistently aiming for 30fps wherever possible. For FFVII Rebirth and the third installment of the trilogy, our engineers are working hard on tuning to ensure stable performance at that level. I hope players will look forward to it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamaguchi adds how the team is working hard to optimise the game so it can maintain a "stable frame rate", while also improving the visual quality "as much as possible" at the same time.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a0b673b84fe83"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0b673b84fe83/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows some comments Hamaguchi made not long ago, when he acknowledged how the second game was a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-hopes-to-share-switch-2-update-in-very-near-future">much more "challenging production process"</a> overall but was still confident his team of engineers would be "able to deliver".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has also confirmed both titles to follow the Remake will feature <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">"exactly the same" gameplay experience</a> as other platforms.</p>
<p>When Rebirth arrived on the PlayStation 5 in 2024, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">our colleagues at <strong>Push Square</strong></a> thought it was a "great" sequel, but did call out the "disappointing" performance mode on this platform at the time, which <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/03/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-getting-another-patch-to-improve-performance-mode">led to a post-launch update</a>. As for our time with Remake on Switch 2, we thought it was an excellent experience, even at 30fps and with "a few minor dips" in handheld.</p>

        <p>Try to survive this cursed game with some help from an unusual cat.</p><p>This game includes scenes where information from the player’s PC environment is displayed within the game. When streaming or recording, enabling “Streamer Mode” is strongly recommended to prevent a loss of privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, we are participating in the Steam Next Fest, (starting on February 24) and a demo version is already available. Save data from the demo can be transferred to the full version, so please take this opportunity to play <em>DYPING: ESCAPE</em> and add it to your wishlist.</p><p><strong>About the Game</strong></p><p>“Let’s play a typing game. All you have to do is type what I tell you to. You don’t have to think at all.”</p><p>A pair of creepy, mysterious eyeballs is your game master. You’ll follow their instructions to progress through a typing game… but also be forced to sign a rather unreasonable contract.</p><p>Whatever you type becomes reality and is inflicted upon you. You might be asked to run programs you don’t want to, or even hack your own system in an act of self-destruction. You might have to watch in horror as your computer breaks down before your very eyes. There’s not much you can really do to fight against this, especially in a typing game… But with the help of a cat awakened from an ancient game, perhaps you can escape.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/dyping-escape-launches-march-13]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Controversy has arisen from the recent <em>Neopets</em> TTRPG playtest document. The beta playtest, released as part of Geekify's development of the tabletop game, was so full of inappropriate and unrepresentative material, that it was taken down by the owner's request.</p><h2>The Neopets TTRPG Playtest Controversy</h2><p>The <em>Neopets</em> TTRPG playtest controversy started when the document became available to the public. Over several weeks, fans and tabletop enthusiasts poured over the material, curious to see how the family-friendly web series about raising adorable digital pets would be adapted.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neopets-ttrpg-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=Dd_dGYVf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="900" height="506">

  </picture><p>The answer was not particularly well. The system was a derivative of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and was very combat heavy. This is a major departure from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/neopets-ttrpg-kickstarter-has-doubled-its-funding-goal" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter's</a> promoted original classless, point-based RPG system. Worse still, the scenario had some decidedly inappropriate subject matter for <em>Neopets</em>.</p><p>How inappropriate? According to some posts on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/infernatrixsophia.bsky.social/post/3mec3mgatyl2f" rel="nofollow">Bluesky</a>, the document had players face intoxicated/drunk bandits, gives them the option to potentially torture them for information, and contains lines with misogynistic and even homophobic connotations. There is even a section asking players their comfort levels about in-game sexual activity. In a <em>Neopets</em> RPG.</p><p>In fact, the Neopets TTRPG playtest controversy was such a debacle, the company recently released a statement addressing the issue on their website. The statement is critical of the RPG, stating that <em>Neopets</em> wasn't "a generic fantasy dungeon crawler." Furthermore, it states the document was made without their approval.</p><blockquote><p>We want to be transparent with the community: the beta playtest document that was recently made public was not approved or reviewed by our team prior to its release. Under our licensing agreement, all content bearing the Neopets name must meet our quality standards and receive our written approval before it is shared publicly. Following an internal review, Neopets has determined that the content and themes contained within the document do not align with our brand standards, values, or the expectations we hold for experiences created under the Neopets license. Although the Neopets team has been steadily reviewing the TTRPG in sections as it is submitted, none of the aforementioned submissions was included in the beta document material released. We immediately requested the document’s removal and have been in direct communication with Geekify to address the matter.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Curiously, despite the <em>Neopets</em> TTRPG controversy, the company seems committed to the game's development. The statement ends stating the company will take the time needed to ensure the project reaches its potential. But if this playtest is indicative of the attitude and approach Geekify has towards the property, it doesn't paint a nice picture for the future.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When big news happens there’s an inevitable rush to put it in context and explain it. One approach is to take the news at face value and begin rationalizing it. Another approach is to assume there’s some hidden logic at work and unearth whatever that is. We’ve seen both of these when it comes to <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">Xbox’s big leadership shakeup</a> and neither offers a completely satisfying answer to the basic question everyone’s been asking themselves a version of since Friday afternoon: what the hell?</p> <p>Phil Spencer is retiring. Sure. Makes sense. He’s been at Microsoft for 38 years. God bless him. But for it to be announced on a Friday afternoon via a series of memos and weird media “exclusives?” Odd way to put a pin in the career of one of gaming’s longest-serving and most visible executives. Not even an Official Xbox Podcast episode to break the news and offer Spencer the chance to share it in a more personal way with the millions of fans who have been following his vision for Xbox and gaming for over a decade now.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">A report from <em>The Verge</em></a> explains some of this weirdness. The announcement was originally supposed to happen on Monday February 23 instead, but reporting from<em> IGN</em> forced Microsoft to move up its timeline. Most employees learned about the move from social media first as a result. Spencer has reportedly been planning to retire for almost a year now. Microsoft just happened to choose the end of February to pull the rip cord. Microsoft head of comms Frank Shaw <a href="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/1940481184649433246?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940481184649433246%7Ctwgr%5E4a5e94428821a7740f8fb58a86617febd86490cc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fphil-spencer-retire-xbox-layoffs-microsoft-sarah-bond-1851785564">shut down rumors</a> last July that Spencer was retiring “anytime soon,” calling them made-up. Was he lying then, or now?</p> <h2>A celebration cut short</h2> <p>All the stranger considering Spencer will technically still be hanging around in an advisory role through the summer to help with the transition as new Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma takes the reigns. Will he be teaching her how to get all the achievements in <em>Brotato</em>? Spencer’s public-facing role at Xbox has felt ceremonial for a while now, yet he’s bailing out before the console’s 25 year anniversary celebrations get underway?</p>

 <p>For all its stumbles and challenges in recent years, 2026 is supposed to be a victory lap for Xbox. Game Pass’ price hike was wildly unpopular but its been on a tear of great releases. Xbox console sales are tanking but people are intrigued by the PC gaming future that devices like the Xbox Ally X are pointing to. And the games, a perennial Achilles’ heel for the tech giant, are here. <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, the <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remake, and <em>Fable</em> are making good on the company’s promise of quarterly tentpoles. They’re not exclusive, but they’re each a celebration of franchises that have defined Xbox across four console generations.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phil Spencer tries to explain Indiana Jones coming to PS5 so soon after Xbox. </p> <p>"We run a business, it's definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company" <a href="https://t.co/U9z5MWxxAe">pic.twitter.com/U9z5MWxxAe</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1826253543491453381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Then there’s the curious case of why Xbox president Sarah Bond resigned on Friday. Spencer’s goodbye email was the only one to mention her. Even Xbox’s long-time third musketeer Matt Booty declined to thank her for her service to the company and the platform. Hours after the news was out, Bond shared her statement on LinkedIn. She didn’t mention Booty either.</p> <p>“This moment also presents a unique opportunity for fresh eyes and new leadership to guide the team into its next chapter,” she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430753683912531968/">wrote</a>. “I’ve had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we’ve planned for this transition, and I’ve seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand.”</p>

 <h2>A convenient scapegoat</h2> <p><em>The Verge</em> reports that Bond was seen as “tough to work with” and that some employees were “relieved that Bond is leaving Microsoft.” Curiously, it lays much of the blame for Xbox’s recent strategic blunders at the feet of Xbox’s most junior leader. “Bond had tried to push mobile and cloud over console, to reach potentially millions more Xbox customers, but the result has been a classic case of chasing tomorrow’s customers by neglecting today’s,” writes Tom Warren, though he later notes that Bond’s actions were “under Spencer’s direction.”</p> <p>I think you’d be hard pressed to find an Xbox fan anywhere who believes even for a minute that Microsoft’s multiplatform “play anywhere” pivot to cloud, PC, and mobile was a bottom-up movement spearheaded by Bond rather than a mandate incentivized from the top down as CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood demanded <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">aggressive growth targets and strict profit margin discipline</a> following the $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3mfkdfhaals2i">Many have noticed</a> how convenient it would be for Microsoft to pin the erosion of Xbox as a meaningful concept on someone who’s no longer at the company and her retiring boss.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox president Sarah Bond responds to a question from Bloomberg's <a href="https://twitter.com/dinabass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dinabass</a> about why Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks was shut down. Full interview here: <a href="https://t.co/te5Trhut0Q">https://t.co/te5Trhut0Q</a> <a href="https://t.co/LGs0n9iV0t">pic.twitter.com/LGs0n9iV0t</a></p> <p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1788728698184540355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It might be easier to square any of this if Microsoft’s own messaging on this moment and what it signals sounded any more coherent than the rest of the Xbox Series X/S generation. “We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world,” Sharma wrote in her introductory memo to staff and fans. She promised “a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are.”</p>

 <p>Then just a sentence later she continued beating the “play anywhere” drum. “Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware,” she wrote. “As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.”</p> <h2>A renegade spirit for the AI age</h2> <p>No mention of other consoles like PS5 and Switch 2. Is Microsoft ending its experiment with exclusivity? “<a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-exclusives-halo-asha-sharma-microsoft-2000672587">Hear you</a>,” Sharma told an Xbox fan over the weekend when he told her to bring back console exclusivity. The new Microsoft Gaming CEO has been saying all the right things to build trust with Xbox’s core audience, but the platform has zigged and zagged so much over the last five years that no one’s going to believe words until they’re backed up by actions, and even then what will stop Microsoft from pivoting again while gaming remains a rounding error relative to its other businesses and the emerging AI market?</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">Affordable hardware</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">Killer games</a>. Those are the ingredients a console platform needs to thrive and flourish. Microsoft has shown time and again it’s either not committed to those two things or is unable to execute on them. Bond may have been a <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1788728698184540355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1788728698184540355%7Ctwgr%5E76c1407b0e4a4366c0ea5b5dff746c7d0cf8191c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fxbox-game-studios-arkane-tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-1851470253">poor messenger</a> for the future of Xbox, but it will take more than messaging <a href="https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114">to save Xbox</a>. And the way this entire Xbox reorg has been rolled out suggests that even the messaging will continue to be a mess.</p> <p>“I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place,” Sharma wrote in her memo. One person who doesn’t believe that is an actual renegade who built the first Xbox, Seamus Blackley. “I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night,” he <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">told <em>Games Beat</em></a> today. “The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI. That’s what you’re seeing here.”</p>

<p>An unfortunate but important update has been shared from the team behind MOUSE: P.I. For Hire.</p>



<p>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire is an upcoming narrative-driven first-person shooter. One of the game’s main elements is its black-and-white art style, inspired by the rubber-hose animation style. MOUSE is one of many projects that entered development once the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain.</p>



<p>A mini behind-the-scenes documentary was released in October 2025, covering the development of MOUSE. It was shared during the ID@Xbox Fall showcase.</p>

<h2 id="h-mouse-p-i-for-hire-release-date-pushed-back">MOUSE: P.I. For Hire Release Date Pushed Back</h2>



<p>The game was slated for a March 19 release date. However, developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fumi-games/" id="3438">Fumi Games</a> and publisher PlaySide have issued a joint statement saying that the game will now be released on April 16. The reason given for the delay is simply a request for extra time to ensure the game’s quality.</p>



<p>“As we approached the final stages of development, we want to ensure that we are taking the extra time and care needed to make MOUSE: P.I. For Hire an experience to remember,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2416450?emclan=103582791473604212&amp;emgid=490465653219656390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement read. </a>“We remain unwavering in our goal to deliver you the best game we can, and that will just take an extra few weeks.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/esports/games/call-of-duty/" id="3373">Call of Duty</a> team recently shut down a rumor regarding an upcoming game project.</p>



<p>Recently, a “leak” from TheGhostofHope on Twitter claimed that the Call of Duty team was planning to release a standalone Zombies title alongside the standard Call of Duty release. The post also noted that Microsoft hoped Activision would be less attached to annual releases going forward.</p>



<p>However, it appears none of that is true.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-team-denies-rumor">Call of Duty Team Denies Rumor</h2>



<p>The Call of Duty Twitter account actively shut down the rumor. Replying to a Dexerto post, they would say that the “rumor factory is working overtime” and that “this ain’t it.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>EXCLUSIVE: Sources indicate to me that the delay on the next Xbox has “hurt” a lot of CODs marketing plans as they wanted Modern Warfare 4 to be a launch title and draw a lot of hype to compete with peoples attention alongside GTA VI.

Because of this delay, the idea of two Call</span></p></article></div>



<p>There you have it. If you were looking forward to a standalone Zombies Call of Duty game, you may have to wait a little longer. This ain’t it, chief.</p>











<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-selling-very-well">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 Is Selling Very Well</h2>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was recently listed as the best-selling game of January 2026. That was the second month in a row, as it also claimed the same spot in December 2025. Therefore, things are looking alright for the CoD brand.</p>



<p>They did recently shut down one of their mobile games, however. It was noted that Warzone Mobile will shut down in April. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-to-go-offline-in-two-months/" id="177181">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last week, longwinded YouTuber F.D. Signifier released a long awaited deep dive on the Black entertainer Tyler Perry. Perry is a filmmaker whose work is ubiquitous and for a long time felt impossible to escape. While his work is ostensibly for a Black audience, if you watch more than one of his films, it also reveals itself as tedious, formulaic, and at its worst, anti-Black. It's true that Perry is a self made billionaire and by all metrics a success. But what does his success mean for the rest of the Black community? </p><p>Gita and Isaiah sat down to talk about this, and the rest of Signifier's epic video.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpgqWZyAJtM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Tyler Perry Video"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Gita Jackson:</strong> Isaiah! Thank you for joining me in unraveling the four hour YouTube video essay about Tyler Perry from F.D. Signifier that I have not been able to stop thinking about. Coming in on the heels of the <em>America's Next Top Model</em> documentary, this extremely long essay takes aim at another Black capitalist, the Madea Maven himself. I wanted to ask you: what's your relationship to Tyler Perry?</p><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> Lordy. Well, my relationship with Tyler Perry—like most Black trauma—came from my mother. Or, more specifically, my mom owning the VHS tapes of his early <em>Madea</em> plays that she got from local bootleggers that she'd play almost daily when I was growing up. Though by then, I knew the man less than I knew his most famous character, Madea, before she became the mainstream caricature of tough Black love she is today. While I've been able to avoid Tyler Perry for the most part in my mostly autonomous day to day life as an adult, whenever I go over to my mom's for the holidays, she's guaranteed to either have her TV already on to whatever the Tyler Perry channel on her Roku TV or ask me if I've seen his latest produced movie after she's already put it on before waiting for my reply. In short, my relationship with him has been against my will.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> That's weirdly relatable for me? At least in that Tyler Perry is inescapable if you're Black. In college, I was in the cinema studies program and I ended up taking a Black Cinema class, and we spent a lot of time talking about that same distribution and tour model that made Tyler Perry so successful. Getting on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitlin%27_Circuit?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">chitlin' circuit</a> and making movies specifically for Black churchgoers was extremely lucrative! But the work itself... well. </p><div><p>I think we also both have opinions on the work. I've never seen a Tyler Perry movie all the way through on purpose, and nothing I have seen of his work makes me want to. Yet, he is one the most successful Black filmmakers of all time. And I think he can be a good actor on occasion—Fincher casting him as a shrewd lawyer in <em>Gone Girl</em> was a stroke of genius.</p><p>For me, watching this video brought together a lot of criticisms I've had about Black capitalists like Perry—your Jay-Zs, your Tyras. But also, it really reveals that these films are not loving portraits of Black people. Perry seems to kind of hate us?&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Oh, big time. Or at least he's hit too comfortable a stride, similar to Dave Chappelle, where he knows he has enough cultural cache with Black people based on his past good will to know that he can joke about owning a town and treating its people like serfs without realize how out of touch the joke is. But the real joke here is that Tyler Perry can basically pump out the same meat and package it as different items on a fast food menu and he knows folks are gonna eat it up because it has the veneer of being by us for us. In reality its not dissimilar to a King Bach-style Vine with a prestige production machine backing it. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRfDgnapUAw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Typical Tyler Perry Plotlines (Boondocks Season 3 - Buy the Box Set Today)"></iframe></figure><p>But, like F.D. Signifier's video highlights, it's something a lot of Black folks have been keyed in on with a lot of help from <em>Boondocks </em>living up to how we'll clown on a nigga and have way too much truth layered in our jokes. He's a good character actor who huffs a bit too much of his own farts and thinks he's putting on airs with the slop he's mass producing on his channel. Unfortunately, convincing my mom of that is as easy as having a conversation about genders and my being bi: a lost cause.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> LMAO yeah, when I came out to my mom she didn't believe me and then we never talked about it again. She also doesn't know what my pronouns are because I'd rather not have that argument.</p><p>In Signifier's video, he frames the entire long-ass essay around the idea of building a table. I really enjoy this metaphor because, well, so often Black people are waiting for a "seat at the table" of success, of prestige, of financial support. But by the end of the video, Signifier says that Perry has truly built a table to sit at and eat at by himself. To me, that's the most evil part of Perry.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>Yeah, not to compare Tyler Perry to <em>Family Guy</em> (lol) but the whole thing seeing how he operates reminded me of the one cutaway gag about a father gorging himself on food while his emaciated family starves and he says they can eat when he's finished. But he's never finished. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHFTATeWH5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Family Guy - John Goodman  ᶜᶜ"></iframe></figure><div><p>But that won't stop a lot of Black folks lauding him as an aspirational tale of Black excellence that every young man should strive to achieve and do the most to sacrifice and claw your way to being at the top. Myself included. I probably can contribute a major part of my being nonbinary because I had a eureka moment in tandem with just not vibing with all the gender standards my family placed on me to what Tyler Perry basically thinks of light skinned men. Basically to be this Christlike figure of masculinity who will sacrifice and save everyone. To be "the man of the house" who commands respect while also being excellent at something that gets me money rather than what I enjoy,&nbsp; no matter how much it's putting myself out, <em>and </em>to never cry about it. Something that's bullshit; men should be allowed to cry and be soft.</p><p>And the whole notion of Black excellence is also bullshit. MFers should be allowed to just be Black without having the pressure to be excellent to give their lives inherent meaning. But Tyler, and his works by proxy, are an enduring sentiment from Boomer and Gen-X churchgoers that people from my generation have as much a chance as a pebble of stopping a wave from reaching shores with how his whole enterprise is intrinsically linked to and&nbsp;supercharged by the cultural Goliath that is the Black church. The man is as much a plague to my existence as the McMahon family.</p></div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Honestly, seeing someone look at the empire that Perry has built and declare that the emperor has no clothes was refreshing to me. I remember when Jay-Z was talking about "gentrify your own hood." For a long time, Black millionaires like him were the people I was told to look up to, people who escaped the hood and consolidated wealth for themselves, the rest of us be damned.</p><figure><figcaption><span>This wig drives me INSANE!//Image Source: Lions Gate</span></figcaption></figure><p>A lot can be said for Perry's outright anti-Blackness, especially when it comes to Black men. He motherfucking HATES dark skinned Black men. Hell, he doesn't like Black women so much either. It's hard to say whether or not he holds the same opinions on blackness that are expressed in his films because he is strikingly dishonest, but he has built his entire empire on abusive dark skinned men and wilting, abused Black women. Black capitalists like Perry often say they're doing it "for the culture," but apparently "the culture" only means themselves and their gentrified hoods.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> And like, what the hell does "gentrify your own hood" even mean? No more corner stores and everything is cashless and by proxy anti-homeless and anti-baller on a budget? That always rang to me less like building our own and more building for oneself by playing the game that's already disadvantaged Black folks for years, but because you're doing it it's somehow better. </p><p>I grew up in Cabrini Green in Chicago, and I can tell you the gentrification of one's own hood seldom comes from the folks who live there because we all got moved the fuck out to make way for dispensaries, mall kiosks, and housing that a rare few of the folks who lived in those project buildings got grandfathered back into after being kicked to the south side. He's a big reason why I just roll my eyes whenever I see someone of his ilk claim his art isn't for everyone while saying it's for me. When in reality, he's just playing in my face. So it was really cathartic to have F.D. Signifier "king of the Blacks" (lol) put all of my deep-seated resentment and complicated history with the man in a video essay that wasn't long for the sake of being long and didn't waste my time or folks who aren't in the know of Perry's bullshit.</p><p>A video essay that stays on message without getting long in the tooth is a lost art within itself.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Right, can we just give F.D. Signifier his flowers for a second? I feel like most video essays are just... long. Not informative, not interesting, and most just don't earn their length. This video did not feel like it was four hours long. I watched it all in one go like, hypnotized. Every single moment of the video was essential! Everything he puts down, he picks back up again! Finally we are eating good on YouTube!</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Me and my friend basically raced to text each other that the video finally dropped and finished it before it wound up getting temporarily taken down. We'd been waiting for that jawn for a minute and it didn't disappoint. Cynically, I always assume his videos have the same purpose as Black literature purposely placed on a table at the front of a predominantly white-owned bookstore as the kind of media that's more for educating the children of the chalk on Black existence than necessarily telling me some shit I don't already know. </p><p>And with contemporary video essays feeling like an exercise in filibustering a video into the double digit hours just to say a whole lotta nothing, I was a bit worried I'd get a bit of fluff from unc here too since I wasn't too hot on his Beyonce video. But you can really tell that he was in full force with this one, making sure to cover the whole history of Tyler Perry and his chokehold on both the entertainment industry he's carved out for himself and the hot plate he's guaranteed with older Black folks as charitably and brutally honest as necessary.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WORguByyH78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="[The Boondocks] Tyler Perry - Supremacy of Black Hollywood"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Going back to the beginning of the video, you can really see the artfulness of it. I do remember, like Signifier, being in school and having white teachers show us "culturally relevant" movies that centered Black struggle and Black pain. I, too, tired of only ever seeing movies about Black slaves. I remember embarrassing a teacher who cast me, the only Black person in class, as a slave in a table read of something or other. All this then creates an environment for someone like Perry to exist--a filmmaker who, for better or for worse (it's for worse) shows the middle-class Black life as it is often lived.</p><p>I especially really loved Signifier's analysis of Black directors in the film industry. You need to serve two masters--white investors and audiences, and the Black as fuck story you want to tell. Yes, it is admirable to see that Perry can build his damn table by centering Black audiences. Too bad he is also an evil man!</p><p>By the end of the four hours, I really did feel like I "ate my whole plate." Thank you for those vegetables, Mr. Signifier sir.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Yeah, I didn't know about the history between him and Spike Lee, a cornball in his own right, being the way it was where Lee rightfully called Perry out by all but saying buddy is sending us back but still having to bend the knee to the capital of it all. That, set against the black balling of Monique really hammered home the complex, "the devil you know" of capitalism and how even if not all folk are skin folk, you kinda have to play the game to get fed. Even if the game is from a person who holds his lack of a writer's room like a badge of honor of his auteurship being made of Teflon against oncoming bullets of valid criticism. But F.D. did the damn thing by acting like the meme of the soldier standing in front of the knives while we all sleep knowing more people get to see, as you said, that the emperor has no clothes.</p><div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It's hard to talk about the failures of Black leaders—even when it's obvious that the emperor is nude as hell—because of the way that it can reflect back on the Black community. (I remember when white people found out about being light skinned and dark skinned, like, that is just not information that I want white people to have, I don't want them to have that ammo against us collectively.) But I think when it comes to parasites like Perry, that time is finally coming to an end. We are allowed to gatekeep the Perrys from building their empire on our backs without letting us have a seat at their own damn table.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I'd prefer white folks get keyed in on things like the Tyler Perry as an industry machine and all the folly that comes with that over misusing lingo like gyatt as a noun every two weeks.</p></div>
