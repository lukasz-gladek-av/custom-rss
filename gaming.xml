			<p>Naughty Dog might have hit a snag with The Last of Us Online, which was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> in December 2023 after being labeled <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-project-ever-says-neil-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most ambitious project</a> the studio had ever conceived.</p>
<p>Naughty Dog chose to stick with its highly successful formula of making narrative-driven single-player games rather than invest a great deal of the studio's resources for many years in the continued development and support of a live-service game.</p>
<p>Despite this failed endeavor, the studio's millions of fans are still very much looking forward to the next project. Today, Naughty Dog co-president and head of creative Neil Druckmann talked a bit about it in an interview <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on Sony's website</a>. Druckmann called it the most thrilling project he has worked on yet and teased it may redefine the mainstream's perception of gaming.</p>
<p><em>I've been lucky to work on several dream projects and am currently excited about a new one, which is perhaps the most thrilling yet. There's a growing appreciation for gaming that transcends all age groups, unlike when I was growing up. This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with The Last of Us, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers. The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers. This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.</em></p>
<p>His statement is as intriguing as it is vague. Is he referring to an even bigger focus on cinematic flair and narrative-driven gameplay? Be that as it may, it's probably still going to be a while before we learn anything concrete about Naughty Dog's new game, even though it's been four years already since The Last of Us Part II. Until an official reveal comes, we'll have to stick with such cryptic teases.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24163189/animal-well-lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzle-game-communities</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-animal-well-and-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-fostered-puzzle-solving-communities.879759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163189/animal-well-lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzle-game-communities<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dg0J3J">If you’re a puzzle game fan, you’ve had one heck of a month. Within a span of two weeks, two of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24114511/best-puzzle-games-play-ios-android-windows-playstation-xbox">2024’s best puzzle games</a> — or, simply, best games — were released with Big Mode’s <em>Animal Well</em> and Simogo’s <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. The puzzles couldn’t look or play more differently: <em>Animal Well</em> is a platformer that prioritizes environmental puzzles, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24156522/animal-well-metroidvania-not">somewhat like a Metroidvania</a>, while <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is a puzzle box disguised as a walking simulator, pulling together logic, math, physics, and language puzzles. And yet, both games are labyrinthian mazes with tons of mysteries and secrets; the way <em>Animal Well</em> gates off puzzles until you find a very specific item mirrors the way <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>withholds a key piece of information until you’ve opened the right book or unlocked the correct door. For games that look nothing alike, the act of playing them — and solving their most mysterious puzzles — feels undeniably similar.</p>
<p id="ZWtzHY">Despite these similarities, I’ve found there’s something different about these games that’s manifesting in their two very different online communities. In <em>Animal Well</em>, I look to online communities like Reddit or the official <em>Animal Well</em> Discord for hints — that kind of mass collaboration is actually essential to solving at least one of the game’s puzzles (more on that later). But for <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, I’m turning to individuals — friends and family — who are willing to talk through some of the game’s most devious puzzles. </p>

<p id="NvZJwA">It’s partly because <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> doesn’t have an official Discord or an active Reddit page. I also think there’s something to the need for actual, real-time, one-on-one conversation and collaboration to solve <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>’ complicated puzzles. Simogo co-founder Simon Flesser told Polygon via email interview that online interactions, like those in an official game Discord, tend to be questions with direct answers — not back-and-forth conversations. Solving <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> collaboratively looks more like brainstorming answers for a crossword puzzle with your roommate, while <em>Animal Well</em> feels like digging for secrets in online forums.</p>
<p id="jTMURa">“We definitely want to enthuse communication between players and internally,” Flesser said. “Solving puzzles and problems is much easier when you verbalize and reason about the issue at hand. We think this type of social aspect is really interesting, especially as it doesn’t even need to happen while you are playing the game.”</p>

<p id="o6cGZK">[<strong>Ed. note</strong>: The following paragraph contains spoilers for a late-game puzzle in <em>Animal Well</em>.]</p>
<p id="GcNidp">Flesser said he was impressed by <em>Animal Well</em> and its necessity for collaboration with a larger community — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-well-contains-a-hidden-puzzle-that-requires-at-least-50-people-to-complete">at least 50 people</a>. Basically, this game includes a 50-piece jigsaw puzzle, but a single player gets a single piece. A community of players must combine their pieces to put together the puzzle and unlock something else in the game. It’s impossible to complete alone, and it’s very unlikely you’ll be able to amass enough real-life friends to put this together. (At least, I certainly don’t know enough people playing <em>Animal Well</em>, let alone have that many friends to begin with!) A Discord server is not only nice to have when playing <em>Animal Well</em>, but downright necessary.</p>
<p id="joPoo0">Meanwhile, The Gamer features editor Tessa Kaur called <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/trust-me-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-is-a-party-game/"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> a party game</a> — and I agree. There are lots of puzzles, and lots of different types of puzzles. While I may be good at some more standard, video game-esque environmental puzzles, I’m awful at math and word problems. Thankfully, I have two sisters — one who excels at word problems and another who specializes in logic, math-based puzzles. (Then there’s me, who can push buttons on my Steam Deck.) Playing <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>with their help was a lot of back-and-forth, one of us suggesting a solution for me to input. No luck, and we’d try again, working through the logic of whatever puzzle we were on. At times, my sisters weren’t even in the same room as I was. </p>
<p id="qDxZXv">The first time I asked for assistance, I texted my family group chat with a screenshot of a word problem, captioned with just two words: “Please help.” (Unfortunately for my family, the text arrived before the screenshot, leaving my family worried I was in actual danger, not just mental anguish.) My sister, a teacher, quickly solved the actual problem, with an explanation of how it’s done. “Word problems are big in fifth grade,” she added. Like Flesser said, the social aspect of the game continued even though my sisters weren’t <em>technically</em> playing it — I was. </p>

<p id="LhELV9">It was a really interesting exercise in understanding how each of our brains worked through <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> puzzles. This sort of collaboration works in <em>Animal Well</em>, too, but it’s a kind of collaboration that’s only relevant to other people actively playing the game: I can’t ask my mom or sisters what to do with <em>Animal Well</em>’s yo-yo, for instance. There’s no way for them to understand the context, whereas in <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, I can easily screenshot a puzzle for help. Neither sort of collaboration is better than another; they’re just different. It’s something Flesser finds interesting about watching other people play Simogo’s games: “It’s always fascinating to learn how any mechanic or specific part of a game will resonate with a larger group of people. A lot of times a component that seemed very basic to us will feel really special to other people.”</p>
<p id="hovFyZ">He continued: “The level ‘Parallel Universes’ in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/23/20880283/sayonara-wild-hearts-review-music"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a> was a good example of this. That applies to puzzles too: It’s interesting to see how people think, and if the puzzles do what they intend to. I think a real good puzzle should be like a good joke; they should lead the player down one straight path, and then suddenly have a funny twist or turn.”</p>
<p id="SnzxYP">If that’s the metric by which we’re thinking about <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> or <em>Animal Well</em>, both are real good puzzle games — ones that their communities, regardless of whether they exist online with strangers or in the kitchen with your family, will be talking about for quite some time. </p>

<p>Activision finally lifted the lid on Black Ops 6 earlier today, revealing key art and the title for the game. It came following months of speculation about ‘Call of Duty 2024’, and while we don’t know much about the game, a few details have been made clear since the teaser snippets started dropping online.</p>



<p>Recently, an employee at Treyarch revealed on social media claimed that they’ve been playtesting Black Ops 6 for two years, stressing that we’re ‘not ready’ for this game. While we knew that Black Ops 6 has benefitted from a lengthier development cycle than normal, knowing that it has been playable to some extent for two years really is something.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-long-time-coming">A Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolehavin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Treyarch’s Nicole Havin</a>, who has been working in Game Designer roles at the firm since 2022, confirmed that she’s been testing Black Ops 6 for two years:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Of course, per the typical development cycle of games, the build that Treyarch would have been ‘playtesting’ two years ago would likely have been a framework of a title that would be miles away from making it to the market. Regardless, it’s interesting to know that Black Ops 6 has been playable in at least some state for longer than it took to develop Modern Warfare 3 in its entirety.</p>



<p>Earlier today, Activision revealed the art and title for this year’s Call of Duty, satiating the eagerness of fans worldwide and finally making it clear that this iteration is a follow-on of sorts from 2020’s Black Ops Cold War. We’re seeing references in the teasers pointing to the Gulf War, so the rumours and claims that the game will be set during the 1990 – 1991 conflict are well-founded. </p>

Those who spent money on the game's content demanded refunds but did not receive them, instead they were also promised that all of that content would be intact when the game returned.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MultiVersus Looks To Return With A Bang After Risky Hiatus</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, in May 2024, the self-imposed hiatus is over: MultiVersus is coming back. We got to check out the new PvE Rifts mode, as well as run a few matches with three of the four new characters coming to the roster. We also spoke with game director Tony Huynh about the hiatus, and he believes both of those aforementioned promises are set to come true.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lessons learned</h2><p dir="ltr">Huynh tells GameSpot that the information gathered during the open-beta session was invaluable, and it gave the team a clear path to its May 28 launch. The team has grown since MultiVersus was pulled from stores, according to Huynh, and it's allowed them to expand content pipelines, make necessary adjustments, and undertake one particular Herculean task: fixing the netcode.</p><p dir="ltr">"We learned a lot during open beta," Huynh says, "and what we learned required us to do things like rebuild our netcode, which requires us to touch every asset in the game; there's nothing in the game that hasn't been updated to support the netcode." Huynh now calls the MultiVersus netcode "world-class" and says playing with anyone, even across the country, feels "amazing, like you're on the couch together."</p><p dir="ltr">The expanded team size at Player First has also helped in not only overhauling the entire game, but creating clear content pipelines--which include "new characters, new maps, new cosmetics, and new game modes" according to Huynh--for the foreseeable future.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Putting on the Rifts</h2><p dir="ltr">A key addition to the MultiVersus experience is Rifts, the new PvE mode where players can challenge multiple routes based on the current events in the game. During our preview session, we had two events available: Multiversal Mayhem, where Joker recruits characters from other dimensions who just so happen to support him; and Rift Detectives, a story revolving around Batman and Velma trying to prove they're the better detective.</p><p dir="ltr">These story elements aren't a major influence on the gameplay, however; they mostly serve to frame the dialogue you'll read between each challenge in your selected path. However, they do add a bit of extra flavor to what is otherwise just a rundown of continuous challenges, one after another, with some forks in the road once in a while.</p><p dir="ltr">These challenges aren't limited to matches against CPU characters, however. MultiVersus borrows from other platform fighters and throws a few minigames into the mix. During our preview, we played MultiVersus's version of Break The Targets from Smash Bros., we shot cannons at Joker balloons a la an arcade shooting gallery, and we raced to outrun an evil force coming at us from the left side of the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">While this mode isn't reinventing the wheel, Rifts does offer a welcome respite from the constant grind of online matches whenever we need it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Bolstering the roster</h2><p dir="ltr">The first season of the new MultiVersus--which, according to Huynh, will last two months--focuses on villain characters, which were missing from the roster previously. Three new characters--DC Comics' The Joker, Friday The 13th's Jason Voorhees, and The Matrix's Agent Smith--highlight this first season, with Joker available on day one, Agent Smith coming later in the season, and Jason Voorhees included in the battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">We got to test out Joker and Jason, as well as another new addition, Banana Guard, during our preview session, and each one adds a unique twist to the roster.</p><p dir="ltr">Joker is a wily Mage, which means he'll be using all manner of tricks to take down his enemies--which is perfect for the Clown Prince of Crime. He can shock opponents with a hand buzzer, throw projectile playing cards from a distance, and produce a cannon from behind a curtain before shooting it at a foe. Joker is not the kind of character who should be diving head-first into a battle, he's better suited on the outside throwing projectiles and generally annoying the opponents into making a mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">Jason Voorhees, meanwhile, is a brutish Tank character who is much better suited to being in an opponent's face. His moveset is made up of iconic moments from his movies; he can fold a bed in half to launch opponents into the air, he can grab opponents in a sleeping bag and bash them on the floor before throwing them away, and he can teleport from one side of the arena to the other using fog. As a tank, Jason soaks up a lot of damage normally, but he can also give himself temporary shield points to make him even more of a sponge.</p><p dir="ltr">Banana Guard, the final playable character, is probably the most straightforward of the trio. As a bruiser, Banana Guard uses strong strikes to knock his opponents back, with most of them coming thanks to his trusty spear. His side special charge attack gives him a dangerous approach option, while his upward normal can attack multiple times and force an opponent into the top boundary quickly.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The old guard</h2><p dir="ltr">While the new characters will get the majority of the attention, the existing roster has seen a ton of changes as well. According to Huynh, every character in the game has gone through some sort of change, though some will be more apparent than others.</p><p dir="ltr">"All of the characters are different now, because the core combat engine is different," Huynh says. "It's familiar, the combat is fluid and feels great, but it definitely feels different than before." Every character now has some new moves in their arsenals, along with new combo routes, and that also comes from the overhauled combat system. "We had to touch everything, everything has been altered in some way."</p><p dir="ltr">One notable example, per Huynh, is also his current main: Arya Stark. "A lot of her kit now revolves around Face Steal," Huynh says, "where she borrows moves from the rest of the cast. Before, it wasn't a core part of her kit, it was just an offshoot, but now it is key to her combo routes." He also says that while before, Arya excelled more in aerial combat, now she's more of a ground-based fighter. "She can still do aerial things," Huynh clarifies, "but she's really strong on the ground now."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Extending an olive branch</h2><p dir="ltr">MultiVersus is adding a ton of new content to its popular platform fighting formula; however, the game does face one significant challenge: Some of the players it left behind might not be willing to greet the game back with open arms. However, Huynh and his team have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-returning-multiversus-players-will-receive-when-they-first-log-in/1100-6523592/" data-ref-id="1100-6523592">nice "welcome back" package</a> for anyone who decides to give them another chance.</p><p dir="ltr">Huynh definitively states that "all characters and cosmetics purchased before May 28 will still be there when they come back to the game." However, the team is planning some "make good" perks as well: For example, "just by logging in, you get Banana Guard and a skin for free." Also, any returning players who log into the game in the first two weeks of launch--from May 28 to June 11--will receive the first battle pass for free. This will, in turn, unlock Jason Voorhees, as he is the level 1 reward for the battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">Essentially, anyone who played the game in open beta and unlocked the entire roster will only have to unlock one new character, Joker, when they log into this new version for the first time. "We understand how players would feel," Huynh said, "and we're trying to make good on that."</p><p dir="ltr">The new and improved MultiVersus will launch May 28 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As with the first game in the series, Mechanicus 2 is a turn-based tactical game. Prior to each mission, you'll be able to manage a garrison and choose from your selection of forces--the first game is often compared to XCOM, if that sounds familiar--and there will be environmental mechanics that will benefit or harm a particular side, adding another strategic layer to combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2 does not yet have a release date, but the game will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. As with the original, it's developed by Bulwark Studios and published by Kasedo Games.

                <p>MultiVersus director Tony Huynh has criticized dataminers for spoiling upcoming content in the game, including the reveal of future fighters and stages. Dataminers have regularly trawled through lines of game code to uncover information on unreleased content, and Huynh says that these leaks leave the developers and fans of Multiversus feeling deflated when they're robbed of a surprise reveal.</p><p>"It is an arms race, so it'll be constant protections against new and creative ways to datamine," Huynh said to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/multiversus-director-says-dataminers-do-a-disservice-to-the-players/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> about the efforts to safeguard information on the game. "At the end of the day, we've done a lot, we've learned a lot, but again, it is an arms race. "I can't promise that there won't ever be leaks or anything like that.

<p>Huynh also spoke about how the efforts of dataminers to break through these protective systems were both impressive and unfortunate for his team. "It's deflating for the team as well," Huynh said, lamenting the fact that the MultiVersus team couldn't do a grand reveal and that "a lot of the air is sucked out of the room" because of dataminers. "But these things happen, so we're trying to prevent them from occurring in the future," he concluded.</p><p>After a lengthy absence, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-looks-to-return-with-a-bang-after-risky-hiatus/1100-6523676/" data-ref-id="1100-6523676">MultiVersus returns</a> on May 28 with three new characters in its roster.

            <p>
Listen carefully to the finale of last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> trailer, and a familiar musical theme can be heard. Originally titled 'Earth' but best known to fans of the franchise as 'Ezio's Family', you may as well at this point just call it The Assassin's Creed Series Theme. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, when I speak to the brains behind it, veteran composer Jesper Kyd, he says he can't say more about Assassin's Creed Shadows at all - or at least, not yet. That's despite his work scoring numerous games across the franchise to date - and despite his iconic theme being used within Shadows once again. 
</p>
<p>
Whether he's involved more deeply in the upcoming feudal Japan-set Shadows is a closely-guarded secret, it seems. But presumably he can confirm he has at least <em>heard</em> Shadows' version of his theme that's now out in the public domain? "I have," he nods, smiling. "It's a great rendition, it sounds great and it really fits. It always surprises me to hear that theme and how many ways it can be presented. And how it always just reminds you of Assassin's Creed."

</figure>
<p>
But despite Ezio's Family being the Assassin's Creed theme, and despite working on the series since Assassin's Creed 1, Kyd's iconic track only came to life for the series' second entry. And even then, Kyd notes, it's barely in it at all.
</p>
<p>
"When that theme first made its appearance in Assassin's Creed 2, it was such a great moment because everybody in the team were just in such agreement to the way it was presented. Because the theme is not used while you're actually playing the game," he recalls. We're chatting over Zoom a couple of days after the Shadows trailer drops, and ahead of the theme being played in London at another tour of the ever-popular Assassin's Creed concert series.
</p>
<p>
"It's in there a little bit, it's more used in the beginning and the end of the game and it gives it such a good kick off into the experience. When we first released that theme we were very passionate about it, but it's so great to see that players feel the same way."
</p>
<p>
Kyd scored the first four games in the series - 1, 2, Brotherhood and Revelations - in rapid succession, as Ubisoft quickly realised it was onto a Good Thing and made the series an annual event. But while Kyd's theme has remained a constant in the years since, the composer ended up taking an extended break - only returning some nine years later with 2020's Viking-set Valhalla. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Doing every Assassin's Creed every year would be just... it would consume you. And like any other composer I like to do lots of different things."</blockquote>
<p>
"I started with Assassin's Creed 1 and then we had two years to do Assassin's Creed 2 where I did a lot of experimentation and a lot of things I've never done before," Kyd recalls. "I really tried to innovate in my music style. That all took a while to figure out. 
</p>
<p>
"And then for Brotherhood, I had a year. I wasn't asked to do that much music, it's not that long of a score. I believe I did 90 minutes of original music where usually it's at least three hours [as] the team decided to start using songs from Assassin's Creed 2, so Brotherhood has a mix of both.
</p>
<p>
"And then Revelations [was released] like a year later. It's a challenge to keep inventing a new music style when you have a shorter deadline, and I really like to invent something new for every location.
</p>
<p>
"Doing every Assassin's Creed every year would be just... it would consume you," Kyd said. "And like any other composer I like to do lots of different things. For me, it all worked out great and it was such a joy to come back with Valhalla. That makes so much sense - going back to the Viking era as I'm Danish, so I grew up with a lot of Viking information... But it's always such a joy to work on."
</p>
<p>
Kyd recalls initially being wowed by the series' early focus on open-world gameplay - and its feeling of discovery, something that seems a key feature again in the upcoming Assassin's Creed Shadows. 
</p>
<p>
"When Assassin's Creed came out, I don't think any game did exploring that way," he says. "I really enjoy the discovery, and so I try to find ways to make you want to stay in that world - even if you've completed a game. A good soundtrack can really do that, if it's carefully constructed."
</p>
<p>
The Assassin's Creed series has evolved significantly over the past 15 years, to the point where its modern day meta-story is now entirely detached from its historical narrative, and is set to be told through the Assassin's Creed Infinity game/hub/experience/thing in the future. But early games in the franchise had you hopping in and out of its Animus device repeatedly - something Kyd tried to reflect in his music. 
</p>
<p>
"[The Animus] was such a huge part of what Assassin's Creed was in the beginning. And I think that is something we now all understand as part of the story. But to set up Assassin's Creed, the Animus was very important. So of course, sci-fi was important. 
</p>
<blockquote>"I try to find ways to make you want to stay in that world - even if you've completed a game."</blockquote>
<p>
"I remember for Assassin's Creed 1, when you were being chased across the rooftops by guards, we had all this escape music," he continues. "And we had all these different states the escape music could be - low, medium and high. Patrice [Desilets, Assassin's Creed co-creator] wanted this music to be electronic, and the idea was the Animus was being pushed to the absolute maximum when you're in those moments - it's why you see screen-tearing and so forth. That's when the sci-fi came out and why it's scored that way. 
</p>
<p>
"In Valhalla, the sci-fi is done in a different way. I wanted the score for Valhalla to sound more realistic and I didn't want any electronic elements in there because the game was so incredibly gritty and realistic and everything took place outdoors in really large, natural environments. You're just so far away from hidden locations in cities where some sci-fi stuff might be going on in a dungeon somewhere.
</p>
<p>
"But the way I was able to blend the Animus and the sci-fi aspect into the music was I filtered and processed all the live performances. Everything had to start from the foundation of being a live performance, but then I would filter and process everything on top. It gave it a different sound. It's not a super-authentic Viking sound, that was never the idea. But the idea was  it could fit in the Viking era and then I would process everything to make it feel more modern, so that was the way I filtered in the Animus on that."
</p>
<p>
Hearing Kyd talk excitedly about his work on the Assassin's Creed series, I don't get the feeling his time with it is done. "It's not a closed book at all," he says, when I ask if he would return. And until then, his theme will continue defining the series' sound, wherever it goes. It must be a source of pride, I ask, that this theme continues. "Yeah, absolutely," he concludes. "It is."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to Mario’s traditional platforming adventures, the story is mostly set dressing. There’s an intro about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Peach being captured</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">Bowser turning into a sentient castle</a>, and then you get on with the jumping and exploring. But there’s a rich and interesting world that goes underexplored — which is where Mario’s roleplaying spinoffs come in. Since the original <em>Super Mario RPG</em> on the SNES, these games have not only given more stories and character to the <em>Mario</em> universe but they’re also somehow even weirder than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch">the already quite weird mainline games</a>.</p><p>And with the addition of the new remaster of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, the Nintendo Switch (and its subscription service) has slowly turned into a great starting point for getting started with the <em>Mario</em> RPG universe.</p><p>The obvious place to start with the franchise is <em>Super Mario RPG</em>. For a while, that was easier said than done. Unlike most Nintendo games, <em>Mario RPG</em> hasn’t been ported all that much; there’s the original SNES version, rereleases on the Wii / Wii U virtual console, and its inclusion in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/27/16363696/super-nintendo-snes-classic-edition-review">SNES Classic Edition</a>. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23960646/super-mario-rpg-review-nintendo-switch">last year, the Switch got a full-on remake</a>, which doesn’t change much aside from introducing proper 3D graphics and some quality-of-life tweaks.</p><p>But it didn’t <em>need</em> to change much: this game is a delight. Created in collaboration with <em>Final Fantasy</em> maker Square Enix (then SquareSoft), it’s a fairly traditional RPG — which means turn-based battles, gear upgrades, and magic — that turns the Mushroom Kingdom into a fever dream of a fantasy realm. It somehow manages to marry slapstick humor with an epic quest, stuff it with <em>Mario</em> references, and still feel cohesive.</p><p>From there, <em>Mario</em> RPGs went on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/12/10972838/mario-and-luigi-paper-jam-interview">two diverging paths</a>. One of them is only lightly represented on the Switch. As part of Nintendo Switch Online’s library of Game Boy Advance titles, you can play <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</em>, which, as the name implies, has players controlling both brothers on a goofy journey to rescue Peach’s voice from an evil bean. To give a sense of how odd <em>Superstar Saga</em> can get: the game opens with a scene where you see Luigi doing laundry and Mario in the shower. It only gets sillier from there. But its playful approach to combat and storytelling makes it stand up even now.</p><p>The other spinoff series is <em>Paper Mario</em>. It kicked off on the N64, and the original game is available as part of Switch Online. What defines this series — aside from the distinct lack of playable Luigi — is its papercraft aesthetic. Not only does it give the games a playful look but it also creates all kinds of opportunities for great jokes and fun gameplay. Depending on the game, Mario can turn into a paper airplane or travel around the world using a fax machine.</p><p>The series arguably peaked with <em>Thousand-Year Door</em>, which originally launched on the GameCube in 2004. It maintains the lighthearted charms and solid yet accessible gameplay of its predecessors, but it builds on them with a surprisingly deep and interesting story and an extremely odd and lovable cast of characters. The remaster on the Switch mostly adds some welcome quality-of-life-tweaks, so that personality remains intact. Unfortunately, from there, the <em>Paper Mario</em> series slowly drifted away from its RPG roots, with subsequent releases shifting more into action territory.</p><p>That said, I have to give a special shoutout to 2020’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324614/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Origami King</em></a> on the Switch. While it’s not as pure of an RPG as <em>Thousand-Year Door</em>, it is still absolutely hilarious and has some of the most memorable — and heartbreaking — character moments in the entire series. Bobby the Bob-omb has forever changed how I view <em>Super Mario</em> enemies.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether I wanted to check out for 20 minutes or 20 hours, <em>Hades </em>was there, and it was replete with narrative twists and turns, excellent combat, and best-in-class art to pass the time and delight me.

I literally can’t believe <em>Hades 2</em> is like this, despite having had it for some time now. After a few dozen hours with the current <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155">early access</a></span> build and multiple attempts on Chronos’ life, I’m in utter disbelief. It somehow polishes rough edges I never even noticed while playing the near-flawless predecessor, and though it is unfinished (it’s an Early Access release), <em>Hades 2 </em>is a <em>force</em>.<br></p><h2 id="h1592"><a id=""></a><strong>A fresh new face</strong></h2><p>Where to start? Why not with where the game starts: as its new protagonist Melinoë and the player embark on their first run. <em>Hades 2</em>, much like its clever predecessor, cuts right to the action yet makes it very clear that it isn’t a simple rehash of a winning formula. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-god-mode-autofire-timer-1851461987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-god-mode-autofire-timer-1851461987"><em>Hades 2</em></a></span> immediately expands on the first game’s range of abilities by bestowing Melinoë with new skills thanks to her connection to Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft who acts as a maternal figure and mentor for our new heroine.</p><p>By the time that <em>Hades </em>launched into 1.0, the game’s protagonist Zagreus had access to a stacked armory of weapons, but his own moves were fairly restrained. He had an attack, a heavy move, a dash and a throwable cast. By comparison, Melinoë has at least double the moveset, since she can now charge each of her techniques into what the game calls Omega moves, sometimes boasting different effects and doing greater damage. Instead of a separate heavy attack though, Mel can throw down a casting circle whose effects are augmented according to the boons that she collects over the course of a run. This change, as well as a dramatically slower dash, often makes Mel feel slower than Zagreus ever was, but also much more powerful and tactical. Zag was a straight-up brawler through and through, and brazenly blasting through enemies proved to be the winning tactic in most of my successful <em>Hades </em>runs. This no longer feels like the case in the follow-up. Melinoë feels like she’s more emboldened to be tactical, and <em>Hades 2 </em>certainly plays better when I use her kit to the fullest extent.</p><figure id="" data-id="449221ff236994e2f2b67e5815e6e4c4" data-recommend-id="image://449221ff236994e2f2b67e5815e6e4c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Melinoë arriving back at camp after a run in Hades 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Melinoë arriving back at camp after a run in Hades 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Supergiant Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="449221ff236994e2f2b67e5815e6e4c4" data-recommend-id="image://449221ff236994e2f2b67e5815e6e4c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Melinoë arriving back at camp after a run in Hades 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Melinoë also has quite the armory, including a pair of twin blades that have quickly become my favored weapons. She also has an interesting pair of torches that necessitate the constant use of her magick and a ranged skull weapon, as well as a more traditional ax. Though I’ve yet to play with all of them and their numerous aspects equally, I’ve seen enough to suggest that Supergiant most assuredly didn’t rest on its laurels developing new ways to cut your way through hell. When you aren’t fighting though, <em>Hades 2</em> also boasts a number of supplementary systems and features, like resource farming, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-incantations-unlock-first-tips-1851461926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-incantations-unlock-first-tips-1851461926">crafting</a></span>, additional currencies, base-building, and even steamy social interactions, that make the current early access build impressive and also massively daunting.<br></p><p>Melinoë isn’t just Zagreus’ mechanical opposite though, she is also his little sister, and her desire for a relationship to the House of Hades is a central thrust of <em>Hades 2</em>. It’s an inspired inversion of Zag’s desire to break free of the very same chains in the first game. Zag was a firebrand and a smartmouth, which in turn made for a charming and roguish protagonist. Mel isn’t too far behind, at least as far as her mouth is concerned, but she leads with sympathy and a determination that strikes a far more resonant chord with me. I never really wanted to rip Zag from his family, even if that was never the <em>real</em> goal of <em>Hades</em>, but I <em>do </em>want to reunite Mel with the family she was deprived of.<br></p><h2 id="h1593"><a id=""></a><strong>A greater pantheon goes to war</strong></h2><p>Speaking of, Mel and Zag do have one other thing in common: neither of them is particularly close to their larger family at the outset of their adventures. For reasons that are revealed over the events of <em>Hades 2</em>, Mel was also raised apart from her aunts, uncles, and numerous cousins on Mount Olympus, who once again return in the sequel to forge relationships with Mel and strengthen her over the course of a run. Favorites like Aphrodite, the embodiment of love and sex, return alongside Zeus and the dazzling Apollo, while Hestia and Hephaestus make incredibly impactful debuts and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-hephaestus-technical-test-fat-greek-gods-1851419788&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-hephaestus-technical-test-fat-greek-gods-1851419788">broaden the spectrum</a></span> of <em>Hades</em>’ limited view of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-aphrodite-gods-characters-hot-sexy-1851423220&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-aphrodite-gods-characters-hot-sexy-1851423220">beauty</a></span>.</p><p>On the matter of boons, <em>Hades 2</em>’s pantheon is even greater than their last outing. Similar boons and some overpowered gods (RIP Athena) have fallen away to make room for a greater range of differentiating abilities. Hestia’s flames singe enemies over time, for example, rewarding players who take their time chipping away at foes. This comes in stark contrast to many of Athena’s abilities in the first game, which often made players invulnerable and emboldened them to dash into the fray. Demeter’s freezing capabilities have always felt powerful, but her late-game addition in <em>Hades </em>muted the arrival of her moveset to some degree. By comparison, I believe Demeter was one of the first gods I met as Mel in <em>Hades 2</em> and her boons have proven to be an essential part of my own kit, solidifying Demeter’s place in my war on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-fight-pause-1851467769&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-fight-pause-1851467769">Chronos</a></span>.</p><p>Even the most familiar abilities, like Zeus’ crackling chain-electricity and Poseidon’s crashing waves, feel greater than their previous incarnations, thanks to <em>Hades 2</em>’s art, which is somehow even more gorgeous and vivid than the first game. You have not lived powerfully until you have seen the most violent waves emanate from the swing of your ax.</p><figure id="" data-id="6430b2998a11e8b406f5315db10a3160" data-recommend-id="image://6430b2998a11e8b406f5315db10a3160" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Nemesis talking to Melinoë in Hades 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Nemesis talking to Melinoë in Hades 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Supergiant Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6430b2998a11e8b406f5315db10a3160" data-recommend-id="image://6430b2998a11e8b406f5315db10a3160" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Nemesis talking to Melinoë in Hades 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Hades 2</em>’s gods aren’t just power ups though, and figure into the story far more heavily. Mt. Olympus is at war with its granddaddy Chronos, who’s sacked the underworld and Hades’ family, and is prompting a war on two fronts. <em>Hades</em>’ depiction of the gods felt celebratory but never challenging. In <em>Hades 2</em> though, the gods are engaged: Hermes is scouting behind enemy lines, Artemis hunts down the forces of Chronos, Charon and the River Styx are our heroes’ supply lines, and absences like Ares and Athena are explained by the fact that the world is, in fact, at war right now and needs their attention. Even some of the lesser gods who fill your base camp throw a little fuel on the fire at times.<br></p><p>Nemesis, who begrudges her post at the Crossroads and wants to fight, will occasionally go rogue, leading to encounters with her in the wild. Sometimes she’ll sit at Charon’s shop pondering what to buy, and if you don’t scoop up everything before her, she could grab a game-changing boon. Often enough, she’ll challenge the player to a competition and make off through a door that had a reward you really wanted. This is much like how interactions with Thanatos functioned in the first game, but here, the writing turns Nemesis into a bristling companion whose loyalties and desires work in conflict to make memorable and defining moments. The larger cast of <em>Hades 2 </em>feel complex and tangible, and I’m fascinated by how Supergiant will continue to mold them over the course of the early access period.</p><h2 id="h1594"><a id=""></a><strong>Revisiting hell</strong></h2><p><em>Hades 2</em>’s narrative and world benefit from an inverted approach. Whereas the first game saw Zag fiercely fighting his way up out of the underworld, the second sees Mel fighting her way back down to her old family home and freeing it from Chronos.</p><p>By the end of the first <em>Hades</em>, you might’ve been forgiven for thinking the team had stretched itself thin in terms of level design. Tartarus’ straight-faced chambers eventually gave way to a sea of environmental hazards in Asphodel, before expanding ever so slightly with the calming (but menacingly packed) fields of Elysium, and culminating in the suffocating chambers of the satyr temple. <em>Hades </em>handled each one of these areas expertly, which tackled a typical tenet of game design and seemed to knock it out of the park.</p><p><em>Hades 2 </em>doubles down on many of the same principles, but does so with such aplomb that their first incarnations look like pedestrian trials by comparison. However, it doesn’t stop there, and <em>Hades 2 </em>successfully blows up ideas and remixes them into something even more novel. Of particular note is the Fields of Mourning, which is <em>Hades 2</em>’s markedly difficult third region that toys with open-ended spaces with a myriad of smaller objectives. This just happens to be an idea that <em>Hades 2 </em>lifts from the most tightly packed region of the first game and splices it into a different mold to great success.</p><figure id="" data-id="7368a35fc80d7d5450ea3d2eeddc0865" data-recommend-id="image://7368a35fc80d7d5450ea3d2eeddc0865" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Melinoë unleashing an Omega attack in the Fields of Mourning, one of Hades 2's more difficult regions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Melinoë unleashing an Omega attack in the Fields of Mourning, one of Hades 2's more difficult regions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Supergiant Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7368a35fc80d7d5450ea3d2eeddc0865" data-recommend-id="image://7368a35fc80d7d5450ea3d2eeddc0865" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Melinoë unleashing an Omega attack in the Fields of Mourning, one of Hades 2's more difficult regions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Supergiant’s impeccable artistry makes this familiar world sing. Each of the regions feel like a far cry from the last, and the boss characters at the end of them are not only wonderful to behold, but a thrill to fight. I hope I never tire of fighting Scylla and her band of sirens in Oceanus, who play instruments and sing songs about fighting you throughout the encounter. Knocking them out one by one will cause their piece of the composition (vocals, drums, guitar, etc.) to go mute, just one of the several inconsequential flourishes that Supergiant deploys to give you some impact in the world.<br></p><p>Just as I began to feel comfortable running the gauntlets of Oceanus and the Fields of Mourning, which led me to several Chronos encounters, <em>Hades 2</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-surface-unraveling-a-fateful-bond-thalamus-1851466545&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-surface-unraveling-a-fateful-bond-thalamus-1851466545">revealed a second parallel storyline</a></span> and another gorgeous set of worlds and characters to be introduced to. This story, which takes place above ground in Greece, comes with its own set of regions that defy the rules of how you think a <em>Hades </em>level <em>should </em>work, and it isn’t even done yet.</p><h2 id="h1595"><a id=""></a><strong>The story’s not over</strong></h2><p>The greatest problem with <em>Hades 2 </em>is that it’s simply not done. I truly mean that. There’s placeholder art all over certain characters and some of the regions featured in the early access build are clearly unfinished. Character arcs are currently suspended in limbo as Supergiant Games works on wrapping up the game for sometime in 2025. There are still places we haven’t seen, dialogue we haven’t heard, and reveals that we’ll just have to wait for while the studio cooks. One thing’s for sure though: it’s only going to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-first-patch-faster-sprint-dash-resources-1851482260&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-first-patch-faster-sprint-dash-resources-1851482260">continue to get better</a></span>.</p><p>It’s both agonizing and wonderful knowing that the thing I’m prepared to spend so much time with is going to have surprises for me for at least the next year. Even now, I’m nowhere near done with the current build, but I feel confident enough in what I’ve played to say without a trace of doubt or hesitation that <em>Hades 2 </em>is a hell of a victory lap for Supergiant.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sonic Rumble has been penned as a ‘first in the Sonic series’, a multiplayer-based action title that can accommodate up to 32 players, all of whom will assume control of an iconic character or variant from the decades-old franchise. It features survival and racing mechanics, with players tasked with charging through various courses, collecting rings and power-ups, fighting off their opponents, and completing tracks as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that the closed beta for the game kicks off tomorrow, which means we can expect snippets of gameplay to start surfacing from this weekend onwards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-get-ready-to-rumble">Get Ready to Rumble</h2>



<p>Here’s the spiel from the press release that was used to announce Sonic Rumble:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>In&nbsp;Sonic Rumble, players will take control of toy figures to compete in thrilling 32-player battle royale challenges, racing against each other to collect the most rings and prove themselves to be the fastest in the toybox. With iconic characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog universe available for customization, players can create their own unique avatars and dive into the action-packed gameplay.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://x.com/sonicstadium/status/1793642139936805049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sonic Stadium revealed on Twitter</a> that the invitations for the closed beta have finally been sent out, and that some users in North America have managed to get access to the game. They also noted that there doesn’t appear to be an NDA for the beta, which means that testers <strong>should </strong>be free to post gameplay, previews, and screenshots online.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of Sonic Rumble content already out in the open thanks to Sega, but getting the first-hand impressions of legitimate playtesters is always a different story.</p>



<p>Have you applied for access to the Sonic Rumble beta?</p>

If you leave Blunderville Square, you can speak to the <strong>Blunderville Attendant</strong> in <strong>The Gold Saucer (X:5.8, Y: 6.3) to get back in</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">To begin an obstacle course, speak to the <strong>Blundarville Registrar</strong> and join the queue for a 24-man showdown for the crown. And if you’re here after the December deadline, don’t fret. The <em>FFXIV </em>x <em>Fall Guys </em>collab is a limited-time affair, but only for now. It will return as a special event at irregular intervals.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">How the Fall Guys Collab works</h2> <figure data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">After queueing into the Blunderville competition, you’ll need to race to the end of three obstacle courses. Those who make the cut continue to the next round as a contestant. However, even if you lose, you can still watch in Spectator Mode and get a feel for what each course is like. </p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Round 1: </strong>Be one of the first 16 to reach the end.</li> <li><strong>Round 2: </strong>Be one of the first 8 to the end.</li> <li><strong>Round 3:</strong> Be the first to the top.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="185" data-injectable="false">Wins net you 100 MGF, while a fail rewards 50 MGF.

<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> rapidly established itself as a hack ‘n’ slash that’s not afraid of doing things differently, though <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-acknowledges-major-issues-with-promises-to-fix-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its Early Access status</a> means it’s rough around the edges. That’s bound to change as the game is updated, of course, and Patch 2 is proof enough of that.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">Notably, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4188989134082981436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>‘s Early Access Patch 2</a> is the biggest update the game’s received yet. Sure, it <em>is </em>only the second major update <em>Wicked</em> has gotten so far, but I’ll allow it. It’s a sizeable chunk of improvements across the board, for sure: between performance uplifts, control scheme improvements, all-new gameplay features, and a variety of fixes and balancing boons, there’s a <em>lot</em> to like here.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-patch-2-overview" data-injectable="false">No Rest for the Wicked Early Access Patch 2 overview</h2> <p data-characters="82" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">First things first, then, let’s go over Patch 2’s performance uplifts:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true"> <li>Upscaler availability: DLSS 3.7 and FSR 2.2 options are now both available</li> <li>Various CPU optimizations</li> <li>Performance Mode improvements: lowered texture resolution, leading to better performance and stability on low-end machines</li> <li>Various memory leak fixes</li> <li>GPU culling improvements (lower latency and overhead, with better stability)</li> <li>Steam Deck improvements (optimizations in the texture resolution and memory budget departments)</li> <li>Improved Ambient Occlusion rendering performance</li> <li>Various additional optimizations in art rendering, memory use, and other items</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Impressive stuff across the board, though it’ll take a bit before we can properly quantify just how <em>much</em> better the game might be running now. The presence of upscalers alone should help massively in GPU bottleneck scenarios, however, so that’s great news for sure. Patch 2 goes far beyond just performance improvements, however:</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"> <li>Introduces the Respec system via the Cerim Crucible Atrium statue (1 Fallen Ember per attribute point reallocation)</li> <li>Introduces the weapon try-out system: players can equip a given weapon regardless of its attribute requirements</li> <li>(Re)introduces the ‘Misc’ inventory tab that separates Housing Items, Runes, Fallen Embers, and other assorted goodies from the rest of your inventory</li> <li>Added a new set of Enchantments</li> <li>Spear weapons can now be upgraded with ‘Throw’ runes</li> <li>Pig Sticker and Assegai blueprints added to Fillmore and Whittacker’s shops, respectively</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">Some extremely solid improvements here, too, but that as well is just the start of it. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4188989134082981436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Steam blog post</a> lists a <em>massive </em>array of other tweaks and changes, many of them having to do with bugs, faulty bounties, localization issues, and various assorted audio improvements. Note that certain VFX instances have been made “juicier,” notably in the blood and gore department, so that might be fun to see in action.</p>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">Regardless, things are looking solid so far for <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>! <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/struggling-in-no-rest-for-the-wicked-stop-playing-it-like-diablo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s not a game you can play as you would a regular hack ‘n’ slash</a>, of course, but Moon Studio is clearly unafraid of pushing the envelope here, and I, for one, am thrilled to see what the team makes of <em>Wicked</em>. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-update-dynamic-difficulty-more</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/abiotic-factor-update-brings-dynamic-difficulty-and-much-more.879639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-update-dynamic-difficulty-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>update has been released, and this one's focused on bringing improvements and features the community has been requesting.</p>

<p>Community Update #1, as it's snappily being referred to, brings a number of features the&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>player base has been asking for, including some difficulty tweaks, a new save backup system, and more.</p>

<p>First up, some behind-the-scenes dynamic difficulty tweaks have been made to&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>for solo and co-op scientists, and though the changes are small, developer Deep Field Games says they should "have a large effect on combat pacing in general".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-difficulty.jpg?itok=Topv7J2V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-difficulty.jpg?itok=mzM_pCy8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat difficulty should have been tweaked for the better in the latest&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>A new save backup system has also been introduced, and it should help if you've found your&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>world being corrupted (beyond the aliens-trying-to-murder-you corruption, which is totally normal).</p>

<p>The game will now keep up to five backups just in case something terrible happens to your world, and if a problem is detected,&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>will ask if you'd like to use a backup instead. This system works for dedicated servers, too.</p>

<p>Improvements have been made to Repair Benches, too; they'll now pull ingredients from nearby storage if a bench has the Item Transporter function, and a number of other, smaller improvements have been made as well.</p>

<p>You can now paint your Cement Bag Walls, so you can make them look like a giant game of&nbsp;<em>Breakout&nbsp;</em>if you like, and small storage crates can also be painted.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-painted-walls.jpg?itok=AQp-EaDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-painted-walls.jpg?itok=zNPIOdPZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to paint your Cement Bag Walls in&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>? Well, now you can!</figcaption></figure><p>This&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>Community Update has a ton of other small changes and tweaks that should all go together to make your gameplay experience smoother. You can check out <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/427410/discussions/7/4331978422249478585/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>is a survival-crafter set in an underground research facility where something has gone very awry. You - and, optionally, your friends - must carve out a life for yourself by scavenging for resources, navigating the facility, and avoiding being killed.</p>

<p>The game has managed to pick up an audience for itself; within its first couple of weeks on sale, it managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-250k">rack up around 250,000 sales</a>, no mean feat for a game that's entering a pretty crowded market.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>

  <p id="SguPqV"><em>Bread and Fred is </em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/bread-and-fred-switch/"><em>now available on Nintendo Switch</em></a><em> — a great platform for its special brand of co-op play. We’re re-publishing this story for the added console release.</em></p>
<p id="gctezw">In <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em>, you’re tied to another penguin by a very short rope, and you’ll need some serious teamwork to make the climb. So, Ana and I (Nicole) are taking on our impressions together, as a team. Think of this story as the rope tying us together to bring you our thoughts on the game’s chaotic platforming. We’re each writing a paragraph and then letting the other take over; Ana’s paragraphs will be in italics. </p>
<hr id="aDv6D4">
<p id="HxmXfD"><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> was released in May by a three-person indie team called SandCastles Studio, and it has been hugely popular on TikTok since. It’s a game that’s perfect for the internet in the same ways <em>Fall Guys</em> or <em>Overcooked</em> are: It requires skill, but even the worst players are rewarded with slapstick animations of squished penguins and hilarious falls.</p>
<p id="8xGdXD"><em>I can only take a step or two until the rope goes taught, and I’m stuck in place until my partner makes progress on their end. Actions like basic jumps to a nearby platform require a level of coordination sometimes hindered by stream latency and potential lag in voice chat. My partner and I stay in constant communication. All of this just so that we can climb a few measly meters. </em></p>

<p id="xjbQOb">It’s hard. The platforming looks relatively simple, but deceptively so. What looks to be simply jumping over gaps is made complicated by the short rope. Thankfully, <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> does have several options to make the game more approachable — one crucial example is a checkpoint system that you can turn on in the options menu. It allows you to put a flag in the ground, which acts as a spawn point if you make one disastrous fall. (We made plenty of those as we started our journey up the mountain.) <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> also has a handy in-game countdown timer, too, which became essential for precise, coordinated leaps, but we developed our own system for areas that required one of us to anchor on a platform while the other swung wildly to get enough force to fling both penguins to the next step.</p>
<p id="DHPuBq"><em>We don’t ascend the mountain very quickly, but the game slowly begins to click. We move in sync, and eventually, each of our penguins looks like a veritable shadow of the other. After dozens of tries, we make an extra-long jump that requires precise timing both on the part of the anchor penguin and the swinging penguin. (No one gets to slack off on this climb!) We use these swinging physics to fling us both to a cave wall. I hold on to the wall while my penguin partner swings to the other side. After completing an extensive series of difficult jumps, our penguins give each other a thumbs-up, and we proudly put a flag in the ground to mark our progress. </em></p>

<p id="tKb5uz">It’s super satisfying to get to those points and to celebrate, but <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> is almost even more fun to watch someone else play — you get to luxuriate in someone else’s mistakes. This is where its popularity on TikTok and other social media platforms comes in; you get <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8e3ggwf/">all of the goofs</a> and none of the face-first falling. People like to joke about the game ruining friendships, something akin to Mario Party. That sort of engagement is a big part of the fun of it all, watching or playing, creating moments where you can poke fun at your friends and celebrate your big wins.</p>
<p id="jAA1Jf"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1607680/Bread__Fred/"><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em></a> is available to play on Windows PC via Steam. It’s got online multiplayer and remote play, as well as a single-player mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163213/dave-the-diver-godzilla-dlc-limited-time-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="LqBb5N"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23777236/dave-the-diver-review-management-sim-steam-pc"><em>Dave the Diver</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23648669/best-video-games-2023">weird and wonderful</a> fishing and restaurant management game from 2023, has new <em>Godzilla</em> downloadable content out today: Godzilla is invading the Blue Hole. Yes, the kaiju Godzilla, all teeth and fire. It’s a free DLC pack for people that already own <em>Dave the Diver</em> on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-godzilla-content-pack-70050000049100-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP8236-PPSA19115_00-0215443120330132">PlayStation 5</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2841140/DAVE_THE_DIVER__Godzilla_Content_Pack/#app_reviews_hash">Windows PC via Steam</a>. The only catch is that you’re only able to download it until Nov. 23 — a six month period.</p>
<p id="CtXAR5">Why? That’s not entirely clear, but my best guess is that it’s due to the licensing of the big monster. (We’ve reached out to developer Mintrocket for clarification.) But as long as you download it before then, you’re good.</p>
<p id="CLeFx1">The Godzilla DLC brings both Godzilla and an original Kaiju — a big lobster — to <em>Dave the Diver</em>. You’ll at least fight the lobster kaiju, Ebirah, in a submarine-based battle. And yes, Godzilla and Ebirah will fight. It looks to be a short, but engaged addition much like the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23992943/dredge-dave-the-diver-crossover-2023"><em>Dredge</em> crossover</a> content that was released in December last year. (<em>Dredge</em>, like <em>Dave the Diver</em>, is a fishing game from 2023, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23669611/dredge-review-fishing-game-horror">with a grotesque, spooky spin</a>. The <em>Dredge</em> DLC in <em>Dave the Diver</em> added a bunch of <em>Dredge</em>’s weird fish.) Beyond the lobster battle, you’ll also be able to find monster figures hidden throughout the Blue Hole.</p>
<p id="MsJVJ4">If you haven’t already tried <em>Dave the Diver</em>, you should. It’s so much more than just a fishing game and restaurant management sim: The deeper you go, the larger the secrets. Last year, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23648669/best-video-games-2023">it earned the 12th spot on our games of the year list</a>.</p>

  <p id="goJFhR">Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22352984/netflix-new-anime-release-date-yasuke-way-househusband-ragnarok">continued investment in anime</a> has yielded fruit over the past couple of years. The streaming service has amassed a selection of some of not only the most popular and iconic anime series in recent memory, but also a host of impressive original anime titles. It has secured the platform’s position as of the go-to streaming services for the medium. With over 100 titles to choose from across a smorgasbord of subgenres including sci-fi, fantasy, slice-of-life comedy, mecha, action, and more, the right anime for the right mood has never been more available and simultaneously harder to find.</p>
<p id="21sKyX">Don’t sweat it; we’ve got you covered. Poring over Netflix’s rich catalog of anime titles, we’ve assembled a list of the best anime to stream on Netflix right now. From classic series like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/22772957/cowboy-bebop-voice-cast-actors-best-episodes"><em>Cowboy Bebop</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/29/18115299/how-to-watch-neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-rebuild-netflix"><em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em></a> to Netflix Originals like <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em> and <em>Devilman Crybaby</em>, here are the very best anime series the platform has to offer.</p>

<p id="c59wOa">Based on mascot company Sanrio’s original character, Netflix’s original animated comedy <em>Aggretsuko</em> follows Retsuko, a 25-year-old anthropomorphic red panda working in the accounting department of a Japanese trading company. Frustrated with her thankless job, domineering boss, and boring love life, Retsuko vents her millennial rage in the only way she knows how: through death metal karaoke. Eventually, Retsuko’s misery and the knowledge of her after-work activity catch up with her professional life, forcing the young red panda to experience a series of meaningful revelations and changes while struggling to figure out what just exactly she wants out of life and who she wants to build that life with. Eccentric, funny, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/8/17321016/aggretsuko-netflix-sanrio-anime">deeply relatable</a>, <em>Aggretsuko</em> is anime’s answer to <em>Bojack Horseman</em>. With four seasons of 15-minute episodes, now is the perfect time to catch up and see what all the hubbub is about. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="sVznYO"><em>Beastars</em> tells the story of a wolf who wants to have sex with a rabbit but worries he will devour said rabbit. I think it’s a metaphor for puberty. Maybe it’s holding a magnifying glass to sexual violence on campus. Or perhaps it’s a coming-of-age story about a generation of young people disconnected from their parents by rapidly changing norms. Frankly, I’ve stopped caring about what it’s <em>about.</em></p>
<p id="O0juyC"><em>Beastars</em> works when I quit trying to make a one-to-one connection between our world and its city of horny teenage carnivores and herbivores. I enjoy the show best when I take its internal logic on its own terms. In that way, <em>Beastars</em> is like <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. A sexy, violent, and often frustrating tale of star-crossed lovers kept apart by society. And like the works of Shakespeare, <em>Beastars</em> can be contorted into whatever else you want it to be. <em>—Chris Plante</em></p>

<p id="Ha6UPQ">Directed by Shinichirō Watanabe (<em>Cowboy Bebop</em>) and produced by anime studio Bones (<em>My Hero Academia</em>), <em>Carole &amp; Tuesday</em> is a spirited drama that hones in on one of the most persistent passion topics of Watanabe’s career: music. Set on a terraformed Mars in the distant future, the anime follows the story of Tuesday Simmons and Carole Stanley, two teenage girls from starkly different backgrounds who bond over their shared dream of becoming musicians. </p>
<p id="kLVAw7">Teaming up as a singer-songwriter duo, the pair navigate the thorny challenges and euphoric highs of their nascent musical career as they grow and bring out the best in both each other and those around them. Featuring the return of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto and original music and vocal performances courtesy of Thundercat, Flying Lotus, Denzel Curry, and more, <em>Carole &amp; Tuesday</em> is a bubbly and beautiful musical anime bursting with heart where it matters most. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="c5mLto">Speaking of Shinichirō Watanabe, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, his 1998 sci-fi Western noir anime produced by Sunrise, is considered by many to be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22723178/cowboy-bebop-anime-best-episodes-to-watch">one of most exemplary anime series ever made</a>. Set in the year 2071, the series follows the stories of four people: Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, and “Radical” Edward as they traipse across the solar system hunting  criminals and chasing bounties. </p>
<p id="ySzWfr">A work of retro-futuristic pastiche that pulls from several dozen influences in the creation of its own universe, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> is an enduring classic of the medium for its rich storytelling, heady themes, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22783964/cowboy-bebop-music-yoko-kanno-soundtrack-behind-the-scenes">a spectacular and eclectic score by composer Yoko Kanno</a>. If you’ve somehow never seen <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> before, (1) now’s the perfect time to and (2) I am both jealous of and excited for you. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="prXCxm">Studio Trigger’s 2022 anime spinoff set in the universe of CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23014759/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-5-review-ps5-xbox-series-x"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/6/17656920/cyberpunk-2077-fps-story-themes-political">Mike Pondsmith</a>’s original TTRPG not only earned a spot on our list of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22919571/best-anime-2022">best anime of 2022</a>, but took home the prize for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23624896/anime-awards-2023-winners-list-cyberpunk-attack-on-titan-spy-family">Anime of the Year</a> at the 2023 Crunchyroll Anime Awards. It’s not hard to see why. As critic Kambole Campbell wrote in his <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23349865/cyberpunk-edgerunners-netflix-review-2077">review for Polygon</a>, “[<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em>] is easily the most exciting thing to come out of the game’s redemption arc.” </p>
<p id="q2uApQ">The series centers on David Martinez, a streetwise teenager growing up in the dystopian metropolis of Night City who, after losing his mother in a horrific accident and crossing paths with a beautiful and mysterious netrunner named Lucy, chooses to become a high-tech mercenary (or “Edgerunner”) in order to make a living and achieve his dream of one day becoming a “legend.” With Hiroyuki Imaishi (<em>Promare</em>) at the helm and Yoh Yoshinari (<em>Little Witch Academia</em>) serving as the series’ chief animation director and character designer, <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners </em>quickly asserted itself as not only one of the most impressive video game anime adaptations in recent memory, but as one of Studio Trigger’s most memorable creative efforts to date. </p>
<p id="gRy5aA">Stepping sideways from its source material, the series leaned into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23351457/cyberpunk-edgerunners-netflix-anime-2077-citizen-sleeper">thematic and emotional territory</a> heretofore unexplored by CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23014759/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-5-review-ps5-xbox-series-x">open-world action RPG</a>, and in doing so created a cast of characters whose respective arcs, motivations, and personalities shaped by a desperate grasp for stability and community in a predatory world left an impression on audiences that lasted far beyond its comparatively short 10-episode run. <em>Edgerunners</em> is the closest a contemporary anime series has come in years to emulating the hyper-violent, risque, and kinetic vitality of a late-’90s anime OVA. To paraphrase <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s protagonist, V: You’re either gonna love <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em> or want to burn it, no middle ground. But if you wanna know for sure, you just need to try it for yourself. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="2u1ieW">Based on Koyoharu Gotouge’s acclaimed manga series, <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> has quickly become an shōnen anime powerhouse on par with <em>My Hero Academia</em> and <em>Naruto</em> since the series premiered in 2019. Set in Taishō-era Japan, the anime follows the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted young boy who trains to become a demon slayer in order to find a cure for his sister, Nezuko, who was transformed into half-demon hybrid in the wake of the attack that claimed the lives of the rest of his family. </p>
<p id="mv3tLN">With jaw-dropping action sequences, brilliant hybrid animation blending traditional and 3D-modeled backgrounds, and a genuinely stirring story centered on the power of family and finding strength in the harshest of circumstances, <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> is one of the most popular anime series today for good reason. With a highly anticipated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23032963/demon-slayer-season-3-everything-we-know">third season coming up</a>, you absolutely must find the time to watch <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> now if you haven’t already. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="FihhPQ">Mitsuo Iso’s sci-fi slice-of-life anime <em>Den-noh Coil</em> is one of the most highly acclaimed yet underseen anime of the late aughts. Set in a future where augmented reality and internet-connected visors have become the norm, the anime follows Yūko Okonogi and her younger sister Kyōko, who move to the small town of Daikoku to live with their grandmother, Sanae. There, the two join the Coil Cyber Detective Agency, a small group of local kids who perform odd jobs and investigate mysteries that skew the line between the technological and the supernatural. </p>
<p id="IeETDi">Drawing inspiration from Japanese folklore and then-cutting-edge technology to tell a story filled with rich characters, subtle themes, outrageous humor, and novel creativity, <em>Den-noh Coil</em> is the definition of an anime cult classic and an absolute gem worth watching. —<em>TE</em></p>

<p id="35t5Ek">Based on Go Nagai’s massively influential manga and directed by Masaaki Yuasa (<em>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</em>), <em>Devilman Crybaby</em> was Netflix’s first original anime series and one of the breakout anime premieres of 2018. The series follows high school student Akira who, after reuniting with his childhood friend Ryo, is made aware of the existence of demons. Convinced that the only way to drive the demons back and save humanity is to create a human-demon hybrid — a so-called devilman — Ryo asks for Akira’s help by volunteering to fuse with one himself. Known for its unsparingly graphic action, ecstatic visual style, and emotionally gripping story, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/8/16862868/devilman-crybaby-season-1-review-netflix"><em>Devilman Crybaby</em> is a phenomenal adaptation</a> that breathes stunning new life into a bona-fide anime classic. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="S41aTn">I will never tire of the quick-witted and sharp-tongued humor of <em>The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. </em>This anime follows a high school boy named Kusuo Saiki who has a secret: he possesses world-altering psychic powers. All he wants to do is live his day-to-day life, go unnoticed, and indulge in a coffee jelly now and then. Unfortunately for Saiki, everybody in his life — from jock himbos to the hottest popular girl in school — decides they want to be his friend.</p>
<p id="ctIrsu">The dialog in this anime runs a mile a minute; I once had a friend say they struggled to keep up with the pace of the subtitles, but I love it. Saiki’s quick and deadpan narration contrasts with all the lovable idiots around him. Whether it’s microwaving a metal bowl or drowning in water that’s an inch deep, these characters really push the limits of bone-headedness. All and all, it makes for a comedy that combines fantastic observational humor with brainless antics.<em> —Ana Diaz</em></p>

<p id="vzMWq9">Based on Q Hayashida’s dark fantasy sci-fi manga, <em>Dorohedoro</em> follows the story of Caiman, a reptilian-headed amnesiac living in a dystopian metropolis known as the Hole where humans are preyed upon by malevolent sorcerers from another dimension. With the help of his friend Nikaido, Caiman hunts down these sorcerers in his search of the one who transformed him, devouring their heads into his mouth where a mysterious face at the back of his throat passes judgment on their fate. Yeah, and that’s not even the series at its weirdest. Comical, hyperviolent, and oddly endearing, <em>Dorohedoro</em> is one of the most bizarre, unique, and impressive anime to grace Netflix since it first premiered in 2020. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="ZXNIfi">Directed by Hiro Kaburagi (<em>Speed Grapher</em>) and produced by Wit Studio (<em>Vinland Saga</em>, <em>Attack on Titan</em>), the Netflix original anime <em>Great Pretender</em> is a rollicking comedy-drama with equal parts style, brains, and explosive action. Centering on the story of Makoto Edamura, a small-time Japanese conman who is taken under the wing of the dashing heist maestro Laurent Theirry, the series follows the intrepid band of thieves as they swagger from one beautiful locale to the next in their campaign to swindle the most notorious criminals out of their ill-gotten gains. Aside from the elaborate antics of the core cast, <em>Great Pretender</em> is absolutely stunning in its visual design, with exotic cities and countries rendered in picturesque layouts and backgrounds inspired by the British artist Brian Cook. Not only that, but with character designs courtesy of Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (<em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>) and an infectiously jazzy score by composer Yutaka Yamada, <em>Great Pretender</em> is a feast for the senses and absolute blast to watch unfold. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="npISMN"><em>Haikyu!! </em>is very often regarded as a favorite first sports anime — and for good reason. Even if you think you don’t care too much about volleyball, the vast cast of characters and their fun personalities are compelling. Sure, protagonist Hinata is the archetypal sports anime hero: He wants to be the very best ever. But the rest of the Karasuno boys’ volleyball team rounds him out, and the relationships they have with one another really shape the show.</p>
<p id="rqIVNK">And that’s how it gets you to care about volleyball. After all, the friendships and otherwise complex relationships between teammates all center around that one activity. Slowly but surely, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22152623/haikyuu-volleyball-anime-real-sports">even if you’re not sports-inclined</a>, you’ll begin to understand the magnetic allure of not just volleyball, but the broader world of sports. <em>—Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="tiO4BD"><em>Hunter x Hunter</em> is a 165-episode gift. Yes, there’s a cannibal furry arc. Yes, the clown man (OK, magician) is naked all the time. But look beyond the fact that I can’t describe this series in a way that will convince my friends to watch it. <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> is the pinnacle of shōnen anime. There’s not a shred of filler in it. A particular arc that involves Gon and pals fighting in the 251-floor Heavens Arena is the perfect example of <em>Hunter x Hunter</em>’s economy of storytelling: it only spends 10 episodes there, and the narrative payoff is so good.</p>
<p id="PGLK6p">By the time I reached the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22619955/hunter-x-hunter-chimera-ant-fans-netflix">61-episode-long Chimera Ant arc</a> (shut up), I would have died for these characters, and <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> is at times so emotionally wrenching that I nearly did. —<em>Simone de Rochefort</em></p>

<p id="fCZyu8">You know that thing you did as a kid when your friend would shoot their finger guns at you, but you’d say you were made out of metal, and then they’d say that their bullets are made out of metal-melting acid, but then you’d say that last night you snuck into their base and ate all their bullets? <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> is exactly like that, except instead of imaginative kids, everyone is an extremely beautiful fully grown adult man with a name like “Robert E.O. Speedwagon” or “Kars.”</p>
<p id="glrGYj"><em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> is pure spectacle. It’s a series built around absurd confrontations where the stakes aren’t always clear and the rules might as well not exist, but it’s a joy to look at. Characters strut around in avant-garde, impractical outfits and strike dramatic poses. They’re all named (seemingly arbitrarily) after classic rock musicians. It’s the kind of series that encourages you to keep watching, not with a compelling plot or great mystery, but just with the promise of seeing beautiful and weird men do things. I think that’s OK. —<em>Patrick Gill</em></p>

<p id="wLEgoL">Sawako Kuronuma is a misunderstood highschooler. Her peers think that she has supernatural powers and call her Sadako — because of her physical resemblance to the possessed girl from <em>The Ring</em> – and live in fear of her until one day a popular jock named Shota Kazehaya befriends Kuronuma. Thus begins her personal journey to make friends and connect with others in a meaningful way.</p>
<p id="9CskVg"><em>Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You</em> is the epitome of a slow-moving romance that takes dozens of episodes to have the slightest bit of romantic development. However, it doesn’t get lost in all the lovey-dovey feelings. At its heart, it’s about young people grappling with decisions they make when faced with miscommunication. Sometimes what we say and mean might seem obvious to one person, but isn’t actually that obvious at all! Its themes of communication and personal development, paired with a lovable cast of good kids, makes it an easy recommendation for me.<em> — AD</em></p>

<p id="BWtxHw">Kenji Nakamura’s 2007 series <em>Mononoke</em> is a cult favorite among anime enthusiasts who prefer a more eccentric and esoteric take on your average supernatural horror fiction. A spinoff of the 2006 anthology anime <em>Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales</em>, <em>Mononoke</em> follows the adventures of the “Medicine Seller,” a mysterious, wandering exorcist of sorts who travels across Edo-period Japan in search of wayward spirits whose unresolved emotional attachments have caused them to transform into malicious entities that feed and prey on negative human emotions. Divided into roughly five different storylines, the 12-episode anime sees the Medicine Seller using his various supernatural abilities to deduce the cause behind a spirit’s inability to part from the physical plane and successfully exorcise them using a sword that can only be unsheathed when the identity and motivations of the spirit are made known.</p>
<p id="DPyloS">The real strength of <em>Mononoke </em>is through its animation and avant-garde art style, drawing inspiration from classical Japanese illustration and painting techniques to create a world of bright palettes, flamboyant characters, and beautiful textures that feel like a ukiyo-e painting brought to life. If you’re a fan of <em>Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, you should make the time to watch this series, and even if you’re not, you should take the opportunity to catch up on the series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2023/8/4/23819984/mononoke-movie-trailer-summer-2024-announcement">before the feature-length anime film premieres next year</a>. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="apuiEM">Whenever I’m asked how to get into anime, I always respond with a question in turn. I never ask “What anime have you seen already?” or even “What kind of animation do you like?” but always “What kinds of stories do you like? What’s the last book, movie, or scripted television show that really caught your attention?” Anime is a diverse and multifaceted medium, one with a breadth of stories and experiences beyond the typical shonen action fare that many come to erroneously equate with the sum total of anime as a whole. My personal, prime example of this is <em>Monster</em>, the 2004 anime adaptation of Naoki Urasawa’s 1994 manga series, and I can’t tell you how excited I am to finally be able to recommend it to folks new to anime.</p>
<p id="b2Z9Ev">An outlier when compared to most other popular anime, <em>Monster</em> is a psychological crime thriller set in postwar Germany. The series centers on Kenzo Tenma, an esteemed Japanese brain surgeon living and working in Düsseldorf, who is faced with a spur-of-the-moment choice of saving the life of a child with a gunshot wound to their head or the city’s mayor — and donor to Tenma’s hospital. Tenma chooses to operate on the child, and in doing so irrevocably alters the course of both of their lives forever.</p>
<p id="fO0a8T">With his career reputation tarnished in the wake of the mayor’s passing, Tenma is further haunted by the subsequent disappearance of the child, who vanished shortly after the operation to save his life. Several years later, Tenma is implicated in the murder of several of his hospital’s senior staff, and the culprit is none other than the child he saved — now a prolific and elusive serial killer. With no other choice, Tenma embarks on a quest in search of proof of his former patient’s identity and transgressions in order to clear his name, all while hounded by German police.</p>
<p id="X3GrNv">If you enjoy slow-burn procedural crime thrillers like <em>True Detective</em>, <em>Zodiac</em>, or <em>The Fugitive</em>, <em>Monster </em>is absolutely the anime for you. At 74 episodes, Masayuki Kojima and Madhouse’s series is a faithful adaptation of Urasawa’s manga and a riveting drama, patiently and meticulously unspooling a cast of unique characters whose respective storylines interweave into a complicated tapestry of murder, sex, lies, and conspiracy. After being difficult procure in the states for over a decade, Netflix finally added <em>Monster</em> to its library earlier this year. If for no other reason than its rarity, you should make time to watch this excellent and well-crafted piece of Japanese animated storytelling. I promise you won’t regret it. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="tWIt5p"><em>My Hero Academia</em>’s legacy is a complicated one: It’s classic shonen to a T, replicating the early beats of a lot of ’90s/2000s shonen (particularly <em>Naruto</em>) as it follows underdog Izuku Midoriya as he tries to make it at an elite high school for those with superpowers (known in-universe as “quirks”). It rocketed to massive popularity and had some foibles — slower or even straight-up misguided arcs that fans felt weighed it down.</p>
<p id="RdOSUB">Still, it left an indelible mark on the anime scene, and will be something that completionists in particular will want to check out. It was a gateway anime and one that will no doubt be a touchstone for years to come (and hopefully it sticks the landing). <em>—Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="plAgs7">Director Hideaki Anno’s apocalyptic mecha drama <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> is one of the undisputed titans of contemporary anime, commanding a passionate legion of fans since it first premiered in 1995 and amassing such a reverential reputation that it spawned <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22633960/rebuild-evangelion-movies-ending">a tetralogy of films</a> dedicated to reimagining its vast universe. Set 15 years after a worldwide cataclysm, the original series centers on Shinji Ikari, a 14-year-old boy who is enlisted by his estranged father to pilot an enormous bio-weapon known as an Evangelion in order to combat a mysterious legion of creatures codenamed “Angels.” </p>
<p id="zSGOLJ">Together with his fellow pilots Asuka Langley Soryu and Rei Ayanami, as well as his legal guardian/commanding officer Misato Katsuragi, Shinji must struggle with the pangs of growing up while defeating the Angels to save humanity. Of course, there’s way <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/7/21043182/neon-genesis-evangelion-netflix-anime-meaning-bible-depression-sexuality">more to this premise than meets the eye</a>. By equal turns psychological and eschatological, <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> subverts audience expectations at every turn to deliver one of the most memorable anime stories of all time, culminating in one of the most divisive, inspired finales ever produced for television. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="y7NSsI">Mitsuo Iso, the legendary animator known for his work on such classic films as <em>End of Evangelion</em> and <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, made his return to directing with the 2022 original anime <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22916144/the-orbital-children-anime-review-netflix"><em>The Orbital Children</em></a>. Produced 15 years after his first original work, the cult favorite sci-fi coming-of-age anime <em>Den-noh Coil</em>, Iso’s 2022 series saw the director revisit his fascination with speculative augmented reality technology and adolescence. </p>
<p id="dM0eIj">Centered on five children who find themselves stranded aboard a commercial space station in the wake of an unforeseen disaster and subsequent terrorist attack, <em>The Orbital Children</em> is easily one of the most visually fascinating and conceptually forward-thinking anime in recent memory. While the story may admittedly grow a tad unwieldy in the series’ latter half, Iso’s series as a whole proves itself to be a remarkable experience to behold all the same. Here’s hoping it doesn’t take him another 15 years to grace us with yet another stunning vision of the future. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="T1FdnY">With all the toys, shows, and games, there’s so much Pokémon in the world right now and it can be hard to know what’s good anymore. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24009728/pokemon-concierge-netflix-animation-review-new-show"><em>Pokémon Concierge</em></a><em> </em>is one of my favorite pieces of Pokémon media in the past decade or so. The show follows Haru, a young and anxious office worker who quits her job to become a concierge at a tropical Pokémon resort. Once there, it’s up to her to reconnect with her joy for life and share that with the Pokémon around her.</p>
<p id="mGfKQS">Dwarf Studio, the animation studio behind <em>Rilakkuma and Kaoru</em>, render beloved creatures like Pikachu in a gorgeous stop-motion claymation style. Every Pokémon, no matter how small, pops with the textiles and clays that really sets the show apart from all other Pokémon series. Pair that with an emotionally touching story that’s sure to speak to every 20 and 30-something overwhelmed office worker, and <em>Pokémon Concierge </em>makes for an easy-to-watch and endlessly relatable viewing. <em>—AD</em></p>

<p id="N4o5Uj">Similar to fellow Netflix original <em>Aggretsuko</em>, <em>Rilakkuma and Kaoru </em>is another anime based on cutesy mascot character designs created by a stationery company. While the latter is beautifully realized in impressive stop-motion animation, the two share a common focus in centering on disgruntled office workers yearning for a change of pace. The series follows a year in the life of Kaoru, a young human woman living with her three roommates: a large brown anthropomorphic bear named Rilakkuma, a small white bear named Korilakkuma, and a baby chick named Kiirotori. Heartwarming, whimsical, and powerfully cathartic, <em>Rilakkuma and Kaoru</em> is a wonderful anime with adorable characters and a stunning art style. With a follow-up series titled <em>Rilakkuma’s Theme Park Adventure </em>slated for release later this year, now is the perfect time to catch up on the series. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="JgDMaH">You know the story of Scott Pilgrim — dating a teenager! Falls in love with another girl! Fights her exes! <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952977/scott-pilgrim-vs-world-movie-comic-changes">Kinda a schmuck</a>! — but <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> <em>Takes Off</em> is a beast of a different nature. This is a story that has been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23943353/netflix-scott-pilgrim-takes-off-anime-same-different-movie-comics">digested and reworked for 20 years</a>, and the anime <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23965502/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-review-anime-netflix-tv-show">comes out with a more mature, open-ended consideration</a> of pretty much every aspect of it. Plus: It’s an anime! So <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> is no longer held back by either the page or the production of its comic and film medium. Now, Scott Pilgrim finally has the space to do what we always wanted for him — and <em>Scott Pilgrim </em>reaps the rewards. <em>—ZM</em></p>

<p id="GYcnSY">Set in a futuristic city where superpowered heroes compete on live television to capture criminals and promote sponsors, <em>Tiger &amp; Bunny</em> follows veteran hero Kotetsu T. Kaburagi (aka Wild Tiger), who is forced to team up with a new partner, Barnaby Brooks Jr. Despite sharing the same abilities, the two clash over their conflicting goals and ideas of what it means to be a hero. However, when a dangerous new adversary threatens to plunge the city into turmoil, the pair will have to put aside their differences and work together if they’re to have any chance of saving the day.</p>
<p id="hBmVSE">The brainchild of producer Masayuki Ozaki (<em>Tales of the Abyss</em>) and director Keiichi Sato (<em>The Big O</em>), <em>Tiger &amp; Bunny</em> failed to muster a strong reception when it first aired in 2011, but a cult following of fans amassed via enough word-of-mouth praise over the next decade that Netflix commissioned a second season of the series, albeit now directed by Mitsuko Kase (<em>Ristorante Paradiso</em>) and produced by Bandai Namco Pictures. </p>
<p id="8b38Ro">If you’re looking for a fun superhero anime in the vein of <em>My Hero Academia</em> or <em>Samurai Flamenco</em> but with a heavier satirical bent, look no further than <em>Tiger &amp; Bunny</em>. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="aLiylK">Set in England around A.D. 1013, the historical action adventure anime <em>Vinland Saga</em> follows Thorfinn, the son of a former Viking commander, who embarks on a journey for vengeance against the band of mercenaries hired to kill his father. Inspired by the life of Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic explorer who followed Leif Eriksson on his short-lived journey to establish a colony in North America, <em>Vinland Saga</em> is one of the most unconventional and rewarding anime series in years. It is a visceral tale of a young man’s attempt to resolve his grief through violence, only to subsequently embrace the ideology of nonviolence his father tried to impart on him earlier in life. </p>
<p id="TtG2B6">The first season is an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23032698/vinland-saga-anime-the-northman-viking-revenge-story">exciting and action-oriented story</a> focusing on Thorfinn’s strained relationship with his nemesis (and begrudging father figure) Askeladd, parallel to the ascendency of King Canute the Great. The second season is an altogether more deliberate and somber story that finds Thorfinn attempting to seek a new purpose in life beyond vengeance. <em>Vinland Saga</em> is a tremendous anime with a life-affirming story of finding peace in spite of hardship, and an absolute must-watch for anime enthusiasts. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="UDKG8W">The highly acclaimed Kyoto Animation brings the Netflix exclusive <em>Violet Evergarden </em>to life with the beautiful scenes you’d expect from the studio. The main character, who shares her name with the series, is a young girl previously used as a killing machine by the military during a war. After losing both of her arms and having them replaced with metal prosthetics, she has to learn how to integrate back into society as an Auto-Memory Doll, which is essentially a trained ghostwriter for books and letters. It’s sweet and satisfying to watch Violet grow and learn about the complexity of human emotions, a journey complemented by gorgeous animation. The 13-episode series is available in its entirety in English and Japanese with English subtitles in addition to dubbed voices and subtitles in several other languages. <em>—Julia Lee</em></p>

<p id="khBrZj">Before Yoshihiro Togashi created <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> — one of the most <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22619955/hunter-x-hunter-chimera-ant-fans-netflix">highly acclaimed</a>, bestselling manga series of all time — he created yet <em>another</em> highly acclaimed, bestselling manga in the form of<em> Yu Yu Hakusho</em>.</p>
<p id="u76ABD">Adapted into a long-running anime by studio Pierrot in 1992, the series follows the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old delinquent who dies from being hit by a car in his attempt to save a child’s life. Surprised by his dying act of altruism, the Spirit World sends Botan, the ferrywoman of the afterlife, to recruit Yusuke as a Spirit Detective. After being resurrected on Earth, Yusuke is tasked with investigating several cases involving malevolent supernatural activity in the human world, gaining new allies along the way as he fights to save the mortal realm from disaster.</p>
<p id="47wEfN">A predecessor to anime like <em>Bleach</em> and <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>, <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> was one of several shows that introduced a generation of anime fans to the medium when it first aired in the United States on Adult Swim during the early 2000s. The Dark Tournament arc is easily one of the best of any anime of its era, and the show’s supporting cast of characters are all unique and inspiring personalities with their own iconic and exhilarating powers. Don’t let the show’s age put you off — <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> is a superb supernatural martial arts anime that’s worth seeing through all the way to the end. <em>—TE</em></p>

In this article, I’d like to tell you a bit about our collaborative, community-driven approach to the development of our flagship franchise, Dying Light. I want to convey why this attitude is so important for us and why we think it’s the right way to go when it comes to our games. I’ll also spotlight the Community Ideas initiative, which is a perfect encapsulation of this strategy.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first Dying Light game was released back in 2015 as our second venture into the realm of open-world zombie IPs. We were very proud of its uniqueness—the core elements, such as the first-person perspective parkour, focus on melee weapons, and the day/night cycle that heavily influenced the gameplay, made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> really stand apart. The appreciation we got from the players back then and the community that started to form around the game gave us—the developers—a lot of confidence and let us spread our wings. Since then, we adopted the strategy of giving back to our players, we’re listening to their suggestions and feedback. We ended up supporting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for almost seven years after its release, building a massive community—the game currently has an overwhelmingly positive rating on Steam with 300,000 reviews, more appearing each day.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/what-a-community-led-shift-to-independent-fan-wikis-means-for-game-developers" target="_self">What a community-led shift to independent fan wikis means for game developers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we released the sequel in 2022, we knew from the very beginning that we wanted to support </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a good couple of years. We wanted the fans to have a say in how the world is shaped, to have their opinions taken into consideration when it comes to decisions regarding the direction of the brand itself and design decisions, both big and small.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We focused on the three main areas of cooperation with the community:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Social Media communication</span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s start with the basics. Like every studio, we try to monitor the opinions of our players that they share online. Our Community Management Team reads and analyzes the feedback and investigates the player sentiment as well as the reception of updates and features that we regularly add to the game. Additionally, said team, together with our QA department, turns the players’ requests into tangible project tasks, recording them in Jira once a week, which are then properly groomed by producers and have their priorities assigned. This helps us work on the requests from our community on an ongoing basis.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/beyond-the-battle-why-do-we-need-to-create-a-safe-game-environment" target="_self">Beyond the battle: Why do we need to create a safe game environment</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community Council is a group of several dozen of the most dedicated, trusted players, community members and influencers with whom we meet once per quarter to talk about our plans for the evolution of the game and get their feedback. Those are the same people we invite to participate in the closed beta tests of the new in-game initiatives. Some of the features that benefited from this treatment—such as the addition of a physical parkour setting or the newly released Nightmare Difficulty—were broadly appreciated by the community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today, however, I’d like to focus on what is, in our opinion, the most interesting endeavor we’ve attempted yet: the Community Ideas program. It’s a special means of getting feedback, where our players can submit requested features and elements they’d like to see added to our game. The ideas that are feasible to implement, based on the existing gameplay mechanics, can be found on the dedicated page of our community hub,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/goodies/community-ideas?state=1&amp;category=&amp;order=&amp;page=1&amp;limit=20&amp;query="> Pilgrim Outpost</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Then, the players vote for their favorites to be included in the game. But don’t let this cursory outline fool you! The entire matter is quite complex, with a pretty extensive process that involves us checking each submitted idea.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/every-game-has-the-community-it-deserves" target="_self">Every Game Has the Community It Deserves</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The voting happens in stages and it’s important to note here that this timing is aligned with our release cycle, as we aim to update the game once every few months. Thanks to this scheduling, the ideas can be implemented fairly soon.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, several of the most popular ideas end up with the development team, where they’re further assessed. While evaluating them, we pay attention to their originality, feasibility, added value, whether a given feature would clash with other gameplay elements from a technical perspective, and so on. The ideas are divided into three categories:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The accepted ones land in our task lists, where we calculate what is needed to implement them and what’s the rough timeline for that. The rejected ideas are deemed unsuitable or ultimately too costly. It’s also worth mentioning that we not only notify the authors of the rejected ideas that we’re not moving forward with them, but we also try to give them the reason for the refusal whenever we can. It’s additional work, of course, but we don’t want to discourage our players by the lack of feedback from us. The third option is Backlog—it’s for the ideas that we like and want to take a closer look at, but their implementation is not immediately possible. It might come down to the insufficient amount of time and resources at a particular moment, or the fact that they would involve altering the game in a significant way—but we still like them and want them to happen at a later date. They’re benched for now.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We launched the second round of Community Ideas in mid-April, which means that the players can again submit their ideas and vote for the best ones. We received over 1500 new entries in a couple of days, so the interest has not waned. We also keep getting feedback concerning the process itself. At the community’s request, we implemented features such as a keyword search bar, extended categories filter, multiple language support, and entry translation powered by Google API. And we will keep upgrading the tool.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We consider this collaborative, community-driven approach to supporting our games to be a good strategy—as every developer cares about favorable reception as well as high community engagement. I think I can confidently claim that our method works. Since the introduction of the Community Ideas program, the player sentiment, expressed as positive comments and reviews, has risen. And </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—despite the fact that it’s an open-world AAA game—can still boast a sizable player base two years after it premiered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Undoubtedly, this type of approach comes with a multitude of challenges. The most substantial one is finding balance between applying the suggestions from the community and maintaining your own authorial vision of the game. The other obstacle is finding time and appropriate resources to be able to focus on implementing the community's ideas, yes, but first and foremost, on realizing our development plans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technical side alone—Pilgrim Outpost website maintenance, accumulating and cleaning up of the ideas themselves, not to mention managing the duplicates—is incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive. Regardless of whether you decide to launch a dedicated program, like our Community Ideas, or to follow a general strategy of community-driven development, you need to:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prepare a production pipeline that will be able to take on the incoming community requests;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make sure that you have appropriate resources at your disposal: people, time, money—all according to the model you’re working with;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interact with the players—launching such a program or a development strategy is a huge commitment on the part of the developer, so you need to be transparent in your actions and communicate the respective stages, decisions, etc.;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be consistent in your actions—nowadays, it’s extremely easy to lose the players’ trust and end up with a result that is entirely opposite to what you had in mind, so if you show your community that they are important, stick to it;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brace yourself for tough feedback.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This all may seem a bit daunting—and that’s a reasonable reaction. The entire process is a lot, but with good planning, cleverly allocated resources, and some flexibility, it’s entirely feasible. And the benefits are really worth it. On the one hand, you get a structured and regulated source of player feedback, and on the other, you give the community the means to influence the game’s development. Both sides benefit, and the game itself ends up getting better and better!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/modders-are-developers-it-s-time-to-pay-them<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via Pexels user Ron Lach.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Almost a decade ago, I wrote an op-ed titled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/modders-are-developers-its-time-to-stop-treating-them-differently">Modders are developers - it's time to stop treating them differently</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which called for a shift in mindset towards a more open and inclusive approach to development. The overriding vision was that users can have a bigger stake in the content creation process within gaming, and creativity can flow from the bottom up. In the last ten years, we’ve seen a tremendous shift play out in precisely that fashion, where major game studios and publishers are actively welcoming and collaborating with creators to improve the longevity and quality of their products. From the advent of Fortnite UEFN to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rockstarintel.com/follow-rockstars-acquisition-fivem-release-statement-on-its-future/#:~:text=Rockstar%20Games%20purchased%20the%20group,now%20they're%20purchasing%20them.">Rockstar acquiring FiveM</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, publishers have embraced creators and recognized the untapped benefits UGC brings towards the entire gaming ecosystem. Gamers get more content, in-game creators can earn a living with their mods, and publishers can crowdsource content creation in a safe and financially viable way, particularly as content production costs increase.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The definition of an in-game creator has also evolved. There are stand out solo creators like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://porofessor.gg/">Porofessor</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/corporation-buys-a-popular-league-of-legends-app-for-dollar55-millionits-made-by-one-guy/">who sold his business for over $54M</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">); teams of mod authors like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.feed-the-beast.com/">FeedtheBeast</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, dedicated to making Minecraft Modpacks; and even former AAA developers that have turned to build games specifically on creator platforms to optimize their odds of success while reducing development time. The rise of UEFN, Roblox, and platforms like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.curseforge.com/">CurseForge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have made it easier than ever for indie developers to create games and playable prototypes, reach giant audiences, and provide a pathway to diversify revenue streams and bring their original content to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The future of gaming is in the hands of in-game creators&nbsp; —&nbsp; this core belief has driven my professional career. These passionate modders, app developers, and game server owners provide an untethered lifecycle for major game studios; keeping gamers consistently coming back for more experiences. As an example, the modding community has enthusiastically embraced titles like Palworld and indie hit game Lethal Company. Since its early access release in mid-October 2023, Lethal Company has sold over 10 million copies. Its top five mods on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://thunderstore.io/">Thunderstore</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (a mod manager built on the Overwolf platform) have collectively amassed over 31M downloads. These mods range from simple tools enhancing audio settings and multiplayer lobbies to transformative additions that revolutionize the gameplay experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We believe that these in-game creators, whether individuals or studios, deserve to be compensated for their time, which is why CurseForge has introduced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DLC-level Premium Mods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Premium mods have the potential to be a significant revenue source for IP owners and in-game creators alike, attracting even talented studios to bring their IP and stories into titles like ARK: Survival Ascended and create engaging content for players to enjoy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understandably, the gaming community has concerns about this shift. Attempts and missteps have been made before, including Valve and Bethesda's attempt to introduce paid mods for Skyrim in 2015. The modding community, built on principles of collaboration and open sharing, strongly opposed this commercial shift. Gamers expressed concerns about the quality of paid mods, mods attribution rights, and perceived potential exploitation of mod authors by developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, the industry’s shift towards UGC has essential differences today. Platforms that emphasize player-made content, like CurseForge and Fortnite Creative/UEFN, are offering tools for these in-game creators and allowing them to safely publish their mods. Further, they offer an attractive business model for both IP owners and in-game creators. Quality assurance of paid mods is something that needs to be taken seriously, and handled by CurseForge as a service.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">CurseForge has recently announced cross-platform premium mods for Studio Wildcard’s ARK: Survival Ascended. We’ve gone as far as to partner with several game studios, including Blue Isle, Sky Map, and Look North World, to guarantee quality content. CurseForge’s premium mod system gives in-game creators a 50% revenue split with Studio Wildcard. Mods can cost anywhere from $2 to $15 and the split gives the studio and CurseForge the ability to support the creators, moderate the platform, and provide the best experience to the player. The price will be set by the creators, but approved by CurseForge to make sure the price is good for the value players are getting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While gaming UGC started four decades ago, it is the present and the future of gaming. It is becoming one of the industry’s largest growth engines, with the world’s most popular games turning to creators to provide gamers with endless quality content that is increasing the shelf lives of games. It is difficult to understate the significance of premium mods within this wider landscape as it signals a titanic shift for studios and creators alike. From the publisher perspective, it provides a catalyst to further break down the stigma of relinquishing creative control to passionate creators in exchange for longevity, retention and a new revenue stream. From the creator’s side, the allure and realistic possibility of earning a stable income welcomes in an entirely new and expansive generation of developer-creators who will feel confident in committing their entire working lives to this newly emerging career path. Together, the entire gaming industry will see an exponential shift in the years to come; from an entirely new and untapped revenue stream to the quality of the gaming experience enjoyed by everyone.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a "beloved" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1793639436766605429">announced on social media</a>, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxIHyfwUrTg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, "The truth lies," while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.</p>

<p>The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/09/xbox-reportedly-debating-putting-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-alongside-price-hike">Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I love <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paradise-killer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detective games</a> because for a brief fleeting moment, they make me feel intelligent. It doesn’t matter how long it takes me or how many things I rub on other things to try and make progress. I eventually solve the case and outsmart a game designed for me to outsmart.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"><em>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami</em> promised this in a healthy, low-calorie bite. Of its bullet points, it proudly states that it’s 2-3 hours long. I can handle that. I’m often conscious for at least 2-3 hours a day. That, like, half a <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/359510/Tangle_Tower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tangle Tower</a></em>!</p> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false"><strong><strong><strong>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2637990/Duck_Detective_The_Secret_Salami/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> [Reviewed], <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/duck-detective-the-secret-salami-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a>, Xbox One)<br>Developer: Happy Broccoli Games<br>Publisher: Happy Broccoli Games<br>Released: May 23, 2024 (PC, Switch) TBA (Xbox)<br>MSRP: $9.99</strong></strong></strong></p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">The story opens with our recently divorced hero waking up from a night of bread-addiction relapse. There’s maybe some former glory there. He might have written a book. A lot of this is mentioned kind of off-hand. Which you’d maybe expect from a game that’s trying to be as brief as possible.</p>
 <p data-characters="43" data-current-count="43" data-injectable="false">Weirdly, though, it still has a slow start.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">As the Duck Detective, you need to gather the clues. All of them. You waddle around the office of Bearbus, using every action on every well-marked interactive object. Once you have enough clues, you can then crack open the “Deducktions” menu and start putting together the pieces. It’s kind of like Mad Libs, but you’re slotting evidence into all the blanks.</p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">This process is so mechanical that it’s extremely jarring when <em>The Secret Salami</em> asks you to actually make a real deduction or eke out meaning from a small change in the environment. I’ve played much more complex investigation games, but I had to stop myself a couple of times and remind myself that it’s not <em>just</em> picking up words and putting them in a scrapbook.</p> <figure data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Duck Detective: The Secret Salami – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLhqdpOi7VE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">It’s really tempting to play it that way, however. Your progress is based entirely on these deductions. It tells you how many clues you have in a particular subject, and once it’s full, it feels like you must know everything. But then you switch over and realize it’s asking you to deduce something that hasn’t really been directly pointed out as important. It gives you subjects that you might not have even registered as important. Sometimes it’s things that <em>aren’t</em> important. Ever.</p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">So, sometimes, you’re faced with something that seems poorly defined or completely irrelevant. There’s no penalty to start slotting in the wrong words into the deducktions, so you can just keep trying different combinations until the game lets you proceed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">You don’t <em>need</em> to do this, as you can always ask for a hint, which takes the form of the Duck Detective musing to himself. <em>Duck Detective</em> at least lives up to its philosophy. It really wants you to make it all the way to the end. There’s even an easier mode if you want to get more specific hints. It’s just unfortunate that all these safety nets were set up, rather than creating consistently intuitive puzzles.</p>
 <p data-characters="846" data-current-count="846" data-injectable="true">A good example is an early deducktion where it asks you what is going on in the kitchen. It isn’t that there are no hints, it’s just that there’s a lot of misdirection. You’re supposed to deduce that it’s a surprise birthday party, but it’s earlier established that the character is sad everyone forgot. It was a puzzle on its own. Okay, that’s fair. It’s a surprise. However, in the kitchen is a poster that says the Halloween party has been canceled, and it’s suggested that it’s because of funding, with the Duck Detective remarking that office parties are a bad idea anyway. So, why set that up in my mind and then expect me to immediately figure out that the person standing in the kitchen with a whisk in hand is making a cake for a surprise birthday party? As I said, there are clues, but it’s not set up intuitively.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">It doesn’t matter though, because the deducktion is only there for progression. It’s completely irrelevant to the case. It’s just not the only instance that this happens.</p> <figure data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">And for that matter, the story has no teeth. I’m tempted to say it isn’t very good, but I don’t think that’s accurate. The narrative itself is fine, even if it’s slow to get to any interesting wrinkles. However, the dialogue, the characters, and the worldbuilding are all extremely limp.</p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">The office of Bearbus is at least well-realized. Having worked several years in an office environment, the relationships and frustrations between all the characters feel extremely familiar.</p>
 <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">In terms of the character, it’s again not that there’s a complete lack of development. Tidbits of backstory are given and does some service in making the characters feel believable. However, very little of it gets tied into the case in a satisfying way. Motivation is poorly defined to the point where it’s hard to care about anyone. At the end of it all, it feels really inconsequential. With the thieved lunch being the focal point, that’s maybe the intention, but it doesn’t really lead to anything memorable.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The dialogue is sometimes amusing but rarely funny. What got the biggest chuckle out of me was the duck “facts” that get flashed on the loading screens. The dialogue is never ever that clever. Possibly because the characters aren’t set up to be that interesting or insightful.</p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">In terms of worldbuilding, there’s an attempt at creating a sense of place. However, not enough effort goes into it to make it really believable outside the walls of the office.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">The art holds up a lot better. While the overall paper-craft look is mostly serviceable, the still-frame art is excellent. This is best shown off during moments where you take a closer look at a character or object in the environment. As you pass your cursor over the image, the magnifying glass depicts the same object in higher detail. You notice fine lines, subtle facial expressions, and fabric stains. It’s well done.</p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">But aside from that, <em>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami</em> delivers on its philosophy too well. It’s an easygoing detective game, sure, but its design feels similarly laid-back. It doesn’t feel like it reaches to excel very often. It doesn’t excite, it doesn’t provoke thought, and it doesn’t linger on the tongue. And there’s something to be said about a game like that. Not everything needs to be a revelation. Sometimes, you just need something that you can file away after you quack the case.</p>
