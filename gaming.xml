            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24270606/2004-week-tech-internet-gadgets-phones-pop-culture<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In early 2004, the world was shaking it like a Polaroid picture, flocking to theaters to see what was going to happen with all those hobbits, and wondering if that Tom Brady guy was something special. Meanwhile, a few folks around the world were inventing the web as we know it now: a world-shaking social network was brewing in a Harvard dorm room. A Google employee was dreaming up the future of email in their spare time. The coolest cellphone of all time was just about to drop. The internet was still a niche activity, but that was about to change — and fast.</p><p>In so many ways, the digital world in which we now all live was created 20 years ago. Google went public and began to ascend to rule the web. Facebook, Gmail, Firefox, Flickr, and Digg all launched — the year Web 2.0 became the web. “Blog” and “the long tail” were on no one’s radar before 2004, and since then, they’ve been everywhere. The United States went through a contentious election, a bunch of sequels dominated the box office, and Apple launched a new product that looked very cool but was ultimately eclipsed by a better product a year later. Okay, some things never change.</p><p>Every year is a big year in tech, of course, but 2004 was an especially big one. And <em>The Verge </em>didn’t exist yet! So, this week, we’ll have stories on the best and most important gadgets and platforms that launched that year and pieces about the cultural events that still affect the way we live now. Basically, we’re going to blog like it’s 2004.</p><div><p>Our first few stories are up today, covering everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24234678/robot-car-darpa-grand-challenge-2004-autonomous-race">the first robo-car race</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24201021/motorola-razr-v3-design-paris-hilton-2004">the Motorola Razr</a> to the mystery of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24220118/lost-photos-facebook-flickr-digital-cameras">all our missing 2004 photos</a>. There’s also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24238422/podcast-etymology-term-history-tech-vergecast">a special episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a><em> </em>all about the history and future of podcasts, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24209615/digg-internet-web-2-homepage-2004-kevin-rose-interview">an interview with Kevin Rose</a> about Digg’s legacy, and a shockingly hard quiz asking one simple question: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24236611/2004-2024-quiz-trivia-tech-gadgets-pop-culture">did it happen in 2004 or 2024</a>?</p></div><p>We’ll be publishing more 2004 stories and videos all week, and we want to hear all your 2004 memories, too! Share your favorite pictures from that year, your favorite 20-year-old gadgets that you wish still worked (or shockingly still do), and anything else you remember from that seminal year in our recent past. We’ll be doing the same. It’s going to be more fun than <em>Shrek 2</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. has <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001448.000051316.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> today that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero “has surpassed 3 million copies sold worldwide within 24 hours of its release.” Sparking Zero is a 3D action fighting game set in the popular Dragon Ball universe, and it arrives as the first new instalment for the Budokai Tenkaichi series after almost two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has been released with a lot of content for players to explore, which has helped the game cross the 3 million mark. It has an Episode Battles game mode that allows players to relive iconic moments from the anime series and explore some never-before-seen scenarios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game’s multiplayer mode has also spiked in popularity, as players love the gameplay mechanics, even though the mode isn’t very balanced. There’s also a custom battles mode, where players can create unique scenarios and battle situations to share with the community worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero also made waves on Steam during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-tops-all-dragon-ball-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access</a>. The title managed to cross an all-time peak of 90,000 during that time, which is higher than any other Dragon Ball game or fighting game on Steam. At the time of writing, the game hit an all-time peak of 122,554 players four days ago and a peak of 80,000 in the past 24 hours, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bandai Namco has started cutting its headcount and paused or cancelled some of its games due to lackluster demand.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles?leadSource=reddit_wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, which has revealed that Bandai Namco has seen employees shuffled about since April 2024. According to Bloomberg, it’s a result of the company canceling and pausing some of its projects due to “lackluster demand”.</p>



<p>Bloomberg reports that Bandai Namco has moved some of its employees to “rooms where they are given nothing to do” in an apparent attempt to voluntarily leave the company. According to its sources, the move has already seen nearly 100 people resign since April, with another 100 expected to resign in the coming months.</p>



<p><span>Japanese companies commonly use “Expulsion rooms,” known as “<em>oi dashi beya</em>” in</span> Japanese, to get staff to leave voluntarily due to the country’s strict labor-protection laws. In a statement to Bloomberg, the company said, “Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation. Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge.”</p>



<p>It continued, “There is no organization like an ‘oidashi beya’ at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily.”</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg’s sources, Bandai Namco canceled the smartphone game&nbsp;Tales of the Rays&nbsp;and said it would take down big-budget online game&nbsp;Blue Protocol&nbsp;in&nbsp;January. In addition, it’s also decided to “either cancel pause development of several games, including ones that feature characters from animes&nbsp;<em>Naruto&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>One Piece</em>, as well as a project commissioned by&nbsp;Nintendo Co,” said Bloomberg.</p>



<p>What do you think of Bandai Namco’s practices in trying to get employee;s to leave? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/full-fathom">Full Fathom</a> describes it as a "thalassophobia sim". You are the lone engineer on a rustbucket submarine exploring the dangerous waters of a submerged country in an alternate reality 1990s. The warning lights on the control panel are flashing, a buzzer is spluttering like a dying bluebottle, and your robotic assistant is about as useful as an umbrella in the Mariana Trench. Things could not get any worse. And then you see it. Something in the green haze outside. Something with a <em>tail</em>.</p>

<p>We've seen Full Fathom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pilot-a-deteriorating-submarine-through-abyssal-waters-in-full-fathom">breach the surface</a> a few times in various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/screenshot-saturday">Screenshot Saturdays</a> but now there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2302470/Full_Fathom/">playable demo</a> as part of Steam Next Fest. In the most pitchy of elevators it is "horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>". You can leave your submarine to swim through the ruins of flooded skyscrapers and houses, salvaging for fuel tanks and canned food among other necessities. But you also need to pilot the submersible (albeit in quite an auto-piloty way) between numbered points of interest in the ocean. </p>
<p>So yes, it is a bit like the wet wandering of Unknown Worlds' survival game. Yet there is something greebly and clunky about the machinery of Full Fathom. This is not the smooth and sleek Frutiger Aero interface of Alterra Corporation, but a grimy, barely functional platter of non-descript buttons and unlabelled levers. Switches and handles and valves and cranks, all of which must be figured out mostly by, well, pressing them. Like this!</p>
<p>Oh dear. All the lights just went out.</p>
<p>The game's demo went up in July, so I'm a little late to the underwater party. But I won't let that stop me. "Use your throttle," advises a handy leaflet in the control room. "Holes are bad." In the end, I barely get the submarine moving and almost perish in a nearby ruin. Outside the ship, spikey urchins will puncture your suit and sap your strength. I get lost in a dark house when my flare goes out. Luckily I am scroungy enough to have picked up a can of compressed air for emergencies. </p><p>I can't fully blame myself for the incompetence. This is your warning that the demo is quite hands-off when it comes to tutorials. There is some guidance in the form of pop-up hints but mostly you are left to figure out the details of all these buttons and cranks yourself. Your robotic anchormate will give intentionally useless advice and feels there to deliberately unnerve and enrage you with his Clippy-like face and passive-aggressive remarks. I enjoy hating him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is a frame story that sits outside all of this, full of fun meta touches. The pause menu here is a set of controls mounted on the wall. A neon hotel sign reads "Alpha Demo". An authentic looking exit label on the door reads: "This door will exit the game". When you take a screenshot with Steam's built-in screenshot key, F12, a camera flash goes off in-game. When leaving the pause menu for a long enough time, it will become a Windows style screensaver circa 1998. I think that's cool. </p>
<p>It's tough to stand out among the 1700+ other demos in Steam Next Fest, but if you are channelling the deep dread of Subnautica, the chunky UI of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nauticrawl">Nauticrawl</a>, the panic of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/barotrauma">Barotrauma</a>, and the rust of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/iron-lung">Iron Lung</a>, you will immediately have my eyes. It is deeply reassuring to me that, even after all these decades, game designers still know how to make pushing an unmarked button equal parts hilarious and terrifying.</p>
<p>For anyone who needs more recommendations of games of this type, but likes sci-fi more than sub-fi: try the delightful tactility of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/objects-in-space">Objects In Space</a> or, more recently, the confused claustrophobia of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tin-can">Tin Can</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-waves-chequered-flag-on-rocket-racing-mode-themed-updates<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Epic Games will no longer release themed updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-rocket-racing-is-a-fun-mix-of-rocket-league-and-mario-kart">Rocket Racing, the vehicular Fortnite mode launched last December</a> that's developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a> studio Psyonix. 
</p>
<p>
The decision, tucked away in <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/learn-whats-new-in-rocket-racing-v31-40">patch notes</a> released over the weekend, signals a downgrading of support for the mode, which has struggled to maintain player numbers in comparison to other Epic Games-made offerings. 
</p>
<p>
This is not the end of Rocket Racing, and the mode will continue to be refreshed with additional quests and cosmetic rewards. But the expectation among fans is that any release of new tracks from Epic Games will now be sporadic at best.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-big-bang-event-was-a-blast-of-marketing-for-the-games-multi-genre-future">Fortnite's enormous Big Bang live event</a> last year heralded a new dawn for the battle royale, with the arrival of three additional new modes: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, Harmonix's musical <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Festival and Psyonix's Rocket Racing. 
</p>
<p>
Lego Fortnite continues to perform very well, with concurrent player numbers visible in-game regularly hovering around the 50,000 mark. Fortnite Festival, across its various mode options, regularly sits above the 10,000 mark meanwhile. Rocket Racing has consistently sat lower in terms of player numbers than both of these.
</p><p>
"v31.40 brings the theme back to the starting line as we say goodbye to Inferno Island and themed updates," Epic Games wrote in its patch notes. "Future updates will be taking new roads with refreshed Ranked periods, renewed Quests, and additional Car items you can take to the track! 
</p>
<p>
"New tracks from creators are releasing every day so racers always have a different place to drift, flip, and fly. There's no end to the starting lines you can discover! Or, if you’re curious about UEFN, to the ones you can create."
</p>
<p>It's a shame to see support downgraded - even as Epic Games reprioritises, and another new Fortnite mode is believed to sit in the wings.</p>
<p>Still, Epic has a history of continuing Fortnite modes over the long-term - as seen in the continued tweaks to Fortnite's original Save the World offering that still take place to this day.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A game based on the Terrifier film series is set to be released next year.</p>
<p>Terrifier: The ARTcade Game will be a beat 'em up inspired by classics like Streets of Rage and Double Dragon, in which players take the role of the films' iconic Art the Clown.</p>
<p>The ultra-gory Terrifier 3 is currently out in cinemas terrorising audiences - it's the highest-grossing film in the series so far, beating rival clown Joker: Folie à Deux at the box office.</p>

<p>The Terrifier game, though, takes on a more cartoonish appearance for its blood-soaked antics.</p>
<p>It's being developed by Relevo and published by Selecta Play, both known for their colourful, retro-inspired games.</p>
<p>The game will see Art the Clown destroying movie sets in over the top, pixel art action. It will also feature local co-op for up to four players, as well as six different game modes to vary gameplay.</p>
<p>It's set for release in 2025 across Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>For a horror experience right now, check out the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, described as a "bloody triumph" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">our Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>.</p>
<p>Or, for something more retro, the PS1-inspired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps1-inspired-theme-park-horror-crow-country-hits-switch-this-month">Crow Country is out this week on PS4 and Switch</a>, in addition to its PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S release in May.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Remember when Nintendo posted a photo of someone in a Mario costume peering creepily around a curtain?
</p>
<p>
The now-iconic image, posted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> on Twitter back in October 2016 to hype the upcoming reveal of Nintendo Switch, was instantly turned into a meme and reposted everywhere - including, multiple times, the pages of this very website. 
</p>
<p>
But what was the story behind that photo? Where did it come from, and why was it so odd? Well, former Nintendo staff Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang have now discussed the incident on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeYuGHAYke8">podcast</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/random-kit-and-krysta-pull-back-the-curtain-on-nintendos-controversial-switch-teaser-photo">Nintendo Life</a>) - and the whole thing sounds as last-minute as it looked.
</p>

<p>
"This was very controversial," Yang explained. "The person that had this idea was the former head of social. This person commissioned a photoshoot for the Mario costume character in the office to go... they basically staged the Mario costume character going behind the curtain and doing the thing. 
</p><p>
"It caused some concern actually because, of course, Nintendo doesn't want to <em>not</em> manage people's expectations and this was too much in the zone of speculation - what could it be? [Is] it too much of a tease for something as big as a console reveal? So it didn't go over too well. Then, of course, it got memed into oblivion and people were kind of upset about it, honestly."
</p> <div>

<p>
Ellis suggested the photo was only necessary as there had been no other images provided by Nintendo for that particular marketing beat - something that had left their team's social media boss scrambling.
</p>
<p>
"Here's the thing with these <em>big</em> beats and moments like this," Ellis said. "You always need more assets than you think you do. And in this case, there was clearly no asset to pair with this news and nobody wants to put out a tweet that has no image with it. So it's like, well what can we do? 
</p>
<p>
"There's always some spreadsheet that's like: here's every single asset we need, every single sizing, every single use. And I think in that case they must have missed out, because why else otherwise would they be taking a last-second picture of Mario in the shower, you know?
</p>
<p>
"Peeping Tom Mario in the shower," Yang chipped in.
</p>
<p>
"They'll be on top of it this time," Ellis concluded. "It won't happen again."
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed for Birdo behind a shower curtain for the reveal of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>?

            <p>If I could extend my arm forty times its normal length, while also granting it the flexibility of a sock filled with mince, I’d probably just use it to take the bins out without leaving my chair. But what if someone were to use this power... for <em>evil?</em> That’s the gist of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-arms-are-longer-now">My Arms Are Longer Now</a>, a cartoony "stealth-comedy" game about worming a single stretchy limb into people’s valuables, which has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> demo out now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The stealth aspect is, in fact, very light. Most NPCs seem unbothered by the meat monstrosity snaking around their feet, wrapping around their shoulders, or repeatedly slapping their heads just for the funny sound effect. Even dragging off a beloved pet in full view of the owner will elicit only the meekest of verbal protests, possibly because they’ve taken one look at this thing and concluded it cannot be defeated by mortal means.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s more a combination of soft puzzler – some target items require you find certain passes or keys first – and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octodad-dadliest-catch">Octodad</a>-style physics wrangler. Lifting your hand up off the floor requires you to build some momentum. Combined with the isometric viewpoint and the slightly surreal mix of a 3D arm on a 2D background, this makes precision pickpocketing trickier than it looks. There’s no failure state, mind, so any clumsy hand-wibbling and/or ropes of excess arm left lying around can only add to the laughs. Speaking of which, My Arms Are Longer Now does well to ground its weirdness in a kind of mumbly, matter-of-fact British wit, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands">Deathbulge</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thank-goodness-youre-here">Thank Goodness You’re Here!</a> do, though I’m not sure why your haul is measured in dollars when everyone looks and sounds like they’re from Slough.</p><p>That aside, this demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2646170/My_Arms_Are_Longer_Now/">which you can grab on Steam</a> – is a cheery way to spend 15 minutes, and I’ll be keeping a much closer eye on the full game's progress than my victims did on their stuff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-lawsuit-activision-blizzard-players-settled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft has settled an antitrust lawsuit with players over its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>



<p>The final verdict was given on Monday, October 14th, 2024. Both sides notified the court to discuss the lawsuit “with prejudice,” meaning that it couldn’t be refiled (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/microsoft-settles-gamers-antitrust-lawsuit-seeking-divestiture-activision-blizzard-1236031977/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood Reporter</a>). Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed to the public; however, each party will bear its own costs and fees regarding the lawsuit.</p>



<p>Players from multiple US states filed the lawsuit following Microsoft’s proposal to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68 billion. Players argued that this would potentially see Microsoft hike prices and make Call of Duty exclusive to its platform.</p>



<p>“As time passes, Microsoft continues to increase its market power, prices have increased, games continue to be canceled, development capacities continue to diminish, and Game Pass continues to trend towards a monopoly,” wrote Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the players who filed the lawsuit. </p>



<p>After two years of battling, though, those players were seemingly unable to uphold their complaint despite exploring all avenues, including trying to get the lawsuit seen by the US Supreme Court.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard was finalized on October 13, 2023.</p>



<p>In May 2024, Microsoft announced that Call of Duty’s latest premium title, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-game-pass-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be available on Xbox Game Pass on Day 1</a>. The move marks the first time that a Call of Duty game has made its way to the Xbox subscription service on Day 1.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sells-an-incredible-3-million-copies-in-just-24-hours<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Gohan ya good thing.</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> has got off to an incredible start with three million sales in 24 hours.</p><p>The first sequel in more than 15 years in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series launched on October 11 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-already-has-double-the-peak-player-count-of-fighterz-on-steam-and-its-not-even-fully-out-yet">quickly shot up to the most-played games list on Valve’s platform</a>. Neither Sony nor Microsoft makes their console numbers public.</p><p>Sparking! Zero soon sped past the Steam peak player counts of every other Dragon Ball game released on the platform — and it's not even close. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> currently reports a peak player count of 122,554, which was achieved at launch. The next-highest peak player count for a Dragon Ball game was set by Arc System Work’s fighting game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, which topped out at 44,303. At the time of this article’s publication, Sparking! Zero still had a sizeable number of players (28,064, with a 24-hour peak of 83,313).</p><p>To put Sparking! Zero’s success into added context, at least on Steam, Capcom's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> has a peak player count of 70,573, while NetherRealm's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> peaked with 38,129 players.</p><p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero, developed by Spike Chunsoft and published by Bandai Namco, is an arena brawler with visuals true to the phenomenally popular anime upon which the game is based.</p><p>IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a final flash from the past, sometimes to a fault, but the feeling of traveling back to a simpler time when games didn’t have to be balanced or competitive to be fun is still a good one.”</p><p>If you're wondering <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/How_to_Transform_Into_a_Super_Saiyan">How to Transform Into a Super Saiyan</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/How_to_Fuse">How to Fuze in Sparking!

It makes changes to the remaining weapons and stratagems the developer wasn’t able to finish for the game-changing patch released on September 17, with the hope that they’re now “more interesting and effective.”</p><p>Elsewhere, Arrowhead said it’s “fine-tuned the Automaton experience to hopefully make them feel less frustrating to play against.” It’s also adjusted the Helldivers durability “to make your armor choices feel more impactful.”</p><p>Some items now have new functionality to give players “more depth in mastering their equipment.” Arrowhead singled out the GR-8 Recoilless Rifle and the AC-8 Autocannon, which now have programmable ammunition, and drones that come with backpacks which can be toggled on or off for added control.</p><p>Separately, game director Mikael Eriksson issued <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4551541857552166131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a note to fans</a> summing up the work Arrowhead has done as part of the 60-day plan, and insisted Arrowhead remains committed to updating the game.</p><p>“On behalf of the team at Arrowhead, I want to thank you for your patience, your insights, and your passion for our game. We’ve genuinely enjoyed seeing your reactions to our latest updates, and we’re excited to continue developing the game while ensuring that it delivers on its core fantasy and remains a game we all love to play.</p><p>“Together, we are shaping the future of Helldivers 2, and we can’t wait to show you what’s next for the core game experience and the next chapters of the Galactic War.”</p><p>There is no mention today of the potential addition of a third alien faction to fight against, with the community expecting the Illuminate to arrive sooner rather than later. Nor is there any word on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries">Helldivers 2's PSN review bomb cape</a>, which Arrowhead is still sitting on.</p><p>Helldivers 2 received a shot in the arm last month with the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-crucial-01001100-update-completely-reworks-weapons-adds-new-galactic-war-feature-and-changes-much-more-in-bid-to-make-the-game-easier"><u>update 01.001.100</u></a>, a patch that completely reworked weapon balance, added a new Galactic War feature, and made loads more changes aimed at making the game easier and more fun (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-helldivers-2s-game-changing-update-made-everything-easier-some-hardcore-fans-want-a-new-harder-difficulty-and-the-devs-agree">some Helldivers 2 players and even some of the developers wondered whether it was too easy</a>).</p><p>The update came after a troubling period for the game and for developer Arrowhead that saw its disgruntled playerbase complain that nerfs had gone too far and as a result had stripped the fun out of Helldivers 2.</p><p>The patch seems to have done the trick and brought fans back on-side. It even sparked a modest increase in concurrent players on Steam (Sony does not make PlayStation player numbers publicly available).</p><h2>Helldivers 2 update 01.001.104 patch notes:</h2><p>Balancing</p><p><strong>General changes</strong></p><p>Additional Supply Items are now visible on the minimap</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Exosuits</li><li>Support Stratagems</li></ul><p>Removed ricochets from Orbital Stratagem projectiles, Eagle-1 bombs and FAF-14 Spear missiles</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>They can no longer ricochet off of targets</li></ul><p>Helldiver armor tweaks, both Heavy and Light armor are now more effective</p><p>Heavy armor reduces damage taken by 25%, up from 20%</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>5% more damage reduction</li></ul><p>Light armor increases damage taken by 25%, down from 33%</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>8% less damage taken</li></ul><p>Stratagems and Weapon tag description updates, they now show more information and are also categorized</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Armor penetration 2 is classified as Light armor penetrating</li><li>Armor penetration 3 is classified as Medium armor penetrating</li><li>Armor penetration 4 is classified as Heavy armor penetrating</li><li>Armor penetration 5+ is classified as Anti tank</li></ul><p><strong>Primary Weapons</strong></p><p>Plasma projectile behavior</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>We’ve standardized the behavior of Plasma projectiles, which previously had varying characteristics in how they traveled through the air.

            <p>An unannounced Death Note game based on the popular anime and manga series has been rated in Taiwan.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/10/death-note-killer-within-rated-for-ps5-ps4-in-taiwan">Gematsu</a>, the rating is for both PS5 and PS4, with the full game name as Death Note: Killer Within. Bandai Namco is the publisher.</p>
<p>No further details have been revealed at this time, including its story or release date.</p>

<p>
<a aria-label="Erogamer Newscast: New Nintendo Hardware, don't be alarmed it's not Switch 2." data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GdNKD3U-4AY?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<figcaption>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but it's not Switch 2 - so what's the point of Alarmo?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNKD3U-4AY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, it's unknown if this is related to the forthcoming live-action TV series produced by Stranger Things creators The Duffer Brothers, which currently does not have a release date.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be the first Death Note video game either, although the previous games from Konami were all Japanese-only - most notably, Nintendo DS game Death Note: Kira Game.</p>
<p>Should Death Note: Killer Within be released globally, then, it would be a turning point for the series in video game terms. The English title suggests that's the case.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, Death Note's story follows a highschool student who discovers the titular notebook with the supernatural ability to kill anyone written on its pages and his attempts to kill anyone he deems immoral to create a crime-free society. He's thwarted by an elite detective force.</p>
<p>So, would this game be a detective story-focused game? An action game? An RPG? What do you think?</p>
<p>With its anime basis and Bandai Namco publishing, Death Note: Killer Within would follow the recently released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a>, which released recently to critical acclaim. "Sparking! Zero is everything Dragon Ball fans will have wanted, but it's also just a blast for those unbothered by its extensive fan-service," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">reads our review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is just two weeks away, and its spoiler-filled Trophy/Achievement list has now popped up online. 
</p>
<p>
Anyone waiting a decade for BioWare's Dragon Age Inquisition follow-up and wanting to go in blind should now be careful where they click online, as The Veilguard's launch nears. 
</p>
<p>
We won't be covering any story details or spoilers from the Trophy list here, though for those who do want to look, there are awards for each of the game's missions. These offer some big hints at what happens within them, and name several locations the game will visit. We also now know how many main missions the game will offer.
</p>
<p>
A specific Trophy for the game's final mission appears to be a particular spoiler.

<p>
There are other Trophies for aligning with each of the game's characters and many factions. It will be interesting to see if you can unlock them all in one playthrough!
</p>
<p>
And unusually, for a BioWare game, there does not seem to be any award for completing a romance storyline. So feel free to go romance-less and still pick up that Platinum.

<p>
As the launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard nears, BioWare has been sharing plenty on the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-five-difficulty-settings-and-a-further-option-to-customise-it-all">accessibility settings</a> and explaining why the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-have-an-arachnophobia-mode-because-it-doesnt-have-a-single-spider">doesn't have an arachnophobia mode</a>. We've also been treated to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/listen-now-to-hans-zimmers-dragon-age-the-veilguard-main-theme">snippet of the game's soundtrack</a>, which is composed by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe.
</p><p>
"After playing it all day, Dragon Age: The Veilguard feels like the series' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a> moment," Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-playing-it-all-day-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feels-like-the-series-mass-effect-2-moment">Eurogamer's recent Dragon Age: The Veilguard hands-on preview</a>. "Based on what I've played, I've absolutely no doubt The Veilguard will be an enjoyable ride. My only concern is how much of a memorable one it will be."

			<p>The PC version of Red Dead Redemption will sport better lighting and shadows, among other things, over the PlayStation 5 release, as highlighted by a recent video.</p>
<p>The early comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> does an excellent job highlighting how the PC version will be superior to the PlayStation 5 version, which is actually the PS4 version played in backward compatibility mode, in several regards, including the aforementioned lighting and shadows, but also draw distance, detail and more. Ultimately, the PC version seems like it will represent the original game's atmosphere the best, which should be more than enough to make it the true definitive edition of one of the best open-world games ever made.</p>

<p>The wait has been incredibly long, but it is almost over, as Red Dead Redemption will finally release on PC 14 years after its debut on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-is-out-on-october-29-system-requirements-nvidia-dlss-frame-generation-confirmed/">October 29th</a>. Developed by Double Eleven, the PC port will come with plenty of exclusive features, including Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide support, HDR10 support, keyboard, and mouse controls support, NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 Super Resolution and Frame Generation support, AMD FSR 3.0 support, and more. This new version of the game will come complete with the Undead Nightmare expansion, but will lack any multiplayer feature, just as the PS4 and Switch port do. More information on the port can be found on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam store page.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-settles-lawsuit-from-players-attempting-to-block-activision-blizzard-acquisition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-settles-lawsuit-from-players-attempting-to-block-activision-blizzard-acquisition.1009680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-settles-lawsuit-from-players-attempting-to-block-activision-blizzard-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Microsoft has settled the antitrust lawsuit from players attempting to block its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69bn</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/small-band-of-gamers-team-up-to-sue-microsoft-over-activision-blizzard-deal">originally filed in California in 2022</a>, after Microsoft announced its intention to acquire the Call of Duty and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> maker. The legal action was begun shortly after the FTC filed its own lawsuit, (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-wins-crucial-ftc-case-on-activision-blizzard-acquisition">Microsoft crucially won back in 2023</a>).</p>
<p>On Monday this week, a deal was struck to dismiss the lawsuit "with prejudice", so it cannot be refiled. In a court filing, lawyers agreed "each party shall bear their own costs and fees" - beyond this, terms of the agreement have not been disclosed (thanks <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/microsoft-settles-gamers-antitrust-lawsuit-seeking-divestiture-activision-blizzard-1236031977/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>Players from multiple US states filed the lawsuit, unhappy with the supposed monopoly Microsoft would gain from acquiring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>. This would potentially mean raising prices, reducing consumer choice, and making certain games exclusive - Call of Duty specifically.</p>
<p>At the timing of the lawsuit's filing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-responds-to-re-filed-gamers-lawsuit-against-activision-acquisition">Microsoft responded to say the legal action was based upon "unsupported and implausible claims"</a>. Undeterred, the defendants continued, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supreme-court-denies-gamers-last-ditch-effort-to-block-microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal">tried to get the lawsuit seen by the US Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition deal was signed off on 13th October 2023 - with this week marking its one year anniversary.</p>
<p>A year later, then, and players were seemingly unable to uphold their complaint, leading to the settlement of this case.</p>
<p>Since the acquisition, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">Eurogamer reported yesterday</a>, much has occurred, least of all a string of layoffs and studio closures. Blizzard president Mike Ybarra left the company at the start of this year, following the departure of controversial Activision Blizzard CEO <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> in December 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-have-campaign-early-access-even-if-you-pre-order">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, the next game in the series, is set to release on PlayStation consoles as well as Xbox and PC, with Microsoft therefore upholding its decision to release the game across multiple platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div>



            
<p>My earliest memory of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-behind-enemy-lines">Commandos</a> series of tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth games</a> was my dad bringing home a box copy of the original. “The missions take months. Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1479730/Commandos_Origins/">Steam demo</a> for Kalypso’s revival, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-origins">Commandos: Origins</a>, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Before loading in, I was offered the following option:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/commandos-origins-flag.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kalypso/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I went with non-historical, mainly because I was worried I was going to get a pop up later like “oh, so you like NAZI flags, do you? You know who <em>else</em> liked Nazi flags?!” (“Crispian Mills” - Graham). The graphics options seem robust enough. I went for high, and the introductory flyover to the demo’s single mission was very pretty, if a lil’ stuttery.</p><p>Even if you’ve never played a Commandos game, you might be familiar with the basics here from one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-gambit-studio-mimimi-are-closing-down-to-prioritize-our-well-being">sadly defunct Mimimi</a>’s absolute belters, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/desperados-iii">Desperados 3</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew">Shadow Gambit</a>. Those games, despite their own wonderful twists and map designs, could fairly accurately be described as spiritual sequels to this series, since the fundamentals bear such strong resemblance. You control a small team of specialists with RTS controls, sneaking around by avoiding enemy vision cones. The vision are divided into ‘don’t walk here’ and ‘don’t crawl here’ sections. You crouch in bushes, perform stealth kills, hide bodies, use gadgets and special abilities, and sometimes coordinate spectacularly gif-worthy team plays.</p>
<p>Even the controls felt immediately intuitive, despite me not having played a Commandos game in years - right down to the soon-to-be-worn-to-nubs quick save and load keys. A very small gripe: the quick save is a little slow, even briefly pausing the game. I feel like a donkey responding to a quick save option with, ah, but how quick are we talking? But here we are.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/commandos-origins-barrel.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The green beret can also carry barrels, though this one was perfectly placed. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Kalypso/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You start the mission as just the green beret, who’s sort of the thick-armed poster boy for the series. I swear he even runs the same, like someone recently injected a sharp needle filled with testosterone into his bottom. The first gadget I find is a radio, which you can plonk down then remotely activate to lure enemies. Combined with a shovel he can use to bury himself in the dirt, this is a disgusting bit of kit, highly abusable.</p><p>Also slightly broken are the marine’s throwing knives. He turns up shortly to help me deal with a higher tier of guard who’s heard it all before, especially radios, and so won’t move from his spot. The knives do have a fairly short distance, but I should point out that kit being abusable is kind of the point with these games. Once you get a full team together, you’ve basically got access to superpowers. When done well - like in Mimimi’s case - the meat of the game is having to stretch all these overpowered combinations to their absolute limit to deal with seemingly impossible scenarios. For obvious reasons, this is something a demo can’t really explore too much - although there were enough instances packed with guards it'd be worth going through twice, I reckon.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/commandos-origins-widdle.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kalypso/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I accidentally amber-alerted an inqusitive grunt at one point, trying to sneak my marine up a ladder to push a wardrobe on top of two chatting guards. Am I going to snark the wardrobe for being much more pristine than the only other two pieces of furniture in the bombed-out house <em>and</em> being conveniently placed in the only position that would allow me to do this? No. That’s some early 2010’s game crit shit. Now we ponder the liminality of the space between the house and the guards. Anyway, the guard ran about for a bit, doing a pretty unconvincing but still thorough check of local hiding spots. The nazis don’t strike me as geniuses, but I did notice they’ll sprint backwards while shooting if you try to quickly rush them down with a knife after fumbling stealth.</p>
<p>After clearing out the area, my next stop is the radio tower I’m supposed to take down for my objective. There’s two guards covering each other with view cones between me and it, so I try a little “time shifting”, which is the game’s fancy way of saying “pause”. I have the marine use a throwing knife, and the green beret use his special “holding knife” to take them down. I then lob a grenade I found on a guard - they drop loot sometimes, medikits and the like - at some barrels surrounding the tower, and that’s the mission and also the demo done.</p>

<p>All in all, it seems very solid. The question, of course, is how Claymore’s scenario design will eventually stack up. Abilities are one thing, but it’s how I’m coaxed into using them that really matters here. Based on the most recent gameplay trailer, it does seem to be saving some of its best toys (tanks!) for later, but that’s par for the course. While it does feel a little strange to call a game primarily about throat-slitting ‘comfy’, that’s about where I am with this. It’s doing everything right by not really doing anything wrong, and when you’ve got a formula that works this well, that’s good enough for a wishlist from me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Steam Next Fest</a> for October 2024 has begun and as usual, there's a veritable treasure trove of demos available for upcoming PC games. The downside is that some gems might slip through the cracks, given how many demos are released at the same time. In this article, we'll try to give you an overview of the five games (plus another bonus five) we believe are worth checking out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/8e31e7492372aa052c2caa93f48a0fbc2c9e4cd3-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force?snr=1_614_615_nextfest_100718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Force</a></h2>
<p>Let's start from the top. So far, the most played demo is the latest playtest of Delta Force, TiMi Studio's upcoming tactical first-person shooter game based on the historic franchise. Back in June, we were <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-qa-early-access-in-october-release-window-in-q1-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> the developers planned to launch early access in October, although that schedule appears to have been delayed. Anyway, this new playtest also features Asia and South America servers in addition to North America and Europe, allowing more players to jump into the fray with a decent latency. Across the Steam Next Fest week, Delta Force players will be able to check out four Havoc Warfare modes (Attack/Defend, King of the Hill, Siege, and Blitz) across two maps (Cracked and Ascension), while the extraction mode Hazard Operations has three maps available. This playtest also includes 45 weapons, 9 vehicles, and 12 props.</p>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/490110/The_Precinct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Precinct</a></h2>
<p>Do you miss the old days of Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2? If so, there is no better cure than The Precinct, even though the game in development at Fallen Tree flips GTA on its premise and puts you in the shoes of a rookie beat cop who just graduated from the Police Academy.</p>
<p>The Precinct mixes action with sandbox elements. In the game, you'll patrol the streets and respond to calls to take on criminals, from drug dealers to bank robbers, choosing your own approach in car chases and shootouts. As a cop, you can get various forms of backup, from spike strips to roadblocks and fellow police cars. A full-fledged day/night cycle with dynamic weather should make you even more immersed in the fictional city of Averno, set in the 1980s East Coast.</p>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407270/AI_LIMIT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Limit</a></h2>
<p>Fans of games like NieR: Automata and Code Vein should definitely check out AI Limit, which has a demo out now on PC for the Steam Next Fest and on PlayStation 5.&nbsp; As in many Japanese games, the setting of the debut title from Sense Games is post-apocalyptic Earth, following various wars and disasters. Players will venture out into the dangerous world from the last human refuge of Havenswell, trying to uncover the truth behind all the destructive events. The AI Limit demo lets players experience the first level in its entirety for an estimated two hours of gameplay.</p>
<p>Enemies include elite and boss battles, and the level has several secret paths that hide weapons and items. Once you finish the demo, there's also a Boss Challenge mode.</p>

<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287330/Empire_of_the_Ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empire of the Ants</a></h2>
<p>This impressive looking Unreal Engine 5-powered real-time strategy game is based on the novel from best-selling saga sci-fi novel originally published by French writer Bernard Werber in 1991. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-lineup-also-includes-the-ue5-rts-empire-of-the-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a> expects you to build up your economy, manage your units, gather information on the battlefield, gain new powers, and strengthen your defenses.

		<p><span>In fashion, it’s said that trends return every 20 years. But it seems technology has started to repeat itself at the same cadence, too. Can you identify what things happened in 2004, 2024, or in some cases, both?</span></p>

								<p>Two decades ago, the EU handed down a fine of over $600 million for not offering versions of Windows that did not come with Windows Media Player preinstalled. Microsoft still has antitrust problems in Europe at the moment, and last year, the EU attempted to block the company’s acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard. But Microsoft has paid no fines this year… so far.</p>

								<p>The very first Razr, called the Motorola Razr V3, was released in November of 2004. At the time, it cost <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22857413/motorola-razr-internet-button-flip-phone-data-cellular-charges">$500 with a two-year contract</a>. That was expensive then, and it’s expensive today. The current model of Motorola’s revival model, the Razr Plus, comes unlocked at nearly the same price.</p>

								<p>Steve Jobs introduced the company’s Cinema Display in 2004 at WWDC. The price of the 30-inch model was $3,299 — adjusted for inflation, that’s over $5,400 today.</p>

								<p>At the end of last year’s film adaptation of the Mattel product, Barbie discovers her independence. But in 2004, Mattel announced that <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/barbie-ken-splitting-after-43-years-1c9485747">the couple had split</a>. Drama in doll lore existed long before Greta Gerwig scripted it.</p>

				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>Google famously launched Gmail on April Fools’ Day 2004 — at a time when promising one gigabyte of free storage surely must have been a joke. Google did introduce Inbox a decade ago in 2014 but shuttered that in 2019.</p>

				<div data-answer="both">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>The 2024 film is actually an adaptation of the 2017 stage musical, which was adapted from the 2004 film, which was originally adapted from a 2002 book titled <em>Queen Bees and Wannabes</em>.</p>

								<p><em>Spider-Man 2</em> opened on June 30th, 2004, breaking the previous opening-day box office record held by its predecessor. Though there were <em>Spider-Man </em>sequels released in 2019 and 2021, none are slated for this calendar year. (We’re not counting <em>Madame Web </em>since it is not a direct sequel and also barely counts as a movie.)</p>

								<p>Microsoft released the SPOT watch — short for “smart personal object technology.” Given that you don’t hear that acronym much anymore, you can probably guess that the watch never took off, despite the fanfare over the device’s ability to read headlines, send instant messages, and give weather forecasts. The SPOT watch also wasn’t even the company’s first attempt at a smartwatch: as early as 1994, it partnered with Timex to release the Datalink, arguably the world’s first smartwatch. But here in 2024, it’s been a while since Microsoft tried to make wristwear happen.</p>

								<p>In 2004, Beyoncé won five Grammy Awards — her first as a solo artist. Though this year’s <em>Cowboy Carter</em> is a likely favorite come awards season, she did not release an album in 2023, which means nothing that qualifies for this year’s Grammy Awards.</p>

								<p>US consumers loved trucks in 2004 and have continued to love them for the past two decades. Ford’s F-series remains the bestseller even today, and it has little to do with the addition of the electric version — in 2024 so far, the Lightning makes up less than 5 percent of total F-series sales.</p>

								<p>First identified in January 2004, Mydoom became the fastest-spreading email worm ever. As of 2024, its speed record has not been surpassed, and its origin is still unknown.</p>

				<div data-answer="2004">
						
								



						
						
								

						
						
								<p>In June of 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that the Child Online Protection Act was unconstitutional, a violation of the First Amendment. Though it was designed to prevent minors from seeing pornography on the internet, the Court ruled 5–4 that the law itself was too broad. Similar echoes are happening this year, though. Age-verification laws at the state level are blocking porn sites for minors or, in some states, blocking them entirely; and this July, the similarly named Kids Online Safety Act passed with bipartisan support.</p>

								<p>The original <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </em>was released for the GameCube in 2004, and its remake was released for the Switch almost exactly 20 years later.</p>

								<p>One of Hollywood’s biggest tabloid magnets, the couple called off their engagement and broke up for the first time in January 2004. Lopez and Affleck got back together many years later, finally marrying in 2022. That union officially ended again in 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/hunt-showdown-1896-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 is a big revision of the original Hunt: Showdown, which was released way back in 2019. For those not familiar, it’s a PvPvE extraction shooter featuring zombies, hunting down a selection of bosses, and a bunch of gunslinger types who want to kill all the aforementioned things as well as you. It’s also got some very cool ideas behind it, such as a heavy reliance on audio cues and spatial sound to pinpoint where other players are, but alas, some of these cool ideas fall apart in a multiplayer game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hunt: Showdown 1896 I Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16vBsmpcxh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The set-up is fairly straightforward, as you and up to two other hunters head into a zombie-filled map to find clues that will lead you to a big monster to kill. You must then banish that monster and collect its bounty tokens, which takes time and gives other hunters your location so they can hunt you down, and steal your bounty tokens – very rude, if you ask me. It’s an extraction shooter, except the things you’re extracting are, I guess, bits of a giant spider, or whatever boss you were lucky enough to get instead. I honestly love the idea, but the reality is a bit less exciting.</p>


<p>The first boss I encountered was the aforementioned spider, and what a spider it was – taller than me, nine feet long, hairy, and scuttling all along the ceiling and walls at a horrific pace. The sounds it makes are the worst part, accurately giving the impression it’s crawling around you when you’re wearing headphones.</p>
<p>The spatial audio is vital throughout, as while you’re finding these clues and fighting this boss, the gunshots and explosions will make an awful lot of noise and draw other groups of players to you. The quieter you are, the safer you are. In addition to shooting and your footsteps, they can also hear any noise traps you might trigger – things like dying horses in the road, flocks of crows, and dogs in a kennel all make noise if they notice you, giving your position away. With a pair of headphones, you can pinpoint the direction they come from and know that there’s likely enemies over there well before you see them. The sound design and the use of spatial sound in this game is truly excellent.</p>

<p>As great as it sounds, it has mostly led to frustration. You can keep your distance from noise traps to avoid triggering them, but there’s often many of them clustered together directly in your way, and sometimes they trigger from further away than you thought they did last time, somehow. This, combined with certain zombies, can make sneaking around more of a chore than a thrill.</p>
<p>The Hive, a zombie with a beehive stuck in its chest that attacks from range demands you have a silent ranged weapon with you or you will be forced to shoot and draw attention to yourself. Its bees also deal poison damage, which prevents you from healing until it stops taking health away from you, which you either have to wait out or heal with an antidote. Meanwhile, the Immolator is a zombie that explodes into flames and charges once pierced by bullets or knives, but I don’t know how many blunt strikes it takes to kill with my fully charged melee because I got to four before it had taken three quarters of my health and then just shot it out of sheer frustration. Fire and bleed both need to be stopped by holding square before they kill you, which just isn’t engaging. Just yet another thing passively draining my health and slowing me down as if the movement speed wasn’t abysmally slow as it is.</p>

<p>Every piece of your equipment costs Hunt Dollars. I started with 8000 Hunt dollars I believe, but now have about 3000. Each time you die you’ll lose all your equipment and, once you reach level 11, you’ll lose your character and all the traits you’ve unlocked from levelling them up as well. Once I run out of Hunt Dollars, I’ll be without ammo packs, med kits, fire bombs, antidotes, and dynamite, not to mention being stuck with basic free characters and their similarly bare-bones weaponry. In short; a very severe disadvantage. Bounties don’t even reward that many Hunt Dollars, with the best way to earn some being killing other players or engaging with the event that sometimes appears in the center of the map.</p>
<p>To counter this disadvantage, you could hang back collecting stuff whilst you wait for the other groups to kill each other, then swoop in and take out the survivors. Unfortunately there isn’t that much stuff to collect, with most of it marked on the map and most buildings just being completely empty, making exploring feel pointless. Many players are also content to just sit in the building they fought the boss in forever. They’ll wait until they’re sure they’ve murdered everyone with their much better sight lines whilst you’ve got to see them through a window and headshot them in the split second they’re visible or try to navigate through all the noise traps and actual traps they have placed.</p>
<p>I’ve been hunting down someone only to find that they were just camping inside a large bush where they simply can’t be seen from outside. They were there for almost five minutes whilst I painstakingly snuck my way over to them, completely still, next to their team mate who I had already downed, and invisible to me because all I could see was their bush.</p>

<p>That’s the issue with this type of cool gameplay idea. When there’s lots of players it gets abandoned because it’s not efficient to play that way. If you sneak you won’t make noise, but you’ll spend fifteen minutes slowly making your way around and then you’ll either have to dash madly towards bounty holders anyway or keep sneaking and lose them. You’re much better off sprinting around because being careful and engaging properly with the sound mechanics is too large of a disadvantage, especially since there’s horses and cows constantly going off anyway because everyone else <em>is</em> sprinting around.</p>
<p>The shooting itself has its share of issues as well. Now, reloading is extremely slow. If someone were to reload like this in real life I’d suggest they switch to using swords or something, it’s so slow it almost feels passive aggressive. But beyond that, there’s also some latency and hit detection issues. In addition to having played a few matches with a big red lag warning in the corner of my screen though without any actual signs of lag like rubber banding and desync, I’ve also aimed directly at a player’s head whilst they were completely still and missed. Additionally, I’ve very obviously missed shots only to find that they mysteriously still connected. This could be part of the lag, it could be poor hit detection, I don’t know, but I do know it’s annoying and quickly converts the tension in gunfights into frustration.</p>
<p>On top of this, there’s a lengthy list of issues with the game’s UI and menus, despite it being overhauled with this update. Navigating around the menus is always a pain, sometimes it’s unclear where things are, where you’ll end up when you press a button, what a button will do, or even what UI elements mean. When choosing traits for your characters, there are a few icons on some of them that we could not find an explanation for in-game. You can’t highlight them, there isn’t a key, eventually we had to google them because we thought they would tell us why we couldn’t equip them. It turns out you have to find them in-game before you can equip them, something the game didn’t tell us outside of an icon without a description. They’ve even removed the Encyclopedia, which had all the background information about types of zombies and the world and so on, so that just isn’t in the game it belongs in anymore apparently.</p>

<p>Speaking of removing things, this new map – Mammon’s Gulch – is pretty nice, though not as nice as you might expect from Crytek. It’s got quite a few distinct areas, though two of those are both burned out wastelands, and a lot of verticality with all the hills, mountains, and mines/caves. It looks good, it just doesn’t have the wow I’ve previously associated with Cryengine. But they’ve also removed the other three maps from the game temporarily for some reason, initially for a month but now for an undisclosed time longer than that. That means you get one map for more than a month, ensuring less variety in the game than there was before this revitalising patch.</p>
<p>Then there’s bugs and frustrating traversal issues. In addition to walking painfully slowly and sneaking/crouching being even more painful, you can usually vault over things in this game, but I guarantee whilst you’re sneaking through the undergrowth you’ll come upon a waist high rock or ledge that you inexplicably can’t vault over. This totally ruins the sneaky vibe and your immersion as you have to go around or stand and jump to get up it, exposing yourself to anyone you might’ve been sneaking up on. Hunters also sometimes leave some chunks of their guns floating in the air around extraction points once they’ve been extracted, whilst sometimes the gun models don’t load even whilst playing, which is poor and a minor disadvantage to other players as that gun sticking up off their back could give away their position if they were, as a random example, hiding in a bush. And <em>then</em> there’s slow matchmaking and even occasional failures when inviting another player into my party, the only reliable way around this being to restart the game for both of us.</p>

<p>In a clip captured during a recent stream, Jesse ‘bubu dubu’ Moeller explained that he and his squad are being dropped by Sentinels in the Halo Championship Series. He also explained that the organisation is uncertain of its future in the Halo scene, prompting concerns from fans.</p>



<p>Sentinels has yet to make a comment about these claims, but the organisation is notorious for being radio silent where the Halo ecosystem is concerned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-on">Moving On</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bubudubu/clip/ObeseUninterestedGooseWholeWheat-zxlkrP0WNdjt18G6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short clip</a> captured while broadcasting a ‘Health &amp; Fitness’ stream, Sentinels’ bubu dubu said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Sentinels pretty much told us that we are all – like my entire team – are unrestricted free agents, and we are available to explore. They’re pretty much undecided if they’re going to field a team for year four, you know?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sentinels is far from being one of the winningest teams in the Halo space. In 2022, the organisation won the Kansas City Major, beating Cloud9 in a 4 – 0 sweep in the grand finals to secure a $140,000 prize. Since then, not much has happened for the organisation.</p>



<p>Most recently, the team finished in fifth place at the Halo World Championship tournament in Seattle.</p>



<p>Regardless of the team’s stature, it would be a blow to the Halo Championship Series to see the organisation cut away and move on. Sentinels has had a place in the HCS since it was reborn a few years ago, and it has shared the stage with some of the biggest names in gaming, like FaZe Clan and OpTic Gaming.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky few years for the Halo esports scene, despite 343 Industries (now Halo Studios) and Esports Engine trying to set up a solid competitive ecosystem and attract fans worldwide to attend a series of high-profile events.</p>



<p>Would you be sad to see the back of Sentinels in the Halo Championship Series? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It's the first mainline entry in the series with Princess Zelda in the leading role, and it plays a lot differently than previous top-down iterations starring Link. Zelda's ability to create echoes (copies) of objects and monsters to solve puzzles, cross gaps, and fight offers a fun new spin on the classic formula. Just like Tears of the Kingdom, there are many ways to solve puzzles. Echoes of Wisdom also has key components of the classics, including traditional dungeons and Heart Pieces.</p><p>All long-time fans should play Echoes of Wisdom, but it would also make for a great first Zelda game for newcomers.

This means that you aren't guaranteed to get a North American edition of the Switch games you order from Woot. All Nintendo Switch consoles are region-free, and Nintendo includes multiple language options in most games, including English in all of the Switch games listed in this article. If you get an international import, the only visible difference is the ratings board logo on the box, which is always ESRB for North American releases.</p><p>When it comes to actually playing the game, you won't notice any differences between the North American, UK, Japanese versions, etc. The one potential snag is with DLC. For example, if you buy the UK edition of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, any DLC you purchase in the future must be from the UK eShop. North American Switch owners can easily create UK and Japanese eShop user accounts on Switch, so this is more of a potential annoyance than anything else, but it's worth keeping in mind. That said, most of the games above--and first-party Switch games in general--are fully self-contained and don't offer DLC.</p><p>Of the games on sale at Woot, four of them have notable add-on content: Smash Bros., Luigi's Mansion 3, and Pokemon Sword and Shield.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="751291687" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"
