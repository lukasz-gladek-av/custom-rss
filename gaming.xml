            <p>Spoilers for<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2"> Death Stranding 2</a> are flooding social media and YouTube, posted by those who bought the digital deluxe edition of the game.</p>
<p>This digital deluxe edition, which provides a 48-hour early access window to those who buy it, released on the 24th June. For owners of the regular version, the game becomes available tomorrow on the 26th June.</p>
<p>Those who have been able to play early have been keen to share their experiences online, but given how narratively rich Death Stranding 2 is (and the whole catalogue of Kojima's works), this has led to a deluge of early game story moments and equipment popping up on the internet.</p>

<figcaption>Why not check out our video review of Death Stranding 2. No spoilers!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDgRQ9ZCRmE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Death Stranding 2, a game which takes between 35-50 hours to beat, is a chunky experience, especially for completionists. However, given the fact deluxe edition owners will obviously continue to play and post their screenshots and videos online as they proceed into the game's later moments, it's best to stay away from such platforms if you're looking to go in fresh.</p>
<p>It's been a rough few days for the spoiler-averse. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-death-stranding-2s-full-opening-hour-has-leaked-online">the opening hour of the game leaked online</a>, giving away all the twists and turns the game throws at you in the game's opening scenes.</p>
<p>One could argue plenty of story moments have already been revealed ahead of launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-releases-hype-trailer">due to a release trailer for the game</a> which featured plenty of cinematics from throughout the game's runtime. Still, it's nice to go in without knowing the surprises that await you. Except for some of the spoiler-free technical stuff maybe, like the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-instantaneous-loading-times-truly-prove-the-power-of-the-ps5">Death Stranding 2 benefits from super fast load times</a>. Cool!</p>
<p>If you want a spoiler-free impression of what the game is like, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Eurogamer's Death Stranding 2 review</a>! In it, the game is described as: "A busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim." No spoilers necessary!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-spoilers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new big patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, updating the game to version 1.5. This update introduces major fixes to the A-Life system, which was kinda broken when STALKER 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in November 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view. Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.</em></li>
<li><em>The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.</em></li>
<li><em>Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world’s immersion.</em></li>
<li><em>Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants' lair, for example, those mutants won't simply reappear moments later.</em></li>
<li><em>A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone's population.</em></li>
<li><em>Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the "pop-in" effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Guns &amp; Looting Showcase | Patch 1.5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yR2DDPJHHcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are many more bug fixes, tweaks, and technical improvements to performance and Ultra-wide screens, for instance, but arguably the other highlight of STALKER 2 Patch 1.5 is the public release of the modding tool. Called Zone Kit, it is available for download <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-zone-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via the Epic Games Store</a> and will allow users to create new animations, weapons, mechanics, and more. The mods can then be shared via Steam Workshop or <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mod.io</a>. The former page isn't up yet, but Mod.io already has 43 mods listed.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Wccftech that they would add cross-platform mods, multiplayer, and hardware ray tracing post-launch. The first one has been released, and now we're expecting them to focus on delivering the remaining promises made to fans.</p>

Death Stranding 2 then does a Groundhog Day thing where the game keeps showing the intro over and over, and you can keep selecting "I wont do it,” but eventually the game forces you to accept the offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This first major dialogue choice doesn’t stop you from progressing the story, nor does it do that thing some games do by rolling credits early. It’s a perfectly safe Easter egg that’s in keeping with the Hideo Kojima style, and a fun distraction before you get stuck into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the video below, where we show you exactly what happens when you refuse Fragile’s plea to join Drawbridge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2 review</a> returned a 9/10.

And if that seems very far away, I have good news: anyone who pre-orders a digital version of Little Nightmares 3 will get to revisit the game that started it all with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/little-nightmares"><u>Little Nightmares</u></a> Enhanced Edition as an early access title between now and launch day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also an all-new season of the Little Nightmares themed podcast series on the way, The Sounds of Nightmares, and a comic book — Little Nightmares: Descent to Nowhere — also kicking off in October. Before then, however, a young adult book called Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones is out in September. Phew. Got all that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comic book? Published by Titan Comics, Little Nightmares: Descent to Nowhere, follows two parallel stories. Hush, a timid mute girl wakes up in a jail cell. Desperate to escape, she befriends another prisoner, Mono, who understands this world far better than her, they will have to find a way out of a very dark Dungeon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The novel Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones, on the other hand, is written by E.C. Myers and published by Scholastic. It follows Ruse, a young child, who awakens in an unfamiliar, shaking room with two other kids she doesn't know — a small girl with a frayed rope dangling from her neck and a starved-looking boy wearing a tattered mask over his mouth and nose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there's another surprise: Bandai Namco also revealed a teaser for a stop motion project developed in collaboration with studio Taller del Chucho. We didn't get much more information, but Bandai says more information will be "unveiled" at a later date. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Little Nightmares 3 — the first Little Nightmares game from Supermassive — is scheduled to release on to PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox Series X and S, and last-gen systems, including Nintendo Switch.

It’s also just as brief, and although the reintroduction of the Six character as an AI-controlled co-op partner ultimately serves the story well, she’s not used as a vehicle to take the game’s puzzle-solving and stealth to interesting new places, which seems like a real missed opportunity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

                <p>Prime Day is quickly approaching, but if you’re in the market for an affordable tablet, there’s no need to wait until July 8. Amazon is currently dropping the price of its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release/dp/B099Z93WD9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus (32GB)</a> to just $55 (was $120)--bringing it to the lowest price we’ve ever seen. There’s also an excellent deal for the 64GB model, and you can snag a preowned Amazon Fire HD 10 for just $70 (was $120). All three are limited-time deals, though it’s unclear when they’ll disappear.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3739" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532627 - Kindle Fire HD 8 Plus Deal" data-collection="" title="6532627 - Kindle Fire HD 8 Plus Deal">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release/dp/B099Z93WD9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Amazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release\/dp\/B099Z93WD9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release/dp/B099Z93WD9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">2022 Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release/dp/B099Z93WD9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Amazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release\/dp\/B099Z93WD9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release/dp/B099Z93WD9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">32GB: $55 (was $120) | 64GB: $85 (was $150)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">While these aren’t the latest models of the tablet, they’re still powerful enough for all your daily computing needs, such as browsing the web or streaming TV shows.

                <p>Samsung is offering a bunch of impressive price cuts ahead of Prime Day, with TVs, soundbars, and memory products all seeing significant discounts. The most enticing deals are for TVs, as you can save well over $2,000 on select products--making this an excellent time to upgrade your home theater. We’ve noticed some of the deals are already selling out (The Frame QLED TV 50-Inch is no longer available in all regions), so we’d recommend checking out all the offers while you can. Amazon is also price-matching some of the offers, so give it a look if you notice models out of stock at Samsung.</p><div title="6532682 - Samsung Early Prime Deals" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3746" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532682 - Samsung Early Prime Deals" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Anti-Reflection-Customizable-QN55LS03D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Anti-Reflection-Customizable-QN55LS03D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Anti-Reflection-Customizable-QN55LS03D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">The Frame TV</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Anti-Reflection-Customizable-QN55LS03D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Anti-Reflection-Customizable-QN55LS03D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Anti-Reflection-Customizable-QN55LS03D?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Save up to $1,300</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Pulling double duty as a television set and picture frame, The Frame TV is a versatile 4K QLED display.

The 65-inch model is the same price as the older QN800D, making it the better choice among the two, as it comes with an upgraded processor for faster performance.</p><p>Amazon is price-matching several <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=samsung+qn90d&amp;crid=26VR9XFNQEFJV&amp;sprefix=samsung+qn90d%2Caps%2C187&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">QN90D</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Tracking-Enhancer-QN75QN800D/dp/B0CV9N2M3H?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">QN800D</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Infinity-Enhancer-QN85QN900D/dp/B0CV9LRLH2?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">QN900D</a> products.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/0cie8di0qp2ug" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/0cie8di0qp2ug&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/0cie8di0qp2ug">Samsung OLED TVs</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/0cie8di0qp2ug" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/0cie8di0qp2ug&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/0cie8di0qp2ug">Save up to $2,100</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">Both the S90D and S95D lineups are on sale at Samsung.

            <p>The Nintendo Museum in Japan is set to receive an art gallery extension.</p>
<p>The art gallery will allow visitors to "explore a wide range of game artwork, including character illustrations and concept art".</p>
<p>It's set to open on 3rd September at the Nintendo Museum near Kyoto, which is built on the site of the company's former hanafuda manufacturing plant that opened in 1969.</p>

<p>The art gallery is an intriguing prospect, which will no doubt have fans speculating as to what kind of never-before-seen artwork may be included. Perhaps some Miyamoto originals from when he designed Mario and Link? Or will this be a digital art display?</p>
<p>The Nintendo Museum opened on 2nd October last year, which includes exhibits showcasing the history of Nintendo's games as well as fun minigames to try out. Then, in the gift shop, you can buy one of those giant controller cushions.</p>
<p>Except, the museum already feels somewhat like a gallery. As former Eurogamer managing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-nintendo-museum-a-joyful-celebration-of-machines-magic-and-the-art-of-play">Katharine Castle wrote when she visited last year</a>, there's a "dizzying amount of stuff to absorb" but Nintendo states up front it's all "shared with little explanation". </p>
<p>"Having spent nine hours wandering round the museum this week," Katharine wrote, "it's a concept that feels both refreshing, but also rich with missed opportunity. This isn't a place that finally pulls back the curtain on Nintendo's secret inner workings, nor is it the kind of exhibit that sheds new light on what you already know."</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Art Gallery will open on Wednesday, September 3rd on the 2nd floor of the Nintendo Museum Exhibition Building.

<p>I also luckily visited the museum last year on holiday and, while I had a great time reminiscing about past consoles and games, I didn't feel I truly learned anything new about Nintendo as a company.</p>
<p>Still, the opportunity to potentially see some rare artwork is certainly a draw to visit the Nintendo Museum, though whether you're able to visit remains luck of the draw for those applying for tickets.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-nintendo-museum-is-opening-an-art-gallery-this-september">Nintendo Life</a> reported, the museum was also updated back in April, to include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exhibit.</p>
<p>Ahead of the new console's launch, we published a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">review of Nintendo's other controversially expensive handheld - the Virtual Boy</a>. And that's something you can see for yourself at the museum.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-museum-in-japan-is-getting-an-art-gallery-extension]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The word premium has started to lose its meaning when it comes to gaming peripherals. The steady rise of improved tech and manufacturing, enhanced ergonomics and better materials means that the playing field is both more level, and more competitive than ever. Nacon are a company continually pushing to raise that bar, and with the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited, their ultra-premium, command screen-equipped wireless pro controller, that bar is once again higher than ever before.</p>
<p><iframe title="REVOLUTION X UNLIMITED | LAUNCH TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDdMQGcUtFA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Revolution X Unlimited offers one hell of a package. Alongside the controller, which is designed for Xbox, PC and mobile, you’re getting a sturdy storage case, which contains an accessory storage box housing a wealth of different options, with the choice of two D-pad tops, six joystick heads, six weights, a super handy charging dock, a 3m USB-C to USB-A cable and the wireless USB dongle as well.</p>


<p>This controller feels fantastic. The all-black soft-touch finish is alluring and immediately tactile, accentuated by the incredibly grippy rubberised material that run along the side and around the back of each of the controller’s arms. It feels utterly fixed in place when it’s in your hands, but manages to avoid the roughness that some grip textures have. While the layout is based upon the traditional Xbox controller’s setup, the ergonomics are recognisably ‘Nacon’, bearing obvious similarities to the previous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/07/nacon-revolution-5-pro-controller-review-ps5/">Nacon Revolution</a> line. That means there’s a little more heft, a little more girth, which feels great if you’ve got the right-sized hands to handle it. If you’ve got smaller hands, this might not be the controller for you.</p>
<p>Just like Nacon’s other top-end controllers, you can adjust the weight of the Revolution X Unlimited by adding tiny weights to each of the arms, the rear grips sliding off to reveal the tiny space that houses them. This has always been one of my favourite things about Nacon controllers, and it allows you to get the feel just right for you. I added two of the medium weights in (there’s three pairs to choose from), just for that additional presence it gives the controller in your hand, but at 328g without anything added, the Revolution X Unlimited might be heavy enough for most players.</p>

<p>The expected core inputs are all present and correct, but you’ll immediately notice the satisfying click of mechanical OMRON switches in the ABXY buttons and the D-pad. These mouse-like inputs are brutally quick, and require just that little bit less pressure to activate, making them feel swifter and operate quicker and smoother than traditional membrane switches. They are easily my preferred option for button tech, and the only downside to them is that they are mildly noisier than their older membrane cousins. Nacon have set these up perfectly here, and from the first click I knew I was onto a good thing.</p>
<p>There’s also mechanical switches in the underside ‘pro’ buttons in the grip, with a really interesting layout here that sees two sit under each ring finger, with the second pair further down the arms beneath your little fingers. It definitely takes some getting used to, but they’ve been placed absolutely perfectly to activate when you need them, but be out of the way if you don’t. You need to move your little finger to hit the lower buttons, and this is potentially a sticking point, as the higher ones are just right there beneath your fingers. Still, they’re done very well, and feel more natural than a lot of rear layouts do, especially after spending some time to get to know them.</p>

<p>The final set of mechanical switches sit within the triggers. This tech gives you a pair of switches that allow you to shorten the length of your trigger activation, and they’re primarily designed to make you better at Call of Duty or Overwatch. I love them. Every single controller should have them. Nacon have stuffed in the best version of this technology too, transitioning from Hall Effect analogue triggers into mechanical switches, and while I don’t understand the magic behind them, you can be certain that your response time is faster than ever before.</p>
<p>We then have the analogue sticks. These utilise the now-expected Hall Effect sensors which means they’re more accurate and longer lasting than typical potentiometer stick technology which runs the risk of developing stick drift. The Nacon Revolution X Unlimited’s sticks use magnets which means there’s no friction through the mechanism, and no friction means greatly reduced wear. They will eventually wear out – everything does – but they’ll likely outlive numerous official gamepads along the way. You’ve also got a variety of tops and collars, to get the height and feel just right, with very few controllers able to match the level of customisation on display here.</p>

<p>The only oddity is the shoulder buttons, and the further two pro inputs which sit alongside them at the top of the controller. The shoulder buttons use different ALPS switches, and while they’re well designed – the shoulder buttons activate across their full length – they feel very different, sitting at odds with every other input on the controller. The additonal S1/S2 inputs here again take some getting used to – this isn’t where most manufacturers put buttons – but once you’ve wrapped your head around using them, it’s fair to say that Nacon have given you an incredibly suite of options to choose from. It’s going to be a select crowd that get the most out of six additional buttons, but for those that want them, they make the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited an incredibly powerful tool.</p>
<p>The number one thing that you come away from a gaming session with the Revolution X Unlimited is that it feels powerful. In turn, that makes you feel like you have the best chance of success. While your own reflexes might let you down, the Revolution X Unlimited feels utterly dependable. It is one of the fastest and slickest controllers I’ve ever used. Speed is absolutely the order of the day, and while you’ve got the option of the limited Bluetooth connection, if you’re playing on PC you’re looking at 2ms latency via wireless, or an insane 1ms of latency when wired. I don’t need to tell you that’s near-instant, and if you’re wanting to be the player who comes first in a head to head showdown, this is the controller to do it.</p>

<p>We’ve not even got to the Revolution X Unlimited’s main party trick: the command screen that sits at the centre of the controller body. This gives you instant access to most of the controller’s customizable aspects, from button mapping through to layout and stick attenuation, as well as allowing audio mixing to the 3.5mm socket from both your gaming platform and your mobile phone. For Xbox players in particular, this is a far more helpful and easily accessible option than using the PC software, though there’s also the choice of the mobile app which you can connect to via Bluetooth. Nacon have basically given you every conceivable tool possible – it is called the ‘Unlimited’ after all – and it’s up to you to decide how you’re going to interact with it, and how you’re going to set it up to suit your playstyle.</p>
<p>You may have already got the sense that I’ve fallen for the Revolution X Unlimited, and that’s undoubtedly true. This is the current pinnacle of controller design, and it’s only potential downside is that it feels a fraction thicker and wider in the hand than some other controllers. At £179.99 it’s a serious investment – that’s a good chunk of the way to buying a whole console – but there’s nothing else that can truly touch it right now, while its only other minor foible is the ten hour battery life, though if you’re using the included charging dock, it’ll rarely bother you.</p>

<p>The Revolution X Unlimited does offer a similar set of features to the excellent<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/"> Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra Pro</a>, my previous top choice for Xbox, but the build quality of the Revolution X Unlimited is comprehensively better. There’s always Microsoft’s own Elite Controller 2, which I love the feel of, but which has had a steady stream of complaints against its reliability since it launched. If you’re looking for something that boasts a number of the different technologies at a less painful price, you’d do well to look at the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">GameSir Cyclone 2</a>. All that said, If you want the best, this is it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ruffy and the Riverside Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157020/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes I'll get asked to review a game that doesn't immediately feel as though it really falls within my wheelhouse. At all. And I have to admit, as much as I do love the look of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside</a>, with its 1980's kids-TV-show-styled characters, replete with visible marker strokes from having been coloured in, I definitely felt(tip) as though we were destined to rub each other the wrong way.</p>
<p>And this, my friends, is what happens when you fall into the trap of judging a you-know by its whats-it, as what's actually here is a delightful 3D platformer in the now classical 'late 90s/early 00s' style. Yes, barring some reasonably light performance hiccups (on both Switch and Switch 2), this one is well worth your time, and doubly so if you happen to be a younger gamer, or a wretched old has-been (moi) who just wants to feel the joy of millennium-era gaming one last time. It's a first try from Zockrates Laboratories as well, so hats off to the developers.</p>
<figure><a title="Ruffy and the Riverside Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157029/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You see, Ruffy and the Riverside has got a very clever trick up its sleeve. Rather than just being a simple tribute to the knock-off 3D platformers us oldies were blasted with in the wake of the success of that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">3D Mario</a> fella and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">Crash Bandicoot</a> (if I start naming more mascots, we're gonna be here all day), and instead of copying and pasting (relevant!) their homework, Ruffy brings the ability to transform his environs by...wait for it...copying and pasting textures, such as water or sand, over one another to solve puzzles, traverse environs and save the day. Hooray for Ruffy!</p>
<p>As it turns out, an evil alien cube of sorts called Groll has appeared and stolen a bunch of very powerful marbles that you'll need to get back because they've made him right bonkers. As Ruffy, and with the help of his genuinely fun bee assistant Pip, you'll also need to collect a bunch of letters from the big 'RIVERSIDE' billboard above the game's colourful hub town that your new idiot nemesis has just blown up. So, Ruffy, you are now the chosen one. God save us all.</p>
<p>Ruffy, for as harmless as he looks, can really get about. He's got a stamina gauge which goes down slowly and fills up really fast, so he can run like the wind across the game's hugely nostalgic 3D world without stopping for much of a break. He can climb up anything, so long as you've pasted some vines there, and his default jump (with a slick bee-assisted hover) allows you to clamber around rooftops and examine every nook and cranny of what is, and especially from a small team on its first game, a very impressive world to examine.</p>
<figure><a title="Ruffy and the Riverside Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157022/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, I'm not sure if the draw distance, which is quite poor sometimes in how its fog instantly envelops and regurgitates entire environs in the background as you move around, is completely because of performance limitations, or if it's been done for effect. That's how on point most of the rest of this game is, you see, that it's got me doubting that it's just been allowed to be this way - but regardless, it's a happy coincidence that it's one of my favourite things about the look of the adventure.</p>
<p>It really does give the whole thing the feel of one of those rather janky, barely held together sorts of 3D romps we all played a ton of decades ago. Except this one is good on pretty much all fronts. As you move around Riverside you can even see joins in the scenery at times, thin black lines on the horizon, and the meeting points of polygons, all that sort of thing. I love it. And I'm just gonna go ahead and assume they did it for the immaculate vibes.</p>
<p>So you've got this rather large main area of game world to explore, with a few large towns full of amusing NPCs - there's a decent amount of snark and silliness in the writing for older gamers - and then the game opens up to incorporate several portals that you need to travel through in order to find those pesky letters. There's an impressive amount of variety in these zones, some of which are surprisingly large, although there's nothing entirely surprising in the environmental changes from the usual lava to ice, forests, deserts and so on. Even so, unlocking the next one and not knowing what it's gonna be is my favourite part!</p>
<figure><a title="Ruffy and the Riverside Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157021/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving through these areas, the thing that impresses time and time again is just how well-implemented the copy and paste conceit is. It's just so much fun to mess with, and although it doesn't give you fully free reign - there are some rules to it all - it's still very flexible and, most importantly, something I hadn't tired of by the end of my eight hours with the game.</p>
<p>Combining the fun of these powers with Ruffy's spinning, crate-smashing, Crash-styled spin attacks, and his boundless energy as he moves around levels (or races through the game's haybale racing mini games), and you've got something that just feels great to play. Yes, sometimes it can be a little finicky to aim at small textures you want to change - and it's a shame we don't have gyro for fine-tuning here - but overall it just works!</p>
<p>Even more impressive than this though, and my absolute favourite thing about what Zockrates has given us, is just how densely packed the areas are with puzzles, references to old games, and things to do and collect. There are several categories of collectible to get busy hoovering up, and a decent mix of puzzle types, some of which younger gamers may need a little hand with from time to time. Indeed, and I'm not too proud to admit it, I was stumped a few times in this one before realising, for example, just what was needed to be done to defeat a particular shark in a pool (turn him into iron so he sinks, there's a free tip).</p>
<figure><a title="Ruffy and the Riverside Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157024/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I love how they've stolen the 2D sections from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> wholesale, too. It's a bit cheeky, fair enough, and although they perhaps don't work out or play quite as slickly as Nintendo's efforts (understandably, perhaps), it's just fun to see the influences being so proudly trumpeted at times. Everywhere you look in Ruffy and the Riverside, there's something to do...several things to do, in fact, and that's exactly how it should be to keep younger players entertained.</p>
<p>Now, negative stuff. On Switch 1, the framerate struggles at times, mostly when the game transitions into new areas on-the-fly. Moving seamlessly across the world comes at a cost, it seems. It's a shame, and although they've not spoiled my enjoyment much, they are there and it'd be really nice to have a patch to sort this (and to add the old gyro).</p>
<p>For Switch 2 players, the performance issues present on Switch 1 do carry over to the newer console, and swapping between the two (bad puns flying out of me today), there's very little difference other than perhaps a slight improvement in loading times.</p>
<figure><a title="Ruffy and the Riverside Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157027/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Enemies, too, are poorly designed. There aren't a whole lot of them, thankfully, and I'd suggest that the puzzles, rather than bashing foes, are the main point here, so again it's not really affected the fun I've had. So, if you're into the vibe thus far, just be aware that smashing stuff and doing puzzles, racing around on hay bales and swapping out water for lava to see what happens, or opening doors by pasting flames onto candles, is where the fun is at.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ruffy and the Riverside is an enjoyable return to the colourful 3D platforming romps of the late 1990s, and it's one that brings its own clever idea to the table, rather than just simply copy/pasting everyone else's homework. With nods to <strong>Mario</strong>, <strong>Zelda</strong>, <strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> and more, levels jam-packed full of fun puzzles and the easy, breezy nature of Ruffy's copy-pasting abilities at the heart of it all, this is one of the better odes to this sort of caper that I've played and, performance issues aside, a very impressive debut to boot.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, Atomic Heart developer Mundfish unveiled several games, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sequel to AH</a>, an online multiplayer spin-off (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cube</a>), and a survival horror game they will publish (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ill-is-an-intriguing-survival-horror-published-by-atomic-heart-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ILL</a>).</p>
<p>As you might recall, we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-final-q-fsr-2-confirmed-old-consoles-will-be-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Mundfish often ahead of the launch of Atomic Heart. Now that the studio's new phase has begun, we reached out once again to the Founder, CEO, and Game Director, Robert Bagratuni, to learn more about all these projects. We're starting today with Atomic Heart 2, arguably the most anticipated one, given that it's the sequel to a highly successful title that <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-has-reached-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> over 10 million players.</p>
<p>The good news is that it's clear the scope and the ambition are much higher. The bad news is that we won't get to play it for a rather long while, although that's not too surprising given that the first installment only launched two years ago. Anyway, keep scrolling below to read the full Q&amp;A.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Everything in the trailer was captured in-engine using Unreal Engine 5, and it features a mix of gameplay footage and in-game cinematics. As we’re not diving deep into detailed gameplay breakdowns yet, what’s shown is only a small glimpse, but it’s enough to hint at some of the key directions we’re taking.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Hello, Robert. Can you tell us when Atomic Heart 2 takes place exactly in the timeline? Can you share which ending of the original will be followed canonically?</strong></p>
<p>Atomic Heart 2 takes place a few years after the conclusion of the first game, picking up the thread following the fallout and DLCs, but in a fresh chapter of the story. The sequel follows the aftermath of the original’s multiple endings, including the upcoming fourth DLC, which will bring more clarity to that matter. We are staying true to the beautiful dystopian world of science and technology, but expanding into broader retro‑futuristic environments across the globe, with a world shaped by previous upheavals and consequences of the first game’s events.</p>
<p><strong>Some users have noticed a more Western vibe from the trailer. Will that be reflected in the actual game? If so, can you expand on this?</strong></p>
<p>We’re definitely not abandoning the art direction and atmosphere that players loved in the first game. The retro-futuristic, dystopian world of Atomic Heart is still very much intact, and music remains a powerful part of how we express it.</p>
<p>Choosing Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now for the announcement trailer wasn’t about changing direction, but about expanding the emotional range of the universe. Actually, that very track was released at the end of ‘70s in USSR on vinyl, as “КВИН – Не останавливай меня”. It’s exactly the kind of cultural crossover that fits into the Radio of the Future we’ve built, familiar yet reimagined through the lens of our world. And just like in the first game, there will be many tracks, many moods, and a mix of regional classics and global icons. If you remember how “Komarovo” and “Trava u doma” became iconic moments in Atomic Heart, rest assured, that spirit is alive and well in the sequel.</p>
<p><strong>How much of the trailer was gameplay and how much of it was cinematics?</strong></p>
<p>Everything in the trailer was captured in-engine using Unreal Engine 5, and it features a mix of gameplay footage and in-game cinematics. As we’re not diving deep into detailed gameplay breakdowns yet, what’s shown is only a small glimpse, but it’s enough to hint at some of the key directions we’re taking.</p>
<p>We’re focused on evolving the combat system with more variety, especially through the use of the glove’s abilities, intense encounters with enemies, and, of course, boss fights. You can see a bit more gameplay in the extended showcase we recently published on our official YouTube channel. As for the cinematics, we wanted to introduce some of the new characters players will meet, not all of whom will be clearly good or evil, and to show that the world itself is becoming more layered and diverse.</p>
<p><strong>Will Atomic Heart 2 include any multiplayer elements, or will those be reserved for The CUBE?</strong></p>
<p>While Atomic Heart 2 focuses on a personal journey, The CUBE opens the door to a much broader, shared experience within the same retro-futuristic dystopia. The CUBE is a narrative spin-off, but not a side project. It’s a massive MMO RPG shooter that takes place after the events of Atomic Heart 1. It expands the universe both narratively and structurally. The Cube itself, as a literal, mysterious megastructure, is a key part of the lore. It's a fully integrated piece of the timeline, not just a multiplayer layer. Players will explore this shifting world, uncover its secrets, and interact with systems and consequences born directly out of the Atomic Heart games.</p>
<p><strong>Is P-3 coming back? Will there be any other playable characters in AH2?</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve watched the trailer closely, you may have spotted P-3 and some other familiar faces - so, yes, some key characters from the first part will return in Atomic Heart 2. That includes characters who survived the events of the original game and its DLCs. As for P-3 specifically… let’s just say his story isn’t over. But we’re not ready to reveal exactly how or in what capacity just yet. We’re not discussing playable characters in detail right now, but the story absolutely will continue threads that fans of the first game will recognize, while also opening new doors and perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>The game world of this sequel seems much larger, as evidenced by the presence of vehicles and new traversal options. Can it be considered an open world? Will it feature dynamic day/time, weather, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>Great question! This is something we’ve thought about a lot, especially after seeing players’ desire to explore the world in the first Atomic Heart. For example, we had this incredible flying city of Chelomey, which players were able to explore only once (not considering another opportunity in the DLC#3). We're paying close attention to all the feedback, so we know that the open world experience in AH1 wasn't perfect. And with Atomic Heart 2, we want to improve this significantly.</p>
<p>The game is much more open in structure. We’re building larger, interconnected spaces that offer more freedom in how you explore, revisit, and engage with different systems - vehicles, traversal tools, and new verticality are all part of that. There’s a core narrative path, but also a lot of space for discovery and replayability. We’re not ready to reveal all the environmental systems yet, but expect more dynamic elements like time of day and weather to play a role in shaping both mood and gameplay. That said, everything is still grounded in story and world logic - the scale is there to serve immersion, not overwhelm it.</p>

<p><strong>You mentioned that AH2 will introduce an 'expanded RPG system' featuring a 'living world' and 'various activities'. Can you provide more information on all these aspects?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we’re introducing a more expanded RPG layer in Atomic Heart 2, but we’re doing it the Mundfish way - integrated into the world and the experience, not layered on top just for complexity’s sake. The “living world” means that we want the world to feel less like a backdrop and more like a responsive, evolving system. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves - we will share more information when we are ready.</p>
<p>As for the RPG elements - we are aiming for deeper weapon customization, skill trees, and progression paths that allow players to shape their playstyle much more than before.<br>
When we talk about “various activities,” we mean things that reward curiosity: things to do between the main missions. But always in service of the core experience - we’re not turning it into a checklist-style open-world game. Everything still has that handcrafted, surreal tone fans expect.</p>
<p><strong>Will players make several choices leading to profound consequences for the various missions and the narrative? Are there companions in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Without giving too much away, we can say that Atomic Heart 2 will offer players more agency than before. Choices do matter, and your actions can influence how certain events or missions unfold. As for companions… that’s a tricky one to answer without spoilers. Let’s just say: you won’t be entirely alone.</p>

<p><strong>You also briefly mentioned improvements to the combat system. What can we expect on that front?</strong></p>
<p>Combat was one of the aspects that players really connected with in Atomic Heart - the weight, the variety, the creative freedom in how you approached each fight. That positive feedback meant a lot to us, and it set a high bar for the sequel. With Atomic Heart 2, we want to go even further. To make sure we do it right, we’re starting internal playtesting much earlier this time around. Whether it’s moment-to-moment gunplay, skills usage, or how enemies react, our goal is to make every fight feel better, deeper, and more satisfying than before.</p>
<p><strong>What's the current state of the game? Prototype, Pre-Alpha? How long will it be until we can see more?</strong></p>
<p>The game is in active development and well past the prototype stage. We're a few years out from release, and taking the time to ensure everything feels tighter, polished, and more immersive. More updates will come as we hit key milestones.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Players are already impressed by the incredibly fast loading times in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, which only proves the power of the PS5 console, as well as Guerrilla Games' Decima game engine used by Kojima Productions.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's release tomorrow, players with advanced access are already sharing their thoughts.</p>
<p>One player posted a video to reddit, stating "Death Stranding 2 has the fastest loading time I've ever seen in a video game". The video itself shows the game impressively loading from menu to gameplay in a split second.</p>

<p>When the PS5 launched, Sony touted the fast loading of the console's SSD as a major selling point. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart - though it released months after launch - was seen as a key example of this technology. What's more, the Decima Engine was created by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> studio Guerrilla Games and used for its games since PS4 release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-shadow-fall">Killzone: Shadow Fall</a>, yielding impressive results.</p>
<p>Yet Kojima Productions has clearly worked some magic with Death Stranding 2 - its load times really are astonishing. Take a look for yourself:</p>

</span></p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-death-stranding-2-tech-review">Digital Foundry gave its tech verdict on Death Stranding 2</a> earlier this week and was particularly impressed by the Decima Engine's ability to create "truly outstanding dynamic landscapes", as well as its lighting, weather, and other environmental effects.</p>
<p>"The first key improvement here stems from fine detail, with rock formations, vegetation and other natural elements holding up under closer scrutiny," wrote John Linneman. "The game opens in a gorgeous mountain range with a level of detail reminiscent of Epic's Nanite virtualised geometry demos, without relying on such tech."</p>
<p>If you're playing on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in particular, Linneman recommends opting for the 60fps performance mode as on Sony's more powerful console, quality and performance modes are so similar in terms of image quality.</p>
<p>"Thankfully, both versions also feature lightning-fast loading times with virtually zero waiting," said Linneman. "Moving from the load screen to a save game is nearly instant and you basically never actually encounter anything resembling a loading screen during the game - it's seamless."</p>
<p>There's one particular sequence I was able to play when I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">previewed the game in May</a>, which was breathtaking in its use of lighting and particles. But I won't spoil it here.</p>
<p>In short, Death Stranding 2 is an exceptional technical achievement that truly shows the power of Sony's PS5 consoles, as well as the Decima game engine.</p>

            <p>Following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">the announcement</a> earlier this week that Riot-backed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has been cancelled, a former Hypixel Studios dev has claimed that internal friction and "mismanagement" at the studio are to blame.</p>
<p>Hytale had been in development for a decade when Hypixel co-founder Noxy revealed that it'd been canned in a website post on June 23, also revealing that the studio will be closing in a few months' time. The game's release had been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-launching-until-2023-at-the-earliest">pushed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-devs-are-redeveloping-its-engine-say-no-release-in-2023">back</a> a number of times since 2020.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Following that news, former security and IT lead at Hypixel DevSlashNull has claimed in a tweet (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-issues-were-all-internal-former-hytale-dev-says-the-minecraft-inspired-survival-rpgs-cancelation-has-nothing-to-do-with-riot-the-community-should-be-angry-at-the-mismanagement/">GamesRadar</a>) that internal "mismanagement" at the studio, specifically friction among its leadership, was to blame Hytale's fate.</p>
<p>"Hytale: what could possibly go wrong when you hire new leadership that thinks the original team is incompetent?" he wrote. "Oh the whole project ends up going in circles until it dies. The community should be angry at the mismanagement that stole the opportunity for Hytale to flourish."</p>
<p>DevSlashNull went on to paint a positive picture of publisher Riot, adding that they were "an absolute pleasure to work with, from people to leaders" and "understood the power of empowering and giving folks agency", while making clear that in his estimation "the issues were all internal to Hytale's leadership".</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>We've reached out to Hypixel Studios and Riot for comment.</p>
<p>While it didn't trace the problems back to studio leadership, Noxy's post announcing the cancellation did acknowledge that the game was deep in a cycle of feature creep by the time Riot opted to pull funding.</p>
<p>Asked by a fan whether the team ever had a version of Hytale running prior to the game's 2022 engine overhaul that "would have satisfied players if it would have been released", DevSlashNull responded: "I think so, some of the best moments for me in the team was us playtesting and running pvp tournaments internally on that engine. It was fun and had tons of potential."</p>
<p>Even if there's still a prototype worth building on here, however, the dev doesn't think the game or the work that went into it have much chance of being resurrected by Riot, as "the team that had the original vision and values had all left or been let go yesterday".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-hytale-dev-claims-internal-mismanagement-at-hypixel-stole-the-opportunity-for-hytale-to-flourish]]></content:encoded>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-owned-company-worked-on-death-stranding-2/">VGC</a>, the company can be spotted in the credits for the game and specifically helped out on motion capture. While this might come as a bit of a surprise, it's important to note that Nintendo Pictures had also worked on the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a> in a similar capacity, though this was before its acquisition when it was still called Dynamo Pictures.</p><p><figure data-videoid="MjdXHwRDqMw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjdXHwRDqMw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3948b1ignpxl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjdXHwRDqMw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Still, with Nintendo Pictures now wholly owned by Nintendo, it's interesting that it still has the freedom to work on titles outside the general Nintendo ecosystem. Since its acquisiton, the company has pretty much only worked on Switch titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros.

<p>Outside of gaming, however, Nintendo Pictures has also lent its expertise to anime such as <strong>You and Idol Pretty Cure</strong> and <strong>Wonderful PreCure!</strong> from Toei Animation.</p>
<p>The company itself has been around since around 2011 as an independent entity, though it commenced operations much sooner than that. Its acquisition by Nintendo came in 2022 after Dynamo Pictures proved its worth with a selection of delightful Pikmin Shorts distributed on the 3DS and Wii U eShops.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-could-cause-many-consoles-to-die-in-a-couple-of-years-as-more-users-are-reporting-problems-over-time.1227786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The previously reported PlayStation 5 liquid metal issues are becoming increasingly widespread, and many units, especially launch units, that are out of warranty, could die in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Speaking on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Law Is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassells highlighted how the system's<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/"> critical flaw</a> is causing the liquid metal used for cooling to drip down the bottom of the console when placed vertically, causing dry spots on the APU that compromise its functionality and forces a shutdown under certain conditions, is getting more widespread. A while back, the developer received reports that the latest update of their game, the dinosaur-themed MMO Path of Titans, was causing PlayStation 5 consoles to power off suddenly. Initially, the developer provided the usual basic troubleshooting advice, like cleaning the console, but the issue persisted. After pinning the related discussion thread on the developer's Discord server, more people showed up reporting the problem, and after Alderon Games pinned a more general message asking players to report if their PlayStation 5 systems were suddenly shutting down while playing any game, a lot more users showed up with their reports. Some members of the team also experienced similar issues and are now investigating what could be the cause. Everything seems to point to the liquid metal issue, which is more likely to manifest with the console placed vertically.</p>
<p>After talking with Sony about this issue, Alderon Games discovered that the more intensive the game gets, the higher the chances are of a PlayStation 5 shutting down due to the liquid metal issues. With the latest update to Path of Titans, the percentage of players affected by the issue rose to 2%, 3%, which may not sound like a lot, but it's still a lot of units. However, better pinpointing what is causing affected systems to shut down is difficult, according to the Alderon Games founder, as it seems to depend on the combination of where the dry spot is and what component of the APU is stressed the most. As there's no way to track CPU and GPU temperature via software, troubleshooting is extremely difficult, and any fix on the developer's part, such as limiting framerate to avoid putting any of the system's components under stress, could end up impacting those with fully working systems for no reason.</p>
<p>Thankfully, not all PlayStation 5 systems are affected the same way by this design flaw. Sony attempted to fix it in the slim revision and the PS5 Pro by adding ridges to the APU and heatsink to prevent the liquid metal from dripping to the bottom of the console, but it's too early to say if this actually fixed the issue. Older models are more at risk, and with most of them now being out of warranty, repairing them could be a costly endeavor. Talking with Sony about the issue, Matthew Cassells suggested setting up a free repair program for systems affected by the issue, but this may not be feasible, considering how many systems are affected. The situation may not be as bad as with the many Xbox 360 consoles that failed with the infamous RRoD, but it is still bad enough that the Alderon Games founder believes that a lot of systems will die in the next couple of years.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Flaw Could Affect Millions, AMD Zen 6 Nears 7GHz, Switch 2 | Alderon Games | Broken Silicon 315" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KjR1uk9LI9c?start=600&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Having used my launch PlayStation 5 not a whole lot, I can't say I have experienced the liquid metal issues that many are experiencing, but if more and more users are indeed affected by them, Sony will eventually have to address them in some manner. Hopefully, the company will indeed follow Alderon Games' founder's advice and set up a free repair program that would definitely make a lot of customers happy.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-is-bigger-and-more-ambitious-%E2%80%94-and-that-includes-its-music.1227783/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> is an expansive, captivating sequel filled with huge environments to explore and a big story from Hideo Kojima to try and wrap your head around. But one of my favorite additions is a small one: an in-game music player that basically functions as your own iPod.</p><p>Woodkid, a co-composer on the game (and whose real name is Yoann Lemoine), tells <em>The Verge</em> that the music player was important to Kojima because it’s “the way Hideo is in everyday life… He plays songs all the time.” (And posts about songs on <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1935113750060876188">social media, too</a>.) “I think he wanted the players to be able to have the same experience,” Woodkid says.</p><p>Music was a big part of the original game. Some of my favorite moments from the first <em>Death Stranding</em> took place when songs from artists like Low Roar, Silent Poets, and Woodkid kicked in while exploring the game’s world. That still happens a lot in <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, and it’s just as effective at setting a mood. But with the personal music player, accessible right from the pause menu, you can create your own vibe as you’re traversing the game’s expansive environments.</p><div><p><cite>Image: PlayStation / Kojima Productions</cite></p></div><p>Woodkid worked with Kojima for three years to make music for <em>DS2</em>. In the game, his music can morph and change based on the player’s actions. In the opening moments, for example, Sam has to cross some treacherous mountain terrain to return to his shelter with Lou while Woodkid’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHcJepz3QW0">“Minus Sixty One”</a> plays in the background. </p><p>As highlighted by Kojima in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gOV2Rx-ncxM?feature=shared&amp;t=2429">a recent livestream</a>, when you run, you’ll hear drums in the song, and when you stop, they’ll stop. If you take a certain route, piano will kick in as other elements fade out. The whole sequence has a bunch of elements like that. Woodkid tells me he had to reverse engineer the song as part of what was needed to make everything work behind the scenes, and when he plays the sequence, he still gets surprised by what the engine is doing.</p><p>To help write the music for <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, Woodkid digested the big themes of the game, which he says are intimacy, fatherhood, grief, escapism, a “very aggressive sense of political violence” about the eco-anxiety of the world, and the concept of connection and how it’s positive and negative in the time of social networks. He then tried to inject those ideas into the songs.</p><p>That all manifests in a wide variety of musical styles in Woodkid’s music for <em>Death Stranding 2</em>. The game’s main theme, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt9ahi3oWlk">“To the Wilder,”</a> is slow, haunting, and beautiful, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAML03NpxVk">“Tmrrw,”</a> which plays at a pivotal cutscene featuring the character named Tomorrow (played by Elle Fanning), has a much harder, industrial edge. Songs from artists like Gen Hoshino and Caroline Polachek show up, too. Ludvig Forssell, who composed music for <em>Death Stranding</em> and <em>Metal Gear Solid V</em>, is <a href="https://x.com/Ludvig_Forssell/status/1752826759354155052?lang=en">a composer</a> for <em>DS2</em> as well.</p><p>I think the breadth of musical styles is good, maybe almost necessary. <em>Death Stranding 2</em> still has a lot of long journeys from one place to another, so like a great song on a real-life road trip, the right track at the right time can make a dull drive much more memorable.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/691316/death-stranding-2-woodkid-kojima-music-player]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this month, Walt Disney Pictures became one of the first major studios to launch a lawsuit against a leading AI company. Disney and Comcast are both going after Midjourney in court over alleged misappropriation of the studios' respective copyrighted materials. However, there's now a report that Disney is negotiating a potential partnership with OpenAI.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-22/inside-disney-s-campaign-to-protect-darth-vader-from-ai?srnd=homepage-europe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Disney "isn't interested in licensing its full library to anyone," but it is following in the footsteps of YouTube, The Atlantic, and Vox Media regarding a possible deal with OpenAI. The report also notes that Disney approached the other major studios and streamers about joining the lawsuit against Midjourney, which is a considerably smaller company than OpenAI. But Comcast was reportedly the only studio to accept the offer because the others had "different priorities." Regardless, Disney has hinted that the Midjourney case may be just the beginning for the company's legal fight over AI.</p><p>"[The lawsuit] is part of a campaign to protect our intellectual property rights in the world of generative AI," explained Disney lawyer Horacio Gutierrez while speaking with Bloomberg. "This is our first case, but it likely won’t be the last."</p><p>Disney hasn't been entirely opposed to AI in the recent past. The studio recently lent out an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI-powered Darth Vader to Fortnite</a> that recreated the voice of the late actor James Earl Jones. AI remains one of the prevailing topics in the world of gaming as well. Frontier Development recently faced a backlash over generative AI in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3/" data-ref-id="5000-629003">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>, which led the company to reverse course <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-will-no-longer-use-generative-ai-following-backlash/1100-6532675/" data-ref-id="1100-6532675">and remove it from the game</a>. Meanwhile, Nintendo veteran Masahiro Sakurai suggested that AAA video game development is becoming unsustainable, and predicts that AI may be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">help companies work more efficiently</a>.</p>

                <p>Fashion shows typically feature a runway of interesting--but unwearable for the general masses--art, but it looks like video game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-alters/">The Alters</a> is ready to invade that space. Hot off the game's release earlier this month, 11 bit studios and ZA/UM Atelier have announced that a limited collection of apparel inspired by the sci-fi survival game will be featured during Paris Fashion Week. Best of all, this clothing is now available to preorder.</p><p>Fans of the game can pick up three items: <a href="https://evolve-pr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/25Rmh9ifSgtfKzNsXApXXWiG9TrmI0me1cZnS0bjLJw935DqjlwFtWO5ku9C29kNXmvKdjmA_u8gqapA-lB62CdoV4hfPYifBA9lXDI2qt2NjQjPeuj8o4-esfmhMseawpu7b_dQBzfSr3GYwb3zunBP5GVStl3Ll1DY9i9VZsuHTPTCOuRnbHWQiRygnVwLx70aXemV1u1HZJ2pDvveR6uxg3hW2aPgYAOhfiQ" rel="nofollow ">Jan Dolski's mission jacket</a>, <a href="https://evolve-pr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2bv9pXq28jtTdoKU5B8koHx_ueMOTNQJjCMr27IZCNBmS5DqjlwGPhrjjaIpGlMbaPOmAZY5z_ufhfIQQskObvtZaj0KT2HU-_1oyyoJd4wIkkW4hOoBaJsKybXyYpbCCaTQRsjs83mpL7pXw7K19oJHxFVlNAS5DBHWbhhjXw0PxRBF6PjWVU54itoxbzC7E0lS5mJvKLHRrKw9bgVsNMnLlRQxqLG7mV708DVx8PIVW" rel="nofollow ">utility pants</a>, and the <a href="https://evolve-pr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2O5qkPyUhNjj-07H3p1KgLLoljdu4mlC86Ukncs0p7HCX5DqjlwHij-Jow3SHiz7-FdpYKcfu1z6NcVCeXLEDUGDALmeuqYKTgMTuaVGFsbQivLl4x8QjuBYfw5ex2AyCsM-Q9O86ENB8HjvgBvtLVxRqKBXN0Q7gY-zi4qBr5T_eclYlb88lp8Fu-gtAyMkJ6-6GJki3OdlJn0Y5Njtu-g" rel="nofollow ">Dolly Baa-Baag</a>. These all feature the aesthetics of the clothing worn by Dolski in the game, as they combine a loose fit with reflective decals, and vibrant colors--exactly the kind of clothing you want to wear while racing against the clock to stop yourself from getting a lethal dose of solar radiation while stranded on an inhospitable alien rock. The Dolly Baa-Baag is also quite cute, as it references the silent sidekick from the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521299-tracksuit_whole2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521299" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521299-tracksuit_whole2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521299"></a><figcaption>Look good and have an instant cosplay with this look.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521299-tracksuit_whole2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521300-dollybaa-baag.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521301-dollybaa-baag_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521302-missionjacket.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521303-missionjacket_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521304-missionutilitypants.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521305-tracksuit_whole.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521300,1300-4521301,1300-4521302,1300-4521303,1300-4521304,1300-4521305" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521300-dollybaa-baag.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521301-dollybaa-baag_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521302-missionjacket.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521303-missionjacket_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521304-missionutilitypants.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521305-tracksuit_whole.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521300-dollybaa-baag.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521301-dollybaa-baag_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521302-missionjacket.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521303-missionjacket_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521304-missionutilitypants.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521305-tracksuit_whole.jpg"></figure><p>The clothing is available to purchase through the ZA/UM Atelier store, but the catch here is that it's <em>quite </em>expensive. The mission jacket costs around $460, the utility pants are $230, and the bag is almost $200.</p><p>"The Alters is a game about who we are, and who we might've been. The way we present ourselves to the world--through clothing, expression, or even the smallest personal details--is deeply tied to the lives we live and the choices we make,” said The Alters game director Tomasz Kisilewicz in a press statement. "This collaboration with ZA/UM Atelier felt like a natural extension of that philosophy--an embodiment of identity through design. We can’t wait to see how our community responds to this fusion."</p><p>The Alters is now out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Reviewer Alessandro Barbosa <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-alters-review-seeing-double/1900-6418373/">gave the game an 8/10 score</a>, noting that The Alters "is an engrossing survival adventure" that delicately nails the balance between self-reflection and base-management gameplay.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Game Release Window Update</p>
      </div>
<p>When reaching out to The Chinese Room's parent company Sumo Digital about the cuts, Game Developer also discovered that a number of employees have been cut from Sumo's communications team. Sumo Digital announced it would be restructuring earlier this year, as part of a plan to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sumo-group-ditching-original-franchises-to-focus-exclusively-on-co-development-work" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pivot away from original projects</a> entirely to focus on co-development work. Sumo also cut 15% of its total global workforce in an earlier round of layoffs this time last year.</p><p>The Chinese Room are currently in the final stages of work on long-awaited sequel Bloodlines 2, which has been delayed and interrupted multiple times now. Most recently the game's release window was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-october/1100-6530367/" data-ref-id="1100-6530367">delayed to October</a>, with the game's executive producer saying the game was already finished, but in need of more work to fix bugs and improve stability.</p><p>The Chinese Room took over development of the title in 2021, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-lead-developers-replaced/1100-6487923/" data-ref-id="1100-6487923">Paradox reassigned the game</a> from its original developer Hardsuit Labs, and insiders say the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-canceled-after-its-last-delay/1100-6497078/" data-ref-id="1100-6497078">almost didn't survive</a> the transition between studios.</p><p>Despite layoffs at The Chinese Room, Bloodlines 2 will still release as planned, a Paradox spokesperson has said in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release," the statement said. "We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like in the first entry in the series, there's a very good reason why killing people in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is not a very smart idea. Following the cataclysmic event known as the Death Stranding, the spirits of the dead have started roaming the world of the living, manifesting themselves as Beached Things, or BTs for short. Every time one of these beings manages to consume a human, a massive explosion that annihilates everything in its vicinity, called a voidout, occurs.</p>
<p>As such, the game makes it abundantly clear right from the onset how going for non-lethal options when dealing with human enemies like MULEs is the way to go to be able to defend oneself without having to deal with the terrible consequences of a voidout. However, if you really want to, there's a way to unlock some lethal weapon options as soon as Sam's new adventure begins in Mexico.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250625114400-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Every weapon in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach with an MP designation can be turned into a lethal weapon from the weapon wheel menu</strong>. Hold the right direction button to bring up the menu, select an MP weapon on the main weapons tab, and<strong> press and hold the right and left triggers as well as the O button</strong>. As soon as you do, you will see a little animation play out in the circle surrounding the weapon, and once the animation has played out, the weapon will have turned lethal and can be used to kill human enemies. This little trick is revealed in-game for the first time after delivering to the pizza chief a few hours in, but you don't have to wait to complete this delivery, as the option of turning most weapons lethal is active right from the start of the game. Do note, however, that not every weapon can be used to kill enemies, as weapons that are specified to use rubber bullets or tranquillizer rounds cannot be rendered lethal, no matter what.</p>

            <p>I'm sure Supermassive are going to do a perfectly respectable job with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. But, when there's two games coming out, one of which looks like a pitch-perfect spiritual sequel by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>' creators in the form of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reanimals">Reaminal</a>, and the other is an <em>eh</em>-looking numbered affair by a different, talented but wildly inconsistent studio, it's hard not to pick favourites. Nonetheless, Little Nightmares 3 is out on October 10th. Here's a trailer. It's too bright. Grumble.</p>

<p>Also on the same date is an enhanced edition of the original Little Nightmares (RTX, 60 FPS, 4K). In the most galaxy brained bit of publisher grasping I've encountered in some time, the actual game is fully playable right now, but only if you pre-order Little Nightmares 3. Otherwise, you can wait until October with the rest of the joyless cynics who don't want to learn about games exclusively from the people trying to sell them, before making a purchase. What are they like, eh?</p>
<p>Little Nightmares 3 itself features full co-op, although you can play solo with an AI companion. Adam Smith (RPS in peace) and Alice Bell (RPS in <a href="https://www.bookbeat.com/ro/book/the-grapples-of-wrath-1654023">new book out next year)</a> both enjoyed the previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmares-review-pc">two</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmares-2-review">games</a> for their "extraordinary views and grubby little rooms" (Adam) and "childhood authority figures stretched and pulled to grotesque extremes like chewing gum" (Alice).</p>
<p>Dedicated Nightheads may want to watch the entirety of <a href="https://youtu.be/oa85Ns7uegc">this week's series showcase</a>, which also included announcements for a new season of podcast The Sounds of Nightmares, a comic book named Descent To Nowhere in October, and "young adult novel" Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones out in September.</p>
<p>Here's a<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmare-studios-reanimal-is-a-creepy-co-op-adventure-inspired-by-wind-waker-and-silent-hill-2"> hands-off preview with Tarsier's (Little Nightmares I&amp;II) Reanimal</a>, which is inspired by both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, according to narrative director David Mervik.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-little-nightmares-3-is-out-this-october-reanimal-still-looks-much-better]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The bald man always hungers for more folks to drown in toilet water, so IO Interactive have kept feeding their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a> a steady stream of post-launch targets with each entry in the World of Assassination trilogy. It sounds the devs'll be taking a similar approach with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, albeit with some Bondy twists.</p>
<p>The question is, would such regular updates scratch the itch of folks who're in it for the long haul as effectively as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jean-claude-van-damme-is-coming-to-hitman-this-week-as-a-double-crossing-ica-agent-and-its-free-to-play-for-a-month">elusive targets</a> Agent 47's been taking out on a regular basis?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>IO boss Hakan Abrak teased this being one of the "learnings from World of Assassination" that the studio may be applying to Bond in a chat with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-hitman-absolutions-wasteful-toilets">The Game Business</a>. </p>
<p>"We obviously have tons of experience now from World of Assassination, and tons of experience on how to extend a single-player experience by giving desirable free content to players," Abrak said when asked whether First Light will follow the post-launch plan the past three Hitman games have ridden to long-term success.</p>
<p>He was keen not to get into too much detail, emphasising that IO are focused on nailing what the game has to offer at launch first, but did go on to say the following:</p>
<blockquote>With Bond, we have really upped our stealth, we have really evolved the action aspects of our technology and features. Seamless combat, coming in and out of range and melee… For Hitman, it was interlocked animations, here it is freeform. We have [players] driving different exotic cars. That gives us more challenges to play with. In Hitman, you have these live challenges. And besides the things that we are able to do in Hitman, we can do more actiony things and more kinetic challenges in Bond.</blockquote>
<p>While a lot of that is just Abrak oulining <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">the differences between how Bond and Hitman will play</a> that IO have been chatting about since the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">revealed</a>, it's the last bit that's got my attention. Hitman's elusive targets are all generally slightly different twists on the 'go somewhere, prep to kill someone, kill someone, get out' formula that the games have refined into a lethal art, with twists like no saving or restarting to spice up the challenge.</p>
<p>With Bond looking like it's much less intensely focused on just eliminating certain people, I'll be keen to see how expansive the extra challenges it offers are. I can see the likes of car chases or more straight-up shootouts being part of the equation, much like they are in the base game. Will we get longer missions that chain a number of these elements together as post-launch extras, will IO opt to just add them as individual challenges so it can drop new stuff more often, or a mix of both?</p>
<p>I'd prefer the former, but it might not be as efficient development-wise as the elusive targets have proven to be - something Abrak notes IO are so keen on that they've stopped making as many new toilets in their games. Plus, we'll have to see if the Bond formula, with its glitzy Hollywood sheen in contrast to Hitman's darkly hilarious murder experimentation, lends itself as well to keeping a game feeling fresh once that initial surge of interest runs its course.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-sounds-like-itll-be-getting-hitman-style-post-launch-missions-but-with-more-actiony-things]]></content:encoded>
