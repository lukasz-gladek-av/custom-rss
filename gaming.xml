            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trucker">Star Trucker</a>, Raw Fury's answer to what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2%3EEuro%20Truck%20Simulator">Euro Truck Simulator</a> might look like in the year 3000, is now a year old, and has celebrated that fact with an update that finally lets you whip out your wheel and pedals.</p>
<p>Ever since I gave it a go with a controller prior to letting my Game Pass subscription crumble into dust, this is a day I've yearned for. After all, what good are truck sims, be they Euro, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American</a> or something more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">Snowrunner</a>y, if you're not operating the controls of your great metal haulage beast by flicking flappy gearbox paddles, or sawing away at a circle clearly designed for something a bit sportier?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's what this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2380050/view/497205194887528952?l=english">anniversary update</a> for the interstellar hauler delivers, with wheels like the Thrustmaster T128 and flight sticks like VKB's Gladiator NXT EVO being early additions to the devs' handy <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z_f-lbxQgzQ87M4tpjXOjAFcS3kEX27alN8surU7fM/edit?gid=0#gid=0">tracking sheet</a> of tested peripherals. There's also a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3560846829&amp;snr=1_5_9_">guide</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2380050/discussions/0/596285020004455725/?snr=1_5_9_">FAQ rundown</a> from Raw Fury to help folks get their hardware up, running, and fully bound to all the inputs space trucking requires.</p>
<p>Gear recognised by the game should set itself up with default bindings automatically, but I usually find creating my own basic set of essential buttons not that time-consuming, as long as the game wants to acknowledge your wheel exists. Just remember to bind a pause button, and stick the handbrake somewhere your finger can easily hold it when you want to see if your rig can finish a delivery with a 10/10 skid.</p><p>As a counterweight to all the wheel and pedal lorry mischief I planned the minute I clocked this update, it also comes with new speed checks. Yep, cameras, fines, the works. These camera checkpoints along the trails of the galaxy will even show you what speed you're doing as you pass them, though the notes don't mention if you get shown a little smiley face for not blasting through a Jupiter school zone at 120mph. You can also disable these checks via the settings, if the threat of having to attend a speeding course with the crowd from the Mos Eisley cantina is just too much.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there are a couple of updates to trailers, and a couple of optional truck goodies to commemorate the game's first birthday. The latter includes a hologrammatic image of a cake you can display in your cab. Just remember to eat plenty before your next long haul.</p>
<p>If you've not given Star Trucker a go, our Nic dubbed it "a game that's much more about the 'trucker' of it all than the stars, but the trucker of it all really does shine" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-trucker-review">his review</a>, writing:</p>
<blockquote>When you exit the airlock to patch up hull breaches, little white spanner icons mark the offending damage. The symbol that marks the airlock to return to your truck is a home. I noticed it early, and then I kept noticing it. The more I did, the more perfect it felt.</blockquote>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to oversteer that home into an asteroid belt.</p>

              <p>Ultra-wide is an understatement when describing this monitor. <strong>The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 measures in at 49 inches</strong>. That very well might be the full length of your desk. If you stand this gaming monitor on its side, it’s tall enough to ride El Toro at Six Flags Great Adventure.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/"> If you want to stretch your gaming to it’s limit, you can actually grab your own Odyssey G9 for 44% off at the moment.</a> The 49-inch OLED gaming monitor is usually priced at $1,600, but right now Amazon has it listed for just $900. That’s a savings of $700 during this limited time deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lose Yourself in Super Wide Worlds</h2>
<p>This ultra-wide 49-inch display is essentially two monitors glued together side by side. It’s maximum display resolution clocks in at 5120 by 1440 pixels. The screen is curved at 1800R which better reflects our vision of the world around us. The super fast refresh rate of 240Hz will help you achieve fast framerates speeds. And with an input timing of 0.03ms, any lag between controller buttons presses and the action happening on screen will be pretty much imperceptible. G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro compatibility keeps your GPU and panel synced, helping to avoid choppiness and image tears</p>
<p>With the OLED screen, you can enjoy brighter whites and deeper blacks, with rich, vibrant colors. The intense contrast will make any game pop. The light and dark areas are extremely localized. You won’t see any light bleed and be able to experience the color and depths of your games at their fullest potential.</p>



<p>You have a variety of choices when it comes to how you connect to the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9. It features ports for HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and USB Hub. You can be hooked up to all three with a custom gaming PC, a work laptop, and a tablet, then swap between inputs on the fly. It can detect when you’ve plugged in a new source or turned on a connected device, automatically switching inputs over to it so you can get into things right away. Heck, you can even choose to display video from two different sources side-by-side. Two different PCS can each take up half the screen with picture-in-picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">For a limited time, Amazon has this absolute behemoth of a gaming monitor on sale for nearly half off.</a> The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 49-inch display normally goes for $1,600. Right now, that’s down to just $900, saving your a whole $700.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-how-long-completionist-achievement-2000623157</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite all of the hype, little is known about what’s actually in <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Developer Team Cherry has been confidently tight-lipped about all of the secrets hiding inside it’s latest Metroidvania Soulslike. But a list of achievements and trophies for the sequel hints at just how much bigger than the original game it might be. The short answer: a lot.</p> <p>Before even playing the game you can look at a list of <em>Silksong</em>‘s achievements (or trophies on PlayStation 5). One in particular provides an interesting clue about the larger scope. As <em>Game File</em>‘s Stephen Totilo <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/post/3lxzeygtav22i?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fkotaku.com%252Fwp%252Fwp-admin%252Fpost-new.php">pointed out</a> on Bluesky, the “speed completion” achievement requires players to hit 100 percent completion in under 30 hours. A similar achievement in the first Hollow Knight only gave players 20 hours.<em> Does that mean Silksong</em> is roughly 33 percent bigger than its predecessor?</p> <p>Maybe!</p>    <p>Mind you, the above achievement is effectively for a 100 percent speedrun, not an average playthrough. Most players have taken <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/26286">around 27 hours</a> to beat <em>Hollow Knight</em>‘s main campaign and up to 64 hours to defeat every boss and find last secret. Assuming Team Cherry is keeping the completionist achievement in <em>Silksong</em> just as difficult to get, we might expect it to take, on average, 10-30 hours longer to do everything there is to do in the game.</p>

 <p>While just a speculative guesstimate, the assumption aligns with some of what Team Cherry hinted at <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">in their first and only pre-release interview</a>. When explaining why the sequel took seven years to make, the developers said part of the reason was that they just couldn’t stop themselves from continuing to add new things to <em>Silksong</em>: more towns, NPCs, boss fights, and seemingly many more secrets.</p> <p>Of course, if you’re a world record <em>Hollow Knight</em> speedrunner like Kyle “LoLNebula” Dodson, you still might be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NSvKncZbMM">100-percent <em>Silksong</em> in just a few hours</a>. That includes collecting all of the upgrades, charms, and improvements, and fighting lots of bosses multiple times. In fairness Dodson, like lots of other <em>Hollow Knight</em> superfans, has had over eight years to practice.</p>

Ars Technica writers have encountered errors getting store pages to load, adding the game to an online shopping cart, and checking out once the game is part of the cart.</p>
<p>That aligns with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/madelynrogers.bsky.social/post/3lxzdj7sbxk2x">widespread</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jesseferguson.bsky.social/post/3lxzdja5s4s2g">social media</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lunallian.bsky.social/post/3lxzdjh7fu22i">complaints</a> and <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/steam/">data from DownDetector</a>, which saw a sudden spike of over 11,000 reports of problems with Steam in the minutes following <em>Silksong</em>'s 10 am Eastern time release on Steam. The server problems don't seem to be completely stopping everyone, though, as SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">currently reports over 100,000 concurrent players</a> for <em>Silksong</em> as of this writing.</p>
<p>Ars also encountered some significant delays and/or outright errors when downloading other games and updates and syncing cloud saves on Steam during this morning's server problems. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hollow-knight-silksong">The Humble Store page for <em>Silksong</em></a> currently warns North American purchasers that "We have run out of Steam keys for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> in your region, but more are on their way!

<p>The PC version of&nbsp;<em>Silksong currently </em>seem to be available for purchase and download without issue.

                <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally available, and it's putting up huge numbers on Steam. The game blasted off today with 5,000 concurrent players in the first five minutes, growing to 50,000 within 30 minutes and 100,000 after the first 45 minutes of availability.</p><p>Silksong is currently the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 10 most-played game on Steam right now.</a> The game is putting up these massive figures despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">numerous and serious issues on Steam</a> that are preventing people from accessing the store, let alone buying and playing the game.</p><p>The 2017 original Hollow Knight, meanwhile, capped out at a peak concurrent-player record of 72,916--a record that was, in fact, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">achieved just recently on September 3</a>. The game's player numbers no doubt spiked due to interest in the sequel.</p><p>Silksong's Steam numbers are expected to keep climbing. Historical data shows that Steam games tend to spike on weekends in terms of popularity when people generally have more free time.</p><p>Silksong is also available for console, but the same kind of player data is not available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or Switch 2. On Xbox and PC, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/" data-ref-id="1100-6534209">game is also available via Game Pass</a>, so any sales data for those platforms wouldn't necessarily tell the whole story. For what it's worth, Silksong's rollout on console platforms also ran into a number of issues.</p><p>The original Hollow Knight sold more than 15 million copies.</p><p>In other Silksong news, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-twitch-drops-how-to-get-the-hornet-badge/1100-6534483/" data-ref-id="1100-6534483">has Twitch Drops available</a> for a Hornet badge. Hornet is the playable character in Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel.</p><p>Silksong took years to come out, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-silksong-take-so-long-its-not-what-you-might-think/1100-6534218/" data-ref-id="1100-6534218">wasn't because the game was stuck in development hell or anything like that</a>, the developers said. Simply put, the enormous success of the first game gave the small team the time to develop the sequel at their own pace. Also adding to the lengthy development schedule was how Silksong actually began as an expansion to Hollow Knight before shifting to a standalone release.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

<p>For us, perhaps the most notable launch was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> for the Switch and Switch 2. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metal_gear_solid_delta_snake_eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> might have claimed the top spot, but combined sales for Grand Bazaar put it just above Konami's flagship remake at 64,734. The same can be said for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_robot_wars_y">Super Robot Wars Y</a> too, which managed a total of 91,500 across Switch and PS5.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> also made its debut, coming in at number 7 with a total of 12,174 sales.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is easily going to become one of the most successful video game releases of the year, if not of the entire console generation, judging from how popular the game already is minutes after its release.</p>



<p>Following the game's release less than an hour ago at the time of writing, the second entry in the series by Team Cherry destroyed the original's concurrent user record of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/">72,916 users</a>, which was only reached yesterday within minutes with a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">103,994 concurrent users </a>record that is only going to increase in the coming hours, possibly setting a new record for an indie game on the platform. The game's launch has proven to be so popular that multiple storefronts like Steam and the Xbox store went down as fans rushed to download the highly anticipated Metroidvania.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong being so successful should surprise no one, as fans of the original have been waiting for the game for years. After being in development for a long time with little to no communication, it seemed like the game would not be out for another good while, but developer Team Cherry surprised fans worldwide by revealing the game's early September release with a surprise announcement only <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-special-presentation-team-cherry/">two weeks ago</a>. While it's too early to say for certain, it seems like the long wait was very worth it, as Hollow Knight: Silksong takes everything that made the original so engaging and brings it up to eleven with more powerful bosses, a full-fledged quest system and a new story featuring Hornet journey through the Kingdom of Pharloom to learn more about secrets tied to her past.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. The game is also available as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-to-be-available-on-day-one-on-xbox-game-pass/">Xbox Game Pass library.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been in the works for a long time, but the wait was well worth it, as the new version of the third entry in the JRPG series by Square Enix, which serves as the beginning of the Erdrick trilogy, is undoubtedly the best rendition of the adventure, which, chronologically, started it all. Everything considered, it was also the easiest game of the trilogy to remake in the HD-2D style, as the gameplay, while definitely a little dated, still held up well, allowing the development team to focus on the new visuals and some choice changes to improve an experience that is still considered among the best in the series.</p>



<p>To make the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake as compelling as its predecessor, however, the development team needed to do much more. The original Dragon Quest is terribly dated, with a single party member who can only face a single enemy, and a vague semblance of a story that is barely there. Dragon Quest II, on the other hand, fares a little better, with a set party and a slightly more developed narrative, but not by much. Both games required a lot more to be enticing for a modern audience who did not experience the original or any of their previous faithful remakes than a new coat of paint and some additional content, but sfter trying both games during last month's Gamescom, I can safely say that the two games are being properly updated with new tweaks and improvements that modernize them without impacting the classic feel the two games still firmly retain.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Having only around one hour to try out both games, I couldn't delve too deep into the many tweaks and changes featured in the upcoming remakes, but the little I experienced was fully convincing. In Dragon Quest I, for example, the Hero continues to fight his way to the Dragonlord alone, but no longer fights single enemies, but groups like in the rest of the series. As such, the experience has been completely rebalanced with this in mind, and the Hero's skillset has been greatly expanded with a Scrolls system that allows players to teach their character a variety of skills. In addition, the game features a lot more story in the vein of the rest of the series, which promises to make the classic game more entertaining than ever before, and even longer, as the development team confirmed it will take around 15 hours to get to the ending, as opposed to around 10 hours required for the original.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest II has been similarly expanded, with the Princess of Cannock joining the party and an increased focus on story to make it feel like more than a fancier way of guiding the player to the next objective. Character customization has also been enhanced with the introduction of a Sigils system that grants special effects in battle, bringing the gameplay closer to that of more recent entries in the series. With the new content added in, the developer expects it will take 35 hours to get to the ending, which is a considerable increase over the around 18 hours needed to complete the original.</p>



<p>For the rest, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake played as one would expect, with the classic top-down view, intricate dungeon design with some simple puzzles to solve, random encounters, classic turn-based combat system, and the iconic music that has always defined the series since its beginnings. With familiar elements and well-thought-out additions meshing together to deliver renewed experiences, I expect Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake to be as successful as last year's release amid newcomers and veterans alike when the game launches on October 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>Well, who could have seen this coming: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has taken Steam offline, or at least, laid waste to large swathes of it. Within seconds of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">its release this afternoon</a>, Team Cherry’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel brought Valve's servers to a halt, cue endlessly loading pages when trying to access the checkout, browse the store or do much of anything.
</p><!--more-->
<p>I can’t even sign in. I’m currently staring into the void of an infinite “loading user data” loop. I can’t get the “Most Played” chart to load in a web browser, either, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 101,828 people playing already. Smash cut to live footage of Gabe Newell ejected screaming from his exploding yacht, hotly pursued by a cloud of burning hornets. 
</p>
<p>If you’re hoping to play on Steam in the next hour or so, you may encounter the following dread message: "Error Code: 2811-7429. Couldn't connect to the server. The network may be busy, or there may be a problem with the server. Please try again later." There are already thousands of reports of a Steam outage on <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/steam/">Downdetector</a>. Valve have yet to comment. The game is also available on GOG, who have a much smaller audience, but I hear <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://bsky.app/profile/khonziel.bsky.social/post/3lxzdkzrccs26%E2%80%9D">they’re having similar difficulties</a>. 
</p>
<p>May the good gods save our engineers in this time of Silksinging. May the good gods save them, at least, from wrathful emails. Having to wait an hour or two for demand to die back so you can play Silksong is no great burden. Still, as ever with Steam overloads, you do have to wonder whether Valve as a whole could have prepared better for this. 
</p><p>Silksong has been Steam’s most-wishlisted game since forever. I’m not clear on what Valve do when they know something is going to be mega-popular - I assume it involves buying more servers, but perhaps they just pour energy drinks over the existing ones while uttering the Optimiser’s Prayer. Perhaps they just stick a bike pump in the outer wall of the server farm and have an intern crank the handle for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>If you’re trying to play, best of luck. James claims he’s already got it downloading, but then he’s always trying to be the popular one.

              <p>Good morning! I’m not sure why I’m even writing today’s Morning Checkpoint, as nobody is going to read today’s edition. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-steam-eshop-crashing-twitch-game-pass-hollow-knight-2000623137">Instead, you’ll all be out there playing your fancy new <em>Silksong</em>.</a> Congrats to all of you. For the few of you <em>actually</em> here, today’s Checkpoint includes news about another long-awaited indie game, an update on <em>Wolverine</em>, some info on the development of the Switch 2, and our thoughts on Bloober’s next big horror game.</p> <h2><em>The Binding of Isaac</em> creator’s next game finally gets a release date</h2> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-creators-mewgenics-finally-gets-a-release-date-almost-13-years-after-it-was-announced">After first being announced in 2012, <em>Mewgenics</em> finally has a launch date.</a> And you thought the wait for <em>Silksong</em> was bad! <em>Mewgenics</em>, which is an RPG built around breeding many cats, is being developed by Edmund McMillen, the creator behind<em> The Binding of Isaac</em>, and will launch on February 10, 2026, which is about 13 years after it was first revealed. Not only did McMillen reveal the game’s release date, but he also uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/cAiIiju7lCo">a 50-minute-long gameplay demo</a> showing off how the game actually plays.</p>  <h2>Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em> game is reportedly showing up in a State of Play soon</h2> <p>We’ve not seen much of <em>Wolverine</em>, the next game from<em> Spider-Man</em> makers Insomniac, since it was revealed in 2021. Well, unless you count all the leaked gameplay floating around out there after the studio was hacked. But it seems like the wait for a new official look at the upcoming superhero game might be coming to an end. <em>Insider Gaming </em>reports that sources have told the outlet a trailer for <em>Wolverine</em> is ready, and many expect it to appear in a Sony State of Play later this month. Will he say “Bub?” One can hope.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo delayed the Switch 2 a few times to make sure it had good games ready</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-repeatedly-delayed-switch-2-at-designers-request-report/1100-6534465/">A new report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-nintendo-switch2/">about Nintendo and how it makes games</a> says that the Switch 2’s launch was held back because the people working on launch games requested extra time to “perfect” their titles. Nintendo apparently made this their number one priority and delayed the Switch 2 a few times to make sure the games it launched with were as good as could be.</p> <h2><em>Shinobi: The Art of Vengeance</em> on Switch is getting a resolution boost</h2> <p>People like that new <em>Shinobi</em> game a lot! But on Switch, the 2D action-platformer is a bit fuzzier than it should be. <a href="https://x.com/SEGA_OFFICIAL/status/1963129469373407429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Sega knows and is patching the Switch port</a> to “improve” <em>Shinobi</em>‘s resolution. Here’s their full statement:</p>

 <blockquote><p><span>In response to feedback from all players, we are currently developing an update patch to improve the screen resolution in the Nintendo Switch version of this title. Please wait a little longer until the patch is released.</span></p></blockquote> <h2>Someone added a Nintendo Cease and Desist into <em>Smash Bros.</em> as a fighter</h2> <p>Truly the greatest enemy in Nintendo history: A legal cease and desist issued by one of the company’s many lawyers. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-cease-desist-letter-is-now-a-playable-character-in-smash-bros-mod/1100-6534471/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">Now someone</a> has brought this iconic and terrible creature, which has stopped many a great mod and fan game, into <em>Smash Bros.</em> as a playable character. Good luck to the other fighters. You’re going to need it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I put my Cease &amp; Desist Letter from Nintendo into Melee!</p> <p>See how much court fines you can stack up against your opponents with this new skin over [COPYRIGHTED CHARACTER]!</p> <p>Get it at your nearest courthouse, linked below! <br>Lawsuit compatible. <a href="https://t.co/QHXyo516z2">pic.twitter.com/QHXyo516z2</a></p> <p>— Moosh (@Mooshies_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mooshies_/status/1962052715649061032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">The new Xbox handheld PC thingy seems cool, but will probably not be worth the price</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-tomorrow-lex-luthor-date-james-gunn-supergirl-batman-2000622739">We’re getting a new Superman movie in 2027</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-review-impressions-horror-bloober-team-silent-hil-2-ps5-2000622488"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is pretty dang good and scary!</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p>Wow, <em>Silksong</em> is out and has a launch trailer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of Hollow Knight: Silksong is a glorious day, but not if you’re a PS5 gamer. Whereas every other available platform got the launch of Silksong bang on the projected start time, PlayStation 5 users have been left out in the cold, wondering why they can’t download Silksong.</p>



<p>I’m a PS5 player, and I can’t download <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. I waited as patiently as all of you for the launch date and time. Once the hour struck, I dove onto the PS Store to buy and download the game—that’s a lie, I was on and tried <em>before </em>this, but still. PlayStation 5 players have been unable to pre-purchase and download Silksong, ready for its inevitable launch.</p>



<p>This didn’t seem too bad, as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-file-sizes-playstation-xbox-switch-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong file sizes</a> suggest it’s not the heftiest game to download. However, the community can’t download Silksong on PS5, so let’s dive into the latest.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-buy-hollow-knight-silksong">Why Can’t I Buy Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We just want to play. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Neither PlayStation nor Team Cherry has explained why PS5 is the only storefront where you can’t purchase Hollow Knight: Silksong right now, and the best guess is due to an error on the store or the server being backed up with customers.</strong></p>



<p>Let me be clear, I’m doing some digging and trying to find out why this is happening as we speak. There hasn’t been a single word from PlayStation or the developer about any miscommunication regarding Silksong’s launch on PS5. However, the fact remains that no one can buy and download Silksong on PS5.</p>



<p>There’s also a chance this could be due to the influx of traffic with hundreds of thousands of players presumably trying to buy the anticipated indie game—myself included.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-hollow-knight-silksong-will-work-on-ps5">Do We Know When Hollow Knight: Silksong Will Work On PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>There seems to be no workaround for Hollow Knight: Silksong not working on PS5<strong> at the moment, </strong>and it’s up in the air as to when it will be available to buy on PS5.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Consider this guide a live page you should keep refreshing,</strong> as I’m monitoring the situation intensely. You can take my word for it, as I also want to download Silksong. So keep checking back. Fingers crossed we get an update from <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a> or PlayStation, or the store page suddenly works.</p>

<p>Drop us a comment or a message on the <a href="https://x.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming X page</a> if you find Hollow Knight: Silksong is working, or if you find an update elsewhere on the ongoing issue.</p>

But behind her quiet demeanour lies an unlikely friendship with the horn-headed tempter himself. This strange bond propels her into a world that feels torn from the pages of Dostoyevsky and Bulgakov, a place where the sacred and the profane intertwine, and where every step reveals new layers of mystery.</p><p><strong>Enjoy an Indie Game Where Anything Goes</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>INDIKA</em> isn’t afraid to challenge conventions, both in storytelling and in the wider gaming landscape. Developed by Odd Meter, a small, independent team formerly based in Moscow and now operating from Kazakhstan, the game combines richly atmospheric exploration, dark humour, and inventive puzzle-solving across surreal landscapes rendered in a unique visual style.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Third-person <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,530 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> with an imaginative, darkly comic story.</li><li>A young nun’s journey of self-discovery in a surreal reimagining of 19th-century Russia.</li><li>The devil himself as an unlikely travel companion.</li><li>Unique puzzle elements woven into the narrative.</li><li>Surreal landscapes and atmospheric world-building.</li><li>2D pixel art mini-games revealing Indika’s troubled past.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Indika | Switch physical announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3JhhUoGe8o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/indika-coming-to-switch-this-fall]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of its launch in October, Square Enix has revealed more details on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake/">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D</a> Remake, focusing on how combat has been enhanced and new items that players can take advantage of. Just like the original JRPGs, players will once again encounter monsters as they explore an overworld and several dungeons, with combat revolving around turn-based battles.</p><p>All the staples of the classic Dragon Quest gameplay are here--like spells and skills--but if you're having a tough time, the game will suggest the optimal actions you can take to exploit the weaknesses of monsters. This is an optional setting found in the game menu, and once enabled, it will show text above the enemy that indicates which of your moves will be effective against it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEsHUslhTQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rxEsHUslhTQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another new feature being introduced are Scrolls, which will allow characters to learn additional spells and skills. These can be obtained from treasure chests throughout the games, but they can only be used on specific characters. The five sigils--Sun, Star, Moon, Water, and Soul--that originally appeared in Dragon Quest 2 return in Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake, and these will activate various effects in battle once they have been collected.</p><p>In Dragon Quest 1 HD, sigils can be acquired through a quest to assist the fairies, and in Dragon Quest 2 HD, sigils are collected as part of a mission to defeat Hargon, the evil high priest who leads an army of monsters. Each sigil offers unique bonuses, like guaranteed critical hit damage for special abilities and other abilities will be upgraded if certain conditions are met.</p><p>Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake launches on October 30 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and Switch. if you're planning to play the game on Nintendo hardware, it's worth noting that there will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-dragon-quest-remakes-wont-upgrade-from-switch-to-switch-2/1100-6533168/">no upgrade path between the different Switch console releases</a>.</p><p>"The games are a stunning marriage of classic pixel art and modern touches. I hadn't realized how much better Square Enix's 'HD-2D' aesthetic had become in recent years," Steve Watts wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-12-hd-2d-remake-gives-the-classics-a-deserved-glow-up/1100-6531817/">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake preview</a>. "The color palette and saturation feels reminiscent of 8-bit classics, which makes the beautiful sprite artwork pop."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

The last Twitch badge to be made available in direct conjunction with a game's release was Elden Ring Nightreign's Wylder, which was unlocked by clipping moments from streamers playing the game.</p>

<p>This time around, you can earn the Hollow Knight: Silksong Hornet badge, which depicts the sequel's protagonist, by subscribing to<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/hollow-knight-silksong?filter=drops" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a participating channel</a>. The campaign is live now and will run until September 13. After that time, it won't be possible to earn the badge via any other method, so if you're a fan of the series and want a fun way to show it on Twitch, you've only got a short while.</p><p>Silksong's release proved so popular that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">crashed several storefronts</a> hosting the game, including Xbox where the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-september-headlined-by-hollow-knight-silksong-and-i-am-your-beast/2900-6974/" data-ref-id="2900-6974">Day One release for Game Pass</a> is hosted. Despite the release time being widely publicized, it seems nobody was expecting just how sought-after the game would be. Part of that is likely due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">Silksong's modest price point</a>.</p>

            <p>Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">Ubisoft announced it would shut down The Crew's servers on 31st March, 2024</a>, which would make the game unplayable due to its always online requirements - even those with physical copies of the game were to be locked out. Needless to say, many were unhappy with Ubisoft's decision.</p>
<p>Some, though, decided not to just leave it there, and set about reviving the game on their own time and dime. Now a little over a year later, the fan lead Crew revival project - known as The Crew Unlimited - is gearing up for its release on 15th September. </p>
<p>But, what has it taken to get to this point?</p>

<p>"We started working on the server emulator project (to revive the game) a bit before the official server shutdown," project lead whammy4 told Eurogamer. "Ever since then it's been a non-stop technical uphill battle: network data analysis, reversing, implementation, rinse and repeat."</p><p>This was all to "implement the networking and communications between the game client (the game that the players play) and the server (what we're working on)", they explain. "Then there's a whole other side of it where we have to re-implement and rewrite entire parts of The Crew's game/data design, functionality and logic, entirely from scratch."</p>
<p>Think that all sounds difficult? Well, it was. The rest of The Crew Unlimited's team is made up of r00t0, ChemicalFlood, mono24 and Guki. It was r00t0 who started and carried out the actual server emulator project, with whammy4 calling them an "absolute godsend". Whammy4, then, is "mainly responsible for programming the actual game functionality and logic, and all the MMO stuff on the server", while ChemicalFlood is "helping and assisting us with the networking and IT side of things (also archiving everything)". Guki, meanwhile, is the expert on The Crew's data and file systems, and mono24 provides "invaluable advice on how to run and manage the project correctly". The entire team have their own jobs, families and lives outside of The Crew Unlimited. </p>
<p>So, what does this all actually mean in practice, though? "The game's economy, prices, items, rewards, databases, MMO systems and logic; we have to manage things down to each individual part you install on your car in the game," whammy4 explained. "Oftentimes working on this project feels like an unpredictable rollercoaster ride, one day we're feeling like we're making huge progress and got everything sorted, next day we're bashing our heads on the wall failing to figure out how some minor gamemode's reward formula works... sometimes for months."</p>
<p>Whammy4 added there would be times when the team would have to deal with issues in their personal lives, and this would halt any progress for a not insignificant period of time. "But you know what really warms our heart and keeps us going? It's the amount of support we get from fans of the game," whammy4 said, adding the entire team is very grateful for this.</p><p>"It just shows how many people love and care for this game. We get kind words and support from people from all across the world, both young and old. Very few video games can boast such dedicated fanbases with such a large variety in age. This warms my heart to no end and just shows how special this game is, and to so many people."</p>

<p>While it is clear The Crew Unlimited has had a huge amount of passion and care poured into it, there is one elephant in the room - Ubisoft. What does it have to say about this community project to revive The Crew?</p>
<p>"We often get asked if Ubisoft has commented or acknowledged our project in any way. They have not, but as for The Crew's developers Ivory Tower, one (alleged) developer has anonymously come out and expressed their and the studio's gratitude and appreciation for our project," whammy4 told me when I asked. While the developer chose to stay anonymous, whammy4 said The Crew Unlimited's team "know for a fact we got supporters over at Ivory Tower", adding "shoutouts to them all!".</p><p>Whammy4 admitted Ubisoft could shut down the project, but said "causing trouble for anyone is not something we're looking to do". They said that "each player has to have their own The Crew game installation, then they install TCU over it to make it playable again". They added The Crew Unlimited team doesn't provide any game files. "TCU itself is 100 percent free of charge and always will be, including anything else we may release," they said.</p>

<p>As for what will come next once The Crew Unlimited releases, whammy4 said the community is excited about the modding potential that they will be able to explore. "Now that the game is free from the publisher's servers and control, we can practically do whatever we want (and can) with the game. Only problem is that this is one hell of a difficult game to work with and modify, but there already are people in the community that are making modding tools, software and documentation in preparation for the game's revival," they furthered.</p>
<p>"With a game as rich in its content and features as The Crew, lots of mods could be possible: New cars, new car customisations, map modifications, or entire new areas and parts of the map. Maybe even new races and gamemodes!</p><p>
"Part of the TCU Project is the 'TCU Mod', which aims to restore a lot of the visuals and ambient content that was removed from the game post-launch. It's still in development, but already features plenty of visual improvements, along with car handling and physics improvements. It's all just a matter of time and effort."</p>
<p>Whammy4 said the team ultimately still doesn't "know where the winds will take us", but believes the modding "could be incredible" in the future. 

"The game already has so much to offer as is, and such a solid base for modding, it's practically screaming to be modded," they said. "I personally believe modding is the future of The Crew, that's how it will live on and be relevant for decades more." </p>
<p>I asked whammy4 why this Crew project is so important. "Let's begin with the fact that... we're basically giving... millions of players their beloved game back," they replied.
</p>
<p>But, it is more than just that. It is also about preservation, something that has been a big topic in recent years. "Sometimes we get dads thanking us for bringing the game back, because they wanted their kids to play it, or continue playing it," whammy4 said. "I consider video games the ultimate form of art, they are a unison of a variety of different arts - visual arts, music, sound, writing, acting, etc. The Crew is a game that definitely took all of these elements very seriously, and each was done by talented, caring artists."</p><p>They continued: "The original version and vision of the game had a visual direction never seen before or after in gaming, it was designed to look like a moving/dynamic painting, going as far as to have entire visual elements like skies and clouds be hand-painted."</p>
<p>"This game also has a ton of educational value, about American geography, history (the game features several hundred landmark points with descriptions), even down to geographical and meteorological quirks of the different places of North US, expressed with the mappers' careful and deliberate work, featuring a large variety of biomes and ecosystems (including lots of different animal types), and a staggering 40+ unique artistic regional weather conditions available in the game (cut down to... two weathers total, in later updates).</p>
<p>"All of this on a huge digital map of the North US, scaled down to 1900 square miles. And to lose all this? Destroy all this work? Take it away from everyone, and bury this game and experience forever? That should be a crime."</p>
<p>Closing, whammy4 said they believe that thanks to The Crew Unlimited, Ubisoft's game "<em>will</em> get the recognition and love it deserves".</p>

For more, <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/home/">you can also check out The Crew Unlimited's website</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crew-review">Eurogamer's own review for The Crew</a>, Outside Xbox's racing aficionado Mike Channel came away impressed. "It's a game that requires and occasionally enforces patience, but like all great road trips it's about the journey, not the destination," he wrote.</p>

<p>All of us here have managed to download it. Happy gaming!</p><hr><p><strong>Update #1 [<time datetime="2025-09-04T14:25:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Thu 4th Sep 2025, 3:25pm</time>]:</strong> A few of us here have been able to purchase Silksong and start the download. Others have managed to reach the payment section and received error code 2813-1409.</p>
<p>We'll keep you posted!</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is out now on Switch and Switch 2. And you'll know this because you're either playing it right now, or you're simply trying to navigate an eShop that's positively <em>buckling</em> under the weight of such a monumental launch. Word has it that other digital storefronts like Steam are also having a real hard time keeping up with the demand, too.</p>
<p>Yes, thanks to the lack of any pre-order pages and Team Cherry giving us a helpful heads up as to when Silksong would actually drop, fans around the world have flooded the eShop at the same time, leading to slowdown and, in many cases, the complete inability to access the game's store page.</p>
<p>Some of us here at Nintendo Life been unable to access the store page, with error code 2811-7002 displaying after a lengthy wait.</p>

<p>We're certain things will calm down soon, but for now, if you're struggling to get your purchase in, we'd perhaps recommend just taking a step back for a little while.</p>
<p>Should things start to stabilise, or we get some sort of statement on the issue, then we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

			<p>Dreamhaven, the studio behind the PvP shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504780/Wildgate/">Wildgate</a>, which goes between boots-on-the-ground first-person shooting and ship-to-ship battle, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-out-now-ps5-xbox-series-pc/">launched this past July 22</a>, has suffered layoffs, chief executive officer Mike Morhaime confirmed in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-morhaime-1081a7170_today-i-want-to-share-some-difficult-news-activity-7369069584328421376-7-qL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dreamhaven-affected-by-unspecified-number-of-layoffs">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>.</p>



<p>Morhaime doesn't confirm how many of Dreamhaven's developers were impacted by the layoff, but does say that the layoffs have mostly impacted its publishing group, and that they were "<em>talented colleagues who have played a key role in building Dreamhaven’s foundation and supporting what has been an eventful year for us</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>From organizing the Dreamhaven Showcase to helping launch three games, every person at Dreamhaven has contributed to sharing our games with the world. I’m deeply grateful for the creativity, dedication, and hard work of the teammates we are parting ways with. They will be truly missed</em>," Morhaime writes.</p>



<p>Morhaime continues to say that the mission for Wildgate and Dreamhaven "<em>remains unchanged</em>," and that he remains "<em>optimistic about Dreamhaven’s future and the experiences still to come</em>."</p>



<p>Dreamhaven is comprised of former <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-first-look-and-hands-on-a-sci-fi-sea-of-thieves-by-former-blizzard-devs/">Blizzard and Sea of Thieves developers,</a> which helps to contextualize the games' back-and-forth from first-person shooting to ship-to-ship battle. When we checked it out in a preview earlier this year, Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo called it "<em>a blast of fun</em>," and that "<em>The art style is definitely very reminiscent of Blizzard's work, but in terms of gameplay, it reminded me a lot of a sci-fi version of Rare's Sea of Thieves</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-is-crashing-storefronts.1288857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After many years of waiting,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is finally out, but you may have a little trouble actually buying the game, because it appears to be crashing the digital storefronts on which it's available.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-steam-numbers-massive-player-count/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>quickly began destabilizing storefronts the moment it was released (around 40 minutes ago at time of writing), with Steam, the PlayStation Store, the Nintendo eShop, and even Xbox Game Pass' frontage all affected.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that I haven't been able to replicate these outages; for me, the storefronts in question all appear to be behaving themselves, although Steam is by far the most intermittent, since it's occasionally taking a few moments longer than usual to load.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts-hornet.jpg?itok=wkgOUeKG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts-hornet.jpg?itok=dCQP9L_s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>appears to be causing storefront outages.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've somehow missed out on the hype, then let me bring you up to speed.&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is one of the industry's most anticipated indie games; it was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">in 2019</a>, and a relative lack of news and announcements from that date onwards essentially caused it to pass into the realms of myth.</p>

<p>Back in August, however, the&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">release date was finally revealed</a>, and the resulting furore caused <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">several indie developers to delay their games</a> in order to avoid clashing with said date. That's how anticipated&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>is (or was, prior to release).</p>

<p>That, then, would probably explain why storefronts are crashing; those who've been waiting for&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>since 2019, and those who are merely curious about its legendary status, are rushing to buy it in droves. I'd imagine the Steam numbers for this one are going to look very good indeed come tomorrow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In 2019, Apple Arcade launched with roughly 70 premium mobile games that had no ads, no in-app purchases, and no sex or violence. Some of the games in the initial launch period, like <em>What the Golf?</em>, were praised for their innovation and depth beyond what’s typically expected of mobile games. In the six years since, Apple Arcade has grown its game offerings, and while it maintains its credo of family-friendly content, its library no longer garners the same critical praise.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/711575/netflix-games-apple-arcade-mobile-games">Alongside Netflix’s mobile games subscription service</a>, it seems that Apple Arcade has shifted its focus toward titles that offer endless engagement with little depth. However, Apple Arcade senior director Alex Rofman doesn’t necessarily see that as the case. Instead, he says the shift has come from trying to satisfy such a varied audience.</p><p>“Apple has a very large customer base,” said Rofman. “There’s no narrow lane that we can operate in and satisfy the broad base of Apple users.” That broad base has led to a multifaceted strategy of game acquisitions for the service. In response to player feedback, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad">in 2021 Arcade expanded beyond exclusive titles</a> and started bringing in classic games like sudoku, chess, and more. Then it took the games already popular on the App Store, like <em>Fruit Ninja</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em>, and brought them to Arcade with their ads and in-app purchases removed.</p><p>“Today, we offer a pretty broad and deep catalog of more than 250 family-friendly games from across genres,” Rofman said. Arcade continues to grow and add games every month, and works on supporting the games already within the service. Apple also connects its partner developers with big IP holders for collaboration opportunities. That’s how <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure </em>got made.</p><p>“I think <em>Hello Kitty</em> is an interesting story,” Rofman said. He detailed how the indie developer Sunblink first launched a game called <em>Heroish</em> on Apple Arcade in 2022. Rofman said that <em>Heroish</em> was “very high quality” and thought Sunblink would make a great partner to bring a <em>Hello Kitty</em> game to Arcade. “We were able to put Sunblink together with Sanrio to do something really special,” Rofman said. “There have been many attempts at creating <em>Hello Kitty</em> games over the years, none of which were really very successful until we matched Sunblink with [Sanrio].”</p><p>And while <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> has enjoyed great success, winning Apple Arcade Game of the Year in the App Store Awards in 2023 and being ported to consoles earlier this year, its existence is also part of a growing shift toward games attached to big, attention-drawing IP. On September 4th, Apple is launching <em>NFL Retro Bowl ’26</em>, a game that came about by connecting indie studio New Star R&amp;D with the NFL. Earlier releases this year include titles from Play-Doh, the PGA Tour, Angry Birds, Lego, and Uno.</p><p>“By no means are we going all into only IP,” Rofman said. “It’s a broad mix, because we have a broad player base.” And while Rofman understands the criticisms Arcade has faced, he says Apple is invested in Arcade for the long haul. “We care very deeply about games,” he said. “Not just the Arcade team, it’s across the company.”</p><p>Apple Arcade was once seen as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman">a home for premium mobile games that no longer had a place in the App Store</a>. And while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">some indie darlings</a> still come to the platform, overall the focus on a broader audience has meant a big change in the kinds of experiences released on Arcade compared to when it first launched. Apple may not only want recognizable properties and family-friendly games, but they are the kinds of experiences that dominate the service right now. However, there may be reason to be excited for the future.</p><p>Rofman says Apple is selective and exacting in its selection of games to add to Arcade, and notes that the games coming later in the year are something to look out for. “Keep your eyes peeled,” he says, “because there’s lots of great stuff coming.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/770599/apple-arcade-interview-alex-rothman#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/770599/apple-arcade-interview-alex-rothman]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Nintendo Switch Online, the Switch subscription service with the deeply irritating name, is rearranging the furniture to try to make things make a bit more sense. For one, various libraries of emulated games from older Nintendo systems are now being designated as “Nintendo Classics,” while the Game Boy Advance section receives a couple of significant improvements.</p> <p>First and foremost, on Switch 2 your GBA games—dating from 2001 to 2010—will now apparently run in a far shinier 1080p even when playing in handheld mode. Now, clearly this sets up quite the battle lines between those who believe emulated games should be played at the scale and resolution that was originally intended, ideally on the cloudy-screened technology of its era, and those who like it when things look pretty. Of course, the app also gives you the option to both run the games in a teeny window, and to “reproduce classic feel” by adding a bunch of effects to make it look like it used to. Saying all this, I’ve updated my Switch 2 and I absolutely cannot get the games to run in 1080p, nor find an option for it, so that’s odd.</p> <p>However, what I can confirm as working is control remapping, which is a very welcome inclusion. The option was recently added to the SNES games, and with an exemplary level of precision. For instance, if you’re adjusting controls for <em>Mario Kart Super Circuit</em>, there are options to reassign controls as specific as “Throw Bananas Ahead of You” and “Shoot Shells Behind You,” letting, you move them wherever is most comfortable for you. (Except, of course, to the rear triggers, because annoyingly those are forcibly reserved for reaching the emulator menu.)</p>

 <p>All of the previous consoles’ games are now in their own section on the Nintendo Switch Online app, under Nintendo Classics with the same branding, which makes a lot more sense. NES, SNES, Game Boy, GBA, N64, and GameCube are in a neat row. Of course, rather irritatingly this <em>doesn’t</em> include any games certificated M, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-online-forsaken-64-mature-2000622653">today’s addition of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em></a>, for which you need a separate app—the catchily titled <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Nintendo-64-Nintendo-Classics-Mature-2592474.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo6In-dwQyKw2KJlbPqUOKk6izShDf_yoce7GWRsGTtNp86uikR">Nintendo 64 – Nintendo Classics: Mature</a>.</p> <p>Let me know if you get 1080p working. Perhaps I’m missing something embarrassingly obvious.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We know that Hollow Knight: Silksong is a much bigger game than its predecessor. The original game’s file sizes were quite small, but now that Silksong is out, we’ve learned that Team Cherry has done an immense job minimizing the strain on storage.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong came out of the blocks hotter than the sun. The successor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-beat-hollow-knight-all-time-peak-player-count-in-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beat the original Hollow Knight’s all-time peak player count in just 15 minutes</a>. This is a miracle when you consider that many people couldn’t download the game due to Silksong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/">taking Steam, Xbox, and Nintendo’s eShop offline</a> due to demand!</p>



<p>If you haven’t had a chance to download it yet, we have all the file sizes for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-file-sizes-are-very-generous">Hollow Knight: Silksong File Sizes Are Very Generous</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s here. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong requires <strong>7.56 GB on PC</strong>, <strong>4 GB on PlayStation 4</strong>, <strong>2.5 GB on PlayStation 5</strong>, <strong>8.01 GB on Xbox</strong>, <strong>2.6 GB on the Nintendo Switch 1</strong>, and a further <strong>4 GB on Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>I think it’s safe to say you probably don’t need to delete any games to make room for Silksong! We’ve been through every available storefront and found these file sizes for ourselves—you know these are accurate and what you should bear in mind.</p>



<p>I did initially worry when the developer mentioned the size and scope of the game. However, Silksong doesn’t have to process anywhere near as much stuff as a AAA open-world game would, for example. Expect super silky (see what I did there?) performance across the board.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It shouldn’t be a surprise to see Hollow Knight: Silksong absolutely smash it within minutes of its launch. This is exactly what happened as the game’s anticipated launch saw huge player numbers come in and help Silksong destroy Hollow Knight 2017’s peak player count.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight has retained legendary status for nearly a decade. However, the torch has well and truly been passed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Within minutes of the sequel going live, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong single-handedly took down Steam, Xbox, and the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>Silksong’s player count and peak numbers were very big, very quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-peak-reaches-100-000-players-in-half-an-hour">Hollow Knight: Silksong Peak Reaches 100,000 Players In Half An Hour</h2>



<figure><figcaption>That didn’t take long. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Hollow Knight (as of writing) achieved a more than respectable all-time peak of 72,916, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. Many indie games would kill for numbers like this, and it’s a big reason why the sequel has been so in demand.</p>



<p>Within minutes of Silksong being available to download, its peak player count eclipsed the OG Hollow Knight. As I’m writing this story now, Silksong’s all-time peak stands at an incredible <strong>100,374</strong> players!</p>



<p>With people still at work, waking up around the world, and the weekend still to come, expect this number to be smashed, and Silksong to reach an even bigger player count. There’s simply no telling what Silksong is going to achieve.</p>



<p>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong a lock for Game of the Year contention? How many copies is it going to sell, and how many people are going to play Silksong? There’s so much to pack, so leave a comment below, and share all your thoughts through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is out today, over six years after its initial announcement. Fans who have been waiting that entire time for the game finally have their hands on it in what is sure to mark an exciting new era for a community that’s driven itself to often-surprising lengths of hype and anticipation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for one fan in particular, today is not just a beginning, it’s an ending, an ending of a nearly five-year project that’s become a staple part of the Silksong community during the long wait for Team Cherry’s game. Today, September 4, 2025, marks the final video for the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DailySilksongNews" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Daily Silksong News</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Daily Silksong News is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a YouTube channel run by Silksong community member Araraura, where he publishes a daily video covering what, if any, news about Hollow Knight: Silksong has surfaced on that day. But simple as the premise is, Daily Silksong News is impressive due to Araraura’s sheer dedication. Since the start of the channel, Araraura has made 1,693 videos. He tells me he hasn’t missed a single day.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/silksong-1756972150246.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Daily Silksong News can finally rest.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Araraura doesn’t self-describe as a content creator or streamer or anything like that. He’s simply a fan. He was inspired by a channel tackling a similar Herculean task <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EldenRingNews" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Elden Ring News</u></a>, which was conducted by a fan going by Mordecai and which similarly provided daily updates on the game in question. Araraura saw this channel and wondered if there was a similar daily update for Silksong. When he saw there was not, he decided, on the spot, to make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as anyone with an interest in Silksong will know, most days over the past four years, there simply has been no Silksong news. Thus, the vast majority of the videos on Daily Silksong News are less than a minute long. These simple videos consist of a basic thumbnail showing the main character, Hornet, and the text “Daily News Day 1577 [or whatever number] News?: No”. The videos themselves are mostly just Araraura narrating the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Today is December 2023, 2023. This is Araraura, your host for today, bringing you your daily Silksong news. There has been no news to report for Silksong today. This has been your daily news for Silksong for today, December 23, 2023.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might imagine, days with news are a bit more interesting. News days feature Araraura providing a brief explanation of what the news actually is, typically only a few minutes long, as well as a “Yes” in the thumbnail declaring that there was, in fact, news on that date. Some days are “Maybe” or “No, but…” news days, where there’s no actual news but something relevant and Silksong-adjacent happened that Araraura found worth reporting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those days, however, are few and far between. Mostly, it’s just Araraura reciting the same no-news script. He tells me that as time went on, he looked for ways to spice up the videos. He began inviting guests on to read the news, largely focusing on bringing in members of the Hollow Knight community, such as noted Hollow Knight lore expert Mossbag. He once did a crossover with Mordecai, where Mordecai read the Silksong news and Araraura read Elden Ring news. Araraura also sometimes has incorporated other fun and funny elements into his videos, such as short video clips, images, or gags. These additional bits have become more prevalent in the later videos, Araraura tells me, as some friends in his Discord group got more involved and helped make various projects and video elements for the channel, including a recurring puppet cutaway gag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But mostly, for four-and-a-half years, it’s been the same update, day after day. And that’s suited Araraura just fine. The simplicity of the videos is what allowed him to keep going for so long. He tells me most of the videos take about 5-10 minutes to make. “Obviously, some of them take a very long time and a lot of effort from myself and from multiple other people who work on the videos, but the regular ones are just, record for 20 seconds, put it on Premier, and just change the numbers. That's how it works for the most part.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s most impressive about Araraura’s effort, though, is his dedication. Easy as he makes it sound, Araraura says he’s never missed a daily update. He says when he wasn’t available on a given day, he’d record a “no news” video in advance, and “just hoped that there wouldn’t be Silksong news when I did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Usually, when we get Silksong news after a massive drought, the first thing I do is I just quickly try to record and edit video, and just upload as fast as I can, because it feels like it's my job, and it's something really important that I need to get done,” he tells me, remembering one particularly memorable news day. “The most viewed video on my channel is when we got the release year back in April, and that was right when I was in the middle of work. And when I saw this, I had to try to get back home as fast as I could to record. And by the time I got there, I was already kind of in a frenzy, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3QECuK0_tE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>you can even just hear it in the video</u></a>. I was just screaming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That video in question has 1.5 million views and is, in fact, entertainingly frantic. But most of the videos on Araraura’s channel aren’t quite that big. Most of the “no news” videos have a few thousand views, unless there’s a particularly popular guest, which might bring them up into the tens of thousands. News days, of course, are far more popular, reaching into the hundreds of thousands of views. It’s not enough to make Araraura some kind of star YouTuber or anything, but he was able to make some money off the channel eventually.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/screenshot-2025-09-04-085244-1756972379175.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Big Silksong news day.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the start it took me half a year to get a channel monetized, because YouTube's requirement is to have 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in your videos, and it's really hard when your videos are like 20 seconds,” he says. “But yeah, eventually I made it, and it helped me build a nice side income. Not like something to live off of, but it was really nice financial support.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, Araraura says he never even considered quitting, and was even prepared to keep on going even if Silksong didn’t release in 2025. Sure, he didn’t realize when he started that he was signing up for four-and-a-half years of this video series. He thought it would be a year or two, max. But it was so easy to keep going once he started, he just charged onward. “It didn't feel like daunting or exhausting, or anything like that. It was just five minutes. It's like brushing your teeth. You don't even really think about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But today, that’s coming to an end. Araraura has published his final Silksong update to Daily Silksong News. In it, he does a face reveal, and shares some of his feelings about the channel and his work on it over the last few years. Turns out, as simple and goofy as his channel’s premise might be, it’s meant something to people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lately I've had a lot of people come up to me and tell me, ‘Thank you for going with the channel for this long and for giving us the news,’ all this stuff,” he says. “And it felt really surreal to see all of this. I knew I had a following and the people knew about my channel, but I don't know, seeing people being so, so grateful, it really hit in a different way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even so, Araraura doesn’t plan to continue the updates, even if Silksong gets DLC, though he points out that one of the mods from his Discord server has<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DailySilksongDLCNews" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> just made a new channel specifically for that</u></a>. Instead, Araraura is going to hand out some giveaway keys for Silksong as he promised his following, and then he’s going to log off. No streaming, no videos, “full blackout mode, no internet, all Silksong,” he says. “I just want to fully be immersed in Silksong and just enjoy it in peace.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Araraura says there might be one thing that could get him to publish one last Daily Silksong Update. “Team Cherry, if you're reading this, hit me up on Discord. We will try to make an extra day for you on the channel or something.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Be sure to stay up-to-date with all the latest from IGN by clicking </em><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJYGV?object_uuid=b89de07a-df65-427a-9fd2-14419cace841&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><em>here</em></u></a><em> and setting IGN as a preferred source in Google.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

This is the big anniversary update that makes a number of significant changes and additions to Saber Interactive’s explosive third-person action game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that while Patch 10 is live now, Season Pass 2 and the Black Templars and Imperial Fists cosmetics do not go live until later today, September 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 10.0 adds new game modes and maps, along with the Chaos Armour Pack, Champion Customisation, new weapons, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chaos Armour Pack is available for free. You can finally change the armour set of your Heretic Astartes in PvP, but you have to unlock the set first. Each class requires you to score a certain amount of kills per match to unlock the corresponding skin.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/swaglords-driplegion-1756984305758.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Chaos Armour Pack is free with Update 10.0. Image credit: Focus Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new PvP mode is Helbrute Onslaught, which is playable on all maps. Two teams of Chaos Marines fight to control strategic areas, but also to take control of the Helbrute. The first team to take control of an objective gets to control the Helbrute, until the opposite team takes it down. One player gets to control the Helbrute at a time, and this player is picked randomly among players who participated in securing the control point. For the team that failed to secure the first control point to have the Helbrute on their side, they need to slay their opponents’ Helbrute and secure a new designated control point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Controlling the Helbrute grants the team a strong advantage, but killing it rewards significant amounts of points to your team. The Helbrute uses a Helbrute Thunder Hammer in melee and a Plasma Cannon in range, and it can unleash a battle cry with its special skill to regenerate its HP.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/disturbingthepeace-1756984335976.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Patch 10 adds a playable Helbrute.

Unlike classic Operations, there are only two difficulty modes: Normal and Hard. What makes this new game mode different are the various Battlefield Conditions, which change every day and week and make each operation different. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Conditions can either help or hinder your progress. Upon successful completion, you receive a new currency called Accolades, which can be exchanged for valuable rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are weekly and daily Stratagems, and each Operation has its own set of modifiers. <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/253-august-community-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publisher Focus Entertainment provided a few examples</a>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Summoner</strong>: Every uninterrupted call for Reinforcements summons the Extremis enemy.</li><li><strong>Where you aiming at</strong>: Friendly fire damage from firearms and explosives is enabled</li><li><strong>Cadia Stands</strong>: Imperial Guards spawn on levels.</li><li><strong>Hunted</strong>: An unkillable Lictor constantly pursues you.

                <p>The Coalition recently released a new gnasher-based <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1963373829780378081?t=IFRx0LBZMIjAQf0j50nDfg&amp;s=09" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update</a> for Gears of War: Reloaded. Though the iconic weapon had already received a bit of tuning (thanks to feedback from the beta), the Gears community still felt that there was room for improvement. This is especially true when it came to how much damage the gnasher inflicted on unsuspecting players--dying by this shotgun-like weapon outside of its immediate range of fire always felt a little unfair.</p><p>One of the gnasher's main issues has always been its (seemingly) inconsistent damage. A lot of the attributing factors beyond player skill--like server issues, proper bullet spread during hip firing, etc.--have already been addressed. This latest patch, however, seeks to adjust some finer points to bring the gnasher more inline with expectations. For instance, its mid-range damage has been reduced by 15%. The bullet spread when aiming down sights has also been adjusted; while it’s still tighter than the beta version, the spread isn’t as tight as it was at launch.</p><p>Thankfully, The Coalition didn't stop at fine tuning the gnasher. This latest patch fixed several game crashing/stability-based bugs and added new visual options like VRR support on Xbox Series X|S in campaign mode. One outstanding issue, which has contributed to "mixed" user reviews on Steam, is the lack of local split-screen co-op support on PC. It's unknown if that will be added in the future.</p><p>Below are the brief patch notes:</p><p>Gnasher weapon tuning:</p><ul><li>Based on community feedback, we've tuned the Gnasher:</li><li>Reduced power at mid-range:</li><li>Damage modifications: medium-range damage reduced by 15% - does not affect close range damage.</li></ul><p>Bullet spread not as tight when aiming down sights:</p><ul><li>The Shotgun Pellet Spread when aiming down sights is now less tight when targeting compared to the launch version, but it is still tighter than the beta.</li></ul><p>Crash &amp; Stability Improvements</p><ul><li>Several rare crashes and bugs have been fixed across all platforms, making your experience smoother.</li></ul><p>Performance &amp; Visuals</p><ul><li>Ultrawide 21:9 monitors supported in benchmark mode Support for Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) on Xbox Series X|S in campaign mode.</li></ul><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
