            <p>
We've had a glut of articles about gloomier video games on here today, Rachel's bright and breezy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review">Dungeons Of Hinterberg review</a> notwithstanding. Tomorrow, I promise, it'll be wall-to-wall wholesome life sims, pastel petals and hug emojis as far as the eye can see. But before then, a quick piece on well-received DreadXP-published <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> sim The Mortuary Assistant, which will shortly be updated with an "endless embalming-only mode" that strips out the game's supernatural scares and turns it into a very downbeat job sim.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I say "downbeat", but I myself have never worked in a mortuary, and should resist making presumptions about the nature of the work. If you work in a mortuary, you may prefer to see tending to human remains as a cathartic labour, or a spiritual experience, or simply a dispassionate activity you do to pay the bills. Perhaps The Mortuary Assistant might qualify as "wholesome", given a positive acceptance of one's finitude and the frailty of the flesh. One obvious reference point here is A Mortician's Tale, which, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-morticians-tale-death-positive">Emma Kidwell wrote in 2017</a>, is "a rare breed [of game] which explains to us how our bodies will be treated after our demise and asks us not to be afraid of the process." You might also like to read Dan Hett's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-games-should-be-truly-honest-about-death">piece about exploring loss as a video game writer and designer</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Mortuary Assistant's endless embalming mode <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295920/view/4349997893936742751?l=english">arrives as a free update on 2nd August</a>, alongside the game's Definite Edition. In the base game, embalming corpses forms part of a story about identifying and repelling demonic invaders while investigating various long-buried secrets. Developers DarkStone Digital	use various procedural systems to cunningly rearrange the pieces and ensure a different cadence of scares and revelations every time.
</p>
<p>
It's not wholly clear how the new mode changes the game, but seemingly, it does away with all the demon stuff, and leaves you alone to practice your trade. It's not the only thing the update adds: there will also be new "haunt events", fresh lore, and new bodies to embalm. Also, a Valentine's Day seasonal event. That seems pretty wholesome? If you've not encountered the game before, there's still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295920/The_Mortuary_Assistant/">a demo on Steam</a>. If you have played already, you might like to know that DarkStone Digital are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-paranormal-activity-horror-game-in-the-works-from-the-creator-of-the-mortuary-assistant">now making a Paranormal Activity adaptation</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-gets-new-gameplay-footage/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you've been following Unknown 9: Awakening, developed by Reflector Entertainment LTD and published by Bandai Namco, brand-new gameplay footage shows off what you can expect to see in the story-rich game.</p>
<p>This title received a new trailer during<a href="https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-first-gameplay-summer-2024-release-date/"> Summer Games Fest</a> that finally gave players a glimpse into the world of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1477940/Unknown_9_Awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unknown 9: Awakening</a> and Haroona's powers. The title was first announced at Gamescom in 2020 and has been developing ever since. The game finally has a planned release date in the Fall of 2024.</p>
<p>In the new eight-minute video, you can see how the gameplay works in Unknown 9: Awakening while the gameplay is accompanied by developer commentary from Creative Director Christophe Rossignol. In this video, Rossignol explains the diverse world that Haroona will get to explore and how exploration ties in with the gameplay. Whether you want to be as stealthy as possible or as destructive as you can be, multiple play styles are available to anyone who dives into Unknown 9: Awakening.</p>
<p>This title features a unique mechanic called "stepping," where Haroona can control her enemies and put them in a position advantageous to her so that she can succeed in battle. This feature may be tricky to wield, but looking at the gameplay footage, it can be incredibly useful. By using her stepping ability, Haroona can temporarily move an enemy to attack then another enemy, which can be beneficial if she needs to plan an escape.</p>
<p>In battle, Haroona is seen to have other abilities that can manipulate the fold to her advantage. This includes her "peeking" ability, which allows her to see the positions of enemies so that you can plan your next attack tactfully and precisely. Haroona can also pull and push enemies, which can help attack enemies high on a cliff to try and avoid damage. She can pull them off the cliff and into a fire hazard, as seen in the footage.</p>
<p>Unknown 9: Awakening features some stunning vistas in the distance, as Haroona has to travel far and wide to understand her powers. This will take her through the deep jungles of India, the Mauritanian desert, and many more fascinating locations, allowing Haroona to bolster her powers differently in each location. Secrets hide around every corner when in exploration mode, and going off of the beaten path can prove to be an asset, as she can find items that can benefit her later in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unknown 9: Awakening – Gameplay Walkthrough with Dev Commentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SqOqGkh_flE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unknown 9: Awakening will be available on Steam, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 in Fall 2024.</p>

It combined the feel of an old-school arena shooter with the novel and brain-tickling mechanic of on-demand portals. Now the team behind it is promising a sequel that’s bigger, better, and coming sometime in 2025 to join an increasingly crowded field of would-be live-service juggernauts. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196909" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Made by 1047 Games, <em>Splitgate 2</em> will still be free-to-play and remain cross-gen on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in addition to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as well as come to PC. Here’s how the studio describes it: “Three unique factions grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies, while a large variety of arenas, weapons and modes keep things fresh.”</p><p>And here’s the cinematic trailer announcing the game:</p><p>This time around, the game is being made in Unreal Engine 5 and with a team much bigger than the original, full of veterans from competitors like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Overwatch, </em>and <em>Valorant </em>as well as single-player games like <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em> and <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. </em>There’s a free app you can download to learn more about the in-game universe and even a five-issue comic book arc, because in 2024 it’s no longer enough just to show a trailer that looks cool for a game that’s fun to play. </p><p>Originally launched in Early Access in 2019, it wasn’t until <em>Splitgate</em> went into beta across PC and console that interest in the mashup reached a fever pitch that led to sporadic outages and downtime to fix server issues. The developers eventually abandoned the game in 2022 to work on the sequel. The servers remain up, however, and people are still playing today. </p><p>A few matches of <em>Splitgate</em> provides a good sense of the promise and potential of its gameplay feel and mechanics if 1047 is able to nail the art direction, world building, and map design this time around. Based on the initial trailer, characters in<em> Splitgate 2</em> are still looking a little bland visually, but the arena looks interesting enough, at least for a cinematic reveal. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Raising animals in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> will require you to have the appropriate building for it, like the barn. Having a barn allows you to raise cows, which reliably provide milk, so long as you take care of them. But if you really want to maximize the value of your barn animals, you will want to upgrade the structure. Upgrading the barn unlocks new animals, increases the number of animals you can have, an auto-feed feature, and more. Here are the details on how to upgrade from the base barn to the Big Barn and Deluxe Barn.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Every barn upgrade</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336042-barn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336042" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336042-barn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336042"></a><figcaption>The fully upgraded barn can hold up to 12 animals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4336042-barn.jpg"></figure><h3>Base Barn</h3><p>Before you can upgrade your barn, you will need to build the base version first. The barn can be built by purchasing it from the Carpenter and providing the necessary materials. The barn takes up a 7x4 space on your farm, which will not increase even when you upgrade the barn. It takes three days to build. <strong>The required materials are 6,000G, 350 wood, and 150 stone.</strong> The initial barn allows you to purchase cows from Marnie's Ranch for 1,500G each, and it can hold up to four animals.</p><h3>Big Barn</h3><p dir="ltr">The next version of the barn is the Big Barn. <strong>Upgrading to the Big Barn requires 12,000G, 450 wood, and 200 stone</strong>. Upgrading the barn only takes two days and it is still usable during this time. The Big Barn can hold up to eight animals and allows animals to get pregnant. It also unlocks goats, which can be purchased for 4,000G from Marnie's Ranch. Goats produce goat milk every two days.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Deluxe Barn</h3><p dir="ltr">The third and final barn upgrade is the Deluxe Barn. <strong>Upgrading to the Deluxe Barn requires 25,000G, 550 wood, and 300 stone. </strong> The Deluxe Barn can hold up to 12 animals and adds the auto-feed system, which will automatically fill the trough with hay, so long as you have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-hay-in-stardew-valley/1100-6525028/">silo with hay in it.</a> This also adds two new animals to Marnie's Ranch for purchase: pigs and sheep. Pigs cost 16,000G and can find truffles if you allow them to go outside. Sheep cost 8,000G and grow wool, which can be sheared every couple of days.</p><p dir="ltr">So long as you have space on your farm for the building, you can construct as many barns as you want, but each barn will have to go through the upgrades each time to reach the Deluxe Barn.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-rog-ally/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-makes-impressive-quick-progress-emulator-can-run-undemanding-games-on-rog-ally.930918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-rog-ally/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is making excellent progress and is now apparently close to getting in-game in a popular title.</p>
<p>Two videos shared on YouTube this week by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gmoralistube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeorgeMoralis</a> highlight how the 0.1.1 version of the emulator, which is currently in the works and now yet available for download, can load up Dark Souls Remastered, get into the character creation menu, and even load up the introduction movie. While the emulator still can't get in-game, this is amazing progress that bodes extremely well for the future, considering how quickly things are improving.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Souls Remaster - Shadps4 v0.1.1 WIP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvTSjdwXLTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Souls Remaster again... Shadps4 v0.1.1 WIP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HqNUtYBm1Wg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ShadPS4 may also make playing PlayStation 4 games on the go a reality. Earlier this week, MaliceSpeedwagon shared a video showcasing eight games running via the emulator on an ROG Ally in Turbo Mode. While Bloodborne doesn't even boot up, far less demanding games like Sonic Mania and Undertale already seem to run great, so it is still impressive, considering the emulator is still very early in development.</p>
<p><iframe title="ShadPS4 (v0.1.0) Emulator Tested In 8 Games On The Rog Ally Ryzen Z1 Extreme In Turbo Mode" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wjBpM0yTNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ShadPS4 emulator isn't the only PlayStation 4 emulator actively in the works, but it's been quickly gaining attention thanks to the steady and quick progress it has been making. It is also capable of booting up <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-emulator-improves-bloodborne-pc/">Bloodborne</a> and getting up to the character creation menu, so the day when the game will finally be playable on PC may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found by going <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4">here</a>. The 0.1.0 version is also available for download for free.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-speed-freeks-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Plaion and developer Caged Element have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>release date, and the chaotic combat racing game is heading to PC via Steam Early Access later this summer.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://press.plaion.com/WARHAMMER-40000-SPEED-FREEKS-EARLY-ACCESS-LAUNCHES-ON-AUGUST-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>crashes the Early Access party on August 6th, which is also when the game's first season will begin. It'll be free-to-play, too, so it won't cost you anything to check it out.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Speed Freeks</em>, it's a car combat game that revolves around&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k</em>'s Orks, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40k-10th-edition-orks-previewed">biologically-engineered race of violence-obsessed xenos</a>. Who better to "drive" (ahem) a game about blowing other players to smithereens with bumper-mounted rocket launchers?</p>

<p>When the game launches, you'll have a choice between two core game modes: Deff Rally and Kill Konvoy. In the former, you'll compete to capture points and control them before sprinting to the finish line, while the latter sees you protecting a Stompa and attempting to destroy its counterpart on the enemy team.</p>
<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which gives a good sense of just how chaotic this one's going to be, right here.</p>

On a dark and stormy night, a young boy asks his not-at-all creepy clown-looking attendant to tell him a story. The attendant dives into a tale about the War of the Reapers, a (fictional) conflict between humans and demons. Humanity only prevailed thanks to forging five armlets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-lotr-gollum-kotaku-review-worst-game-2023-1850606133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-lotr-gollum-kotaku-review-worst-game-2023-1850606133"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a></span>-style, with the power to contain the demons. The story ends and the attendant reveals that many years have passed, and now England and France are engaged in their own war that has lasted close to a century. This is the (historical) conflict known as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hundred Years’ War</a></span>, and the boy is Henry VI, King of England. To change the tides of war the attendant, John of Lancaster for you history buffs, calls upon those demons of old. I cannot stress enough how hard this goes, despite being admittedly silly. Just imagine someone having no previous knowledge of what this game is about and getting the twist that it’s about a real conflict between England and France. Oh, and there are demons involved.</p><p>After that amazing opening, we finally meet our heroine, a young woman in the village of Domrémy, named Jeanne. To get the action started, the game sends Jeanne and her friend Liane into the woods to search for a missing man, Roger. In their search, the two women come upon a dead knight and a small group of demons. Jeanne finds a mysterious armlet on the knight, picks it up, and begins to hear a voice. Then combat begins. </p><p>In the few encounters I’ve had so far, the game’s combat is pretty standard tactical RPG fare. You and the enemy take turns moving and attacking until you meet the encounter’s win conditions, usually just taking out all enemies. Soon, Jeanne activates the power in her armlet and gets a sick <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/we-tried-to-uncover-the-long-lost-american-sailor-moon-1827695456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/we-tried-to-uncover-the-long-lost-american-sailor-moon-1827695456"><em>Sailor Moon</em></a></span> transformation that dresses her in badass armor. The new fit also lets you use special abilities, like one that gives you an extra turn of movement after defeating an enemy. In one encounter I was able to take out four enemies in a row thanks to smart use of that specific ability. As the game gets more complex and I learn new abilities I can only imagine how this will add to the strategic possibilities at play. </p><figure id="" data-id="3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-recommend-id="image://3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde girl swings a sword at a pig-like creature in a burning village" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blonde girl swings a sword at a pig-like creature in a burning village" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-recommend-id="image://3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde girl swings a sword at a pig-like creature in a burning village" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of my first hour was spent asking questions about what the rest of my playthrough will hold. Is the voice Jeanne hears the Roman Catholic God? Is England literally in cahoots with the biblical devil? Am I going to see Jeanne burned to death before the game rolls credits? Clearly <em>Jeanne d’Arc </em>is willing to play fast and loose with the history books, so I think it’ll be kind of hilarious to see how demons pop up at the siege of Orléans—because what are we doing if the Joan of Arc game doesn’t have the siege of Orléans?<br></p><p>So far <em>Jeanne d’Arc</em> has proven to be a tactical RPG with room to grow as I get deeper into it. It is also an exceedingly silly story that I doubt will do much justice to the complexities of the real woman, and yet I can’t help but enjoy it every time the game puts demons next to historical figures. It’s like the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> of tactical RPGs and like with those games, I’m not coming back to this one for historical accuracy. I’m here for a fun time, not an educational one. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veMD9nuQ1Xk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Respawn revealed the Void Reckoning event, which includes more cosmetics and the new Big TDM limited-time mode.</p>



<p>Big TDM will introduce a 12v12 version of the classic Team Deathmatch mode. The official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/void-reckoning-event" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> revealed further details about the mode and its balancing. </p>



<p>It will feature 5 different maps to compete on, as well as “improved health regeneration and an increased score limit of 60.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Apex Legends: Void Reckoning Event Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/veMD9nuQ1Xk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Void Reckoning will also add 22 limited-time cosmetics, each counting towards bonus rewards after earning 5, 12, and 17 items. </p>



<p>There will be no duplicate event items in the Void Reckoning event packs, though each pack only has one event item. Players can get these packs to earn all event items, including the “Crestfallen Stars” reactive havoc. </p>



<p>Apex Legends recently faced serious fan backlash after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass overhaul</a>. It split the Battle Pass into two per season. </p>



<p>Notably, it also removed the option to purchase them with Apex Coins, the in-game currency. Fans must now pay with real-world currency for two Battle Passes each season to earn all content.</p>



<p>Players quickly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-review-bombed-over-new-battle-pass-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review-bombed the game</a> this week, in turn causing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-esports-world-cup-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overall community to plummet</a>. Although the Void Reckoning event has a neat LTM, it may not be enough to begin renewing interest among longtime fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-re-announced-with-a-much-bigger-team-and-bigger-dreams<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When Ian Proulx and his colleagues at 1047 fully released Splitgate in 2021, his expectations for the “Halo with Portals” multiplayer shooter were fully in check. He expected it to do well enough over time, and was hoping for slow and steady growth. At the time, 1047 consisted of less than 20 individuals, and only four engineers.</p><p>“But it was like, nope, this is your moment now, everything's on fire,” Proulx says.</p><p>Splitgate blew up far beyond what Proulx ever expected or what their small indie team were ready to handle. It peaked, he says, at around two million daily active users, and the team spent the next several months in “fire fighting mode” trying to keep the game stable amid the surge of interest.</p><p>Fortunately for Proulx and 1047, Splitgate was a financial success for the team. What’s more, 1047 was able to raise an additional $100 million from investors thanks to the game’s positive reception. At first, they expected to pour that money into building and maintaining Splitgate. But in conversation after conversation, Proulx and his colleagues found they had to keep their ambitions in check due to the game’s technical and the team’s personnel limitations. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“When you're making an indie game, it's really about finding your niche, doing a few things really, really well,” Proulx says. “But then you do have to cut corners, because you don't have the resources of a Call of Duty. And so our view at the time was like, wow, we're licking our lips. We're thinking, man, we don't have to cut corners like this. What if we could do it all over again?”</p><p>Which is exactly what 1047 decided to do. In 2022, the team announced they were ending active development on Splitgate in the interest of building Splitgate 2.</p><p>“We know what Splitgate does well, and we know where it falls short,” Proulx explains. “And we also felt like our goal is we want to build one of the biggest shooters in the world. We want to be out there competing with Call of Duty, and Apex, and Fortnite. And we didn't feel like we could ever get there by continuing to iterate on Splitgate.”</p><h2>A new trajectory</h2><p>Today, 1047 has officially announced Splitgate 2 for release on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox sometime in 2025, with a first cinematic trailer showing off the sequel’s vibes and introducing its factions. Starting today, fans can download a Splitgate 2 Companion App, which includes a free digital comic series developing the lore of the universe, quizzes, collectible digital cards, and other activities. And 1047 is planning for a community play test later this year, sometime around Gamescom.</p><p>Proulx tells me that Splitgate 2 is still fundamentally Splitgate: it’s still a free-to-play (with only cosmetic microtransactions, Proulx reassures), first-person shooter with 4v4 battles. It’s still a shooter where players mess around with portals and physics to fling themselves or their enemies around at wild angles and speeds. The biggest difference between the sequel and its predecessor is the introduction of three different factions, each tailored to a different gameplay style or strategy. 1047 isn’t saying much about the details on these factions for now, though today’s cinematic trailer offers some clues as to the vibes on offer. Proulx loves lore, which is why he channeled his love of old Halo novels into the Splitgate 2 companion comic as a way to define art style, characters, and factions for the audience ahead of the game’s release. He tells me the three pillars he wants his team aiming for are “positive,” “sporty,” and “future.” </p><p>“We're not killing each other to save humanity or to defeat evil,” he says. “It's a sport. And so that reflects itself in the lore, in the art style. You saw a very small smidge of that in Splitgate, because that was always my original vision is I wanted it to be a sport.”</p><p>Apart from the addition of factions, Proulx says the most noticeable difference between Splitgate 1 and 2 is the map design. In Splitgate, he tells me, he ended up as the map designer somewhat by default. But for Splitgate 2, he hired professionals.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want a universe that I want to live in.</p></div><p>”I had no clue what I was doing [in Splitgate 1],” he says. “Some of [the maps] are okay, but we have real level designers now who are phenomenal. And they're also, not only are they way better than me, but it's just our process. Everybody's iterating, we're play testing, we've got just much more of an iterative process. We're not afraid to test a map and throw it away and start over. And so what we've ended up with is, I think, by far our best maps ever. But also just much more actual guidelines and thought put into the maps.”</p><p>For example, he says, the walls on which players could place portals were placed “kind of randomly” in the original game. But now, with the combined experience and data from players using them over the years, the team has a better understanding of what kind of placement works well, and what doesn’t. As a result, there are fewer portal walls in Splitgate 2 than in 1, but their placement is more deliberate.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Splitgate 2 First Reveal Images</h3></div></output><p>“Splitgate was much more of an arena shooter, fast-paced, very circular motion,” Proulx adds. “With this next game, it's much more of a class-based shooter or arcade shooter where it's still fast-paced. It's still about shooting people and portaling, but it's a little bit more thoughtful, it's a little bit more strategic. The angles are a little bit more intentional and less chaotic.”</p><p>Proulx and his studio have, in some ways, dodged an industry bullet. They accumulated enough funding to make Splitgate 2 ahead of the recent industry funding crisis, and were able to scale up 1047 from less than 20 people to over 170 with senior talent from games including Call of Duty and God of War: Ragnarok. And during that time, Proulx has been obsessing over live ops, preparing the team and Splitgate 2 to handle whatever happens during its launch days and weeks. He also has a two-year roadmap for future updates – though he expects that will inevitably change based on community feedback. Whatever happens when Splitgate 2 launches next year, this time, Proulx is prepared.</p><p>“The dream truly is to build the number one shooter in the world,” he says. “That's what I'm going to fight for forever. I think though, really, if we can make a game that all the Splitgate 1 fans love and are sticking around forever, but also broadening our scope so that the people who never got to enjoy Splitgate can enjoy this game as well. That's what success would look like to me.”</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip? Send it to rvalentine@ign.com.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With each new season, Activision typically releases a new BlackCell DLC pack, and that trend will continue with the July 24 release of Season 5 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Modern Warfare III</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>.</p><p>The new Season 5 BlackCell bundle comes with a new operator, Reckoner, who sports an animated skin that "occasionally reveals the ghoul within." The bundle comes with multiple other skins as well, and, like usual, the new BlackCell operator has black-and-yellow armor with spark effects.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4336231-screenshot2024-07-18at11.09.03am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336231" data-ratio="0.55756578947368" data-width="608" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4336231-screenshot2024-07-18at11.09.03am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336231"></a><figcaption>Season 5's new BlackCell bundle is coming soon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4336231-screenshot2024-07-18at11.09.03am.png"></figure><p>Everyone who buys the new BlackCell bundle gets access to an exclusive sector of the battle map, along with 20 battle token tier skips and these items listed below:</p><ul><li>1,100 COD Points</li><li>"Long Live the King BlackCell" Blueprint for the Superi SMG with "Inquisitor" Tracers and "Divine Enforcement" Death Effect.</li><li>"Malleus BlackCell" Blueprint for the Sledgehammer Melee weapon with "Inquisitor" Impact and "Divine Enforcement" Dismemberment</li><li>"Reckoner" Operator</li><li>"Judge, Jury, and Finisher" Finishing Move.</li></ul><p>There are other BlackCell-specific rewards in the Season 5 battle pass, including 11 total operator skins and seven animated weapon blueprints.</p><p>Anyone who upgrades to BlackCell after buying the Season 5 battle pass will get 1,100 COD points returned to them.

                <p>Call of Duty is known for its crossover characters, but could The Crow be next? That's what fans are theorizing after Activision published the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-5-roadmap-reveal-wwes-cody-rhodes-and-rey-mysterio-as-operators/1100-6525067/" data-ref-id="1100-6525067">first details on Season 5</a>. The roadmap image includes a "classified" image of an Operator coming to the game mid-season, and people think it's Bill Skarsgard's new take on the character from the upcoming remake.</p><p>Indeed, a zoomed-in image seems to match up with the silhouette of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bill-skarsgard-takes-flight-in-first-new-crow-trailer/1100-6521850/" data-ref-id="1100-6521850">Skarsgard's rendition of the character. </a> The Crow releases in theaters in the US on August 23, so if the character is indeed coming to Call of Duty, fans can likely expect it to happen around then.</p><p>Call of Duty was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-might-include-a-deadpool-wolverine-crossover-in-season-5/1100-6524622/" data-ref-id="1100-6524622">rumored to have a Deadpool &amp; Wolverine collaboration</a>, but it remains to be seen if that will happen. There was no mention or tease for any possible crossover in the Season 5 rundown. The new season is, however, adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-5-trailer-shows-off-cel-shaded-maps-and-wwes-rhea-ripley/1100-6525062/" data-ref-id="1100-6525062">WWE's Rhea Ripley, Cody Rhodes, and Rey Mysterio.</a></p><p>Season 5 releases on July 24, with content to continue rolling out in the weeks and months after. In addition to the WWE characters, Season 5 adds new maps, weapons, and 15 minigames.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's Call of Duty Season 5 rundown to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-5-roadmap-reveal-wwes-cody-rhodes-and-rey-mysterio-as-operators/1100-6525067/" data-ref-id="1100-6525067">what's coming to Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile.</a> The next Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Black Ops 6</a>, launches in October, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">multiplayer beta kicks off in August. </a></p>
