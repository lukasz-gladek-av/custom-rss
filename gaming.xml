            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/olympic-nfts-mario-sonic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report suggests that the fact there's no&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>game this year is at least partially thanks to the Olympic authorities wanting to explore the possibilities of NFTs.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a> (which cites a conversation with series veteran Lee Cocker), the International Olympic Committee (IOC) let its agreements with Nintendo and Sega lapse in order to explore what Cocker calls "other partners and NFTs and esports".</p>
<p>As Cocker tells it, the reason behind the agreements lapsing is a pretty sad one; the IOC wanted to explore opportunities to "get more money" through signing up with other partners in order to "bring it back to themselves internally".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-and-sonic-olympics-nfts-swimming.jpg?itok=7cuhDF0d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-and-sonic-olympics-nfts-swimming.jpg?itok=L1uvKJxv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like we're not getting any more&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&nbsp;</em>titles anytime soon.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems that the&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>series won't be keeping up with the times, as no Paris Olympics tie-in has been announced. Instead, the IOC is focusing on free-to-play game&nbsp;<em>Olympics Go! Paris 2024</em>, which is developed by nWay, a company that also offers the chance to <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">purchase Paris Olympics-themed NFTs on its website</a>.</p>
<p>If it is true that the IOC abandoned&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>for what is essentially the chance to make a quick buck, then I think we've lost something special. The&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>series isn't exactly high art, but it's reliably fun, especially with friends, so not getting the chance to play any more games in this series is a tragic loss, if you ask me. That goes double if the alternative is a free-to-play mobile game that's propping up NFTs.</p>
<p>It's doubly unfortunate because there's not much that's plugging the gap left by the&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>series. The aforementioned free-to-play game doesn't really offer the same experience, so we'll have to wait for the indie sphere to come up with something similar. Let's hope there are enough&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>fans out there for that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-and-sonic-olympics-nfts-racing.jpg?itok=EVg4nrc3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-and-sonic-olympics-nfts-racing.jpg?itok=MekUJkIW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Say goodbye to the&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only is there no&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>game for this year's Olympic Games, but there's no official game along the lines of the snappily-titled&nbsp;<em>Olympic Games Tokyo 2020: Official Video Game&nbsp;</em>either, likely for the same reasons outlined above. Sadly, it looks like we're going to have a bit of a wait on our hands for the next premium Olympics tie-in.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to relive the glory days of the&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic&nbsp;</em>franchise, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Mario-Sonic-at-the-Olympic-Games-Tokyo-2020-1575303.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here on Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

Uploaded on July 26, just a day after <em>Fallout: London</em>’s release, the description sums up what the mod is all about: “Are you an American exploring London for the first time and find some of the lingo a bit confusing? Have no fear! The soccer ball is now properly named so as to avoid confusion with a real football.” A recent 1.1 update now also changes the Football Kit outfit to the Soccer Uniform. As one commenter on in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/11?tab=posts&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/11?tab=posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion area</a></span> of the Nexus Mods page puts it, “immersion restored.”</p><figure id="" data-id="f0b054226f801c77df5649d96727ecca" data-recommend-id="image://f0b054226f801c77df5649d96727ecca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A soccer ball floats in the air with text that reads &quot;Soccer Ball&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A soccer ball floats in the air with text that reads &quot;Soccer Ball&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Team FOLON</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f0b054226f801c77df5649d96727ecca" data-recommend-id="image://f0b054226f801c77df5649d96727ecca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A soccer ball floats in the air with text that reads &quot;Soccer Ball&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But the Brits have found the mod and are expressing their disdain for this sacrilegious change. “Well, it’s this mod who breaks the immersion,” fires back one angry commenter, “but Americans always think their wording is right, while the whole world knows better.” That’s a pretty measured response when compared to what else you can find about the mod. “Reporting this mod for terrorism,” writes another peeved customer, “Absolutely dastardly behaviour, you deserve a hundred fortnights in the stocks.” You can tell by the useless “u” in “behavior” that this is an angry Brit.<br></p><p>But what is most surprising is how the conversation has devolved into a full-fledged history-lesson on what the sport of soccer (or football, I guess) even is. I don’t know that much about the sport, but just by reading through the comments I feel like I’m getting a crash course. For example, as one commenter points out in a lengthy post, did you know that soccer is actually what the UK called the sport when it was brought over to the U.S.? Apparently it comes from “assoccer”, a slang word for association football originally coined at Oxford University. The post goes on to explain how rugby and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/football-the-kotaku-review-5980571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/football-the-kotaku-review-5980571">American football</a></span> all tie into the story as well, but I’m not gonna recount all of that. There are currently nine pages of comments on the mod, many of which get into the nitty-gritty details of the sport.</p><hr><p>Of course, It’s A Soccer Ball is ultimately a big joke. The mod itself is tagged both as “horror” and “humor, joke, or just for fun.” It’s meant to be a silly thing that nobody should take seriously, though someone should probably tell the comments section that.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Available now on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this playable slice lets players experience the game’s first chapter and a big boss fight.</p>

<p>The demo begins in the middle of Chapter 1 at Rime Falls and takes players through areas such as Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. The chapter’s final boss, the Kraken, awaits the playable party of Val, Careena, and Morley.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHIJtLufSsM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Unfortunately, save data will not transfer from the demo to the full game. Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years. Set in a vibrant, semi-open, fully 3D world, the adventure stars Val, who travels to the Mana Tree alongside his lifelong friend Hinna. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/12/visions-of-mana-gets-august-release-date-in-new-trailer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visions of Mana launches on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.</p>

            <p>I am a big Hobbit and Lord of the Rings fan. That whole world that Tolkien created fills me with an immense amount of wonder and awe. While I don't fancy coming face to face with an orc anytime soon, I would relish the opportunity to explore Middle-earth with my backpack full of lembas bread and a pint from the Prancing Pony in hand.</p>
<p>That is why when I was scrolling through X the other day, I stopped and did a brief double take. In a welcome change to some of the rubbish on social media these days, my algorithm had presented me with a beautiful, photorealistic re-imagining of Lord Of The Rings' The Argonath scene, made in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>For a tranquil minute and a half, I was transported from my desk to a small boat on the River Anduin, as the two monumental statues made famous in Fellowship of the Ring watched over me. After playing the video again, I quickly got in touch with the footage's creator Micah Malinics to find out more about his project, and - importantly - if I would ever get the chance to play through this fan-made recreation myself.</p>

<p>"The idea for the scene actually came from a prompt I had given myself, which was 'What games should exist, but don't?' and after jotting down a bunch of ideas, a bunch of Lord of the Rings ones really gravitated toward me," Malinics tells me via email.</p>
<p>"So I actually wanted to create a LOTR 'proof of concept' tiny adventure game like this silly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aBGnmQ8Gntc">Shrek Western </a>I had made, but after a friend shared Leo Torres' beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0DKoV4SbLY">river jungle</a> scene, I immediately wanted to do the Argonath scene from Fellowship of the Ring as a first person experience."</p>
<p>On the technical side of things, this scene was made in Unreal Engine 5.4, using Lumen and Nanite heavily. "The scene still ran at a steady 30-50 fps on an RTX 3080Ti. And you could lower the graphics yet to perform on other machines," Malinics adds.</p>
<p>"The fluid system is completely dynamic, so it automatically interacts with the geometry in the scene. To me that is the most impressive part, and it's all a result of the masterful Fluid Flux plugin."</p>
<p>You can check out Malinics' scene, which was made in "six days from start to finish", via the video below.</p>

<p>Malinics now wants to work on some of the other ideas he jotted down during this brainstorming session. This includes a Helm's Deep scene with a dynamic weather system which changes from the iconic moment's pre-battle sunset to the storming night time. And of course that marching Orc army would also be there. </p>
<p>"I also have been playing around with movement mechanics a lot, and it would be fun to create a little moment when you are the hobbits running away from the Ringwraith on your way to the Prancing Pony," he continues. "There's so much you could do there that it could almost be it's own game in the vein of 'escape the monster' type genre. I hope to make both at some point - as it's such a blast utilising this technology to re-imagine Tolkien's world, and of course the Peter Jackson films are the ultimate visual inspiration."</p>
<p>However, while Malinics has all of these new ideas waiting to be realised, he tells me "if there was enough demand for the Argonath scene" it could be released as a playable project.</p>
<p>"[Unreal Engine] would handle it like a champ, but the challenges to releasing it be a good amount of project cleanup, some optimisation, and there are some areas that aren't fully built out for a 360 degree viewing experience, so I would need to go back in and finish building out those parts of the environment," he says.</p>
<p>"The project sits at a whopping 100GB right now, so it's also not yet 'release' friendly haha."</p>

<p>Malinics originally wanted to expand this scene so the boat could dock on a beach after it passes the Argonath, and the player would then be able to walk around the beach area. "I also was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v75dSep_kbE">this creator</a> to add Orcs in the woods that you can ride the boat past," he says. However, at this time, this would have been "more of an easter egg" than a playable experience. </p>
<p>"If I had more time I would have added those, but I started to get eager to finish this scene up."</p>
<p>So in short, "it just comes down to prioritising time," Malinics says regarding that playable demo, before adding: "If there's a big rally for it and demand, I'm happy to put in the time. Otherwise, I have some other cool stuff I'm really excited to make that I think people will enjoy, too!"</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-influencer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespect-was-just-%E2%80%98an-influencer%E2%80%99-for-midnight-society-studio-claims.940368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-influencer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Dr Disrespect is still missing from the internet after disappearing on vacation with his family following the controversy that surfaced little more than a month ago. In a shocking revelation, it came to light that Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm had been banned on Twitch in 2020 because of an incident in 2017 during which Dr Disrespect knowingly and inappropriately messaged a minor on the platform.</p>



<p>He subsequently lost his spot with Midnight Society shortly after this news dropped, per a new report by Bloomberg. In this interview, Midnight Society’s Robert Bowling set the story straight about Dr Disrespect’s claimed involvement with the ‘Deadrop’ extraction shooter project.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-an-influencer">Just an Influencer</h2>



<p>Robert Bowling spoke to Bloomberg, attempting to soothe troubled waters by stressing that Dr Disrespect was only involved in the Deadrop project as an influencer. From the moment Deadrop went public, Dr Disrespect appeared to be the face of the project, heavily involved in marketing the game and keeping his followers updated regarding the ongoing development of this ambitious extraction shooter.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-30/how-dr-disrespect-almost-derailed-new-studio-s-first-video-game?embedded-c">In the interview</a>, Bowling explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>His job as an influencer was to bring eyeballs and community to it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was explained that he was brought into the fold to ‘exploit his 4.5 million YouTube subscribers’. </p>



<p>Bowling went on to explain that when the allegations about Dr Disrespect dropped online, they held an emergency call, during which Beahm joined and straight up admitted to messaging a minor on Twitch in 2017. On that topic, Bowling said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We knew it was the right decision after talking everything over with all four of us. We made agreements on what our principles were and are as a studio, and his actions don’t align with our principles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not known if or when Dr Disrespect will resurface. If he does, some theories suggest he’ll rebrand or relocate to another platform, like Kick. The big question is, will he have anything tangible to come back to?</p>

			<p>A new Elden Ring patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing some welcome improvements to summoned spirits and plenty of other balance changes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.13 focuses on balance changes, introducing some PvP-exclusive changes alongside some general ones which improve the Repeating Crossbow, Spread Crossbow, Rabbath's Cannon, Shield of Night, Golem Fist armaments, among others, the Savage Lion's Claw, Swift Slash, Overhead Stance skills, among others, select spells and incantations. The biggest changes, however, were made to several summoned spirits, which now hit harder and have better damage negation when the Revered Spirit Ash Blessing is at 5 or more and when upgraded to +8 or higher. The Mimic Tear, however, hasn't been changed, which isn't surprising considering how effective it continues to be even after getting nerfed since the game's launch.</p>
<p>Rounding up the Elden Ring 1.13 patch are multiple bug fixes. You can learn everything there is to know about the new update by going<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-113"> here.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring and its expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the expansion by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>

			<p>Garry Newman, the creator of Garry's Mod, has received a DMCA on behalf of the SKibidi Toilet creator. The DMCA is a notice for utilizing Skibidi Toilet assets in Garry's Mod, which he is claiming to be his assets. However, most of the assets from Skibidi Toilet come from Half-Life 2, meaning that the creator of Skibidi Toilet doesn't really have a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>Despite the DMCA being sent on behalf of the creator, they did not approve of the DMCA or ask them to send it in the first place. "Significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere. There is absolutely no licensed Steam, Valve, Garry's Mod content related to Skibidi Toilet." In addition to this statement, they go on to provide their Copyright Registration Number, which shows everything within the meme content that has a copyright.</p>
<p>This includes characters such as "Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, Titan TV Man, and Skibidi Toilet" who all have their own copyrights, giving them the rights to characters developed with Half-Life 2 assets that are owned by Valve.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what will happen with this DMCA attempt going forward, as Skibidi Toilet blatantly uses Half-Life 2 assets belonging to <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadlock-footage-leak-characters-world-details/">Valve</a>. The creator of the meme content released a small statement on their Discord server. <a href="https://x.com/Thafnine/status/1818112776403132615/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They go on to say</a>, "Sup y'all. Is there a way to contact Garry? I did NOT strike Garry's Mod, and I'm trying to understand what else is written in the letter!"</p>
<p>The company Invisible Narratives, owned by Adam Goodman and Michael Bay, created this DMCA on behalf of the creator. In recent news, this company has secured the rights to create a Skibidi Toilet movie. It remains to be seen whether this strike came as a joke or whether they were illogical when writing the letter to be sent to Garry Newman.</p>
<p>Whether or not Valve will get involved in this process or whether Garry Newman will make a statement on the DMCA is unknown for now. Still, it's unlikely that Invisible Narratives will have a leg to stand on, considering that the assets they use for the meme content already belong to Valve, regardless of whether they have copyright over the characters or not.</p>

<p>EA Sports has pushed a new patch for College Football 25. The update comes days after the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-releases-future-update-notes-on-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced various plans</a> for future updates to the game.</p>



<p>“[Tuesday] morning, we distributed a smaller title update which is designed to address some issues that have been affecting your gameplay experience,”  the post on the <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/College-Football-25-Title-Update-July-30th-2024/m-p/13917585/thread-id/3338?utm_campaign=cf25_pub_ww_ic_soco_twt_title-update-july-30&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=81003&amp;ts=1722349509163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s official forums reads.</a> </p>



<p>While this first patch doesn’t address all of what EA Sports is working on, it does address a few small issues along with increasing server stability. The studio says that a larger title update is coming “in the near future”.</p>



<p>When that major update drops, it will receive a full Campus Huddle post from EA detailing the full scope of those updates. According to multiple sources, another update on the first major patch is expected to come over the next couple of weeks or so. The goal, they said, is to make sure nothing gets pushed that might cause other issues to arise to they are taking extra time to get things done.</p>

"They wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports," said <a href="https://leecocker.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lee Cocker</a>, who worked on the series and spoke with Eurogamer. "Basically the IOC wanted to bring [it] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Cocker spent almost two decades at <a href="https://www.ismltd.com/about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ISM Fantasy Games</a>, a company that counts itself as one of the "creators of the worldwide Mario &amp; Sonic Olympic Games series." ISM also touts that the now-discontinued franchise "sold over 30 million copies."</p><p dir="ltr">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games began in 2007 on Wii, with the title celebrating the 2008 Beijing Games. It's also notable for teaming up the two iconic mascots, especially after the console wars between Nintendo and Sega in the 1990s.</p><p dir="ltr">Eurogamer points out that instead of Mario &amp; Sonic, the IOC has <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Olympic Go! Paris 2024</a> as the main video game release for this year's Olympics. It's a free-to-play title available on mobile and PC. And yes, there are NFT digital pins to collect separately, as well. Meanwhile, next year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-olympic-esports-games-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia/1100-6524936/" data-ref-id="1100-6524936">IOC is bringing the 2025 Olympic Esports to Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and this one is all about fire, so if you're a fan of flamethrowers and incendiary weapons, you're in luck.</p>
<p>In some ways, the Freedom's Flame Warbond, which lands on August 8th, is the polar opposite (hem, hem) of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond">Polar Patriots Warbond</a>, although this one's packing significantly more weaponry themed around its title.</p>
<p>First up, you're getting two new primary weapons. The SG-451 Cookout, which is likely named after Ray Bradbury's iconic&nbsp;<em>Fahrenheit 451&nbsp;</em>(or perhaps the temperature to which the title refers), is a "pump action shotgun that unleashes a burst of incendiary phosphorus pellets". Sounds like fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-flamethrower.jpg?itok=RVqijWHu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-flamethrower.jpg?itok=xPw5BJGX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond is perfect for fans of fire.</figcaption></figure><p>The second new primary weapon is a literal flamethrower. The FLAM-66 Torcher works in a similar way to&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s existing flamethrowers, so make sure that you're not near your squadmates when you start blasting (or, alternatively, make sure you are if you're looking to lose some friends).</p>
<p>Lest you think that's the only flamethrower you're getting, think again. The Freedom's Flame Warbond also brings the P-72 Crisper secondary weapon, described as a "flamethrower that fits in your pocket". It's essentially a pistol that shoots fire. Finally, my childhood dreams have come true!</p>
<p>A new Booster gives you the chance to set fire to the battlefield when you land, which is ideal for clearing out hordes of enemies (but perhaps not ideal if you're planning to land next to your squadmates). You'll also find new armor sets that grant resistance to fire, though, so perhaps you could recommend your squadmates wear that armor.</p>

<p>There's plenty more coming in the Freedom's Flame Warbond too, so make sure to read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4339865428697564653" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full list of additions</a> if you're planning to drop some Super Credits on this one next week.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Freedom's Flame Warbond lands on August 8th. The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/553850/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy">read our review of it right here</a>.</p>

<p>Riot has just rolled out patch 9.02 for Valorant, their popular FPS shooter, and it’s packed with some exciting updates. In the patch notes, Riot has announced that the much-loved map, Icebox, is finally available for console players. Additionally, PC players can now delve into the Basic Training (tutorial) and The Range, features that were previously exclusive to the console version of the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-platforms-nbsp">All Platforms&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Riot has announced a Behavioral Intervention Update for all platforms due to the rise in toxic online players. After Valorant’s patch 9.02, players who use abusive language over comms will face increased penalties. Agents like Neon, Gameplay systems like Premier Overtime and Ability HUD, and Maps like Abyss and Sunset have received some bug fixes, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-pc-players-can-now-access-basic-training-and-the-range">Valorant PC Players Can Now Access Basic Training and The Range</h2>



<p>PC players can check out Basic Training (tutorial) and The Range from the Console version of Valorant after patch 9.02. After the update, every new player must play through this tutorial, with a choice to play a bot training match. Existing players can check out these modes through the practice menu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In gameplay updates, the combat report has received visual improvements. In Premier Updates, playoffs in the Contender and Invite Divisions will now have best-of-3 finals. Map picks and bans will happen before the agent selects each map. The game will remove maps from the map pool for subsequent matches once they are played. Additionally, playoff qualification rules have been added to the side panel on the standings page. Lastly, on the social panel, players can see which platform their friends are playing from.</p>

<h2 id="h-console-players-receive-icebox-and-more-through-patch-9-02">Console Players Receive Icebox and More Through Patch 9.02</h2>



<p>In the latest update for Valorant console players, the highly anticipated Icebox map has been added to Competitive, Unrated, Swift Play, and Deathmatch queues.</p>



<p>An exciting new feature called ‘Toggelable Abilities’ has been introduced, allowing players greater control over specific abilities. This feature enables players to press and hold a button to activate the ‘Toggle’ mode, granting them the ability to steer skills such as Harbor’s High Tide, Phoenix’s Fire Wall, Skye’s Guiding Light, Neon’s High Gear, and Sova’s Hunter Fury by pressing and releasing the input. This new addition could significantly impact gameplay and strategy for Valorant console players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other than that, the “Keep Player Centered” minimap setting will now be forced on for minimap zoom levels above 1.0. Players can now open the in-match with a button and have the option to mute other players or switch voice channels. Social notifications now have a notification sound. Lastly, party information is now visible in the social channel after Valorant patch 9.02.&nbsp;</p>
