            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-bounty-hunter-review-jango-deserves-better<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> released during an era when <em>Star Wars </em>games were a dime a dozen. It was pretty easy to miss a game or two, so I never played <em>Bounty Hunter </em>until now. Nonetheless, I was happy to see it get a port on modern platforms so I could finally experience a game through the eyes of one of my favorite <em>Star Wars</em> characters: Jango Fett.</p>
<p>Well, I have no nostalgia for <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>. I suspect this port by Aspyr is hoping for players to relive their experience with the game. Looking at it with a critical lens, in 2024, it's hard for me to see what the hype was all about, and moreover, the port leaves a lot to be desired. It's not a game befitting Jango Fett, that's for sure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-cutscene.jpg?itok=tUN3zYYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-cutscene.jpg?itok=ZiEzeuZh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Temuera Morrison reprised his role as Jango Fett in the original release -- less than a year after his debut in <em>Episode II</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Port Quality of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em></h2>
<p>Originally launching in 2002, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is a bonafide antique. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-old-republic-kotor">early 2000s</a> had its fair share of classics, but it can be a bit rough experiencing older games in 2024. That is, unfortunately, the case here. It's a game rife with issues stemming from 2002 game design, and those issues persist today, despite the chance to be fixed in this port.</p>
<p>But before all the doom and gloom, in terms of visual fidelity, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> features a fresh coat of paint. It's not a remaster, but Aspyr likely did the same upscaling as they did in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response"><em>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</em></a><em> </em>launch earlier in the year. And hey, it looks pretty great here. Textures are crisp, and lighting is overall improved.</p>
<p>I got a chance to try out both the PS2 and GameCube versions of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> just for comparison's sake, and Aspyr breathes new life into a game that looks rather rough around the edges on its original consoles. Its visuals are by far the best thing this game has going for it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting.jpg?itok=v4BuGhda 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting.jpg?itok=55fM_oZ3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Feelin' lucky?</figcaption></figure><p>Even as a port, I'd expect other areas to be improved. Namely the camera, which was notoriously jank back in the day (and I can confirm this having played the originals less than a week ago, as of this review). Aspyr claims to have updated the camera system in this port, which might be true, but it's definitely no better than it was before.</p>
<p>Many deaths or mishaps in my playthrough can be attributed to this reworked camera, which was still jerky and finicky. In short, it's atrocious, and the lock-on system often butts heads with the camera and creates situations where you can walk off cliffs or get pummeled by enemies. Get used to getting frustrated is all I can say.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-boss.jpg?itok=gyg_aIy8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-boss.jpg?itok=3dN0b2gT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How fast can your trigger finger go?</figcaption></figure><h2>AI, Saving, What Else Isn't Great?</h2>
<p>It would have been great to see an improvement to <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>'s save system, but it is antiquated. There's a checkpoint system and five lives for each level, and if you die you spawn on these checkpoints. You can't save in the middle of a level, so if you quit, you have to restart the level.</p>
<p>That's just not practical in this day and age, but it's not too surprising in an older game. Other than that, AI is dumber than a box of rocks, and heck, I even had one of the final bosses stand still after a few seconds of fighting. They didn't shoot, they didn't do anything -- the boss simply let me kill them without a fuss.</p>
<p>There isn't any extra gameplay content in this port beyond achievements, as far as I can tell, so don't go expecting to find new surprises. The extras from the original game are still unlockable by collecting bounties and such, but I'm sure that's not a huge incentive for players returning to experience this game again.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-platforming.jpg?itok=b4pkt_eG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-platforming.jpg?itok=VQOlzAcF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I just wish my jetpack worked as well as it did in the movies.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter'</em>s Gameplay Hold Up?</h2>
<p><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is very much a game of its era. Playing as Jango Fett before the start of <em>Episode II</em>, you're on a cross-galaxy trip to capture bounties and put an end to a notorious, intergalactic cult. You'll shoot and jetpack across six different chapters, each featuring its own planets and environments.</p>
<p>It's a very straightforward game. Jango Fett has an arsenal of weapons like the flamethrower, rockets, poison darts, and of course, duel blasters. You'll rely on the latter the most. There's his jetpack, too, which isn't as capable as I'd like -- since it's usable only in short bursts -- but still fun to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting-2.jpg?itok=KHHw1mBN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-shooting-2.jpg?itok=rlGAvXV1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It feels a little messed up to wipe out an entire civilization full of Sebulba's bros.</figcaption></figure><p>This adventure is a third-person shooter/platformer hybrid, often tasking players to shoot through an absurd number of infinitely respawning enemies as they navigate to an objective. Levels take advantage of Jango's jetpack, but often times platforming sequences feel like a pain what with all the enemies around.</p>
<p>In the original <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>, Jango Fett's blasters shot as fast as you could pull the trigger. The base fire rate is improved here by just holding down the trigger, but you're still better off mashing it as fast as possible. Some enemies are spongy and soak up hits, so your finger is likely to feel tired after a few rounds of combat -- that was certainly the case for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-bounty.jpg?itok=zf8ZwEyq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-bounty.jpg?itok=D_Lw6-Mf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This guy is definitely peddling death sticks.</figcaption></figure><p>In between combat, you can scan crowds and enemies for bounties to either capture or kill. You'll earn unlockables this way, though it's purely optional. Thankfully, Aspyr adds some improved controls which makes this game slightly less cumbersome to play on modern controllers.</p>
<p>A big improvement to all of these mechanics is that scanning for bounties slows time down, as opposed to the original. When you're fighting a dozen enemies shooting you at the same time, the slow motion is a great help.</p>
<p>Enemy overload is apparent in the last several levels and is quite a pain. Hordes of enemies run at you and the best solution is to torch them with a flamethrower. The finale should go all out but instead feels more like an afterthought compared to some of the earlier levels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-unlock.jpg?itok=7lgH7G3c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunter-unlock.jpg?itok=d2jNpU5_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Concept art is always cool, and here is no different.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter </em>| Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If we ignore the lacking quality of this port, <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> shows its age. It's really not all that fun playing as Jango Fett, with his limited jetpack fuel and the constant need to mash the trigger. With so many enemies that respawn constantly, there's little to get excited about. Its saving grace is a somewhat palatable story, and decently fun platforming.</p>
<p>Bundle everything together and you have a very shoddy experience. <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is intriguing to experience as a fan of the series and character, but does little else. The camera, by far the worst part of this whole experience, makes me hesitant to go back and play this antiquated title for quite a while.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter isn't a good game, nor is it necessarily bad, but its age shows as you play through its campaign. Not only that but the port quality and terrible camera controls leave a lot to be desired. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>I’m as guilty as many of you regarding using console commands and cheats in Bethesda’s open-world titles. I still occasionally spawn a few hundred thousand Caps in Fallout 4 so that I can buy and modify all of the custom weapons I mod into the game. But there’s a new kid on the block! So, without further ado, here’s a full list of Fallout: London console commands and cheats!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-one-of-the-fallout-london-console-commands-and-cheats">Every One of the Fallout: London Console Commands and Cheats</h2>

</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-use-console-commands-in-fallout-london">How to Use Console Commands in Fallout: London</h2>



<p>As Fallout: London doesn’t entirely replace Fallout 4 during installation—it’s running over the top of the original product, like an overhaul mod—it utilizes the same console command system you’re like familiar with. To use console commands in Fallout: London, hit the tilde (~) on your keyboard to open the command menu. Once it appears in the bottom left corner of your screen, you may start typing or copy/paste cheats into the console.</p>



<p>Be wary of what cheats you use, though. It’s possible to irreversibly break your game, which may require a fresh install!</p>

<p>Check back shortly because we’ll have plenty more from the world of Fallout: London in the coming days! In the meantime, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>?</p>

<p>EA Sports held its latest deep dive for Madden 25 on Wednesday, giving full details on all of the features coming to the game’s Franchise mode.</p>



<p>This year’s franchise mode includes an overhauled NFL Draft experience with more pageantry akin to what NFL fans see in real life. Also added to Madden 25’s franchise mode are more personalized stories, new environments, a new Super Bowl celebration, streamlined league creation tools and more.</p>

<h2 id="h-madden-25-franchise-mode-features-highlights">Madden 25 Franchise Mode Features Highlights</h2>



<h3 id="h-nfl-draft">NFL Draft</h3>



<p>“Your authentic Draft Night experience starts when Roger Goodell takes the stage. The draft environment is dynamic, with the Draft Board updating in real-time. After selections are made, you’ll witness the iconic moment of your draft pick walking across the stage, holding up their new jersey or receiving the life-changing call from home.”</p>



<h3 id="h-prospect-hub">Prospect Hub</h3>



<p>“To reduce friction in the scouting and drafting process, we’ve completely redesigned the prospect hub in Madden NFL 25. Previously, in order to see a prospect’s athletic grades or physical measurables, you would have to go all the way into the player card. This year, we’ve brought all prospect information forward into a more familiar spreadsheet format…”</p>



<h3 id="h-super-bowl-presentation">Super Bowl Presentation  </h3>



<p>The presentation has been overhauled in both Superstar mode and Franchise mode. The way the Lombardi Trophy is presented will change depending on the game’s outcome and scenario.</p>



<h3 id="h-team-and-player-customization">Team and Player Customization</h3>



<p>For the first time, Team Builder is coming to Madden with Madden 25. In Madden 25 Team Builder, you can do the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Create + upload your own logos</li>



<li>Personalize:
<ul>
<li>Uniforms (Home, Away, Alternate)&nbsp;</li>



<li>Helmets</li>



<li>Stadium</li>



<li>On-field logos</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Build your rosters
<ul>
<li>Option to create every player if you’d like to!</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Import up to 32 Team Builder teams into Franchise</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-rookie-and-team-records">Rookie and Team Records</h3>



<p>“Madden NFL 25 features over 1400 new records to be broken within franchise mode.&nbsp;“</p>



<h3 id="h-league-tools">League Tools</h3>



<p>“The league creation flow has been updated to make the selection of your league type and roster clearer, and the team select screen now provides expanded information about rankings, top players, and rosters.”</p>



<p>Madden 25 launches August 16 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox One, and PS4. Those on last-gen platforms won’t have some of the newer features in the game.</p>

Every time I step out of an elevator, I accelerate wildly in case the elevator falls without warning and chops me in half, leaving the frontal and, all things considered, inferior portion of my body swaying in place for a second before collapsing in a cloud of bisected bone and organ. Don't laugh: I know you do this too. Kletka isn't helping: created by <a href="https://ln404.itch.io/">in404</a>, it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> scavenging game reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> and Golden Light, in which you ponderously plummet through the layers of an "endless" post-Soviet Gigastructure, scrounging fuel, parts and provender for an elevator that wants to eat you.

The elevator's roof is a gnashing, lipless mouth with a lantern dangling beneath it like a droplet of drool. It parts and closes ever so gently as you scurry around with hunched shoulders, refuelling the generator and patching the machinery. You can almost feel its breath in your hair. Needless to say, you'll want to keep it sated with edible objects pilfered from the surrounding world. I spent my 15 minutes in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1699480/KLETKA/">Steam demo</a> with both eyes riveted to the screen displaying the creature's level of peckishness and my cursor hovering over the brake lever.
</p>
<p>
The rooms and corridors of the Gigastructure aren't much safer than the elevator. They're as dark as a dog's interior, and chocabloc with traps such as landmines and lakes of electrified water. The game's rusty, lichenous PS1-era visual direction makes spotting resources and items a fiddle, and your all-important torch has to switch off and recharge at regular intervals. Worst of all, you'll have to deal with Samosbor. I'm not sure what Samosbor is, but you can't kill it. If you see a lot of red light, run run run as you would from a Balrog with the mumps.
</p>
<p>
Kletka's demo includes a multiplayer mode for up to four - this won't allow crossplay with the full release, which is due later this year. You can spectate online games and join the proceedings when the host finds a vending machine in the Gigastructure, as when rescuing Survivors from closets in Left 4 Dead. Also as in Left 4 Dead, though for different reasons, co-op partners are worth having around even when they suck at the game. Teamwork makes the dream work, yes, but Kletka's Steam blurb offers the fine counterargument that "friends make for good fuel".

<p>In an official <a href="https://rebellion.com/rebellion-and-level-infinite-announce-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, Rebellion revealed a new partnership with Level Infinite to work on an unannounced title with the codename “Project Archipelago.” </p>



<p>Rebellion calls it an original IP that uses “the unique skillsets of both organisations to create a new gameplay experience.”</p>



<p>Today’s blog post also reveals that Rebellion will roll out a playtest of the game sometime “soon.” The playtest will only feature a “pre-Alpha build of Project Archipelago,” as well as a dedicated Discord. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Although fans can playtest Project Archipelago soon, Rebellion did not offer further details about the project or its gameplay. But the playtest does give fans an idea of the development timeline.</p>



<p>Rebellion did add that “more details will be revealed about the project in due course.” Although the devs appear to be wisely patient, it seems that more news about the project is coming soon. There will likely be even more revealed at Gamescom 2024 in August.</p>



<p>Fans likely recognize Rebellion for its work on the Sniper Elite and Zombie Army series. In February 2024, Rebellion <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rebellion-reveals-zombie-army-vr-is-coming-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Zombie Army VR</a>, which is coming out sometime this year.</p>



<p>Level Infinite published a variety of popular games, such as PUBG Mobile and Honor of Kings. Just last week, Honor of Kings developer TiMi Studio Group announced the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/honor-of-kings-worldwide-launch-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached 50 million downloads</a> since launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-addresses-dead-game-debate-who-cares-if-theres-only-five-people-playing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Our obsession with the concept of the “dead game” and player counts is unhealthy for the video game industry and gamers, one of the developers behind <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> has said.</p><p>Palworld, dubbed “Pokémon with guns,” launched in early access form to record-breaking success. It is the second most-played game ever on Steam, with an incredible concurrent player count of 2,101,867 on Valve’s platform. Only battle royale PUBG is ahead of Palworld in Steam’s all-time peak concurrents chart.</p><p>Palworld’s Steam concurrents have fallen since that explosive launch earlier this year, and now usually hit a peak in the tens of thousands rather than millions. The decline has caused some to call Palworld a “dead game,” but it is far from the only game to be called that in recent years.</p><p>For example, Rocksteady’s catastrophic <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, whose Steam concurrents usually peak in the hundreds of players, was called a dead game upon its release. Arrowhead's Helldivers 2, Ubisoft's Skull &amp; Bones, and Blizzard’s Overwatch 2 are also often called dead games. Sony’s live service hero shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> has been labeled "dead on arrival” before launch because of low beta concurrents on Steam.</p><p>The “dead game” narrative is exacerbated by an industry currently pumping out more live service games than the market can perhaps support, or even wants, and by publishers who walk away from their live service games amid low player numbers. This month <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-a-dino-crisis-for-capcom-as-it-abandons-new-exoprimal-content-just-a-year-after-launch">Capcom announced plans to move on from dinosaur-themed shooter Exoprimal just a year after launch</a>, with Steam concurrents brutally low.</p><p>John “Bucky” Buckley, community chief at Palworld developer Pocketpair, has been a vocal critic of the “dead game” phrase, and in social media posts has called on the industry, media, and gamers to ditch the fixation on concurrents and player counts.</p><p>Bucky followed up on these posts in an interview with YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GoingIndie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Going Indie</a> for a video titled, ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/NO38QvKraTQ?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dead Games Are A Good Thing, Actually.'</a> In it, Bucky called out publishers and developers who try to brute-force mechanics designed to keep players playing forever into games they're not suited to, declaring it "unhealthy."</p><p>“Just play the games you like,” Bucky said. “If you finish in a day, cool. Good job. I’m glad you enjoyed it. Play the next one.</p><p>“I don’t think it really serves anyone to push gamers to just play the same game day in, day out. There are games that you can play every single day for months on end and never burn out. League of Legends, Dota, most MMOs, but they’re designed to be like that.</p><p>“Whereas what we’re seeing now is a trend of... I won’t necessarily say who’s trying to push it, but a lot more people are trying to push gamers to play games that aren’t really designed to be played for months on end, for months on end.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Who cares if there’s only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself.</p></div><p>“I don’t think you need to be pushing yourself to play the same game all the time,” Bucky continued.</p><p>“It’s not healthy for us, it’s not healthy for developers, it’s not healthy for gamers, it’s not healthy for the gaming media. And it’s just not healthy for our industry, because the more we push this kind of narrative, the more very large companies are going to just say ‘gamers want more live service.’ And we’re just going to get more of these really soulless live service games that come out and then get shut down nine months later, 12 months later, because they’re not making enough money. And we all lose in that case.</p><p>“Play all the indIes you can. Spend as much money on indies as you can. Who cares if there’s only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself. Just enjoy games. I don’t think it needs to be any more complex than that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But will the industry, the media, and gamers listen? The “dead game” narrative is in part fueled by the video game industry’s obsession with secrecy. Unlike Hollywood, which makes movie budgets and box office figures public, video game publishers tend not to announce video game sales and/or revenue unless they’re truly spectacular, with development budgets almost always kept a closely guarded secret. In truth, it’s almost impossible to determine whether a video game has met expectations, which is why vague publisher comments made by CEOs in investor-focused financial calls get so much attention.</p><p>This secrecy means gamers and the media have just one publicly available performance metric with which to gauge performance: Steam concurrents. Valve continues to make this stat available for the world to see, and so the world has developed a hyper-focus around it, in turn leading to an over-reliance.</p><p>In any case, there have been plenty of examples of live service video games that were prematurely consigned to the scrap heap. Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege suffered a disastrous launch but went on to become one of the biggest live service games around. Hello Games' No Man's Sky is another redemption story, as is CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077. And let's not forget the humble origins of Fortnite, what began as a lackluster tower defense game but ended up perhaps the biggest live service of them all.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Braid: Anniversary Edition has "sold like dog shit", according to its creator Jonathan Blow.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/j_blow">Blow regularly streams on Twitch</a> and has discussed the sales performance of the Braid re-release on a number of occasions since its release in May.
</p>
<p>
YouTube channel Blow Fan has pieced together a montage of clips from Blow's streams (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/braid-anniversary-edition-has-sold-like-dog-sht-creator-jonathan-blow-says/">VGC</a>), in which he bluntly shares his thoughts on the sales of Braid: Anniversary Edition.

<p>
On 20th May, six days after the game's launch, Blow stated it was "a little too early" to see the game's performance, specifically the downward curve of sales after release. He also noted events like the Summer Sale can be a major contributor post-launch.
</p>
<p>
"It's not like we sold a million copies day one or whatever, which is what you expect. It's a remaster, so you don't expect it to be like a new game in terms of the hype level. But we just have to see where it lands," said Blow.
</p>
<p>
Then, on 17th June (34 days after launch), Blow stated the game had "sold horribly". "It depends on what your standards are," he said. "It's sold well if you compare it to nostalgic things like the Jeff Minter game that's on Steam or Atari 50. It's sold much better than all of those but it still has sold like dog shit compared to what we need to make for the company to survive.
</p>
<p>
"The future is uncertain, let's put it that way," he concluded. "It hasn't been good."
</p>
<p>
Blow reiterated sales have "been utterly terrible" on 21st July and then again on 22nd July, adding on the latter that console platforms "are dead now" with Steam as the game's biggest platform.
</p>
<p>
Referring to commentary added in the Anniversary Edition, Blow said: "At some point, you just have to know that what you did was a good thing even if the world doesn't really acknowledge it and this is one of those cases I think."
</p>
<p>
He then stated the likes of cons and events, as well as most YouTube interviews and podcasts, aren't useful for promotion.

Finally, on 27th July, Blow noted the "whole industry is having a hard time" and then, when asked how many of his development team are working on the compiler for programming language Jai, Blow replied: "None, because we can't afford to pay anyone because the sales are bad."

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/braid-anniversary-edition-briefly-delayed-but-itll-feature-a-bunch-of-new-levels">Braid: Anniversary Edition launched in May</a> and adds 40 new levels, as well as over 15 hours of commentary.

<p>
The indie puzzle-platform game was first released on Xbox 360 in 2008 and quickly became a critical darling.

            <p>
Sorry singing fans, Amazon's Yakuza TV show won't include the game's iconic karaoke sessions.
</p>
<p>
The Yakuza, or Like a Dragon, games are known for their bizarre minigames, but it seems the TV producers are taking a more serious approach to their adaptations by focusing on human emotion and offering new interpretations of familiar characters.
</p>
<p>
When asked during a roundtable if karaoke would be featured in the Like a Dragon: Yakuza TV show, executive producer Erik Barmack said it would not, though "singing may come eventually" (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/yakuzas-tv-show-adaptation-no-karaoke-minigame/">The Gamer</a>).

<p>

"When you start to figure out how to boil down this world into six episodes... there's so much source material to pull from," said Barmack. There's no confirmation of further series, but it seems the door for karaoke is open at least.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/yakuza-tv-series-no-substories/">TV show won't focus on the substories</a> of the games, which often include some outlandish characters and activities.
</p>
<p>
"I think we're digging into the human emotions and the emotional elements of the characters of this iteration," said lead actor Ryoma Takeuchi (Kazuma Kiryu). "In a positive way, we're departing from the game at the end of the day; it all comes together."
</p>
<p>
Added Barmack: "As this series is an origin story, we wanted to make sure fans were emotionally connected to these characters... It's a balance that has to be found between the world that is so quirky and these characters, which need to feel real to everybody who is watching the series."
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-tv-show-drops-a-new-teaser-trailer">teaser trailer for the series was shown at San Diego Comic Con</a>, plus a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NS-3_Gqr-s&amp;t=8s">video interview</a> with director of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and show executive producer Masayoshi Yokoyama.


</p>
<p>
He described the portrayal of characters Kazuma Kiryu and Akira Nishikiyama as "totally different from the original story", but added "that's what's great about it" because there's nothing more to add to the game's character. There will also be brand new characters original to the Amazon TV show.
</p>
<p>
In November 2023, Sega reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sammy-reports-best-financial-performance-for-a-decade-despite-european-studio-disappointment">lifetime sales of the Yakuza game series had reached 21.3m units</a>. The most recent game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">Infinite Wealth, sold 1m units in its first week</a> to become the fastest selling in the series.

<p>During new <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-FY25-Prepared-Remarks-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prepared remarks</a> that accompanied the latest financial results, EA CEO Andrew Wilson offered optimistic comments on the next Battlefield project.</p>



<p>Wilson said these plans for Battlefield are “one of our top priorities,” and “one of the most ambitious projects in our history.” </p>



<p>They also emphasized EA’s investment in the team and resources necessary to deliver on that. </p>



<p>The prepared remarks state that EA has already “brought together the very best team,” and supplied them with optimal “resources and technology.” EA previously confirmed that it has the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-has-largest-team-ever-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“largest team ever”</a> working on the new Battlefield game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the new remarks, Wilson also noted that the Battlefield franchise “has surpassed over 25 million players over the last twelve months.” However, EA did not offer further details on the exact nature of the upcoming Battlefield project.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, EA announced that some legacy Battlefield games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-battlefield-game-ever-going-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are going offline</a>. That includes the fan favorite Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline. </p>



<p>Today, players will lose access to purchasing those titles on some platforms. Further, those games will also permanently shut down their online services on November 7, 2024.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 fans did recently get a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-is-getting-a-dead-space-event-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space crossover event</a> called “Outbreak” just a couple of weeks ago. Fans are still holding out for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-space-2-remake-shelved-for-battlefield-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space 2 remake</a>.</p>

And console players can upgrade—for free—to the current-generation version if they have previously purchased either the Xbox One or PlayStation 4 versions of the game.</p><p>While the Creepy Jar team is excited to bring <em>Green Hell</em> to current-generation consoles, last-generation consoles will no longer receive updates as the developer focuses on current-gen and beyond. Simply put, the last-generation consoles are unable to shoulder the weight of the newer updates while running at the quality Creepy Jar expects to deliver to players.</p><p>It is important to note that due to the discrepancy between current and last-gen console versions in terms of content, neither the Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5 versions will be compatible with their previous generation counterparts. As well, there will be no cross-play between versions and no save transfers from last-gen to current.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

It was the first time we had done it in 10 years, and the level of gameplay and the level of visual fidelity that we did, was a combination of many years of work of our incredible teams, amplified and accelerated by AI," <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-2024-07-30.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said</a>. "Something that we just wouldn't have been able to do as little as two or three years ago."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EA Sports College Football 25 | Official Gameplay First Look Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Prior to launch, EA explained how it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-will-have-inaccuracies-at-launch-ea-says/1100-6524998/" data-ref-id="1100-6524998">"never going to be a viable option"</a> to create CFB 25's thousands of players manually by scanning them all into the game and using human hands alone to do it. Instead, EA used AI and a machine-learning toolset to create the character models. EA inputted "hundreds" of head shapes, hairstyles, skin tones, complexions, beards, and brows into the model. Using this data, along with a single reference photo of the athlete or coach in question, EA said it was able to create the player likenesses in the game.</p><p>In total, College Football 25 features about 11,390 real players, along with 5,000 or so player models for coaches, fans, and created players, totaling more than 16,000 character models.</p><p>College Football 25 was in development for years, but things really ramped up in February 2024 when EA<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-offering-college-athletes-600-to-appear-in-new-football-game/1100-6521289/" data-ref-id="1100-6521289"> signed Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals with college athletes for the game</a>. That happened just five months before the game launched in July 2024. Using machine-learning and AI was critical in helping get College Football 25 out the door on time and at the desired level of quality, Wilson said.</p><p>The executive gave this answer in response to a question about why EA decided to make College Football 25 exclusive to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, instead of bringing the game to multiple generations of consoles. Wilson said EA decided to focus on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S because that is where "the player communities are showing up at the greatest level."</p><p>"And the uptake that we've seen across the new platforms would suggest that the platform decisions we made were the right ones," Wilson said. College Football 25 reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hit-5-million-players-in-its-first-week/1100-6525421/" data-ref-id="1100-6525421">5 million players in its first week alone</a>.</p><p>Before this, Wilson spoke about how AI could positively benefit EA's games going forward, even if there is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">human cost to this as well via layoffs and other job displacement.</a></p><p>Wilson said EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">conducted a study across all of its development processe</a>s and found that 60% of development processes have a "high feasibility" of being positively impacted by generative AI. As an example, Wilson said in the past it took six months to develop a stadium in one of its sports games, and now it takes six weeks. In the future, it could take six days, he said.</p><p>EA's ambition, Wilson said, is to use generative AI to make its development processes 30% more efficient. Wilson said EA's development teams are driven by the desire to "get to the fun faster" and release games faster. The aim is to "get to greatness much more quickly," he said.</p><p>Prior to this, Wilson warned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">advances to AI would lead to job losses</a>. Wilson said the "fear of displacement of the workforce" is a legitimate issue as it pertains to AI. He said history has shown that major revolutions like the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution led to "displacement" in the workforce in the near term and then "meaningful increases" in job opportunities down the road. AI could follow a similar trajectory, Wilson said.</p><p>EA is not alone in its admiration for AI. Microsoft is heavily invested in AI and has said AI will be baked into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">every product it makes going forward, including Xbox.</a> Microsoft also implemented <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-undermining-activisions-independence-with-latest-layoffs-ftc-says/1100-6520894/" data-ref-id="1100-6520894">mass layoffs</a> around the same time of pushing further into AI.</p><p>Video game actors and performers are now on strike in part over concerns about AI. Wilson, however, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-ceo-isnt-worried-about-immediate-impact-from-video-game-actors-strike/1100-6525423/" data-ref-id="1100-6525423">not very worried about it. </a></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> community manager John "Bucky" Buckley has shared his thoughts on 'dead games', saying he believes it isn't healthy for the industry to play the same game all the time if it wasn't created with this sort of playstyle in mind.</p>
<p>Bucky first got involved in the 'dead game' discourse earlier this year, when he addressed Palworld's player numbers. Palworld was the first big mega-hit of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">surpassing 2m concurrent players on Steam back in January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being PUBG. As expected, however, player numbers declined after release, as they do with many games. Palworld was then branded a 'dead game' in certain corners of the internet.</p>
<p>Speaking about this player dip back in February, Bucky acknowledged "there are so many amazing games out there to play", and said people didn't need to feel bad about trying something different.</p>
<p>"If you are still playing Palworld, we love you. If you're no longer playing Palworld, we still love you, and we hope you'll come back for round two when you're ready," he wrote on social media platform X.</p>

</figure>
<p>Bucky has now further elaborated on this discussion during a recent conversation with YouTube channel Going Indie (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/palworlds-community-manager-says-our-dead-game-fixation-is-ruining-gaming-i-dont-think-it-really-serves-anyone-to-push-gamers-to-play-the-same-game-day-in-and-day-out/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"I don't think it really serves anyone to kind of push gamers to just play the same game day in day out," Bucky said. "There are games you can just play every single day for months on end and never burn out [such as] most MMOs, but they're designed to be like that."</p>
<p>The Palworld community manager went on to say there is now a certain 'push' for players to react this way to games that have not necessarily been created with long-term gameplay in mind.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>With Palworld quickly approaching the 1-month mark, it's interesting to look back at my own thoughts for launch.</p><p>In May of 2023, I was convinced that Palworld could break the 50,000 player mark. Anything above that seemed unobtainable though, and I certainly never expected it to… <a href="https://t.co/1rZaV30QON">pic.twitter.com/1rZaV30QON</a></p></div>— Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1757796446739558795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>"I don't think you need to be pushing yourself to play the same game all the time," Bucky continued. "It's not healthy for us, it's not healthy for developers, it's not healthy for gamers, it's not healthy for gaming media.</p>
<p>"And it's just not healthy for our industry, because the more we push this kind of narrative, the more very large companies are going to just say 'gamers want more live service'.</p>
<p>"And we're just going to get more of these really soulless live service games that come out then get shut down nine months later, 12 months later - because they're not making enough money. And we all lose in that case."</p>
<p>So, what does the Palworld developer suggest we do? Well, he just wants us all to support the games we want to support and enjoy the games we enjoy - it really doesn't need to be more complicated.</p>
<p>"Play all the indies you can," he said. "Spend as much money on indies as you can. Really, really support the guys who are trying to make fun games. Who cares if there's only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself. Just enjoy games. I don't think it needs to be any more complex than that."</p>

                <p>Last week, video game voice actors voted to go on strike after a year and a half of back-and-forth negotiation with major gaming entities. The CEO of one of the companies at the bargaining table, EA, has said he's not concerned about the strike having a short-term impact on business.</p><p>As part of EA's most recent earnings call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson was asked about any potential impact from the strike, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-video-game-actor-strikes-wont-have-short-term-impact-on-the-company" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN reports</a>. Due to the specifics of how the strike will operate, and how EA's business runs, he's not concerned that the strike will cause any disruption in the near future.</p><p>"We're working very closely; this is not an EA-specific situation, this is an industry-specific situation, and we're working diligently to negotiate at the table," Wilson said, noting that voice actors are an important and valued part of EA's business.</p><p>"The way it works now in terms of our product specifically is that the strike is limited to games commencing production after September 2023, including live-service games," Wilson explained. "So we don't expect any near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development or any of the live services we're currently running."</p><p>On a standard AAA development timeframe, any game that started production after the cutoff of September 2023 is likely to be a long way off from release, meaning that the strike may not have any noticeable impact on game-release schedules in the near future. Live-service games that have already been released are also exempt, meaning that titles like Fortnite or Destiny 2 can continue get new content as usual.</p><p>"That being said, we're committed to continuing to bargain in good faith and are hopeful that the parties can expediently resolve our issues at the bargaining table," Wilson added. "But we're not anticipating any significant short-term impact at EA."</p><p>Video game voice actors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actors-have-voted-to-authorize-a-strike-if-negotiations-fail/1100-6517987/" data-ref-id="1100-6517987">voted to authorize the strike</a> last September, but only just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">initiated action as of July 26</a>, after SAG-AFTRA failed to come to an agreement with video game companies. The union has said that AI is a major sticking point in negotiations, and that it wants to ensure fair protections against AI for voice actors. The game industry body also released a statement, saying it is disappointed with the union's decision to strike.</p>

      </div>
<p>CFB 25 was drawing huge player numbers even before the game officially launched, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hits-2-million-players-before-official-launch/1100-6525147/" data-ref-id="1100-6525147">2.2 million unique players logged</a> during the game's four-day early-access period. That figure more than doubled in the first week after its full release on July 19, with 5 million unique players trying out the game--and that figure did not include an additional 500,000 players who checked it out via the EA Play trial.</p><p>CFB 25's launch comes at the tail end of what EA reports as a strong financial quarter. Although most of its figures are down from the corresponding period the year before, EA notes that certain metrics exceeded its own expectations for the quarter.</p><p>Despite some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-warns-of-known-issues-in-college-football-25-following-launch/1100-6525210/" data-ref-id="1100-6525210">early technical issues and inaccuracies</a> with certain players and team likenesses, CFB 25 has been critically well received. "EA Sports College Football 25 proves it's more than just nostalgia with its impressive production and gameplay," GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-university-of-madden/1900-6418261/" data-ref-id="1900-6418261">College Football 25 review</a> said, scoring the football sim 8/10.</p><p>If you're just getting into the college football sim, check out our guide to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-dynasty-recruitment-tips/2900-5627/" data-ref-id="2900-5627">starting out in the game's Dynasty mode</a>.</p>

                <p>The Xbox Series X and S will be four years old this year, and Microsoft's latest earnings call has revealed that its newest generation of consoles just aren't selling like they used to. While software and service sales have been strong, helped along by the massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-officially-acquires-activision-nearly-two-years-later-bobby-kotick-resi/1100-6516016/" data-ref-id="1100-6516016">Activision acquisition</a>, hardware sales have seen a sharp decline.</p><p>In its Q4 earnings presentation for the 2024 fiscal year, Microsoft noted that its gaming hardware sales have decreased significantly, with a 42% decline compared to the same period last year. Despite this, the company's overall gaming revenue was up 44%, with a 61% increase in content and services revenue that Microsoft says was "slightly ahead of expectations." Both of these growth figures were positively impacted by the Activision purchase, Microsoft says.</p><p>The call also suggests that third-party content may not have performed as well as expected for Xbox in Q4, with Microsoft noting that "stronger-than-expected performance in first-party content was partially offset by third-party content performance."</p><p>Despite the sharp decline in hardware sales, the figures aren't likely to come as a shock for Microsoft--in fact, its future outlook notes that "hardware revenue will again decline year-over-year." To offset this continued decline, Microsoft is looking to its Activision purchase to continue to drive sales on the content side.</p><p>While Microsoft looks to be focusing increasingly on software sales and Game Pass as the key to its gaming business, with Activision only the largest of its recent publisher acquisitions, the company has still reaffirmed its commitment to the hardware business. Microsoft has a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-announces-new-all-digital-xbox-series-x/1100-6524077/" data-ref-id="1100-6524077">digital-only Xbox Series X</a> releasing in time for the holidays, and has also confirmed that it is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reaffirms-a-next-gen-xbox-is-on-the-way/1100-6524094/" data-ref-id="1100-6524094">the next generation of Xbox consoles</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/infinity-paradise-lost-trailer-and-rogue-ai-have-entered-chat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a huge week for Corvus Belli, the creators of the <em>Infinity</em> tabletop wargame. First, they announced an animated series set in the <em>Infinity</em> Universe, and then immediately followed up with launching their own AI Chatbot, Sibylla. We've also got our hands on the exclusive Kassad Event Exclusive Miniature that celebrates the announcement and we take a look at all below.</p>


<p>Announced at San Diego Comic-Con, <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> is an upcoming animated series set in the <em>Infinity</em> Universe. Originally a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-guide">tabletop wargame</a>, <em>Infinity</em> has had a full roleplaying game release, 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/aristeia-and-aristeia-prime-time-review">tie-in sports-based spin-off board games</a>, and a dungeon-crawling adventure game.</p>
<p>For those not aware, the <em>Infinity</em> universe is set in the future, with mankind living amongst the stars. While not in outright war, various factions of humanity occasionally come to blows over territory and resources, coupled with all kinds of shadow operations. Thrown into this, are the combined alliance of alien races, and the forces of a rogue AI, known as the Evolved Intelligence, ALEPH.</p>

The series’ voice cast includes actors Zehra Fazal (<em>Young Justice, Halo Infinite, Starfield</em>), Jason Spisak (<em>Arcane, Batman: Hush</em>), Raffi Barsoumian (<em>DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, Seal Team, The Code</em>), Abubakr Ali (<em>Grendel, Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime</em>), Emily O’Brien (<em>Days of Our Lives, Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham</em>), Nick E. Tarabay (<em>Spartacus, Star Trek Into Darkness</em>) and Roshelle Simpson (<em>Gather by the Ghost Light</em>).</p>
<p>I've been playing <em>Infinity</em> since the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power">JSA army pack</a> caught my attention in 2018, and have played several campaigns in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-rpg-review-core-rulebook">Infinity RPG</a>. The animation, and story details that we can see in the <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> trailer look to capture the feel of Infinity perfectly, and I can't wait to see more.</p>
<p>There's no release date for <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> yet, but we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>Everyone who went to the <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> panel at SDCC last weekend, got hold of an Event Exclusive Miniature for Kassad, the main protagonist in the upcoming series, and featured heavily throughout the trailer.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-paradise-lost-2.jpg?itok=g36aUwdl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-paradise-lost-2.jpg?itok=6WJva0o5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While Kassad doesn't have his own rules (yet...?), he's an alternative model for the&nbsp;Hassassin Farzan units that the profile for can be seen above.</figcaption></figure><p>While Kassad doesn't have his own special rules (he's a named character in the show and not the wargame), he's an alternative model for the Hassassin Farzan in the Haqqislam faction. On the tabletop, as you might expect, the Farzan's are incredibly stealthy, and use their camouflage, infiltration, and stealth abilities to move up the tabletop and take out key targets.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-paradise-lost-4.jpg?itok=_dCoKYQP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-paradise-lost-4.jpg?itok=Pu2HY1I0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The paint job above of the event-exclusive Kassad miniature shows him coming out of his camouflage, as can also be seen in the <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> trailer.</figcaption></figure><p>The awesome miniature comes as a single piece (no construction required), on a scenic base. The miniature looks like one you might see in a board game, not those usually produced for miniature wargames, but the sculpt is extremely detailed and you can see the individual hex shapes underneath his cloak and the extremely close struts on the grate on his base, detail that would be hard to get in the metal miniatures normally produced by Corvus Belli.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-paradise-lost-6.jpg?itok=WIKCxMng 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-paradise-lost-6.jpg?itok=6M3WiA0d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Kassad event-exclusive miniature for <em>Infinity</em> had incredible detail.</figcaption></figure><p>If you missed out on the event-exclusive miniature at SDCC, then the second-hand market might be your only option. Usually, once the event is over, you can't get hold of the exclusive again, unless Crovus Belli decides to release extra stock onto their website or offer them in competitions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-ai-sibylla-1.jpg?itok=yP7J9i0f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-ai-sibylla-1.jpg?itok=t_hKHAzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sibylla, the AI Chatbot for <em>Infinity</em>, can answer any questions you have on the Human Sphere.</figcaption></figure><h2>Sibylla, The AI Chatbbot</h2>
<p>Considering that one of the factions in <em>Infinity</em>, and usually the one that causes the most fuss in the setting, is based on a rogue AI, Corvus Belli releasing their own AI chatbot is a bold move, but one they have taken anyway. Sibylla, who can be found <a href="https://infinityuniverse.ai/">here</a>, is happy to help provide any answers or background you wish to know about in the Infinity universe. We've been careful to be polite and complimentary at all times, just in case.</p>
<p>Sibylla doesn't know the release date of <em>Infinity: Paradise Lost</em> either, we checked, and Sibylla assures us they don't work for ALEPH.</p>

			<p>Half-Life Alyx with the<a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-novr-mod-gets-fully-modeled-and-animated-arms/"> NoVR mod</a> that makes the game playable without a VR headset can run rather well on an RTX 4080 GPU, a new video shared today revealed.</p>
<p>The video, put together by MxBenchmarkPC, shows the game running at 8K resolution and locked 60 FPS with ultra settings on an RTX 4080 GPU. Sadly, there's some evident stuttering in some scenarios, so the end result isn't perfect, but the game undoubtedly looks incredible at such high resolution.</p>

<p>Tetris made its way into Minecraft last month with a new <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/line-tetris-add" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">add-on</a> that added Line-Clearing tools, colourful blocks and Tertimonsters. Now, through the latest DLC, Minecraft players can enjoy the classic game of Tetris and experience a unique twist within the Minecraft universe, adding a new layer of excitement to their gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the new DLC, players are in for an intriguing experience as they enter a Tetris Universe within Minecraft. The mission is to recover the stolen Tetriminos from a mischievous Tetrimonster. The journey begins with a round of 2D Tetris that transforms into a thrilling 3D dungeon filled with surprises and challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Each Tetris game is unique, so players encounter a different dungeon every time. It would help if you strategically used the Tetriminos to create a path that guides you to the treasure and keeps you away from the traps. Along the way, you will encounter various puzzles, rewards to collect, and monsters to fight. You aim to reach the top, where new Tetriminos await you in the next dungeon.</p>



<p>For those who love the classic modes, the Tetris DLC for Minecraft offers a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Players can enjoy the original game in the lobby, setting new high scores in Marathon, Sprint, and Ultra modes, complete with SRS-compliant Tetrimino action. And the best part? The entire DLC, including the classic modes, is available for multiplayer fun. The DLC is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-tetris-dlc-on-rotation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now available for download</a> from the Minecraft Marketplace.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In other news, the Minecraft movie<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is rumoured to have a creepy, too-realistic style</a>. Also, the game arrived for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-arrives-on-playstation-5-with-preview-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 through a preview version last month</a>. What are your thoughts on Minecraft’s new Tetris DLC? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
While he's "blown away" by the beach scenes in the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> trailer, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij thinks the forthcoming open worlder might underwhelm players hoping for a palpable technological update on GTA 5, which has been reworked and re-released extensively since its 2013 launch. This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation. It's becoming rare, he suggests, that you see a "jump" akin to GTA going 3D.

'Technological change' obviously covers a lot of bases, and what counts as a "jump" varies by the player or at least, the hardware manufacturer trying to flog you a new graphics card. One day people are frenziedly associating "the next gen" with the absence of crawlspaces, the next it's all about whether the vegetation rustles when you shoot it.</p>
<p>To chuck my own hat into the ring, I'm grumpy about placing video game hardware on a timeline from less to more advanced - this kind of rigid teleological, market-driven thinking cancels out and buries a wealth of specific usages of technology for particular artistic ends. I also agree with BioWare's Mark Darrah that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blockbuster-games-are-in-the-grip-of-a-fidelity-death-cult-says-former-dragon-age-producer">chasing fidelity for its own sake is a "death cult"</a>. Still, I can see Vermeij's point that it's generally harder to screenshot the difference between, say, two sequels released in the past five years than two sequels released in the early noughties.
</p>
<p>
"It's harder to make the same step again because well the technology is moving much slower," Vermeij observed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpF3lMqgPSw">SanInPlay</a>. "Like, the difference between PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 was enormous, and PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 is not that not that big, right. So you don't really have that technology jump to make things different and better. 
</p>
<p>
"So I think yeah, so I think GTA 6 is not going to be wildly different from GTA 5. I don't know, maybe they pulled it off, maybe it's amazing, but I think some people, their expectations might be a little too high. Because you can never have that jump, the jump from GTA 2 to GTA 3 was big, and from San Andreas to GTA 4 was very big. I don't think we can ever see a jump like that again."
</p>
<p>
Again, Vermeij is impressed by what he's glimpsed of GTA 6 nonetheless. Like fellow ex-Rockstar Mike York, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-trailer-is-how-the-game-is-really-going-to-look-not-cinematics-says-ex-rockstar-dev">posted his own reactions to the trailer in December</a>, he's mad keen on the NPC animations. "The scene that blows me away is the one on the beach where everybody seems to be doing something else," Vermeij enthused elsewhere in the SanInPlay interview. "Every character has got their own animation. I think that looks pretty amazing. But I don't think it is going to be wildly different from GTA 5. I think maybe people might be a little disappointed. But it's still going to be the best game out there."
</p>
<p>
Discussion of the supporting hardware aside, the interview includes some reflection on how Rockstar changed up their narrative and stylistic approach for GTA 4, introducing a more "serious" storyline about a migrant chasing the New York dream, and doing away with many of GTA: San Andreas's oddball flourishes, such as simulating the effects of over-eating.
</p>
<p>

"We had a lot of time to do that one, like three years," Vermeij recalled. "And we went crazy in all the features, like stupidly. We were like stealth and skydiving and all these bikes, articulated lorries - it was just ridiculous. And of course, the three cities. And then at the end of that, we thought 'OK that was dumb'. Because we didn't have to do it. We could do half of it and it would still be very good. So we knew for GTA 4, we had to make a big jump and work to make the animation better and the city better and all that stuff. So that's why we cut down the features on purpose. So that we could actually make it a much more polished, much more beautiful game. And then worry about the additional features later on."
</p>
<p>
All that notwithstanding, Vermeij prefers the preceding games for their more openly comedic tone. This is one reason he left Rockstar in 2009 (the others include wanting to relocate with his family, and wanting to work for a smaller team again). "The [opening] trilogy, I thought those games were just tons of fun," Vermeij said. "I really enjoyed them. And then we made 4, and to my mind, it was a little too serious, too dark, too depressing almost. So when I decided to leave after GTA 4, it was like a number of things. One of them was like, my wife's Canadian and she wanted to move back to Canada. But also, I thought GTA 4 wasn't as good and as fun as the games before. And I thought that the next one was going to be like, even darker. I'm happy to see that I was wrong. GTA 5 is a lot more lighthearted than GTA 4. So I got that wrong."
</p>
<p>
Vermeij feels that GTA needed to become more "realistic" to wow the punters, comparing Rockstar's on-going successes to other games that have tried to continue the tradition of "crazy, wild" GTA (he doesn't mention Saints Row, but it's the obvious elephant in the room). "And, you know, they didn't do that well either. So I think it was the right move to make it more serious. But at the same time, I sort of miss the old games still." He's hopeful that GTA 6 - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-style adventure in Vice City, GTA's version of Miami</a> - will keep things relatively light and silly.
</p>
<p>
"I love the Miami vibe. I think that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-appears-to-have-its-own-florida-man-parody">Miami Man theme</a> where people just do stupid stuff, and the alligators and sitting on cars and everything - I think that suits GTA very well. So yeah, it's going to be a good game for sure." Vermeij also speculates that Rockstar might have access to "pretty new technology having to do with animation and AI and all that stuff", remarking in closing that that "I think there's definitely time for a revolution where animation is maybe not hand-animated anymore, but it would be more AI-driven and physics-driven." He doesn't go into detail and I'll refrain from extrapolating, because I can never quite decide what "hand-animated" means or has meant.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Vermeij has held forth on all things GTA. Last year, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-once-planned-a-zombie-island-survival-game-using-gta-vice-city-code-but-it-was-too-depressing">aired a few cancelled Rockstar projects on his blog</a>, though he has since deleted these posts after current Rockstar developers expressed their displeasure. He still puts out the odd development titbit on <a href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij">Xitter</a>. GTA 6, meanwhile, is coming in 2025, though <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-thrilled-to-share-gta-6-with-players-everywhere-but-no-pc-release-date-yet">Rockstar have yet to pin down a PC release date</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
