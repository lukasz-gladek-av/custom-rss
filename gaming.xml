			<p>Today, Riot Games and VALORANT released information regarding the latest agent to be joining the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valorant-lands-on-consoles-soon-no-pc-crossplay-but-theres-cross-progression/">incredibly popular title</a>. Their name is Tejo, and he is a veteran intelligence consultant from Colombia who has a variety of abilities revolving around ballistics. If you want to see Tejo in action, make sure to check out the gameplay trailer below where you can see everything he has to offer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tejo Official Gameplay Reveal // VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRuRID5JoQY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, the commentary regarding the latest agent for VALORANT seems to be pretty positive, with many saying that he feels like he is a mix of pre-existing agents rolled into one as a powerful killer.</p>
<p>Like every other agent, he has four abilities which includes his Ultimate. These abilities are all showcased in the trailer above. However, we're going to run you through the abilities and what they do, so you can get confirmation on their functionality.</p>
<p>First up is Special Delivery, where you can equip a sticky grenade and fire it at your desired position. The grenade will then stick to the surface and explode after a short time, where any targets caught in the blast will become concussed. You can also alt fire the grenade so that it launches with a single bounce, rather than sticking in place.</p>
<p>Next is the Stealth Drone. You can equip and fire the drone to throw it forward, where you can then take control of its movement. Firing again allows you to trigger a pulse from the drone that Suppresses and Reveals any enemies that were hit by the pulse.</p>
<p>After that is the Guided Salvo, which allows Tejo to equip an AR targeting system. Firing allows you to select two locations on the map, with alt fire launching missiles on the target locations, and detonating as soon as they get to the planned spot.</p>
<p>Finally, Tejo's ultimate. He can utilize a tactical strike targeting map, where he can choose the origin point of the strike and then fire to unleash a heavy wave of explosions in his chosen destination.</p>
<p>However, Tejo is not the only thing coming to VALORANT, as a brand-new content type is being added to the game. This content is called Flex, where players can begin collecting handheld objects to show off their flair in battle. This is similar to the Spray Wheel, and can be equipped via Collections. As Flex is new <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the game</a>, players will receive a free Flex, with a second one becoming available in the upcoming Act I Battlepass.</p>

<p>The first new VALORANT agent of 2025 is <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1876282811667112298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">veteran ballistics expert Tejo</a>, who becomes the 26th agent to join the Riot shooter’s roster. Tejo is also the seventh agent under the initiator role, equipped with an explosive kit that overwhelms the opponent with ordinance. </p>



<p>Billed as a “veteran intelligence consultant from Colombia,” Riot says that the newest VALORANT agent Tejo is designed to “[pressure] the enemy to relinquish their ground – or their lives.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-tejo-s-abilities">What are Tejo’s abilities?</h2>



<p>The themes of Tejo’s ability kit are suppression and explosiveness. Like Fade and Sova, he doesn’t have a flash ability. But while those two are geared toward maximum information gathering, Tejo is a disruptive force who can wreak havoc on enemy setups.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Guide Salvo in action. Image credit: Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s how each of his abilities work:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Guided Salvo: </strong>Equip a tactical map, and like you’re placing Brimstone smokes, select two spots on the map. Activating the ability will send a self-guided missile to each of the two spots, detonating on arrival with a three-pulse explosion. Great for flushing enemies out of corners and hiding spots, and great for post-plants.</li>



<li><strong>Stealth Drone</strong>: Deploy a drone that you control for a limited time. The Drone controls like one of Skye’s Trailblazer tigers, and you can manually detonate it near an enemy to both suppress and reveal them.</li>



<li><strong>Special Delivery</strong>: Equip a sticky grenade that sticks to the surface and explodes, concussing enemies caught in the vicinity. You can normal fire the grenade to stick to the first surface it hits, or you can alt-fire with right-click to make it bounce once first.</li>



<li><strong>Armageddon</strong>: Tejo’s ultimate ability effectively calls in a super destructive airstrike that travels along a long corridor. Players bring up a tactical map, select a starting area, then use the mouse to choose the direction that Armageddon travels.</li>
</ul>



<p>Tejo will officially arrive in VALORANT on Tuesday, Jan. 7. Riot is also debuting a new cosmetic type called FLEX, which are unique handheld objects that players can interact with. There will be two available starting Jan. 7: one for free, and one in the paid track of the next battle pass. The next VALORANT act will start on Jan. 8.</p>

<p>Images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons have allegedly leaked online, providing new details about the successor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/523194/article/rumor-leaked-joy-con-2-pics-confirmed-via-serial-number-and-it-fits-nexthandhelds-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NintendoSwitch2</a> subreddit features a post that has leaked images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons from the Chinese online forum, Baidu Teiba. At first glance, players can spot several obvious changes, such as the larger SL and SR bumpers and new connectors. It seems the successor to the Switch will be ditching the rails for a new connector that will allow players to pop their Joy-Cons in instead of sliding them in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if you look closer, you will find a new addition to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons. The latest addition looks like some kind of sensor next to the new connector. Many players on the r/NintendoSwitch2 subreddit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1huvbt9/the_mouse_theory_doesnt_seem_so_unreasonable_to_me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">theorised</a> that this might be a sensor that will allow players to turn their Joy-Con into a mouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, the overall Joy-Con is much bigger, with larger joysticks and triggers. Regarding the colour, the Joy-Con is covered with a matte-black casing and has a patch of blue near the connectors. The new images of the Joy-Con also match the Christmas Leak by <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NextHandhled</a>, where the alleged Switch 2 console also had connectors instead of rails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-passes-ps2-in-total-us-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed PlayStation 2 in total US sales</a>. Also, check out the Switch 2 design <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-dbrand-give-players-another-look-at-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was leaked earlier by Dbrand</a>.

As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-now-the-only-game-in-the-series-with-online-functionality-as-2k23-servers-go-dark" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, WWE 2K23 goes dark today, January 6, 2025, when the servers are discontinued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. Players will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point. However if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes. The game itself and all VC (Virtual Currency), as well as DLC/Add-Ons, were pulled from sale in November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This also means WWE 2K23's PS5 and PS4 Platinum Trophy is unobtainable, the latest to fizzle out of existence with a server shutdown. Gamers have long called on the platform holders to mandate achievement and trophy changes upon a server shutdown so customers can still complete those challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k23-review">WWE 2K23 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Though the Showcase mode isn’t as super as its subject, John Cena, the sharp focus on refinement instead of reinvention helps keep WWE 2K23 as the gold standard of wrestling sims."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">WWE 2K23’s server shutdown leaves last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</a> as the only game in the series with online functionality. The expectation is WWE 2K25 launches around March this year, but some fans are now debating the value in investing time in these games if they fail to last even a couple of years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher 2K has form when it comes to shutting down its sports games in the immediate years after release. 2022's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k23-next-gen-version">NBA 2K23</a>, for example, shut down in December 2024. Rival sports video game maker EA tends to keep the online portion of its games running longer than 2K, with FIFA and Madden servers often up and running years after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>I have some <em>Fantastic</em> news <em>Four </em>you (it's Monday, let me have this one). At the end of the week, the Fantastic Four will be making their debut in the free-to-play hero PvP shooter, Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>The heroic team - which comprises Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch and the Thing - will be arriving in the game as part of the first season, known as Eternal Night Falls, which has a vampiric flavour to it.</p>

<p>"Darkness engulfs New York as the Timestream Entanglement leaves Doctor Strange trapped in the Entangled Astral Plane, scattering the Darkhold pages. Dracula and Doctor Doom disrupt the moon's orbit, plunging the city into eternal night and unleashing an army of vampiric creatures," reads the official blurb.</p><p>"With the world on the brink, the Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals!"</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals' first season kicks off at 1am PST on Friday, 10th January. That's 9am for those of us in the UK. You can check out a teaser for the upcoming season and the Fantastic Four's debut above. As you can see, the artwork also includes H.E.R.B.I.E., Marvel's Humanoid Experimental Robot, B-Type, Integrated Electronics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">Marvel Rivals has proven incredibly popular</a> since its launch. Its opening weekend saw 10 million players join online to take part in the fray.</p>
<p>"NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>. "Its biggest impact is a renewed appreciation for the rivals that do it better." He awarded it two out of five stars. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-claims-2025-as-the-year-of-eevee<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
2025 will be the Year of Eevee, according to the Pokémon Company. 
</p>
<p>
Branding showing <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/year-of-eevee">Pokémon's Year of Eevee</a> is now live on the franchise's Pokémon Center site, alongside an array of merchandise featuring the cute creature and its many evolutions including plushies and action figures. 
</p>
<p>
The gimmick follows Nintendo previously declaring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-nintendos-year-of-luigi-continues-until-18th-march">2014 to be the Year of Luigi</a>, and Sega last year dubbing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">2024 to be the Year of Shadow the Hedgehog</a>.
</p>
<p>
On the surface, the Year of Eevee seems to be just a merchandise range, but the Pokémon Center often taps into themes for the coming year with merchandise that ties into the wider franchise.

</figure>
<p>
So, what's in store for Pokémon fans this Year of Eevee? So far, all we know of 2025 is that it will see the launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the next mainline Pokémon game that will return to Kalos, the region based on Paris first seen in Pokémon X and Y. (And hey, that's where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> Fest is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2025-to-be-held-in-paris">being held this year</a>! How's that for brand synergy?)
</p><p>
Could the Year of Eevee finally see a new Eevee evolution announced, perhaps set to debut in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? It's now been 12 years since Eevee's eighth evolution option - the Fairy-type Sylveon - was announced, and fans have long hoped for more. A Dragon-type Eeveelution, perhaps? Or how about a Ghost-type?
</p>
<p>And what else could be on the way? C'mon, Pokémon - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">Sega gave Shadow a movie</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/open-thread-how-was-your-break<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to 2025, which is starting in earnest with good things–<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games Done Quick</a>!--and less good things–<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/06/nx-s1-5217818/january-6-electoral-count-reform-act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the US certifying election results</a>, ushering in whatever the next four years of our lives are going to be. Let’s drag our heels a little longer by reflecting on the glory of the timeless sprawl of winter break.</p><p>My break was pretty OK– I went to visit my parents in Florida for the first time since they moved there many years ago. For <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/en/know-your-rights/know-your-rights-floridas-public-restroom-changing-facility-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obvious reasons</a> I wasn’t that psyched to go, but the trip was mostly good. They live in a weird golfing complex, which makes my dad happy and gave me the opportunity to spy on golfers and remember how much I don’t like golf. My sister took me and my youngest niece and nephew to the Everglades, where we saw so many terrifying alligators and also some cool birds. My parents have a giant TV that is positively cursed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sor5qTTsOOQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion smoothing</a>; I smugly said “Oh, I can fix this for you,” only for them to not be able to find the remote that would allow me to do so. I have failed in my duty as an ostensibly tech-savvy kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also spent some time with my sister’s family in South Carolina, where she lives on a farm full of horses, who let me pet them, and also goats, who for some inexplicable reason I want to pick up and cradle like babies but who mostly ran away to mockingly have goat fun where I couldn’t get to them.</p><p>Because I was away, I didn’t get to play as many games as I meant to, though I did start a new run in my favorite game, <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Long Dark</em></a>, instead of doing the more professionally responsible thing of playing more <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>. But I did read a lot of books on my travels: a book about <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671288/dont-call-it-a-cult-by-sarah--berman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NXIVM</a>, an academic book about <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479881062/heavens-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heaven’s Gate</a>, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670541/the-rich-people-have-gone-away-by-regina-porter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Rich People Have Gone Away</em></a> (wasn’t as into it as I was hoping to be from reviews), and half of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/665335/come-and-get-it-a-gma-book-club-pick-by-kiley-reid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Come and Get It</em></a>, which I’m digging.</p><p>And now we’re all back to work and ready (or not) for whatever a new year will bring. What did you get up to? How’s your 2025 feeling so far? &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The last time I wrote about Sonic fangame, I innocently and absent-mindedly described it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dr-robotniks-ring-racers-is-a-gorgeous-free-snes-style-arcade-racer-built-using-doom-legacy">"SNES-style"</a>. This led to <a href="https://x.com/rockpapershot/status/1783557395202834708">a social media dog-pile</a> of an intensity typically reserved for major international banks accidentally tweeting rule34, <a href="https://x.com/rockpapershot/status/1783557395202834708/quotes">a howl of derision</a> that washed over me again and again while I rolled around on the floor beneath my desk, caterwauling at Graham to please please delete the whole internet, I want to start all over again. </p>
<p>Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. <a href="https://sonicgalactic.github.io/index.html">Please find it here on Itch.io</a>. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.</p><!--more-->

<p>The base marker for judgement of any post-Mega-Drive Sonic game is: which sidekicks have they kept in? Because after all, the addition of sidekicks has gone hand-in-hand with Sonic's dilution from iconic platform game into puddle of franchising goop. Expand beyond the core trinity of Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, and you are adding a range of, at best, gimmicky, at worst, actively poisonous condiments to an exquisite layer cake. But there are circumstances under which a dollop of Amy Rose, a smattering of Shadow can bring piquancy and zestiness.</p><p>Sonic Galactic seems to have the right idea. Aside from Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, it adds Fang the Sniper (a jerboa) from Sonic The Hedgehog Triple Trouble, and a new character, Tunnel the Mole (a mole). Each character has their own moves with which to modulate the classic Sonic thrill of pinballing through beautiful, "hand-pixelled" arrangements of ring-bedecked loops and ramps, only to collide with some spikes when you're 10 rings away from a 1-Up. </p>
<p>I've played a bit of the demo, which terrifies me slightly for having a tutorial level, with quite wordy text instructions that clatter into view while you're platforming. The game otherwise fits my memories of the Mega Drive games like a glove. It very much feels like the game Sonic Team might have made if they'd been asked to iterate upon the visual and ability design of Sonic 3 - it has the same roster of elemental TV power-ups, but adds a wall-kick for Sonic and various nifty techniques for when running on water. So far, Galactic seems to play things straighter than the obvious comparison, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a>, which I think is showier in its remixing of elements from the older Sonic games. </p>
<p>The 3D special stages are where you most see the "power of Saturn", a very good console that is now mostly remembered for getting its arse kicked by PlayStation 1. The chiptune soundtrack, meanwhile, has that pacey wistfulness I associate with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-i8HYi1QH0">the series at its best</a>.</p>
<p>Sonic Galactic was announced back in 2020, and doesn't have a release date yet. Go on, take the demo out for a spin-attack.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Today is a big day for the WWE, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwes-monday-night-raw-is-moving-to-netflix-in-2025/1100-6520526/" data-ref-id="1100-6520526">Raw officially moves to Netflix</a> with tonight's show from Los Angeles. It also marks an end of an era for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k23-review-head-of-the-table/1900-6418048/" data-ref-id="1900-6418048">WWE 2K23</a>. As of now, 2K Games has taken down the game's servers permanently.</p><p>2K Games said it was giving WWE 2K23 its "final takedown" <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/33035089436307--WWE-2K23-SERVER-SUNSET" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">last September</a>. The game and its DLC was removed from PlayStation and Xbox's digital storefronts at the beginning of November. Now that the servers are also down, WWE 2K23 will no longer have any online functions, including player-to-player matches or even the Community Creations that allowed fan-made characters to be downloaded.</p><p>However, WWE 2K23 will still be available to play offline for anyone who purchased it prior to its removal. This game's fate foreshadows what will eventually befall its successor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k24-review-long-term-booking/1900-6418191/" data-ref-id="1900-6418191">WWE 2K24</a>. That game reintroduced the special referee mode and featured <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k24-cover-stars-new-match-types-and-release-date-revealed/1100-6520486/" data-ref-id="1100-6520486">40 Years of WrestleMania</a>, which allowed players to recreate several famous matches from "the showcase of the immortals."</p><p>2K Games hasn't officially unveiled WWE 2K25 yet, but if the game holds to the previous titles' release window, it should arrive sometime early this year. WWE superstars have also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-new-wwe-finishers-have-a-small-touch-wrestling-fans-will-appreciate/1100-6525270/" data-ref-id="1100-6525270">crossed over with Call of Duty</a> and Fortnite in the past, so the next WWE 2K game may not be the only place to find your favorite wrestlers in 2025.</p>

      </div>
<h3 dir="ltr">Season 23 Mid-Season Loba Changes</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Loba's tactical ability (Burglar's Best Friend) is getting a second charge by default and the toss and recovery time are both increasing.</li><li dir="ltr">Loba's ultimate ability (Black Market Boutique) will be available immediately, will deploy faster, will be able to be remotely packed up, and can pick up small meds and ally banners for free.</li><li dir="ltr">Black Market Boutique will be able to steal from Explosive Holds and Vaults once again, and stealing from Vaults won't destroy the Black Market Boutique (alarms still go off)</li><li dir="ltr">Loba will be able to pick the locks on Vaults as an interaction</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In addition to these changes, Loba's in-match upgrade paths have been overhauled with one now focused on stealing more items for teammates while the other amplifies her Burglar's Best Friend tactical ability so that she behaves a bit more like a Skirmisher with escape options (akin to Wraith or Alter).</p><p dir="ltr">Mirage is also getting an update but it's not quite as major as the adjustments that Loba is getting. Mirage's passive ability, Now You See Me..., is being improved so that now the holographic trickster will always cloak while he's healing, and while cloaked after a successful revive, Mirage will get a temporary speed boost to aid in repositioning. He's also getting an interesting addition to the second stage of his in-match upgrade track, gaining a choice to access all class-based consoles, bins, beacons, and package scans to become the only character in the game that can transform into an all-rounder.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422592-s0_wraithmirage2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422592" data-ratio="0.50966936993138" data-width="1603" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422592-s0_wraithmirage2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422592"></a><figcaption>Mirage is transforming into Apex Legends' first jack-of-all-trades character.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422592-s0_wraithmirage2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I spoke to the Apex Legends dev team about why these changes to Loba and Mirage are coming so late in Season 23--as opposed to being included in the initial seasonal patch--lead legend designer Devin McGuire told me there are "a couple different reasons."</p><p dir="ltr">"Generally we wanted to not throw all our eggs in one basket because support characters will naturally just compete for each other's spaces and some will hit the limelight and others won't. So by splitting it up, we ensure that everyone gets their time and gets to focus in on what the new hotness is. And then by the time the mid-season comes in, we can tip that up and there's something new to look forward to, there's new angles to play off of this support meta once it's been learned. The [legends] that we chose [to get updates] at the start [of Season 23] are simpler to understand legends.</p><p dir="ltr">"And then [Loba and Mirage] are the more nuanced support legends. [Loba] plays off of teleporting and looting up, which are a different way of supporting than just shielding and healing. And then Mirage, who is a very strange one, plays off of cloaking and deception in order to get off more supportive angles and options."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422594-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422594" data-ratio="0.54414784394251" data-width="1461" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422594-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422594"></a><figcaption>Loba is getting huge buffs in the mid-season update, making her a substantially better thief.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422594-s5_loba3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In response to how dominant Gibraltar, Newcastle, and Lifeline have become in Apex Legends' meta in response to the Season 23 changes--all three can keep their allies up and fighting extremely easy if they're carrying a gold knockdown shield--the mid-season update is nerfing that combination a bit to give opposing legends a fighting chance.</p><p dir="ltr">"Both Lifeline and Newcastle ballooned out to a pretty crazy extreme," McGuire said. "We expected them to do that. Lifeline was already at the top of the pick rate and a revival of her amidst already being that strong is not going to bring her down by any means. So I think that these [mid-season] changes will settle them a little bit, just the way that when we made the gold knockdown change early on, it brought both of those characters a little bit closer in line. I don't think we'll see a major shift from them being super high in the meta until we tamper down on the season of support as a whole."</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the playable legends, weapons are getting several adjustments as well. The scariest adjustment is the return of the Select Fire weapon attachment, meaning the fully automatic Prowler submachine gun is once again a threat in Ranked play. The attachment is also, surprisingly, now being allowed on the Charge Rifle as well, the game's second-slowest-firing sniper rifle. With this attachment, the Charge Rifle can now go automatic, firing continuous piercing lasers at an increased fire rate (thankfully, in this mode, at 60% of normal damage).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422595-s7_horizon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422595" data-ratio="0.56263121063681" data-width="1429" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422595-s7_horizon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422595"></a><figcaption>The mid-season update is making minor adjustments to both the Mastiff and Peacekeeper shotguns as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422595-s7_horizon.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese told me that the devs have wanted to add an automatic sniper rifle to Apex Legends for a while now but repeated attempts resulted in something akin to a marksmen rifle. With the Select Fire attachment returning to the loot pool, the team decided to--instead of making a new gun--try using the attachment to give an old gun the option of a faster fire rate.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's still methodical," lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese Canavese clarified when I asked how an automatic sniper rifle could possibly be fair in terms of power. "You still have some time to calibrate and think between shots. Because it represents so much power, we still needed to have a fair amount of recoil--because with snipers you really want them to be able to settle back down before you fire again. So that meant we needed to keep it a bit slower in the fire rate. It's not the same fire rate as the Rampage [light machine gun], but it's like how you would look at the relationship between a Spitfire and a Rampage. This is a slow but automatic version of a sniper."</p><p dir="ltr">The Charge Rifle's projectile size and range are also increasing (the range is going from 200m to 300) while the effects of gravity on projectiles and the recoil while firing are both decreasing, which should make it significantly easier to land shots with what's been a powerful but unwieldy weapon for several seasons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422596-s0_lifeline5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422596" data-ratio="0.58733624454148" data-width="1374" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422596-s0_lifeline5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422596"></a><figcaption>Lifeline has enjoyed a severe spike in pick rate since the start of Season 23, as developer Respawn intended.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422596-s0_lifeline5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alongside the return of the Select Fire, a new Ultimate Accelerator attachment is being added to the game that automatically comes equipped with the Nemesis assault rifle, G7 Scout marksmen rifle, and C.A.R. submachine gun. This new attachment increases the rate by which you charge your shield and ultimate ability while dealing damage or knocking targets with these weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it's basically accelerating your gameplay--you're leveling up a bit faster if you're using these weapons," Canavese said. "[The Ultimate Accelerator] is all about pushing that high-octane gameplay, putting it on faster weapons to sort of align with that fast style of gameplay. It's got some cool stuff where if you have an accelerated weapon in your load-out and you get a knock, we actually reward you with a chunk of ultimate charge. It's really good if you're running one of these weapons, it's much easier to reset your ultimates after fights to get ready for the next fight."</p><p dir="ltr">Both the C.A.R. and the Nemesis have never supported hop-up attachments before, making this their first. "We're always looking to flesh out the roster in that way," Canavese said. "For the most part, the C.A.R. is sort of underperforming in the SMG category, so this is an opportunity for us to see if we can boost a weapon's relevancy by giving it utility versus just giving it raw damage. And we think that that's a really fun experiment to be trying."</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends Season 23 has shown considerable attention to the support class, so it remains to be seen if this mid-season update is the last major adjustment to the meta we'll see ahead of Season 24 and the next major patch. Season 24 will also mark the six-year anniversary of Apex Legends, kicking off in mid-February.</p>

                <p>A newly unsurfaced and translated interview reveals more information about how the Mario franchise's iconic pipes came to be, and there is a pretty simple explanation for it.</p><p>Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto told Game Maestro in 2000, and translated more recently by <a href="https://shmuplations.com/miyamoto2000/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shmuplations</a>, that although the first Mario Bros. game established Mario as a plumber, the idea for pipes didn't come until later. Miyamoto said he was walking down the street in Kyoto one day and "saw a plastic pipe sticking out of a wall." This helped Miyamoto solve a design challenge, and thus the iconic warp pipe was born.</p><p>"Due to the way the screens worked, enemies that went to the bottom had to re-appear at the top of the screen. So that got us thinking, OK, we need a path or some way for them to get back up there. Then one day I happened to be walking through the streets of Kyoto, and I saw a plastic pipe sticking out of a wall," he said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/marios-iconic-pipes-only-exist-because-shigeru-miyamoto-happened-to-see-a-plastic-pipe-sticking-out-of-a-wall-while-wandering-the-streets-of-kyoto/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_content=gamesradar&amp;utm_medium=social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>Miyamoto also discussed how a logical setting for the original Mario games was an underground tunnel, in part because it's where turtles, crabs, and flies--enemies in the game--tend to live. He envisioned a place like New York with its extensive underground tunnel system, though Miyamoto hadn't ever been to New York at the time.</p><p>"I guess we should say Mario Bros. takes place in a New York-ish kind of place, really," he said.</p><p>This wasn't the last time Miyamoto discussed the origins of Mario's iconic pipes. In 2009, he said in an <a href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/wii/nsmb/0/2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iwata Asks interview</a> that he was walking through a residential area on the way home from his office when he said an area that had "a number of drainage pipes coming out of it."</p><p>"I thought: 'I can use those!' (laughs) It's well established that something will emerge from a pipe and then go back into it," he said.</p><p>But why make the pipes green? Miyamoto said he couldn't recall the exact reason, but explained that video games at the time couldn't support all that many different colors.</p><p>"Blue was very bright and beautiful. Green was also very nice when you used two different tones. Those were the things we considered when designing the look of the game," he said.</p><p>Nintendo doesn't have any new Mario games that have been announced, but that could change soon, as Nintendo is likely to bring a new Mario game to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. The console will be announced in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">next few months</a>, at which point some games should be revealed for it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-centers-year-of-eevee-promises-tons-of-eevee-themed-merch-in-2025.1074912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-year-of-eevee-merchandise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has designated 2025 as the "Year of Eevee", promising tons of Eevee-themed merchandise throughout the year including plushies, TCG sets, figurines, and much more.</p>

<p>Over on the UK version of the Pokemon Center <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/year-of-eevee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;(with the promo likely also on its way to the US website soon), the company promises "a year of Eevee products" as a gift for those who "love Eevee". Who doesn't?</p>

<p>The site goes on to say that "from plush to apparel,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>to figures, you won't be short on Eevee merch this year". True to its word, the site then spotlights a number of existing plushies, toys, and pins themed around Eevee and its evolutions (or Eeveelutions).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-listings.jpg?itok=qY6xd3Bn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-listings.jpg?itok=WoNLmx1t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Year of Eevee is already well and truly underway on the Pokemon Center website.</figcaption></figure><p>Further down, the Pokemon Center site looks forward to Eevee merchandise that's coming later this year, including "a new series of beautifully-crafted Evolving Personalities figures" based on Eeveelutions.</p>

<p>They include the Splashes Vaporeon figure, the Skillful Strategy Jolteon figure, and the Satisfied Snooze Flareon figure, with several more based on the remaining Eeveelutions coming later on.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new kind of plushie that features "the most cozy, fleecy material", and as you've probably guessed, Eevee will be one of the options for that plushie, although you can also pick up Pikachu if you like.</p>

<p>All of this is, of course, in addition to the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-brings-eevee-and-its-many-forms-to-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow"><em>Prismatic Evolutions&nbsp;</em>set</a> for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG</em>, which launches next week and revolves mainly around Eevee and its evolutions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions.jpg?itok=j7zmhfec 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions.jpg?itok=1mYb5EEQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Prismatic Evolutions&nbsp;</em>set will be heavily themed around Eevee.</figcaption></figure><p>All of this Eevee-related excitement comes as speculation regarding the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor mounts. Nintendo has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">promised an announcement</a> before April this year, so it's very possible the new console could be revealed this month.</p>

<p>In February, a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">was revealed</a>, and we still don't have a concrete release date for that. Additionally, mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games have been released every three years since 2013, so we could be due an announcement on that front soon as well.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that given that 2025 is now apparently the Year of Eevee, and given all of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em> news we might reasonably expect this year, we could finally be in for a new Eeveelution being revealed soon. Let's hope so!</p>

This is nuts. Absolutely sicko behavior. Sony may have won the console war but there are clearly millions of degenerates within its ranks. The revelation comes from a recent interview with console interface designers at Sony and how player habits informed their choices when creating the new Welcome Hub. </p><p>“We had an internal hypothesis that far more people would put their console into rest mode than would fully shut it down each time between their play sessions,” Cory Gasaway, VP of Product, Game and Player Experiences at Sony Interactive Entertainment, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/exclusive-ps5-welcome-hub-dashboard-cory-gasaway&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/exclusive-ps5-welcome-hub-dashboard-cory-gasaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game File</em></a></span>. <strong>“</strong>As it turned out, it was actually about 50/50 between the two options between all our players. So, what that meant was for about 50 percent of our users, when they booted up, if they were in the U.S. they were landing on our ‘Explore’ page, and if they were outside the U.S. they were landing on the game page for the last game that they have played.”</p><p>For people like me who just put the console into rest mode, starting it up again puts you right back into whatever game was last being played. Others—roughly 32.5 million, to be exact—were landing on woefully boring home menu tabs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-2024-year-review-concord-helldivers-astro-bot-price-1851724531?_gl=1*107oqcx*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjE3MzU0NS42MS4xLjE3MzYxNzYwOTMuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-2024-year-review-concord-helldivers-astro-bot-price-1851724531?_gl=1*107oqcx*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjE3MzU0NS42MS4xLjE3MzYxNzYwOTMuNjAuMC4w">The Welcome Hub added last year fixed that</a></span> by adding a bunch of customizable widgets that immediately share cool info about things like console storage, DualSense battery life, and wishlist sales. </p><p>It’s all part of an ongoing effort within Sony to “have more shortcuts” in the console that “reduce the number of clicks” for players to get to what they need, as well as surfacing features and functionality they might not have been previously aware of.  Gasaway also told <em>Game File</em> that decoupling some of the user interface from system-level software updates has helped it speed up the number of tweaks and updates it pushes out every year. </p><p> Hiromi Wakai, vice president of product management at Sony Interactive Entertainment, also recently shared another interesting insight with <em>Game File</em> about PlayStation fans. It turns out the heaviest usage for the PlayStation Portal cloud gaming handheld comes at around 9:00 p.m. each day, about an hour after peak PS5 usage hits. “This could suggest scenarios like users playing on the console first, then later switching to PS Portal to play in another room—courtesy of PS Portal’s characteristics like the ability to play in another room—while their family is using the TV,” Wakai said.</p><p>The PS Portal has also been getting updates in response to the real-world usage data coming in.

			<p>We’ve finally reached the point that even remakes are being remastered. Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana isn’t just a remaster of a 2010 PSP game being given new life on modern consoles, because even that was a localised port of a 2005 PC remake of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys back in 1989! Despite, or perhaps because of, all those steps of separation from the original release, the result is one of the most refreshing and immediately engaging entries in this decades-old franchise.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHMjSsm9qi8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>




<p>Even though recent original entries in the series, like last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/ys-x-nordics-review/">Ys X: Nordics</a>, are chasing higher fidelity and expanded gameplay sub-systems, when you look at the gaming landscape at large it’s clear that more and more people yearn for artistically driven and lower fidelity games that wear retro charm on their sleeve. Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana in 2005 was a complete reimagining of Ys III, stepping back from the side-scrolling spin-off from the original series formula to better match the action of Ys IV, but twenty years on from that, it doesn’t try to shoot for the increasingly unobtainable fidelity-focused goals of modern gaming. This release instead celebrates its roots at every opportunity.</p>

<p>In that sense, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana feels like an incredibly timely release – on PlayStation 5 the game certainly runs at a higher resolution than ever and a consistent framerate, but the character models and textures look just like they did on PSP and PC, and you have a choice between original and refined graphics for the dialogue character art. Of the three available soundtrack options, one of them is the original Wanderers from Ys PC-88 soundtrack and the other is the only slightly-less-old-school X68000 soundtrack from the 2005 PC release.</p>

<p>One of the major charming elements of the Ys franchise is that the combat and gameplay was so ahead of it’s time. A groundbreaking, lightning-fast action game from like this from 20 years ago isn’t any less fun or exciting today. You’ll barely be able to see your protagonist Adol Christin on the screen at some points with how fast you’re moving, spinning your blades at waves of enemies and constantly unlocking new attacks and abilities that expand your arsenal. The depth of gameplay and customization here isn’t as deep as more recent Ys entries that give you access to multiple party members or more dynamic sub-systems of character growth, but it never feels like any of that is needed. What’s lost in character-building growth is made up for twice-fold in the increasing amounts of strategy and quick-thinking that bosses will require of you as you progress through the game.</p>
<p>While the narrative of Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana isn’t a major highlight of the experience, it never drags on or over-explains to the point of getting in your way like a few more recent Ys entries do. You’ve got engaging stakes and likeable characters, and they always serve the purpose of propelling you towards your next exciting gameplay moment, and never holding you back from them. Sure, the result means you shouldn’t be expecting some kind of meta-textual brain-melting story experience from this game, but I’m happy to have my brain unmelted when the trade-off is face-meltingly fast and exciting boss battles – even faster if you engage Turbo mode.</p>

<p>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana has aged flawlessly, and is the perfect sort of simple, fast-paced action game that anyone can hop into and enjoy. With how expansive and varied the Ys series has become over the years, it’s also an exciting window into the origins of the franchise, and a reminder of why this series has been heralded as Nihon Falcom’s flagship franchise for so long.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-tejo-season-2025-act-1</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-valorant-agent-tejo-revealed-for-season-2025-act-1.1074864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-tejo-season-2025-act-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>Agent in the form of Tejo, an Initiator with a number of rather intriguing gadgets to his name.</p>

<p>Tejo will arrive alongside Season 2025 Act 1, which is set to debut in just a couple of days. He's a Colombian intelligence consultant with a "ballistic guidance system" that both helps his allies to identify their foes and deals direct damage into the bargain.</p>

<p>First up, Tejo's Special Delivery ability fires a sticky grenade onto the first surface it hits, exploding and Concussing targets caught up in its blast radius. You can also launch the grenade with just one bounce using the alt fire key.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-new-agent-tejo-special-delivery.jpg?itok=HhmTWk0d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-new-agent-tejo-special-delivery.jpg?itok=VmWEB5g0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tejo is&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s latest Initiator Agent.</figcaption></figure><p>Stealth Drone, meanwhile, allows Tejo to control a drone as it reveals the enemies its pulse hits, as well as Suppressing them. Finally, the Guided Salvo ability hits up to two locations on the map with missiles that detonate as soon as they arrive.</p>

<p>Of course, Tejo also has an Ultimate ability in the form of Armageddon, a tactical strike that delivers a payload of explosives along a custom-set path. It sounds like Tejo won't be for those who prefer their Agents simple, but he'll be a rewarding choice for more skilled players.</p>

<p>Along with Tejo,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s Season 2025 Act 1 also brings with it the Flex system, consisting of "handheld objects that [give] players more ways to express themselves in-game". Each player will get one Flex for free, and a second will be available via the battle pass.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to get your hands on the new EX.O skin line, which offers skins for the Vandal, the Sheriff, the Spectre, the Outlaw, and the Katana.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, it's a competitive multiplayer first-person shooter created by&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Riot Games.</p>

<p>The game mixes the objective-based gameplay of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive" rel="nofollow">Counter-Strike</a>&nbsp;</em>with the hero-focused approach of the likes of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and the more recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, offering players unique abilities for each Agent while also keeping the focus on map control and awareness.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://playvalorant.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Season 2025 Act 1 arrives on January 8th.</p>

            <p>An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Even at a surface glance, Paradise looks like a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">Grand Theft Auto Online</a> pretender with added AI goop - not particularly appealing when placed next to Rockstar's high quality and "hand crafted"  cityscapes. Here's the early trailer for the game:</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="PARADISE ® | Official Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmPZp4Lhi40?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmPZp4Lhi40" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>As you can see, it's very "we've got Los Santos at home". Many elements, including the minimap, map text, and even the beach umbrellas, look identical to those found in either GTA V or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">the trailer for GTA VI</a>. The company have even copied the music and motto from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkiRB7sM_Y4">a fan-made trailer for a now defunct GTA roleplaying server</a>, which was itself called "Paradise Roleplay".</p><p>The biggest tell lands at 1:20, when the narrator announces that you'll "earn money and crypto" while the player character strolls into a bank. Subsequent trailers have downplayed the crypto element, and the same trailer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3281420/Paradise/">on Steam</a> has been edited to exclude that particular word, probably to abide by Valve's rules on marketing cryptocurrency. The company behind Paradise, Ultra Games, say they're no longer going to ship it with cryptocurrency in mind but, as we'll see, the game itself seems to barely matter.</p>
<p>Last month, various YouTubers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9CQBMzLjCA">brought up these concerns</a> around the game, including the fact that early trailers showed unlicensed Lamborghinis. Most chutzpah-ly of all, Paradise promised the ability to interact with AI versions of popular influencers like Pokimane and Fortnite streamer Lachlan Power, among many others. However, none of those big-time streamers have said anything about the game on their public channels. The trailer that promises AI cameos of these influencers is still showing on Steam, but the game's website now admits that certain high profile streamfolk won't appear, claiming that "not all contracts were finalized within the expected timeframe."</p>

<p>Some accusations made by the YouTubers felt overzealous. Buying and using assets from Unreal's store is not a crime, for example. But considering the many other signs of crypto-dirt, you don't even need to point to cheap assets as proof of suspicious practices. Paradise has more smoking guns than a firing range at West Point. </p><p>Most dramatically, later investigations by YouTuber "Jetro" claim that the company are not based in Hong Kong, as they state on their website, but are allegedly practicing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_5S3JVEY-g">a Russian-backed "pump and dump" scam</a> centred around an app that lets you buy the game's currency - the PAR token - before release. Jetro also points out that the game's Steam listing claims it will utilize kernal level anti-cheat, which "will give the developers full access to everything on your PC," he warns. "For this reason I do not recommend  downloading this game at any point."</p>
<p>Despite all this, the game is still gaining followers on Steam. Paradise had 20,000 followers a month ago, according to <a href="https://games-stats.com/">game-stats.com</a>, and that has since risen to over 30,000 followers. To put this into perspective, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> has around 27,000 followers at time of print, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has around 40,000. It is enough to get Paradise onto the stat site's top ten list of "trending upcoming games". </p>

<p>At a conservative estimate, these follower numbers may translate to about 150,000 wishlists or more (I'm using the calculations figured out by <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/deep-dive-how-steam-followers-and">the data crunchers at Game Discoverer</a> for that). Granted, there is no accounting for statistical shenanigans and even less accounting for bots, sockpuppets, and otherwise false wishlists. But still, it should be a concern that such a blatantly sketchy game is rising through the ranks of curation on Steam as well as being shared more broadly on social media. </p><p>I've asked Valve if they have existing concerns about the game and whether it ought to be allowed on the store. Meanwhile, it looks like Epic Games have already removed the game from sale, its store page now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-57edc7">redirecting to a 404 not found</a>.</p>
<p>As for the creators of the unreleased game, they have posted <a href="https://paradisevs.com/community_info">a lengthy and defensive FAQ</a> on their website which more or less repeatedly hollers "we're doing nothing illegal, promise!" You might expect a GTA-like's FAQ to include stuff like "What guns will I get?" or "How many jet skis can I own?" But for Paradise we get answers to: "Where is your company’s registered legal address?" and "Are there specialists from other countries, including Russia, on your team?" These are questions a player shouldn't have to ask once, never mind <em>frequently</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone players are screaming out for the return of their first love—Verdansk. The iconic battle royale map birthed friendships, laughs, and intense victories during a difficult time in the world. Verdansk is coming back to Warzone, and its release period is interesting.</p>



<p>“Verdansk” is a stimulus word for many, with CoD smartly priming this feeling many years ago in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beginners-tips-and-tricks-for-winning-big-in-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a>. Activision had no right to drop a free-to-play battle royale so compelling. Its smart tactical gameplay was outshined by frantic firefights as you desperately sought cover under the shelter of Stadium’s sunlight-blocking presence. </p>



<p>Verdansk was the source of comfort for frustrated players emotionally bettered by the plight of the world in 2020 and beyond. With Warzone not quite what it once was, it’s time for the fictional city to return to Call of Duty.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone">Is Verdansk Coming Back to Warzone?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s good to be back. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, to be clear, <strong>Verdansk is returning</strong>, and there are no debates or rumors here. Warzone is officially bringing back Verdansk to console CoD, and I’m not talking about Warzone Mobile.</p>



<p>The handheld spin-off marked the first appearance of Verdansk since it was removed. However, Verdansk deserves a bigger stage, and it’s getting one.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-warzone-s-verdansk-release-date">Do we Know Warzone’s Verdansk Release Date?</h2>



<p>There isn’t a precise date, but <strong>Verdansk returns to Warzone sometime in 2025</strong>—we know this is the case as it was confirmed at 2024’s COD NEXT event.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873802551271432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828873802551271432%7Ctwgr%5E78cbc24b0e3ac71fc9db6351227985dd8fa46544%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fverdansk-return-warzone-2025%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD’s official X account</a> echoed the news with a message sure to get the blood pumping, “Run it back. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/">Verdansk will return to Call of Duty Warzone in 2025</a>.”</p>



<p>Before you ask, there aren’t any leaks or general indicators as to when in 2025. It could be midway through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> lifecycle, or Activision can choose to wait until the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty 2025</a> for a joint integration.</p>



<p>We’ll update this when we have an exact release date for Verdansk’s reintroduction.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-verdansk-removed-from-warzone">When Was Verdansk Removed From Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Verdansk was removed in December 2021</strong> when it was replaced with the tropical Caldera map for the launch of Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Caldera.</p>



<p>The original Verdansk changed from its debut, from opening up Bunkers to The Destruction of Vedansk—eventually leading to things starting anew with Verdansk ’84. I’m sure we all have our first and last experiences of the legendary map (mine being a win!) and 2025 is ready to hit you in the nostalgia and create new memories and matches.</p>



<hr>



<p>On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you to see Verdansk return? Are you excited to drop into Dam, Train Station, and Superstore? Or will the novelty wear off quicker than a 1v1 in the OG Gulag?

The 1,000th Wordle game was played in early 2024, and it still retains a large audience. Now, the New York Times has revealed which word tripped up millions of Wordle players in 2024.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/news/new-york-times-top-wordle-connections-2024-rcna185738" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a>, 5.6 million Wordle streaks ended on October 15, 2024. The word chosen for that day was "corer," which can refer to either a knife that's used for coring fruits or a large hollow cylindrical drill/tube that's primarily made for extracting samples of rocks or dirt from the ground or the ocean floor. </p><p>The outcome of that puzzle doesn't seem to have had an adverse affect on Wordle's numbers. The New York Times even debuted a math version of Wordle last year, which is called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-york-times-debuts-digits-the-math-version-of-wordle/1100-6513150/" data-ref-id="1100-6513150">Digits</a>. That game invites players to use six numbers or digits to reach a single set number as the final result. Players can choose whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide their numbers as needed as long as the correct result is reached. </p><p>Versions of Wordle were also found in other titles last year including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploding-kittens-creator-launches-wordle-style-word-guessing-game-with-hilarious-visual-clues/1100-6513308/" data-ref-id="1100-6513308">a more humorous take on the game from Exploding Kittens</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a> even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-cleverly-reinvents-wordle-then-squanders-it/1100-6526187/" data-ref-id="1100-6526187">had its own Wordle variant</a>.

                <p>Andy Gavin, one of the co-founders of Naughty Dog, has explained why the company sold itself to Sony back in 2001. Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_why-did-we-sell-naughty-dog-its-a-question-activity-7277011334121058305-JZKz/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, Gavin said he's been asked "countless times" why Naughty Dog took the deal, and it was all about rising development costs.</p><p>Gavin said (<a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/news/why-naughty-dog-sold-to-sony" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via SI</a>) when Naughty Dog first started making games in the 1980s, game development costs were "manageable," with costs for games made in the early '80s running about $50,000 per game. For 1992's Rings of Power, Naughty Dog spent about $100,000. For the first Crash Bandicoot game, however, costs rose to $1.6 million, with Jak and Daxter (2001) coming in at $15 million or more. Just a few years later, Jak 3's development cost came in at between $45 million and $50 million.</p><p>Naughty Dog was self-funding all of its projects at this time, and the stress about "financing these ballooning budgets independently" became too much to bear. Gavin said rising development costs is a "systemic issue" to this day in the video game industry.</p><p>"Developers almost never have the resources to fund their own games, which gives publishers enormous leverage," Gavin said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Naughty Dog sold to Sony not just to help secure its financial future, but also to help Naughty Dog make the best games possible "without being crushed by the weight of skyrocketing costs and the paralyzing fear that one slip would ruin it all."</p><p>"Looking back, it was the right call. AAA games have only gotten more expensive since then. Today's big-budget games can easily cost $300, $400, or even $500 million to develop," Gavin said. "Would we have been able to keep up? Maybe. But selling--to the right party--gave Naughty Dog the stability it needed to thrive; and to continue making the kinds of games we'd always dreamed of!"</p><p>Gavin left Naughty Dog in 2004, prior to the developer's Uncharted and The Last of Us franchises coming onto the scene. Naughty Dog's other founder, Jason Rubin, is also no longer with the company.</p><p>Gavin isn't the only video game industry veteran to speak about rising costs. Former Sony executive Shawn Layden has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/" data-ref-id="1100-6478908">the AAA video game space is unsustainable due in part to rising development costs.</a></p><p>Naughty Dog is now run by Neil Druckmann, who is president of the company. He is also the writer of Naughty Dog's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Beyond that, Druckmann remains involved with HBO's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-gets-a-narrower-release-window/1100-6528219/" data-ref-id="1100-6528219">The Last of Us TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">potentially The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p>

            <p>An Xbox controller based on the PlayStation 5's DualSense design has been announced by peripheral company Hyperkin.</p>
<p>The upcoming controller - which was announced at CES and is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC - is the company's new 'Competitor' wired gamepad. It features a PS5-style d-pad, symmetrical stick layout, Hall effect joysticks and triggers, and an Xbox button front and centre.</p>
<p>"If you prefer PS5's DualSense controller but want to play something on Xbox or PC, then this is probably going to be the controller for you," reads the official blurb alongside an accompanying trailer for the gamepad. You can check it out below, and no, before you ask like one commenter joked, this is not a parody video and no it is not April Fool's Day.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Hyperkin hasn't shared pricing or a release date for its upcoming controller, so stay tuned.</p>
