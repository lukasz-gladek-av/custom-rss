<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza DLC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a6184125b5da8/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>There is a lot to be distracted by in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza DLC</a>. It might be the beautifully reimagined DK Island, the fast and frantic Emerald Rush mode or... actually, that's about it. But those are two pretty distracting things! Distracting enough, we'd say, for a sneaky Easter Egg to slip under the radar.</p>
<p>If you had asked us yesterday whether we spotted the Namco reference in the DKB DLC, then all you would have got in return is a blank stare — and that's with near enough 10 hours of Emerald Rush roguelike runs under our belts. But modding extraordinaire <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohpoorpup.bsky.social">Christa Lee</a> has opened our eyes. What's been seen cannot be unseen.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4kzptvn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Okay, let's cut to the chase. When you finish an Emerald Rush run, DK's VoidCo employee card pops up on screen so you can see all the rewards you've pulled in. But if you take a closer look at the platforming primate's employee number, you'll see a pretty recognisable series of digits (if you're a Pac-Man fan, that is): 7650.</p>

<p>For those <em>not</em> in the know, 7,650 is the maximum number of points you can pick up in a Pac-Man game. It's a recurring figure that cropped up in a bunch of Namco-developed titles, apparently due to the numbers' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_substitution_in_Japanese">gorowase</a> substitutions sounding like the company name (7='Na', 6='Mu', 5='Ko', 0='O').</p>
<p>Now, sure, its appearance in the Bananza DLC <em>could</em> be a complete coincidence, but we doubt it. Nintendo clearly has knowledge of it — remember the Wii U Smash Bros. '<a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/The_Big_7650!">The Big 7650!</a>' event? Yep, we forgot it too — so we think the employee number is a nice nod to the high-score-achievers and arcade originators of the past.</p>
<p>We have smashed our way through the DLC's interactive credits, and we saw no sign of Bandai Namco having done any work on it. Then again, the studio has paired up with Nintendo on various things in the past, so this isn't to say that the team had <em>no</em> sway over the roguelike add-on.</p>
<p>It's a neat little nod, and one that definitely would have passed us by had it not been pointed out to us (so that's for the heads up, Christa!). We had a good time with the DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC, praising the fast and fun roguelike mode, but feeling a little short-changed by the rest of the experience. You can find our full thoughts in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">review</a> below.</p>

Two Namco classic Game Boy Advance games are joining the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue.
</p>
<p>
First up is Mr. Driller 2, the iconic puzzle game that started life as an arcade game before being ported to the GBA for the Japanese launch. It was later released worldwide, and was previously re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console.
</p>
<p>
The second is Klonoa: Empire of Dreams, a 2D platformer spin-off of the console games that began on the PS1. By comparison, it has more puzzle-like gameplay and introduced a new realm to the ongoing series.

<p>
Both games will be available from 25th September for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers with the Expansion Pack.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Nintendo added an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-switch-nintendo-classics-app-just-got-a-cool-hidden-game-boy-advance-easter-egg">Easter egg to the Game Boy Advance app</a>, which adds the classic bootup sequence if you twiddle the analogue stick.
</p>
<p>
And at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-nintendos-latest-direct">last week's Nintendo Direct</a>, the company announced Virtual Boy games will be coming to Switch Online too, along with a dedicated accessory to play them in 3D - it comes in both plastic and cardboard varieties.

                <p>Nintendo's original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing/" data-ref-id="5000-3602">Animal Crossing</a> on GameCube helped pave the way for many of the cozy games players have today. The cute animal villagers largely enjoy a blissful experience, but a new AI hack has the town feeling that Tom Nook--the raccoon who basically controls the local economy based on bells as currency--is a tyrant who needs to go down.</p><p>Software engineer <a href="https://joshfonseca.com/blogs/animal-crossing-llm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Josh Fonseca</a> created this Animal Crossing hack (via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/animal-crossing-mod-uses-ai-to-orchestrate-anti-tom-nook-villager-revolt/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica</a>), and he explained at length how he pulled it off in the accompanying YouTube video. The GameCube software wasn't really designed to hacked like this, but Fonseca was eventually able to find his way in and give Animal Crossing some commands that could be understood by the game's code.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AyEzA5ziE0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1115">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7AyEzA5ziE0?start=1115" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fonseca initially tried to use a single live language model AI to write new dialogue for the characters, while also drawing their character traits from online wikis. According to Fonseca, that approach failed because he was asking the AI to do too much. In the end, he set aside one AI program to handle the dialogue, while another program essentially directed its in-game presentation.</p><p>Once this was done, Fonseca introduced some modern elements to the game including news about current events. He also cheekily instructed the AI to depict resentment towards Tom Nook, which grows into unrest among the villagers over time. There's no endgame conclusion where the villagers confront Tom, but it is a very funny turn for these gentle creatures.</p><p>Former Nintendo of America localization manager Leslie Swan recently shared that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-almost-had-a-better-title-in-the-west-but-nintendo-rejected-it/1100-6534576/" data-ref-id="1100-6534576">Animal Crossing almost had another name</a> that was ultimately rejected. The most recent game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" data-ref-id="5000-487113">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, was released in 2020. That game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/">received a Switch 2 update</a> earlier this year. Although there aren't any new titles in the franchise at the moment, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-crocs-let-you-bring-your-favourite-villagers-everywhere-now-available-to-order/1100-6534311/">Animal Crossing Crocs</a> that are available for order.</p>

<p>Free blades if you've played TOTK or AoC</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It's not too long now until we finally get our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> on Switch 2, with that <strong>2nd November</strong> release date rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>To sate our appetites in the interim, Nintendo has dropped a new teaser trailer showing off Koei Tecmo's very slick-looking Musou action featuring all of your favourite lunatics from the Zelda series. Oh, and Zelda herself, who is shown kicking seven shades out of huge armies in gameplay footage that, as a big Warriors franchise fan, this writer is incredibly excited about. It's all so smooth, so 60fps, so crystal clear and beautiful. Hold me, Tingle!</p>
<p>Now, beyond the excitement of finally getting a 60fps Musou game in the palm of our hands (and one that happens to look incredible, to boot), the trailer above also unveils some goodies to be nabbed for players who have a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and/or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> save on their system.</p>
<p>Tears of the Kingdom data nets you a <strong>High Guard's Sword</strong> to be used in the game, whereas Age of Calamity nets you a <strong>High Guard's Claymore</strong>. Nothing groundbreaking, but welcome nonetheless.</p>

<p>If November is too far away, remember that the previous entry in the Hyrule Warriors series is playable on Switch 2 with a much improved, now-stable frame rate - one of various games to get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/33-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">unnannounced, 'secret' updates</a> thanks to the newer hardware's grunt. If the frequent dips put you off on your Switch 1, now's a good time to catch up.</p>
<p>And if that's not enough Musou for you, remember that Koei Tecmo is bringing Omega Force's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> to Switch 2 in January, too. Plenty of hacking and/or slashing to be getting on with, then!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have announced that the Lasombra and Toreador clans will now be included as part of the Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 base game, following strong criticism of the previous plans to have them be premium DLC and for pricier editions of the game. In their place two Story Packs will be created and launched in 2026 as part of an Expansion Pass available separately or with the Premium Edition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> has a release date confirmed for 21st October 2025 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>


<p>“Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing,” said Marco Behrmann, White Wolf Executive Vice President and Bloodlines 2 Executive Producer. “We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2.”</p>
<p>This change now means that there will be six clans available to all players – the Banu Haqim, Brujah, Lasombra, Toreador, Tremere and Ventrue – which are equivalent to character classes in other RPGs.</p>
<p>The two new stories are Loose Cannon, which will give players Brujah Sheriff Benny’s perspective and let them experience his story of relentless pursuit, set for Q2 2026, and <b><i>The Flower &amp; the Flame, which follows</i></b> Toreador Primogen Ysabella’s path to creating her dark magnum opus in Q3 2026.</p>

<p>Both story packs can be purchased separately for $14.99/£12.99/€14.99, and there’s also Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack with decor items inspired by the original cult classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines to feature in Phyre’s in-game apartment for $11.99/£9.99/€11.99. They’re bundled into the $34.99/£28.99/€34.99 Expansion Pass or as part of the Premium Edition $89.99/£74.99/€89.99. Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£58.50/€69.99) is now worse value, as they get the Santa Monica Memories included, but there doesn’t seem to be a cheaper Expansion Pass option for them.</p>
<p>Physical Day One and limited Premium Editions are to be released in collaboration with PLAION, including character cards, a journal, and a steelbook case.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 is a game that’s evoked plenty of strong opinions amongst fans of the 2004 original, and the Vampire: The Masquerade setting in general. First announced back in March 2019 with Seattle-based developer Hardsuit Labs, the game’s development struggled to the extent that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/23/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delay-release-date-2021-hardsuit-labs-cancelled-developer/">Paradox made the decision to pull the project from Hardsuit Labs</a> and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/14/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-cancelled-instead-of-getting-a-new-developer/">after considering cancelling it outright</a>, brought in The Chinese Room to reboot the game.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/04/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-developer-is-the-chinese-room-coming-in-2024/">Bloodlines 2 was re-revealed</a> in September 2023, the pitch and overarching story for Bloodlines 2 shifting compared to the originally revealed version of the game.</p>
<p>Still set in Seattle, the narrative has shifted away from casting you as a freshly fledged vamp and you are instead Phyre, an Elder Vampire who is known for being a harbinger of tumult and sudden change. That, for some, detracts from the fantasy of the setting, even if you are still able to tap into the abilities of a clan of your choosing and role play through the world. At the same time, it could be more accessible as an entry point for those unfamiliar with the TTRPG or original game.</p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with the opening couple hours of the game in the run up to Gamescom, and there’s an intriguing blend of characters, dire situations and powerful vampire types. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/fangs-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-opening-hours-and-the-lasombra-clan/">Check out our preview here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Development footage of what appears to be upcoming superhero action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra</a> has exploded upon the internet like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a> clawing his way into a seedy Parisian bar and flinging himself at alt-fascist soldiers in a whirlwind of kicked chairs and bursting bottles. This also being the content of said video. 
</p>
<p>
Assuming the leaked goods are the Real McCoy, they suggest that the game will be a fast and furious brawler with a fair amount of environment destruction, which is probably what you're expecting from a game with Azzuri and Steve Rogers on the poster. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The <a href="https://streamable.com/ka4jm7">footage</a> comes to us via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/first-look-gameplay-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-surfaces">MP1st</a>, who attribute it to "a developer who worked on the game", and say it was created between 2022 and 2023, but do not link to the portfolio that originally contained it. 
</p>
<p>
They've also found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/jF1GGSk#oHzWJeF">a selection of images</a> that show various possible Marvel 1943 environments, including a plush lamp-lit hallway, a vast cavern entrance with dangling stalactites, a bunch of building-top areas with glass conservatory roofs, and a hazy nocturnal view of searchlights over what is presumably Paris.
</p><p>
Assuming it's the Genuine MacGyver, the leaked Black Panther video is very clearly WIP. The fixed camera perspective suggests that it's an internal test, knocked together to illustrate the flow of a typical Marvel 1943 fight scene. As such, we should be careful about reading too much into it. But I have to say, I do enjoy the 5am cat energy here. 
</p>
<p>
If you live with a younger feline, you'll be familiar with that time of day when they Catch The Crazy and start zipping about, striking amateur ninjitsu poses and climbing every nearby human bodypart/piece of furniture. I'd love it if Black Panther had a Zoomies mode that caused him to spontaneously sit on Captain America's face. I'd love it if he had a special terrain execution that consisted of hiding under the sofa and slashing people's feet off. "D'awww," the abbreviated sturmtruppen of Hydra would coo, clutching their bloody stumps. "What on Earth is going through his ickle head."
</p>
<p>
Developed by Skydance New Media and published by Plaion, with former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig on-board to produce and co-write, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is the story of Captain America and the Panther fighting Hydra in occupied France, though part of it is set in Wakanda. It's inspired by the comicbook series Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-black-panther-and-captain-america-game-revealed-as-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-out-2025">Announced in 2024</a>, the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-date-pushed-to-early-2026-for-polishing">slated to land in early 2026</a>. Which is not that far away, and Plaion have shown us little of the game beyond a couple of 'cinematic' trailers. I'll ask them if they have any comment on this footage, and when we can see more of the game.

            <p>Dark Math Games, a new studio of former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> developers, have announced a change to their forthcoming debut project, which will now be a third-person RPG.</p>
<p>The studio is one of many that have risen from the shattering of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">years of legal threats</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">accusations of toxic behaviour</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>While ZA/UM still exists and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zero-parades-is-the-next-game-by-disco-elysium-dev-zaum-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live">working on a new project</a>, other rival studios have formed to create their own spiritual successor to the isometric detective RPG.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's why Dark Math Games has now shifted perspective. Formerly XXXNightshift, the studio's forthcoming project is now known as Tangerine Antarctic and will be a third-person RPG instead of isometric.</p>
<p>"Set at the World's End ski village at Mount Hope, British Antarctica, Tangerine Antarctic is the name of the in-game hotel, designed by renowned Estonian architect Kaur Stőőr, where most of the games' action takes place," explained Timo Albert, founder and art director of Dark Math Games (formerly at ZA/UM).</p>
<p>"This is where you are stuck because of the blizzard and must solve the mysterious murders. And Tangerine Antarctic is one of the important characters of this true detective's RPG."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">Dark Math Games first revealed its formation and project in October</a> last year. Simultaneously, other former developers announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">formation of their studio Longdue</a>, while others still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">announced Summer Eternal</a>.</p>
<p>There's plenty of rivalry going on, then, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-staff-say-rival-projects-from-former-colleagues-are-friendly-competition">ZA/UM told Eurogamer earlier this year it's all "friendly competition"</a>.</p>
<p>"For us, always we think it's friendly competition," said principal writer Siim (Kosmos) Sinamäe. "We're not going to really think about what the other writers are doing, or the studios... how can I be better at my own craft? We're competing essentially against ourselves in this way of can we take it further? Do we have to make any compromises? I think it absolutely sets us apart."</p>

<p>With a heavy discount for current owners</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/touryst">The Touryst</a> was a delightful little game from developer Shin'en Multimedia, and the company has now revealed that its official re-release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">The Touryst: Deluxe</a>, will launch on the Switch 2 next week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available now at <strong>19.99€ / $19.99</strong>, though current owners who purchased The Touryst from the Switch eShop can bag the re-release at a heavily discounted price of <strong>4.99€ / $4.99</strong>.</p>
<p>The game will run at 4K resolution with frame rate set at 60fps; it's worth mentioning here that the game already ran at 60fps on Switch, albeit at a max resolution of 1080p. 120fps won't be supported at launch, but this might be something Shin'en could explore at a later date.</p>
<p>Several other graphical enhancements have been applied, but players can also look forward to brand new content, including new locations and quests, and even a playable arcade spin-off of the <strong>FAST</strong> racing series.</p>
<p>Let's take a peek at everything new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Resolution is now 4k (from 1080p) at 60fps<br>
- Added new locations, new items, new quest<br>
- Added new Arcade Cabinet (featuring FAST ZERO racing game)<br>
- Added Global Illumination for many locations<br>
- Added Voxel waves on the beach shores<br>
- Added dynamic Ambient Occlusion<br>
- Added Anti-Aliasing<br>
- Much improved Rain effect<br>
- Much improved Depth of Field effect<br>
- Improved controls<br>
- Import your save game from the Nintendo Switch 1 version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now let's see how The Touryst: Deluxe is shaping up, along with a couple of comparison shots with the Switch original:</p>


<p>Shin'en Multimedia also launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> as a launch title for the Switch 2 to critical acclaim, earning a well-deserved score of 9/10 from us. It's since received a free update to add more performance options and content.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-fights-back-on-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-says-horizon-devs-acknowledged-it-wasn%E2%80%99t-original-in-the-first-place.1301139/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since Light of Motiram was <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> in November 2024, it was immediately obvious to everyone (us included) that it looked very, very similar to Guerrilla Games' Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West, from the animal-like machines down to the red-haired protagonist dressed in tribal gear.</p>



<p>In July 2025, Guerrilla Games' owner Sony Interactive Entertainment <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/" target="_blank">sued Tencent</a>&nbsp;(the parent company of Light of Motiram developer Polaris Quest) in the state of California, alleging copyright and trademark infringement and adding that Tencent reps had reached out to Sony in 2024 about the possibility of making</span> a mobile Horizon game. Sony assumes that when talks failed, Tencent went ahead and made its own Horizon-inspired title anyway.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Tencent officially fought back with a motion to dismiss on a 'myriad of flaws', including but not limited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lack of actual jurisdiction over Tencent Holdings, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in China and merely the parent company of the actual entities developing the game, which the motion says haven't been served yet in the case: '<em>Sony’s threadbare, conclusory allegations improperly lump these Defendants together with the foreign companies alleged to be responsible for the core conduct at issue. Sony’s vague allegations against ‘Tencent’ or ‘Defendants’ generally cannot substantiate the claims it brings against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., or Tencent Holdings specifically</em>.</li>



<li>For the time being, the claims amount to speculation as the game's release date (which has conveniently been set just now to Q4 2027 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>) is far away and the alleged infringements haven't happened and may never happen.</li>



<li>Lastly and perhaps more interestingly, the motion to dismiss labels Sony's lawsuit as a clumsy attempt to secure a corner of popular culture for themselves. </li>
</ul>



<p>In this regard, Tencent's motion goes as far as including actual quotes from Guerrilla Games, specifically from Lead Artist Jan-Bart van Beek, who mentioned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tLcD1r-6w&amp;t=859s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a NoClip documentary</a> that when pitching Horizon, the developers initially shelved it because of its similarities to Ninja Theory's 2013 game Enslaved: Odyssey to the West:</p>



<p><em>Enslaved basically featured a post-apocalyptic world, a female protagonist, machines that were slumbering that would be awakened. So I myself went to Hermen and I said like, I don't think we should do this, it touches too much of these other points. And Hermen, he sort of was very reluctant. He said like okay, well, I think it's a bad idea to do this, but you know, we'll can it for now and maybe we'll look at it later.</em></p>



<p>That's exactly what happened. For some time, Guerrilla worked on another pitch, a shooter set in an alternate history steampunk setting loosely in the vein of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Unbeknownst to the Dutch studio, though, Ready at Dawn was already doing something not too far from that with The Order: 1886. Eventually, Studio Technical Director Michiel van der Leeuw asked Studio Head Hermen Hulst to reconsider the Horizon pitch, and Guerrilla switched back to that.</p>



<p>Tencent's point is clear-cut: </p>



<p><em>By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honored tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon—like Enslaved, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Far Cry: Primal, Far Cry: New Dawn, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more—Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions.</em></p>



<p>However, it should be noted that Tencent, or at least its developers who are actually making the game, have made several changes in the description and the screenshots of Light of Motiram to distance themselves from the Horizon IP. The red-headed protagonist who looked a lot like Aloy is nowhere to be seen, for instance. </p>



<p>To be fair, the actual game is probably going to play quite a bit differently. It will have survival mechanics such as base building. It also supports online cooperative play, which is missing from the Horizon games (although Guerrilla is now working <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-is-guerrillas-next-big-game-with-horizon-3-a-ways-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Horizon Online</a>).</p>



<p>As to the lawsuit, we'll see how Sony responds to this motion to dismiss. We'll report any noteworthy updates on the lawsuit, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>The local release will be published by NIS America, but we don't have a release date just yet. On a more positive note, a Switch 2 version (and Game-Key Card physical release) has also been confirmed. It's arriving in Japan alongside the Switch, PlayStation and PC release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067itqxlh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This title was previously targeting a 2025 launch, after it was delayed in September 2024. So hopefully the wait will finally be over early next year. If we hear any updates about the local release date or window, we'll let you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Remember how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_tactics_i_b_ii_cosmos"><strong>R-Type Tactics I • II Cosmos</strong></a> by Granzilla was meant to be coming to the Switch this year? Well, it's now been delayed (again).</p>
<p>In an update during a live stream, the developer announced the title would be arriving on Nintendo's hybrid system in <strong>2025</strong> instead of Fall 2024. No reason was attached to this delay, but the developer has apologised once again.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, this package will contain the turn-based strategy tactical RPG's <strong>R-Type Tactics</strong> (Command in the West) and <strong>R-Type Tactics II: Operation Bitter Chocolate</strong>. You can find out more about these releases in our existing coverage.</p>

<p>Going beyond the Mushroom Kingdom</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> games are back with not only a new movie but also an updated package for the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>If you're not sold on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> just yet, Nintendo has now released a new seven-minute overview trailer which outlines not only the gameplay but also the new content and updates. In case you did miss it, this includes enhanced resolution, improved UI, extra storybook chapters, the new assist mode, amiibo support, and more!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With enhanced resolution (1080p on Nintendo Switch/4K* on Nintendo Switch 2), improved UI, extra Storybook Chapters, a new Assist Mode, and more, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 are now out of this world!"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, this trailer has only been released in Japan, but there's still enough on display to get an idea of what's on the way. When an English version of the trailer is released (or a similar trailer is made available), we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>One other thing that's been spotted in this overview is two new storybook pages. Although it's all in Japanese, it seems <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/52980-two-new-rosalina-s-storybook-pages-from-super-mario-galaxy-2-revealed">they've already been translated</a>. Nintendo will also be releasing a physical version of Rosalina's Storybook, but it's worth noting, the new chapters and pages <em>won't</em> be included.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the storybook and the updated versions of the Galaxy games in our previous coverage:</p>

<p>Two Namco games join 'Nintendo Classics'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced it will be expanding its Switch Online + Expansion Pack service with two more games for the Game Boy Advance library.</p>
<p>They include the Namco titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mr_driller_2">Mr. Driller 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/klonoa_empire_of_dreams">Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</a>, and they'll be arriving next week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>. The puzzle title Mr. Driller 2 started life in arcades and was then ported to the GBA for the system's Japanese launch.</p>
<p>The puzzle-platform title Klonoa: Empire of Dreams debuted on the GBA in 2001 and allows you take control of Klonoa as you take down enemies, solve puzzles and jump your way through 40 incredible stages. Here's Nintendo's official description these titles:</p>
<h3>KLONOA Empire of Dreams</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The ruler of a distant empire suffers from a serious case of sleepless nights. In his torment, Emperor Jillius passes a law forbidding his loyal subjects from ever dreaming again! One morning, our hero Klonoa and his friend Huepow find themselves in front of the emperor, charged with dreaming of<br>
adventure. As punishment for their crimes, they must defeat the four monsters that plague the lands.</p>
<p>Play as Klonoa and take down enemies with the ever-trusty Wind Bullet. Solve puzzles and collect helpful items like stars as you jump your way through 40 incredible stages! Help Klonoa in his journey to redeem himself and find out just why dreams have become so taboo...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Mr. Driller2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Join Susumu and Anna as a mysterious outbreak of Blocks threatens the world's existence once more. Armed with a mighty drill, dig deep through multicolored blocks until you reach safety. Not all blocks will be breakable, so be careful that the blocks you break don't cause others to fall on you or cut off your Air Supply! Scramble to grab air capsules for a recharge, and you'll be just fine to reach your goal. How deep can you dig underground? Drill to your heart's content in three modes: Mission Driller, Endless Driller, and Time Attack Driller!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Japan will receive the same two titles next week. And as usual, these games come with modern benefits such as the ability to save and load on the fly, and even rewind your gameplay.</p>
<p>The GBA app was also recently updated to Version 3.0.0 (alongside the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a> in Japan). It includes button remapping options and even 1080p support in handheld mode on the Switch 2. You can find out more about this update in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/switch-onlines-gba-app-has-been-updated-version-3-0-0">our previous story</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be revisiting these GBA games on Nintendo's subscription service next week? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>The arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Ahead of release, Dotemu and Tribute Games have slowly been revealing new playable characters. This week, a new trailer has dropped for Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider. An official description for both of these characters has also been shared:</p>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"King T’Challa, the Black Panther and stalwart leader of Wakanda, dashes into battle wielding his vibranium-enhanced suit and sonic daggers. With peerless martial arts skills and strength, he’ll pounce on any threat or foe foolish enough to challenge him!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Cosmic Ghost Rider</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, Cosmic Ghost Rider can’t let that go unpunished. Atop his Hell cycle, this wild incarnation of the Rider roars across the spaceways. Beware: this Spirit of Stellar Vengeance punishes by wielding both hellfire and the Power Cosmic!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the previous character reveals include heroes like Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill, with the rest of the roster made up of Marvel classics like Captain America, X-Men characters, and Spider-Man. Together they'll travel from "New York City to the depths of the Negative Zone" to fight for the future of the universe.</p>
