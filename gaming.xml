<p>It's a free upgrade for Switch 1 owners</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Gameloft's smash hit Disney life sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_dreamlight_valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, is getting a native <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-dreamlight-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> on 25th March 2026.</p>
<p>The game briefly popped up during today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase as part of the sizzle reel, confirming the tease that the developer dropped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-disney-dreamlight-valley-is-getting-a-switch-2-version">last summer</a> along with a date.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/NintendoSwitchUpdate2026">blog post</a>, Gameloft shared some Switch 2 gameplay footage, featuring a character walking through the Valley and doing a bit of decorating.</p>
<p>In the post, the developer detailed that the game will feel "smoother and easier to enjoy" on the newer console. Improvements come in the form of better frame rates, higher resolution, faster load times, and a much higher item limit of 6,000.</p>
<p>Plus, if you already own the game on Switch, the upgrade will be completely free. That's pretty handy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-new-live-service-game-is-coming-at-just-the-worst-possible-time-2000666078</link>
            <guid>1427368</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">Earlier today, PlayStation and Guerrilla revealed </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a>,</em> the next entry in the popular post-apocalyptic franchise. But this spin-off is a multiplayer-focused online co-op action game that looks a lot like<em> Monster Hunter</em> meets <em>Destiny</em>. It will receive updates post-launch, and oh, wait, this is a live-service game. Oh no, this was a bad time to announce <em>Hunters Gathering</em>.</p> <p>I’m not sure a colorful, cartoonish online-only spin-off of the photorealistic solo single-player open-world series <em>Horizon</em> would have been a smash hit with terminally online fans at any point. But right now, of all times, feels one of the worst possible moments to reveal <em>Hunters Gathering</em> to a world wide web primed to make a Kombucha Girl face at everything it’s doing. The last two years have been littered with the corpses of failed, cancelled, or still-dying live-service games. A lot of players are, understandably, tired of these things and unsure of whether they should even invest any time into caring, as so many seem to flop or shut down.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The hunt is on.</p> <p>Step into the world of Horizon Hunters Gathering, a new co-op action game from Guerrilla coming to PS5 and PC: <a href="https://t.co/TNWH4oRX2Q">https://t.co/TNWH4oRX2Q</a> <a href="https://t.co/BCjSquv30R">pic.twitter.com/BCjSquv30R</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/2019425896008974566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was just last month that <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> launched and <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">was then immediately trashed</a> by a large portion of players. The live-service PvP shooter debuted at the Game Awards, launched with over 90k active players on Steam, and now, less than two weeks after launch, is struggling to reach 5,000 players and is nowhere to be seen on any of my social feeds. Before that, <em>Concord</em>, a previous attempt by Sony to make a live-service game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">infamously crashed and burned in less than two weeks</a>. <em>Marathon</em>, the next game from PlayStation-owned Bungie, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">has had a very rocky rollout</a> ever since it confirmed it was an online-only live-service experience, making me nervous about its future even as sentiment online seems to be slowly rebounding in its favor.</p> <p>There are so many more live-service games that seem to be struggling to exist in an era when most people are just playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-newzoo-balatro-helldivers-2-gdc-time-spent-1851771352"><em>Roblox, Fortnite, GTA Online, </em>or <em>DOTA 2</em> forever</a>. As reported by <em>TheGamer,</em> <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/2025-live-service-games-player-analysis/">many of the live-service games launched in 2025 have lost most of their players</a>, according to SteamDB. And while there are a few recent exceptions, like <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it is really, really hard to break into the market and stay around. Even brief bright spots, like last year’s mini-breakout MOBA <em>Supervine</em>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/moba/another-moba-gives-up-supervive-developed-by-former-riot-devs-is-closing-in-february-just-7-months-after-it-launched/">eventually lose steam</a>.</p>

 <p>All of these attempts to carve out a sustainable multiplayer niche over the last two years have whittled down players’ patience. At this point, every live-service multiplayer thing gets dunked on relentlessly the moment it’s announced. Sure, some of that negativity is just assholes drafting off the “hate everything” digital ecosystems on TikTok and YouTube. But a lot of it is also just people tired of more games that ask a ton of their players without first earning it, only to eventually pay it back with a shutdown notice screenshot on social media.</p>

 <p>This is the environment that Sony has announced <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> into, and it shouldn’t shock anyone that a lot of the reactions to the game are people saying they have zero interest or actively calling it bad. Can you blame them? The last two years have shown that live-service games are prone to failure, likely to collapse shortly after launch, and not worth checking out if you already play one or two of them, like <em>Fortnite</em>. Maybe that’s why they slipped it out in a PlayStation Blog post instead of a proper State of Play showcase.</p> <p>So, while I think <em>Hunters Gathering</em> looks neat and could be fun, I’m well aware that one day I’ll likely be writing a story about how it’s no longer getting updates and is shutting off the in-game microtransaction shop. You’ll read that headline on X or Reddit, go “Oh right, that game…” and then just keep scrolling by. It’s hard to get too excited about a new game, even from a PlayStation studio, when that fate already feels sealed. Maybe especially from a PlayStation studio.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo’s Trailers Of Violent Games Are Full Of (Purposefully?) Missed Shots]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo/</link>
            <guid>1427365</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>There was a Nintendo Partner Direct this morning, full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Switch ports and Bethesda games</u></a> and starting with an intensely soothing preroll of puzzle pieces slotting into grooves that I could have watched for hours. There were also trailers for some fairly violent games, <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, that looked a lot less violent in the hands of whoever was controlling them for their Switch trailers.&nbsp;</p><p>Viewers on social media were swift to point out that in the gameplay for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DTMmld4Wzs&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Requiem</u></em></a>, protagonist Leon Kennedy misses all of his gunshots against the game’s enemies, even though the enemies are close enough to be basically impossible to miss. In a scene where Leon wields a sniper rifle, even accounting for enemy movement, his shot isn’t remotely close. (As someone who is shit at sniper rifles in games, I have sympathy here, but come on.) In potentially gory moments of close combat, Leon swings a chainsaw basically into thin air; in others, the trailer cuts away before an axe can connect with an enemy’s head.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/app.bsky.feed.post/3me4ntqnrns2l" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigmitjj4vpp32xqn5gvaxhwd6ir6c7q7p2qtrxtw3nmk7aky2iwpy"><p lang="en">Usually, video game trailers that show gameplay show successful gameplay, because presumably that's what sells

But, I guess to tamp down on depictions of gory violence, the Resident Evil Requiem footage in today's Nintendo Direct showed some missed attacks. 

Frankly, it made it feel more authentic</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/post/3me4ntqnrns2l?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-02-05T15:01:43.867Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>Similarly, in an <em>Indiana Jones</em> trailer, Indy notably fires a gun nowhere near some other boats as he races by them:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BV3H__rdMw4?start=45&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 2.5.2026"></iframe></figure><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1qwkonv/comment/o3qa7lb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>Some</u></a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/apzonerunner.com/post/3me4mfg3mak2j?ref=aftermath.site"><u>viewers</u></a> suggest this is due to Nintendo trying to avoid too much violence in its Directs, with Game File’s Stephen Totilo highlighting <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me4ntqnwk22l?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a different version of the Resident Evil trailer</u></a> that shows Leon having a much better go of things. We’ve reached out to Nintendo for more information and will update this piece if we receive a reply.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a funny thing, something I didn’t notice until it was pointed out, and it’s led me down a rabbithole about whether other Switch trailers are like this. There are plenty of regular Switch trailers, not part of presentations, that don’t seem to have this issue. For instance, a Switch 2 trailer for the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8kPSGj7dqY&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Squirrel With A Gun</em> </u></a>very much features a squirrel shooting a human with a gun, and there is a predictably gory<em> Doom </em>trailer for Switch in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lRpoGucGA0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>2018</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But other <em>Doom</em> trailers go differently: In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpKEWIRwoxM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bethesda’s 2021 trailer </u></a>for <em>Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part One </em>on Switch, there’s a moment early on where Doomguy shoots an enemy:</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Bethesda version</span></figcaption></figure><p>But in the same trailer for Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ggPNp1vbnY&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>2021 E3</u></a> presentation, he misses:</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Nintendo version</span></figcaption></figure><p>Likewise, there's a later violent moment in the Bethesda trailer--</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Bethesda version</span></figcaption></figure><p> --which is replaced with non-violent navigation and a much tamer fight in the Nintendo version:</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Nintendo version</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t think I’ve uncovered some huge revelation here, just something I’ve never noticed about trailers in Nintendo presentations. These tweaks certainly makes sense for <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-super-nintendo-keza-macdonald/" rel="noreferrer">Nintendo’s image</a>, especially in a presentation with multiple games that would invite a broad age range of audiences. Still, it feels a little bit like Nintendo trying to have its cake and eat it too. If you’re putting a violent game on the Switch, there’s not really any getting around that it’s violent, and dealing with it by just having someone be really bad at shooting feels like a half-measure.</p><p>In the case of today’s <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, the whole thing was so laughably obvious that it drew attention to the ostensible strategy, which is now going to gnaw at me in every subsequent Direct. If you are the person <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker/" rel="noreferrer">tasked</a> with missing all your shots in Nintendo trailers, please get in touch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Players Can Prepare for the Second Expedition With a New Catch-Up Mechanic and Lowered Stash Value Requirements]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-players-can-prepare-for-the-second-expedition-with-a-new-catch-up-mechanic-and-lowered-stash-value-requirements/</link>
            <guid>1427359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One mechanic that <strong>Embark Studios</strong> uses to keep players engaged in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> is the game's <strong>Expeditions</strong>, which are essentially a big reset for your Raider. Things like your Workshop, player level, skill points, blueprints, coins, quests, and stash upgrade progress all get reset, letting you start again with new rewards and buffs to make your next round of Topside visits all the more intriguing.</p>



<p>What makes Expeditions interesting to complete (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-dominance-continues-reportedly-stands-as-top-selling-game-across-steam-xbox-and-playstation-for-third-consecutive-month/">and what helps keep players logging onto ARC Raiders each day</a>) is that you have a limited amount of time to prepare for them, with Expeditions running on a tight, 60-day schedule, as you prepare the necessary resources to embark on one. Players will be able to head out on the game's first Expedition since it launched on <strong>March 1, 2026,</strong> with the deadline to sign up for it being <strong>February 25, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of that, and ahead of the game's second Expedition, Embark has introduced a couple of changes to get players better prepared for the endeavour. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARCRaiders_Expeditions-Infographic.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first major change comes directly from player feedback. After hearing from players that the required Stash value for the maximum amount of rewards was too high, Embark has decided to lower it. The required value for maximum rewards is now <strong>3 million coins</strong> <strong>(600K per skill point)</strong>. Players will still get five skill points for reaching the 3 million Stash value mark.</p>



<p>The second major change is the introduction of a new <strong>catch-up mechanic</strong> meant specifically for Raiders who were not able to obtain enough coins during the first Expedition period. This mechanic lets Raiders reclaim the skill points they missed, with catch-up skill points being heavily discounted. "<em>Amass the entire Stash value and enjoy your skill points before everyone else, fail to do so and the catch-up system will allow you to close the gap over time</em>," <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">a blog post on the game's official website reads</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>For this Expedition, you will need to gather 300K Stash value per skill point missing from the first Expedition. When departing, coins will contribute to the skill points of the second Expedition, before contributing to missing skill points from the first one</em>."</p>



<p>If you're participating in the Expedition for the first time with the start of the second Expedition next month, then you'll also be able to get the rewards from the first Expedition. The rewards for the second Expediton are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Evolved Patchwork outfit (permanent)</li>



<li>Scrappy cosmetics (permanent)</li>



<li>Expedition Indicator Icon (permanent)</li>



<li>24 Stash Spaces (permanent) </li>



<li>+0-5 skill points (permanent) </li>



<li>5-10% XP boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>6-12% Scrappy materials boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>60-70% repair value increase (consecutive)</li>
</ul>

              <p><span>You know, if you’re ever looking for an example of the power of human artistry, you can typically look to incredible sculptures and statues that depict the human form like </span><i><span>David </span></i><span>by Michelangelo or the work of Rodin. But these pieces have the advantage of not being mass produced for people to buy and stick on the Nintendo system to unlock cosmetics. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-leon-infection-dead-dies-theory-2000663084"><span>Leon Kennedy</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span> amiibo doesn’t have such luxuries, but it nonetheless accomplishes something remarkable as well: it somehow finally makes the zombie-shooting heartthrob ugly.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Requiem for the dead. Nightmare for the living.<br>Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy join the amiibo family in summer 2026.</p> <p>Amiibo will be sold separately. <a href="https://t.co/zOfUuU3IH3">pic.twitter.com/zOfUuU3IH3</a></p> <p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/2019420370554745295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>That’s not to say that the Grace Ashcroft figure is much better. Both of them look like cheap wedding cake toppers. Amiibos typically feature more stylized characters like most of Nintendo’s heroes, so they don’t often have to be very detailed. </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>, however, is a photorealistic game that would lend itself to a more detailed statue. These figures’ faces are so generic-looking that if it weren’t for Leon’s distinctive swooping hair, I probably would have a hard time identifying him. And trust me, I’ve looked at his face extensively for decades. Where is his old man scruff?</span></p>

 <p><span>“Reading the comments I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, but I must admit I’m not familiar with Amiibo and their usual quality,” Nexxtic wrote on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qwmppb/nintendo_just_revealed_amiibo_for_both_grace_and/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>. “Are they always this… rough? I think these look pretty bad, especially Leon. Like one of those bad Switch ports.”</span></p> <p><span>“Grace seems nice, Leon a little less so,” wrote AdResponsible5888.</span></p> <p><span>If nothing else, the existence of a Leon amiibo—a goofy looking one at that—means we get good jokes. Even if a lot of them have the same punchline.</span></p>   <p><span>Hopefully these aren’t the expensive $40+ amiibo, and are in the $15-20 range. They’re both coming out after </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s launch, with the game itself arriving later this month on February 27 and both figures launching in the summer.</span></p>

			<p>Today, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has published some updates</a> on the <strong>Xbox schedule for this year</strong>. In 2026, the Xbox brand <strong>celebrates its 25th anniversary</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft</strong> is trying to launch games in four of its biggest franchises: <strong>Forza Horizon</strong>, <strong>Halo</strong>, <strong>Gears</strong>, and <strong>Fable</strong>.</p>



<p>We already know the date of <strong>Playground's Forza Horizon 6</strong>, which will be released on <strong>May 19, 2026</strong>, as announced during the recent <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong>. Warren adds that his sources indicate <strong>Halo Studios</strong> (formerly known as<strong> 343 Industries</strong>) is targeting a Summer release for <strong>Halo Campaign Evolved</strong>, the single-player remake of the 2001 game that launched the first-person shooter series and originally captured the interest of many gamers in the Xbox brand.</p>



<p>Fable is targeting Fall, as Playground officially shared, and <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, the prequel featuring fan-favorite characters <strong>Marcus Fenix</strong> and <strong>Dominic Santiago</strong>, is also aiming to debut in the latter half of the year. In both cases, Warren added that <strong>Microsoft is very mindful of keeping apart from Rockstar's juggernaut, Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, which is set to crash on the market with all its weight on November 19. <span>Another GTA VI delay is still not out of the realm of possibility, but&nbsp;<strong>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/more-grand-theft-auto-vi-marketing-beats-coming-in-summer-2026-while-gta-v-has-sold-over-225m-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has confirmed earlier this week that the marketing campaign will begin in the Summer</a>, so both Rockstar and Take-Two are honed in to ensure the game isn't delayed a third time.</span> As such, Microsoft will try to release both games as early as possible before November 19. After would be more complicated, as December isn't traditionally a great time to release games.</p>



<p>According to Warren's sources, Xbox is also preparing to launch <strong>Double Fine</strong>'s new multiplayer game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/double-fine-productions-kiln-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiln</a></strong> in April, as well as new <strong>Starfield</strong> content (and PS5 release) "soon". On that note, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prepare-your-spaceships-starfield-is-reportedly-landing-on-playstation-5-in-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Polish website has just come out to share that the game will launch on PlayStation 5 <strong>on April 7</strong></a>, though that remains a rumor for now.</p>



<p><strong>Bethesda's Fallout 3 remaster</strong> is reportedly still in <strong>"active development"</strong> to ensure that it is as polished as possible. Warren doesn't share any date in his report, but it sounds like he doesn't expect the game to be released this year. However, he reckons <strong>Xbox fans will get a new controller this year</strong>. These are supposed to be next-generation controllers (although it's unclear whether they will add haptic feedback or adaptive triggers-like tech, inspired by the PS5's DualSense), with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity to reduce latency in <strong>Xbox Cloud Gaming</strong>. On that note, The Verge's journalist adds that <strong>Microsoft is "close" to testing free ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming with Xbox Insiders</strong> ahead of a wider rollout later in 2026.</p>

I've never gelled well with the Sniper Elite series, as much as I do love a bit of goresploitation in my horror, it just has that kind of Mortal Kombat, slightly too realistic violence vibe about it that pushes it out of my comfort zone. But, I would still like to snipe! Sniping is always satisfying, that strange disconnect between your action and the reaction from a great distance away. So, Sniper Dan, a "family-friendly" hidden object game where you use a sniper to solve the problems of various townspeople, sounds like just what I'm after.
</p>
<p>
In Sniper Dan, you are Dan, a man who has a sniper rifle. Dan's job is to fix things, specifically with his sniper rifle, as opposed to literally anything else that might be better suited. In each level, you'll be given various hints as to how you might go about solving a given task. Like, say, there's a handy man who's struggling to loosen a pipe. Shoot it, problem solved! Maybe there's someone trying to steal some honey from a beehive. Shoot the beehive, and the hive gets stuck on the thief's head! Or maybe there's a seagull that's stolen a sausage. Bang! Job done.
</p>

<p>
It is certainly incredibly silly, that much can't be denied, but is a genuinely fun seeming twist on both the hidden object genre and sniping in literally any game. You even have a little hub area in the form of an office that you can decorate with motivational cat posters, or a snazzier logo that you actually paid someone for rather than just lazily AI generated. I like it!
</p><p>
And, if you fancy giving it a go, there's already a demo for you to try out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2841650/Sniper_Dan/">Steam</a>. No release date attached to this one just yet, but you could always wishlist it too if you like what you see or play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Xbox released a lot of big games in 2025. <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-state-of-xbox-and-game-pass-in-2025-2000651807">It was one of the only good bits of Xbox-related news from last year</a>. And in 2026, it will release new entries in four of its oldest franchises: <em>Forza, Gears, Halo, </em>and<em> Fable.</em> But new reporting indicates that while these projects, and others including a <em>Fallout 3</em>&nbsp;remaster, are on track, Xbox is trying to avoid <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>‘s big launch in November.</p> <p>On February 5, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad?"><em>The Verge</em> reported</a> a lot of interesting tidbits and nuggets about Xbox’s plans heading into 2026. For example, the company is apparently working on a new “next-gen” Xbox controller that will support connecting via wifi, which should help reduce lag when streaming games via the cloud. But the most interesting news from the report concerns three of Xbox’s big games launching in 2026.</p>

 <p>According to <em>The Verge, <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>,</em> a remaster of the OG game, is on track to launch this summer. Meanwhile,<a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-marcus-fenix-dom-1851531003"> <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, a prequel to the original </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-marcus-fenix-dom-1851531003">Gears</a></em>, is tentatively aiming for fall. This is also the same window in which Xbox plans to launch that <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-fantasy-rpg-reboot-2000662595">long-delayed <em>Fable</em> reboot.</a> The outlet reports that it has heard Xbox has a solid idea of when the new <em>Fable</em> and <em>Gears</em> will launch, but that it’s also trying to avoid having either title land too close to<em> GTA 6</em>‘s November 19 release. And with news that marketing for the next <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452"><em>GTA</em> is set to start in summer</a>, it seems unlikely it will be delayed again, meaning Xbox will have to dance around that date with <em>Fable</em> and <em>Gears</em>. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching in May, way ahead of <em>GTA 6.</em></a>)</p> <p>Reportedly, Double Fine’s recently announced next game, the online pottery smasher <em>Kiln</em>, is set to drop in April. <em>Starfield</em> is getting new content “soon,” and the PS5 port, long rumored, is allegedly going to be revealed in the near future. And for folks sad that Bethesda didn’t announce a <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-two-review-amazon-more-episodes-bethesda-new-vegas-2000665533">season two finale of Amazon’s Fallout show</a> after so many rumor mongers online claimed it would, don’t worry. <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161">The previously reported remaster is still in development</a>, according to <em>The Verge.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>2026 could be a big year for Xbox games once again. But ironically, Xbox enters this new era of actually having games at the same time that it has begun porting most of them to other consoles. The universe is weird like that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/aerial-knight-dropshot-shooter-black-game-dev-2000665741</link>
            <guid>1427308</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s not often that a game is created in part as a eulogy to a dear friend.</span></p> <p><i><span>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</span></i><span>, a new stylized first-person indie shooter releasing on February 17, is one of those few. It was first conceived by game director Neil Jones and his long-time friend, Daniel Wilkins. Wilkins, who passed away in 2024, was a sound designer, composer on the games </span><i><span>Never Yield</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>We Never Yield</span></i><span>, and game developer.</span></p> <p><span>Based out of Detroit, Jones (Aerial_Knight) explains that he has a book filled with game ideas, and </span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span> was one of those concepts he spoke openly and excitedly about with Wilkins. He developed the new shooter within a year with the same excitement he’s maintained since his first title, </span><i><span>Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield</span></i><span>, which was released in 2021.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I feel video games are the most expansive art form. You literally have to touch everything. From level design, interior design, you gotta create the outfits, the music, the sounds. You’re creating an entire world, so it’s a ton of work, but I just, you know, I’m at peace when I’m sitting in front of a computer just working on some stuff and just making my own games,” he explains.</span></p> <p><span>Jones says that as an indie developer, he wants to keep making games for as long as he can. His personal story of how and why he makes games is similar to that of many other creators; he feels a drive to make things he cares about. Creating titles for underserved communities and establishing his own lane in the games industry also remain important to him.</span></p>

 <p><span>&nbsp;Jones says, “There’s still not a lot of Black characters or Black-coded characters, you know, because Smoke Wallace (the lead character of </span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span>), he’s purple, but everybody who looks at him [says] ‘Oh, he’s Black.’ “</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665745" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665745"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665745">©Aerial_Knight</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Regarding Smoke being purple, the game originally didn’t have a story. However, for marketing purposes, it was made up on the fly and added in later on. The hero is bitten by a radioactive dragon, the creature eats his family, he can fire bullets from his fingers, and Smoke engages in aerial battles for revenge.</span></p> <p><span>While </span><i><span>DropShot </span></i><span>is a single-player FPS, Jones admits he is not a fan of guns. He deliberately decided to have Smoke shoot with finger guns so he wouldn’t have to model guns for the hero; all the marketing prominently features the purple-skinned lead with fingers aimed at enemies. Meanwhile, the enemies you face are armed. These choices, Jones explains, are intended to subvert FPS titles. It’s also a reflection of his own desire to not have another piece of media with a Black leading man armed with a gun.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Now this was gonna be my take on a shooter, how would I make a shooter, but I hate guns. There’s a lot of stuff that you can do outside of adding guns. We have this one power-up: you destroy a dragon egg and get power-ups, and he has 8 arms come out, turning into a Gatling gun of finger blasts. So, we’re just trying to be as creative as possible to kind of negate the violence of it all,” he explains.</span></p> <p><span>“…I didn’t want to model a gun. I modeled it for the enemies and whatnot. So, it wasn’t against making guns. It was just the main character. I was [thinking] it’s so boring to just put a gun in his hand.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665746" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665746"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665746">©Aerial_Knight</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Making a game is no easy feat. While Jones himself served as the main designer and director, he required a close-knit team to help him create </span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span>. He enlisted the help of past collaborator Julie Huynh, and rounding out what would become Aerial_Knight Games were Tomas Abrams and Benjamin Campbell. With the team by his side, Jones found developing this fast-paced, 50-level shooter relatively easy.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This is the third game,” Jones said. “So, I got a good workflow now, and this was the easiest of all the games we made. Because the environments are a lot simpler. You’re in the sky, so there are clouds and floating rocks, planes, stuff like that, and that’s it. So it was just me focusing mostly on mechanics and level design.”</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;“…The hardest part, I would say, would probably be the cutscenes. It’s because they’re all hand-animated. I did them all myself, and we have 150 cutscenes for each level. We have 50 levels, each level has a custom intro and a custom ending, and then some levels had these mini option cutscenes in between.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The small nature of the development team also helped make the game’s development a smooth process. Jones notes that with a cohort this small, it’s easier to manage people, communicate, and iterate on ideas. If the group were larger, processes would become more complicated, so the game director prefers to keep teams small, much like the games he likes to create.</span></p> <p><span>Unsurprisingly, the team of four also had a fun time generating additional ideas for the game. Jones points to a cow that’s featured in the game’s trailer.</span></p> <p><span>“I had this old cow model. I put it in the trailer and made it say something, and everybody loved the cow so much,” he says.</span></p> <p><span>The bovine creature became more prominent throughout the course of the game’s development.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665747" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665747"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665747">©Aerial_Knight</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The team said, “Hey, I want to make a cow level, special cow sunglasses, and a hidden cow event that happens.” I said all right, because I do this thing on my team, I give everybody one wish. Because I wanted [</span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span>] to feel like everybody’s, you know, this is a group activity. My name is on it or whatever, but that’s because, you know, I’m putting all the risk out there, for branding, but everybody gets a wish.”</span></p> <p><span>When it comes to sales performance, the game director is confident </span><i><span>DropShot</span></i><span> will do well. However, Jones admits that a title’s market success depends largely on luck, a factor that he says many game developers don’t appropriately acknowledge. Which is why he continues to bet on himself and the games he creates. This also included the decision to self-publish, which he says was an easy choice.</span></p> <p><span>To fully explain his decision to eschew a publisher deal, he cited a quote from Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes of the popular girl group TLC. In a 1999 episode of VH1’s </span><i><span>Behind the Music</span></i><span>, Lopes explained how she and her bandmates were broke after selling 10 million records.</span></p> <p><span>“That means that every time an album gets sold, TLC gets 0.56 cents. So, 10 million records, $5.6 million seems like a lot of money. Well, it’s not a lot of money when the record company spent $3 million to record your album. And in the record business, we pay all costs back to the record company. We paid recording costs and video costs, so now we have $2.6 million left. Well, guess what? When you have that much money, you’re in about the 47 percent tax bracket. So that immediately gets deducted to $1.3 million,” said Lopes.</span></p>

 <p><span>Jones admits the decision meant more work on the backend when self-publishing, but he says it was worth it. If the title sells 10,000 copies, that would be enough to fund the next slate of titles for Never Yield Games. Autonomy means a lot to him as a game developer, creatively and business-wise.</span></p> <p><span>It’s why all his games are labeled Aerial_Knight, followed by their respective titles. As he explains, it’s for branding purposes, so people know it’s his work. He can even be found on social media saying no to commentators who suggest removing the label. Jones makes the point that people wouldn’t ask that of prominent figures in the games industry.</span></p>

    <article>
      <p>Strauss Zelnick, CEO of <em>Borderlands </em>and <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> publisher Take-Two, has spent years expressing his opinions about AI. Let’s take a quick look at what he’s said.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/take-two-ceo-says-ai-created-hit-games-are-a-fantasy-genius-is-the-domain-of-human-beings-and-i-believe-will-stay-that-way/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>May 2023</u></a>:</p><blockquote>I wish I could say that the advances in AI will make it easier to create hits, obviously it won't. Hits are created by genius. And data sets plus compute plus large language models does not equal genius. Genius is the domain of human beings and I believe will stay that way.</blockquote><p>From <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6?ref=aftermath.site"><u>February 2025</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Artificial intelligence is an oxymoron, there's no such thing. Machine learning, machines don't learn. Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever. I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment.</blockquote><blockquote>To the contrary, the history of digital technology is that technology increases employment, increases productivity, increases GDP and I think that's what's going to happen with AI. I think the video game business will probably be on the leading, if not bleeding, edge of using AI.</blockquote><blockquote>But in terms of the guardrails, if you mean, you know, not infringing on other people's intellectual property by, you know, poaching their LLMs, yeah, we're not going to do that. Moreover, if we did, we couldn't protect that, we wouldn't be able to protect our own IP. So of course, we're mindful of what technology we use to make sure that it respects others' intellectual property and allows us to protect our own. Apart from that, I really can't think of any new guardrails that need to be implemented.</blockquote><p>From <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/ahead-of-gta-6-take-two-ceo-says-hes-not-worried-about-ai-creating-hits-because-its-built-on-recycled-data-big-hits-need-to-be-created-out-of-thin-air/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>March 2025</u></a>:</p><blockquote>I’m not worried about AI creating hits, because it’s built on data that already exists. It’s backward-looking. Big hits are forward-looking and therefore need to be created out of thin air. Being the most creative means not just thinking outside the box; it means there is no box.</blockquote><blockquote>Hire the best creators and insist they pursue their passions. Encourage them to always try something new and to stay away from derivative and copycat works … in Hollywood it’s common to pitch your product as 'it’s a combination of <em>Spiderman </em>meets <em>Batman </em>meets <em>Back to the Future</em>' … We don’t do that here; we want something that you’ve never seen before.</blockquote><p>From <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-ceo-predicts-genai-will-create-jobs-not-kill-them?ref=aftermath.site"><u>October 2025</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The reason [AI] is so extraordinary right now is because what we have is a combination of metadata with a parlor trick; we're all going to get used to it. We're getting really used to it in the same way that if this were 25 years ago and I handed you today's version of Google, you would have been blown away by what it could do for you. But now it's like, 'yeah, I searched again' – this is all very standard, and [AI] will be standard, this is the future of technology.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>You have to look at it as a tool set. Our business has been involved with digital tools since its inception. I think we'll probably be able to create a bunch of efficiency, and we're already trying to do that. We're reviewing 200 different opportunities at any given time, but what AI is not going to do—because remember, what AI is, is the combination of big data sets with a bunch of computers within a natural LLM, a large language model. And by definition, a data set is backward-looking, while creativity is forward-looking. To the extent that AI appears to be forward-looking, it is what a predictive model is.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>From <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/were-actively-embracing-generative-ai-take-two-boss-says-after-previously-expressing-skepticism-we-have-hundreds-of-pilots-and-implementations-across-our-company/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>February 2026</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The video game business, since its inception, was built on the back of machine learning and artificial intelligence. We create our games in computers, with technology, and ever since questions began about generative AI about 18 months ago, I've been incredibly enthusiastic about what the future can bring.</blockquote><blockquote>As it happens now, we're actively embracing generative AI. We have hundreds of pilots and implementations across our company, including with our studios, and we are seeing opportunities to drive efficiencies, reduce costs, and create the opportunity to do what digital technology has always allowed, which is, mundane tasks become easier and less relevant, which frees up our creators to do the more interesting tasks of making superb entertainment.</blockquote><blockquote>[AI] allows our creators to use digital tools to expand what we do, to make it even more beautiful, and even more engaging, and even more exciting.</blockquote><p>Huh, OK! But I thought AI – or the thing we now call AI – was a parlor trick. And I’m not sure video games have been incorporating machine learning (again, at least in the modern sense) for <em>that </em>long. Wonder if anything happened this week that caused Zelnick to start singing, at the very least, a different-<em>sounding</em> take on his favorite tune – like, say, stocks <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4544948-video-game-stocks-nosedive-as-googles-project-genie-allows-virtual-world-creation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>taking a tumble</u></a> as a result of Google’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on?ref=aftermath.site"><u>dogshit-looking, copyright-infringing</u></a> Project Genie. Well, I’m sure he’ll never go back on any other part of his word, like his insistence that AI won’t replace people at his company. He would <a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-layoffs-strauss-zelnick-gta/"><u>never do something like that</u></a>.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-layoffs-strauss-zelnick-gta/"><div><p>Company With ‘No Current Layoff Plans’ Announces Layoffs - Aftermath</p><p>600 people are being laid off, while “several projects in development” have been cancelled</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-zelnick-layoffs-roll7-intercept/"><div><p>CEO Of Take-Two, Reportedly Closing Two Studios, Denies Closing Two Studios - Aftermath</p><p>‘We didn’t shutter those studios’, says man who clearly appears to have shuttered two studios</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-interactive-strauss-zelnick-ftc-grand-theft-auto/"><div><p>Fresh Off Closing Two Studios, Take-Two CEO Expresses Excitement About ‘More Sensible’ FTC Under Trump - Aftermath</p><p>It was a rough time to be a guy who makes tens of millions of dollars per year, but things are looking up</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <guid>1427263</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, as part of a flurry of showcases <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">announced to start 2026,</a> the studio hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/"><strong>World of Warcraft: State of Azeroth</strong> showcase</a>, which dug into the roadmap the company has for the long-running MMORPG in 2026. Following that showcase, in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/five-things-i-learned-from-my-world">The Game Business</a>, game director <strong>Ion Hazzikostas</strong> and executive producer and vice president <strong>Holly Longdale</strong> went further into what they envision for the future of World of Warcraft, and the <strong>"<em>bigger vision</em>"</strong> they have for the franchise.</p>



<p>It's clear that Blizzard has a lot coming for World of Warcraft. The game's next major expansion, World of Warcraft: Midnight, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">is due to arrive on <strong>March 2, 2026</strong></a>, with several major additions coming to the game in the expansion. It'll be the game's eleventh expansion since it launched in 2004 and completely changed the landscape of the video game industry forever. Even after all those years of massive success, over 20 years later, Blizzard is looking to the future for Warcraft's best days.</p>



<p>"<em>We firmly believe <strong>that our best years are ahead of us</strong>,</em>" said game director Ion Hazzikostas. "<em>It's game design, but it's also social design, and it's thinking about how we meet a new generation where they are. That's going to mean thinking outside the box in some places compared to what our game has traditionally been. But <strong>we're excited to keep taking big swings</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>That could also potentially include new games within the Warcraft universe that aren't an MMORPG. With <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/">BlizzCon 2026</a></strong> arriving in September, and Blizzard promising it'll be "<em>one for the ages</em>," we could really start to see the Warcraft IP branch out. A new <strong>RTS</strong> is one possible avenue, but the reality is, with how expansive the Warcraft universe is, Blizzard could really take the franchise in any direction it feels fits within the world, and offers something new to its audience.</p>



<p>The drive for Blizzard to expand and do more with Warcraft comes in part from the fact that the game is now, in 2026, <strong>22 years old</strong>. It's old enough to drink in the US, and that means there are people who started playing it in their early to middle age who lived a whole life and are now retired, still choosing to spend their time in Azeroth. At the same time, there are young people getting into the game for the first time today, and Blizzard has to find a way to satisfy the game's whole audience.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Interview: World of Warcraft bosses on ageing players, Midnight and expanding the Warcraft IP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p12F5la-yPo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We've got a lot of players that say to us, 'Give me something I can play with my kids, or play with my partner,'"</em> added Holly Longdale. "<em>We have so many players and the ability to really dig into how they play, it's given us a lot of interesting opportunities to be able to broaden </em>out.<em> We are <strong>aiming to be a game that's approachable for anyone</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Breadth is really the key</em>," continued Hazzikostas. "<em>It's less about change in the sense of moving away from something and becoming something different, and more about being broader and more approachable in our offerings and meeting people where they are</em>.<em> We already do have retired folks playing World of Warcraft, and a generation of young students who may have all the time in the world. 20 years ago, there was a sense that, for a lot of people, the game might be something that appealed to them, but they don't have the time for it, because it might be all-consuming</em>.<em> That is not what we are anymore. It's not what we've been for a long time. But we still have that depth for those who want it. If you only have 20 minutes to play, you can accomplish something. But if you have an entire weekend or a vacation, and you want to go deep, that's there as well.</em>"</p>



<p>How that breadth of experiences materializes is something we'll see as Blizzard continues to update and work on the game going forward. Though we know that, at least for now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-director-denies-console-rumors-wed-just-say-it/">that won't include a console version of Warcraft</a>, bringing the game to other platforms and making it playable in new ways is definitely one avenue Blizzard might explore.</p>



<p>It's World of Warcraft: Classic offering is one avenue it's already deep into, as Hazzikostas explains that there's an entirely different audience of players who go for Classic, over the modern World of Warcraft. "<em>Classic players are completely different, for the most part, than modern players. They behave differently. They want different things. We don't have a whole lot of crossover between both games</em>."</p>



<p>Wherever Blizzard takes World of Warcraft, it's clear that Blizzard sees more for the game, with Longdale going so far as to say that it's currently an "<em>underutilized</em>" IP.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s a fantastic IP. In my humble opinion, it’s been underutilized, and I just want to bring it to as many people as possible. And that means <strong>evolving what Warcraft means, what it is, and where it’s going</strong>. We want it to be approachable</em>," Longdale said. </p>



<p>"<em>And at the same time, we want to take advantage of 20 years of stories that have been told and not told, and start bringing it out to the world in a broader way. That’s my goal and vision</em>. <em>We’re never going to stop doing the things people love</em>. <em>But at the same time, <strong>we have a bigger vision than simply being an MMORPG</strong></em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has a big year ahead for Xbox as it marks its 25-year milestone. After the tough decision to release more Xbox games on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">rival consoles two years ago</a>, 2026 is a chance to refocus on the platform and celebrate some of Xbox’s biggest franchises. It’s also an opportunity for Microsoft to define its vision for the future of Xbox, after months of confusion from fans and plummeting Xbox hardware sales.</p><p>Xbox kicked off 2026 with its annual <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/865573/xbox-developer-direct-2026-the-biggest-games-and-announcements">Developer Direct</a> last month, a preview of some of the games it’s publishing this year. Microsoft is lining up its “four horsemen” for 2026: <em>Forza</em>, <em>Halo</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>Gears of War</em>. These franchises have been the driving force behind Microsoft’s own Xbox games over the past 25 years, and I’m told there’s a big effort internally to ensure all four games debut on time this year.</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is first up on May 19th, and sources at Microsoft tell me that <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved </em>is tentatively targeting release over the summer. Microsoft is planning to release <em>Fable </em>in the fall, with <em>Gears of War: E-Day </em>also scheduled for the second half of 2026. I understand Microsoft has a good idea of when both should launch, but it’s also keen to avoid being too close to <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>’s November 19th date. Rockstar’s modern day Vice City could still slip further, but Take-Two <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/032e3067-32cd-4c82-b4dd-2bd20a153a6a">announced this week</a> that marketing for <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is due to start in the summer.</p><p>Outside of the big four, I understand Double Fine is also preparing to launch its new <em>Kiln </em>game in April. Bethesda is also working on new content for <em>Starfield</em> that looks set to debut soon. I wouldn’t be surprised if we also hear about a PS5 version of <em>Starfield</em>, years after it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/4/24057433/microsoft-bethesda-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release">first rumored</a>. Don’t be surprised if any of these game dates slip or change — such is the reality of video game development.</p><p>Blizzard is also celebrating 35 years, with a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24250351/blizzard-showcase-viewers-guide">series of showcases</a> for <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Hearthstone</em>, and <em>Diablo</em>. <em>Overwatch 2</em> is now back to being just <em>Overwatch, </em>and there are plans for <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246206/overwatch-spotlight-the-reign-of-talon-begins/">10 new heroes</a> over the course of the year, new maps, and more.</p><p><em>Fallout</em> fans are also desperate for news about the <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster we heard about in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880132/microsoft-ftc-documents-leak-oblivion-fallout-3-remaster-doom-xbox">FTC documents from 2023</a>, or news of a <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> remaster. The <em>Fallout</em> season 2 TV show finale debuted on Tuesday, and many fans were hoping a <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main">countdown website</a> was hinting at a <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster. The game is still in active development, and I understand Bethesda is keen to ensure it’s as well polished as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649795/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-release-date">surprise release</a> of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>last year.</p><p>Beyond Xbox games, 2026 is also an important year for Microsoft’s Xbox hardware and software platforms. The release of the Xbox Ally handhelds from Asus last year marked a new effort to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">bring Windows and Xbox closer together</a>. This model of third-party devices now looks like the future of Xbox hardware and software.</p><p>Microsoft is working on several improvements to the Xbox “full screen experience” that powers the Xbox Ally devices. An Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR) feature, which uses an NPU to upscale games, is set to debut in the coming months for the Xbox Ally X. Microsoft is also planning to use the NPU inside the Xbox Ally X to launch a new highlight reel feature that uses AI models to automatically capture gameplay and make it easy to share the footage on social media.</p><p>An improved Xbox PC UI is also being developed. It’s based on the changes Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/868434/xbox-cloud-gaming-new-ui-future-xbox-console-design">been testing</a> in the new desktop mode for Xbox Cloud Gaming. It features a floating Xbox guide interface and smooth animations, and I expect to see this UI unified across Xbox consoles, PC, and cloud.</p><p>We’ll probably hear more about Xbox PC plans and further hints at the direction of Xbox consoles at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) next month. Microsoft has used GDC in the past to detail key developer changes to Xbox, as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173004/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xcloud-plans-features-details-gdc-2020-live-stream">next-gen Xbox development plans</a>. While I’m not expecting to hear full details about the next Xbox, I’d expect the various sessions will shed further light on the plans to merge Xbox and Windows, as well as more of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/620839/microsoft-xbox-ai-gaming-muse-model-notepad">AI work in gaming</a>.</p><p>We won’t be seeing a next-gen Xbox release this year, though. AMD CEO <strong>Lisa Su</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/873490/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-console-2027-date-amd">hinted this week</a> that Microsoft could launch its next-gen Xbox in 2027. “Development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox, featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC, is progressing well to support a launch in 2027,” said Su in an earnings call on Tuesday. Microsoft has only vaguely teased its next-gen Xbox plans so far, and I’m hoping that a bigger teaser is set for later this year.</p><p>Xbox fans will get a new controller this year, though. I’m hearing that Microsoft has greenlit next-gen Xbox controllers that include Wi-Fi connectivity to reduce Xbox Cloud Gaming latency. A new Xbox controller was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880809/microsoft-xbox-leak-gamepad-sebile-stadia-steam-sony">originally planned for 2024</a>, alongside a canceled Xbox Series X refresh. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond"><em>Windows Central</em></a> also expects an Xbox Elite Controller Series 3 debut in 2026, which would align with a rollout of next-gen Xbox controllers.</p><p>New Xbox controllers that connect directly to Xbox Cloud Gaming could help boost Microsoft’s Game Pass numbers and complement plans for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864261/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ads-testing">free ad-supported access</a> to cloud games. I understand Microsoft is getting close to testing free Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming with Xbox Insiders, ahead of a broader rollout this year.</p><p>While the free Xbox Cloud Gaming won’t be a new Game Pass tier, sources tell me Microsoft is in the early stages of exploring ways to expand its Game Pass subscription lineup. After a Game Pass Ultimate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">price hike in October</a>, I understand that Microsoft is looking at ways to bundle third-party services with Game Pass subscriptions and potentially even merge Xbox Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass together. I wouldn’t expect to see any major changes to Game Pass this year, though.</p><p>Microsoft already added PC games to its various Xbox Game Pass subscriptions in October, with the dedicated PC Game Pass subscription rising by nearly 40 percent to cover the cost of day one releases. Microsoft is still seeing growth in PC Game Pass subscriptions, but it needs to clear up its fragmented subscription options if the future of Xbox consoles is PC.</p><p>All of the Xbox platform changes and pressure on big game releases add up to an important year for Xbox as it marks its 25-year anniversary. I’m certainly hoping that by the end of the year we’ll have a much better idea of Microsoft’s vision for the next 25 years of Xbox.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is experimenting with a top menu bar for Windows 11. </strong>Microsoft’s PowerToys team is contemplating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/870663/microsoft-windows-11-top-menu-bar-powertoy-experiment">building a top menu bar for Windows 11</a>, much like Linux, macOS, or older versions of Windows. The menu bar is actually a dock for Microsoft’s Command Palette PowerToy, and will provide quick access to tools, monitoring of system resources, and much more. You’ll be able to position this dock at the top, left, right, or bottom edge of a screen, which already makes it more flexible than the Windows 11 Start menu. We’re now waiting to see if Microsoft goes ahead and fully builds this dock or not.</span></li><li><span><strong>Jeffrey Epstein was permanently banned from Xbox Live. </strong>Microsoft booted <strong>Jeffrey Epstein </strong>from its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/871425/jeffrey-epstein-xbox-live-ban-microsoft-sex-offender">online gaming platform in 2013</a>. It was part of a ban wave of registered sex offenders. It’s not clear if Epstein ever played Xbox, and the rest of the so-called Epstein files don’t reveal much more about Epstein’s Xbox habits.</span></li><li><span><strong>Former Windows 8 boss recruited Epstein to help negotiate his messy Microsoft exit. </strong>Not only did the Epstein files reveal an Xbox ban for Epstein and claims that Microsoft cofounder <strong>Bill Gates</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/871879/bill-gates-epstein-files-absolutely-absurd">allegedly contracted an STD</a>, they also appear to show how former Windows 8 boss <strong>Steven Sinofsky </strong>recruited Epstein to negotiate his messy exit from Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/872073/steven-sinofsky-jeffrey-epstein-files-emails-microsoft-exit-settlement">The emails appear to show</a> that Sinofsky constantly sought Epstein’s advice as he negotiated his surprise exit from Microsoft in November 2012, forwarding emails to him in nearly real time as talks progressed. Sinofsky also appears to have forwarded a confidential email between Microsoft executives to Epstein in July 2013 that details the issues around the launch of Surface, warning that the Surface RT tablet was “about to catastrophically fail in a very public way.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft says it’s building an app store for AI content licensing. </strong>Microsoft is creating a new Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), a licensing hub that could make it easier for AI companies to pay for “premium” content. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/873296/microsoft-publisher-content-marketplace-ai-licensing">Microsoft says it’s been codesigning PCM</a> with companies including <em>Verge </em>parent Vox Media,<em> The Associated Press</em>, Condé Nast, <em>People</em>, and others. It’s certainly an improvement over scraping and ingesting content into AI models without payment, but <em>The New York Times</em> is still in the middle of a copyright lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, claiming that the companies built their AI models by “copying and using millions” of the publication’s articles.</span></li><li><span><strong>Call of Duty tries to block XIM and Cronus cheaters again. </strong>Activision is trying to crack down on third-party hardware cheating devices in <em>Call of Duty</em> again. Devices like XIM, Cronus Zen, and ReaSnow S1 can enable unfair advantages that exploit aim assist, and now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/872976/call-of-duty-xim-cronus-reasnow-s1-ban-detections">Activision is introducing new detections</a> to ban the devices. Activision attempted to detect the devices in the past, but it’s now switching its detection software to focus on player inputs, rather than attempt to detect devices that are designed to be hidden.

This leaves <strong>Charlie Bell</strong>, Microsoft’s former security chief, in a new role at the company. While Bell and Nadella claim this move was planned, Microsoft’s security record over Bell’s four years in charge speaks for itself. In 2024, the Cyber Safety Review Board concluded that “Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul,” after a series of high-profile security issues. Microsoft has been focused on cybersecurity ever since, in a bid to win back trust.</span></li><li><span><strong>GitHub adds Claude and Codex AI coding agents. </strong>GitHub is making Claude by Anthropic and OpenAI’s Codex AI coding agents directly available inside GitHub this week.

            <title><![CDATA[Blizzard Is Open To GenAI But The Overwatch Devs Don’t Want It: ‘We Want This To Feel Like A Handcrafted Universe’]]></title>

            <guid>1427251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As AI continues to encroach on game development, the worry that the studios that make your favorite games are dabbling in the tech, especially for art assets and written dialogue, grows ever greater. Sometimes this concern and the scrutiny that comes with it are well-founded, but other times it leads to witch hunts with fans seeing AI-generated art where it actually doesn’t exist. Blizzard’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team</span></a><span> has been the subject of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941"><span>these moments of mass hysteria</span></a><span>. So what exactly is Blizzard’s stance on genAI? Well, it sounds like the company itself is of one mind, while the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team itself is in a different camp.</span></p> <p><span>In a group interview on Blizzard’s Irvine campus last month that </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>leadership was asked by </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-president-supports-generative-ai-exploration"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span> if the company had been integrating genAI into its workflow. Blizzard president Johanna Faries said the company wants to take a “dev-led” approach that allows its teams to use whatever tech is out there to “the extent that they’re comfortable” and in line with what the company believes is “responsible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We do actually, at Blizzard, have a centralized governance team specifically focused on AI and the role it can or should play in our development cycles,” Faries said. “What’s great about that is it’s very cross-functional, so you’re going to have voices from around the horn thinking about not just what’s hot-topic now, but where do we want to be five, 10 years from now? What’s the implication on our teams? What’s the implication on our values? How do we make sure that we don’t stymie the opportunity for devs, artists, whomever, to want to play with new tools and play in the sandbox, if it unlocks creativity or gets rid of drudgery or what have you? We want happy devs, right?</span></p> <p><span>“But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it’s a responsible tool and aligned with how we want to show up as a company,” she said. “So I feel very good in terms of the process we have in terms of vetting: is it secure, is it safe, is it values led? But I keep coming back to: I want the teams to feel safe, to explore to the extent that it drives joy in the work. And I think we have a good process, all up, in terms of making sure we’re doing it in a responsible manner.”</span></p>

 <p><span>So it sounds like, as a company, Blizzard is open to allowing its developers to use AI if they want to, though Faries didn’t get more specific about the parameters under which it considers its use “secure,” “safe,” or “values led.” But what about the </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> team, specifically? Game director Aaron Keller doesn’t sound like a fan. In an interview with </span><a href="https://x.com/gamespot/status/2019127667899961722"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>, he said the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team wants the hero shooter to be a “handcrafted universe.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller speaks out against adding AI-generated content to the game. <a href="https://t.co/44ZznZWiXJ">pic.twitter.com/44ZznZWiXJ</a></p> <p>— GameSpot (@GameSpot) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameSpot/status/2019127667899961722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“We don’t want to put AI-generated content out in front of players,” Keller said. “It’s just not something that we’re comfortable doing. I know it’s a moving space, right? I don’t know where players or society’s perception of this is going to be five years or 10 years from now. So it’s not like, I don’t think that there’s ever gonna be a ‘Hey, here’s a forever policy around it,’ but that’s just where we’re at right now. We want this to feel like a handcrafted universe, and it is a handcrafted universe.”</span></p> <p><span>So it sounds like, for now, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>won’t have genAI-created heroes, maps, or skins. These questions come after Microsoft, which acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, has been reportedly pushing for AI use within the company. Blizzard teams, including those behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003"><i><span>Diablo</span></i></a><span>, recently unionized, with concerns about AI replacing artists being top of mind among organizers.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is undergoing a revamp next week, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropping the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>from its title</span></a><span>, adding five new heroes, and restructuring its seasonal content to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>prioritize linear storytelling</span></a><span>. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Next Expedition Rewards and Date Revealed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has unveiled the slate of rewards coming later this month when the <strong>second </strong>expedition window opens in ARC Raiders. This is the mechanic that allows players to reset their account, going back to base and starting all over again with a ‘new’ character. It also yields exclusive unlocks, bonuses, and temporary buffs.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, what’s being unlocked the second time around isn’t amazing, which is proving to be a concern for the game’s die-hard fanbase.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-second-expedition-rewards-explained">ARC Raiders Second Expedition Rewards Explained</h2>



<p>On February 25th, the second <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">ARC Raiders Expedition</a> window will open, running until March 1st, when all Raiders participating in the event <strong>leave Speranza</strong>. The team at Embark Studios has made some major changes to how the Expedition works, based on feedback received from the community in recent weeks.</p>



<p>First, it will now cost way less to acquire the five extra skill points you get for leaving Speranza. Instead of one million credits per skill point, the requirement is now 600,000 credits per skill point. Additionally, if you missed the full allotment of bonus points during the first Expedition, you can now unlock those bonus skill points at a discounted rate of 300,000 credits per skill point.</p>



<p>That means if you did your Expedition last time with <strong>zero </strong>extra skill points, you can get <strong>TEN </strong>bonus points in February, provided you can rack up 4.5 million credits.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With that being said, here are the other rewards waiting for you as the second Expedition rolls around:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Patchwork Outfit (Evolved)</li>



<li>Scrappy Cosmetics</li>



<li>The Expedition Indicator Icon (Upgraded)</li>



<li>24 extra Stash spaces</li>



<li>Bonus skill points</li>



<li>5 – 10% XP boost</li>



<li>6 – 12% Scrappy materials boost</li>



<li>60 – 70% Repair value increase</li>
</ul>



<p>The latter items are a range because you get <strong>a bigger boost </strong>if you’ve already completed your Expedition in December. If not, you get the <strong>lower </strong>end of the scale. It’ll face a consecutive boost <strong>again </strong>during the third Expedition, which should arrive in April.</p>



<p>Fans are disappointed that we don’t even get a new outfit for the second Expedition, just an ‘evolved’ one.</p>
