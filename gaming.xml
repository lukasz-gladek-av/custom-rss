		<p>A major update and overhaul for the 4X strategy game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has been released, with version 2.0, dubbed the Revolutions Update, out now.</p>
<p><iframe title="v2.0 Revolutions Update | Ara: History Untold" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5xFw_o-ANs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This update is when we see the fruits of the new development partnership with Stardock, who stepped into a production role to further the game’s post-launch roadmap earlier this year. The revolutions update has been developed with key community feedback, building in a new culture and influence system, units specific to certain nations, quota crafting systems and more.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Culture &amp; Influence Systems – </strong>Cities gain a new quality of life category called Culture. Culture generates Influence, a new currency used to acquire cultural traits and expand territory through claims. This creates meaningful alternatives to military expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Agitator Unit – </strong>Introduced with the Revolutions technology at the end of the Renaissance, Agitators can be sent into adjacent foreign regions to stir rebellion and, through Influence, bring those territories into your nation. This unlocks a second form of conquest in Act II: ideological subversion.</li>
<li><strong>Per-Nation Units – </strong>Every civilization now commands unique historical forces, from Mongol Horse Archers to Japanese Samurai, adding tactical depth and flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Leader Redesigns – </strong>Every leader has been reimagined with unique mechanics, traits, and abilities, ensuring more replayability and personality-driven diplomacy.</li>
<li><strong>Priority &amp; Quota Crafting System – </strong>Micromanaged production queues are replaced with smarter stockpile and priority controls, freeing players to focus on high-level strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive AI – </strong>A more dynamic and personality-driven AI responds to player performance, making diplomacy, warfare, and resource management more challenging and believable.</li>
<li><strong>Map Generation Overhaul – </strong>Realistic natural resource clustering plus new exclusivity rules modeling historical trade and competition.</li>
<li><strong>High DPI UI &amp; Visual Update – </strong>A sharper, scalable UI built for modern displays, with new accessibility and customization options.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Boosts – </strong>Major engine optimizations deliver faster turns, smoother framerates, and reduced CPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We’re thrilled to introduce Culture as a gameplay element in <em>Ara: History Untold</em>,” stated Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock and Oxide. “The importance of ‘soft power’ is immense. Although military conquest is the most straightforward method for territorial expansion, we aimed to provide players with alternative strategies for asserting their influence over the world. This becomes particularly significant in the late game, when exploration and expansion have already reached their limits.”</p>

<p>Ara: History Untold is one of a number of historical 4X titles that have sprung up to challenge Civilization – especially looking to launch ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/civilization-7-review/">Civ 7</a> – each introducing their own twist on how to deal with the passage of time. Now, with Civ 7’s stumbles, there’s a chance to carve out an audience for this game through steady updates and community building. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Ara: History Untold is another distinctive take on the historical 4X strategy genre, putting a real emphasis on furthering your nation, managing supply chains and resources, and shifting the focus away from warring mentality it’s so easy to sink into. There’s room to grow, but this is a strong contender.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-update-adds-fov-slider-on-consoles-stability-improvements-and-more.1309101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update for Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">pushed to all platforms today</a>, adding an FOV slider for console players, stability and performance improvements for all platforms, UI, audio, visual, gear refinements, and more.</p>



<p>As the latest entry in Gearbox's shooter series, even with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical acclaim from multiple outlets</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/">major commercial success right at launch</a>, the story of Borderlands 4 isn't about everyone grabbing their own copies and having a blast. </p>



<p>It's about the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-developer-says-fixing-pc-performance-is-top-priority/">poor technical performance at launch</a>, Gearbox boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">Randy Pitchford's bizarre approach of antagonizing players upset at the state of the game</a>, and, as of two days ago, how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game has been indefinitely delayed</a> while Gearbox works on the versions already in players' hands.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today's update, and every update that'll come after it, is slowly trying to chip away at that narrative and turn it around from 'Borderlands 4 is broken but fun' to 'Borderlands 4 is fun.'</p>



<p>Starting with stability updates and performance improvements, which are key elements of today's update, and will likely remain key elements of every update going forward. Character animations have been updated, issues of frame rate hitching and crashes have been addressed, and several issues where players didn't get the rewards they were owed from completing an objective have been fixed. </p>



<p>For console players, an FOV slider has finally been added, and for all players, there's a series of balance changes for each of the Vault Hunters and several gameplay elements.</p>



<p>It's all a start, of course, but the work on Borderlands 4 is far from done. Hopefully, it doesn't take Gearbox too much longer to fix the myriad of issues the game launched with. Though with how many problems the game had, it feels like we're in this for the long haul.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/saros-sci-fi-trailer-returnal-housemarque-ps5-state-of-play-2000628274"><i><span>Saros</span></i></a><span>, the next action game from </span><i><span>Returnal </span></i><span>developers Housemarque, was one of the tentpole games during yesterday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258"><span>State of Play presentation</span></a><span>. The game stars </span><i><span>iZombie </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Fall of the House of Usher </span></i><span>actor Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj, a soldier investigating a foreign planet full of vicious aliens who will kill him over and over again. Kohli has starred in a few video games, including </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005"><i><span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stray-gods-review-musical-songs-grace-laura-bailey-1850747942"><i><span>Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical</span></i></a><span>, but this is easily his biggest game role yet, and the dude seems stoked to be there.</span></p> <p><span>In a post on Bluesky, Kohli laid out how video games have always been part of his hopes and dreams. As a kid, he wanted to make video games. He used to work in a game store, and one of his first acting gigs was in a commercial for </span><i><span>LittleBigPlanet </span></i><span>on Vita. So really, it’s all been leading up to this point.</span></p>    <blockquote><p><span>I know it’s cliche to say “this is a dream come true” but in the case of </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>, it really is. My first hobby/love was gaming. Before I left primary school, we were asked in assembly to tell the school what we wanted to do for a career. I played a VHS of video game trailers and said I wanted to make video games.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One of my first jobs was working as a sales assistant at Gamestation (the UK equivalent of GameStop). One of my earliest paid acting gigs was a commercial for Little Big Planet on the PS Vita – I thought I finally made it. My next gig after starring in </span><i><span>iZOMBiE</span></i><span> was playing Fahz in </span><i><span>Gears 5</span></i><span>, I didn’t think anything could top that… until I was approached by Housemarque to play the lead in </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s been a long journey to get here, each moment along the way was special and the final destination isn’t just a career highlight, it’s one of the best moments of my life. Thank you HouseMarque with trusting me with your character, I hope Arjun is everything you asked for. And for the players, see you on March 20th.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>That’s sweet. I was a big fan of Kohli’s performance in </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>Fall of the House of Usher</span></i><span>, so I’m interested to see what he brings to the role of Arjun when </span><i><span>Saros </span></i><span>comes to PlayStation 5 on March 20. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-remastered-trailer-ugly-bad-comparison-ps5-pc-mods-nightdive-2000628799</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-deus-ex-remaster-is-a-reminder-that-better-isn%E2%80%99t-always-better.1309086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just because a remaster of an old game has improved textures, better lighting, runs at a higher resolution, and features fancy new effects doesn’t mean it’s better. I mean, <em>technically</em> it is, but the end result can often look very ugly and wrong. And sadly, this is the case with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258#:~:text=One%20of%20the,on%20February%205.">recently announced <em>Deus Ex Remastered.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Yesterday, during Sony’s short and so-so State of Play, we got our first look at a newly announced remaster of the classic immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musks-favorite-game-is-getting-remastered-25-years-later-2000628283">This new version of Elon Musk’s favorite video game</a> is being marketed as a remaster, with higher resolution textures and fancier lighting. And yes, technically, what is seen in the trailer is “better” than the original release. These are higher-resolution textures with more detail. Models are more detailed and complicated, too. What’s here is better in the sense that it is all stuff that couldn’t have been done 25 years ago in 2000. And yet many online, myself included, aren’t impressed with <em>Deus Ex Remastered’</em>s “improved” visuals. In fact, I think the new game looks really terrible.</p> <p>You would think that replacing the old textures from 2000 with new and higher-resolution textures would make<em> Deus Ex</em> look great. The problem with this new remastered port isn’t that the textures are bad, but that they are being slapped on a very old game. The models, levels, and other parts of<em> Deus Ex</em> were designed 25 years ago, with the tech limitations of the period in mind. The original devs and artists worked within those limits to create art that offered just enough detail and let your mind fill in the gaps.</p>

  <p>Covering the game in new, sharp textures that don’t seem to take into consideration the art design and intentions behind the visuals of the OG <em>Deus Ex</em> leads to an odd juxtaposition. You have the old game running under this new skin that feels out of place. Add in new lighting that changes the mood and appearance of the characters and world even more, and you end up with this odd plastic-y look that we’ve also seen in other similar remasters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-trilogys-san-andreas-now-feels-depressing-without-i-1848047292?_gl=1*242l6h*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMS4xNzMxNDQ1MjEwLjYwLjAuMA..">like the infamous <em>GTA Trilogy</em> bundle</a>. It’s also the same look I spotted in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-review-pc-lara-croft-1851250080">remastered<em> Tomb Raider</em> games,</a> which were also developed by Aspyr, the same team that’s behind <em>Deus Ex Remastered.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Reactions to the <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> trailer have been nearly universally negative. People have criticized the plastic-like sheen on everything, the way the game now seems filled with <em>Doom 3</em>-like stencil shadows, and the overall vibes of this new remaster being off. One highly upvoted comment on YouTube said: “Upgraded visuals from 2000 to 2005.” In direct comparisons between the two, it’s hard not to see the remastered <em>Deus Ex</em> as anything but an ugly mess.</p>   <p>It seems like the remastered version of <em>Deus Ex</em> will be the worst way to replay the original game, especially considering the fact that for decades, fans have created incredible mods that improve the game in smart ways without altering its overall look and vibes too much.</p>

 <p>And that’s the most annoying thing to me about this remastered version of <em>Deus Ex.</em> There are ways to remaster and modernize old games and make them look great. <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-star-wars-game-dark-forces-fps-remaster-ps5-xbox-1851294048">Nightdive Studios has done some fantastic work</a> bringing back classic titles, like <em>Dark Forces</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-thing-remastered-2002-ps2-xbox-pc-sequel-4k-120-ps5-1851524769"><em>The Thing,</em></a> without making these games look horrible. I think the key is that Nightdive is very careful with the new art it adds to its projects. They tend to create remasters that perhaps aren’t as “fancy” as some others but which almost always look like you remember the games looking back in the day, despite them very much not appearing that way back in the ’90s. Nightdive also tends to let you turn off many or most of the new visual features, too, which is always an appreciated option.</p> <p>So you can definitely remaster a classic game in a faithful way. It can be done. Sadly, for <em>Deus Ex,</em> it seems that it won’t be so lucky with this remaster, and instead, we are left with an overly shiny and visually jarring port of <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985">one of the best PC games of all time</a>. Ah well, at least it’s easy as heck to play and mod on PC in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Gosh, make up your minds</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="RE Requiem - Game Key Card" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bd37fe4bea16/re-requiem-game-key-card.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Just recently, the director of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> mentioned that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-director-highlights-the-speed-problem-with-switch-2-game-cards">Game-Key Cards for Switch 2 were somewhat of a necessary evil</a>, stating that load times from a physical cartridge are inferior to that found on an SSD.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-resident-evil-requiem-bosses-talk-leaks-switch-2-and-remakes/">VGC</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> director Koshi Nakanishi has seemingly contradicted this viewpoint when asked about the decision to utilise Game-Key Cards. His response was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s not a development decision for us, it’s more of a sales strategy decision."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Welp. It seems we're not going to get a definitive answer on this, with publishers offering various reasons as to why they're opting to use Game-Key Cards for their Switch 2 games. Nakanishi's statement here lends credibility to the assumption that cost is a major factor, with Nintendo seemingly only offering publishers two options: 64GB cartridges or Game-Key Cards.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this isn't confirmation that Resident Evil Requiem will arrive on a Game-Key Card, but it's about as close as we're going to get. Unless we hear otherwise, we're going to assume it won't be a proper physical release.</p>
<p>Nakanishi also touched on the decision to launch Requiem, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> on the same day (<strong>27th February 2026</strong>). He said that the team started with Village when looking at development for the Switch 2. When that went smoothly, they moved over to Requiem. In the end, they simply said “well, let’s go the whole hog and add in 7”.</p>
<p>So there you have it! A good day for RE fans, indeed.</p>

The developers put out a new trailer today showing off some of the zany things people can build using Portal, but when Battlefield 6 gets into the hands of a big audience, we can only imagine the kinds of things people will build using the tools.</p><p>Community manager Kevin Johnson <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/1971245786362257645" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "Truly looking forward to seeing this level of power in your hands for the first time in Battlefield." Johnson added that the last iteration of Portal only "scraped the surface," but Battlefield 6's Portal mode gives players a lot more freedom.</p><p>Johnson said it might be a fan who comes up with the next Rush or Conquest, referring to Battlefield's best-known modes.</p><p>As you can see in the new trailer posted today, your imagination seems to be the limit of what you can make in Battlefield 6's Portal mode. As an example, we see tanks falling from the sky to create falling missiles that players have to avoid while riding ATVs. That's just one possibility of what people can make.</p><p>Battlefield 6's Portal mode will also allow players to earn XP, and players will be able to find custom games and modes through the game's server browser.</p><p>A bigger investment in Portal for Battlefield 6 is no big surprise. After all, EA CEO Andrew Wilson has said the company wants to <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/user-generated-content-key-to-eas-growth-strategy-towards-over-one-billion-players/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">lean into user-generated content</a> to fuel the company's growth in the future, and it seems Portal will be part of that.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

Although the skateboarding feels good, most players don't love the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>-ification (or the copious microtransactions and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">Sims</a>-esque looking character models) of the iconic skate sim. The developers at Full Circle have heard these complaints about the high-contrast visuals and, with the imminent launch of Season 1, will address the game's look to feel "more grounded and lived in."</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1971259590667899153" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy X post</a>, Full Circle reiterated that the look of the game is ever-evolving. Referencing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an August 15 blog</a>, where the team promised that Skate's aesthetic would improve to add "even more detail and personality," Full Circle revealed what this "detail and personality" will start to look like when Season 1 drops on October 7.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> skate. | Early Access Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The change, as part of update .28 arriving on the same day as Season 1, gives San Vansterdam a "more grounded and lived in" feel. What Full Circle showed off was a drop in contrast, washing the world in a golden glow. The team said this is "San Van at 'Golden Hour.'"</p><p>"While this is only Step One of what will be an ongoing development of the game’s visuals, we want to give you a sneak peek today," Full Circle posted on X. "And once this update releases [on October 7], we want your feedback so we can keep improving and iterating."</p><p>That's in the more immediate future. Looking ahead into December and beyond, Seasons 2 and 3 (and...beyond) will introduce new content such as customization items, "legacy game modes" from the Skate franchise, challenges, seasonal events like Skate-o-Ween and the 7 Ply Maple Harvest, and party voice chat, alongside quality-of-life improvements and more additions. That does include new tricks, with Season 2 adding impossible and improved handplants while Season 3 brings darkslides and improved footplants. That's sick.</p><p>What's really sick, though, is that you don't have to pay for them. Yes, Seasons 1, 2, and 3 (and beyond) will always introduce some microtransactions--particularly thanks to the imminent inclusion of the Skate Pass--however, when new tricks drop, your wallet stays closed.</p><p>"You will never have to pay for new tricks," Full Circle reiterated in a Q&amp;A towards the end of its X post. "As we add new tricks to skate., you’ll have access to them as soon as they come to the game (update may be required), and they’ll become part of Challenges to help keep up your skill. Once added, a trick will never go away."</p><p>Still, it's hard to tell if any of these updates will assuage the skateboarding community. The game currently sits at a "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mixed</a>" rating on Steam (with over 22,000 reviews at the time of this writing) and some scathing criticism from gaming outlets like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-early-access-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sports/the-new-skate-feels-like-it-was-made-by-people-in-suits-rather-than-people-with-skateboards/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. It might not look realistic, but at the very least, the skateboarding to enjoyable.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/palestinian-voice-in-games-coalition-helps-game-developers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-coalition-seeks-to-help-palestinian-game-developers-%E2%80%98speak-loudly%E2%80%99-through-games.1309041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of more than 50 video game industry professionals announced a new initiative dedicated to amplifying the work of Palestinian game developers last week. The coalition, called Palestinian Voices in Games, is supported by the likes of <em>Reigns</em> developer Nerial, narrative design agency actezéro, <em>Democratic Socialist Simulator</em> maker Molleindustria, and others, <a href="https://palestinian-voices-in-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the group’s website</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The group provides access to volunteers to help with game production for Palestinian game developers. A representative for Palestinian Voices in Games said that economic support is something most requested by developers, but noted the group cannot accept donations or raise funds at the moment, though several members have financially supported the development of prototypes. Palestinian Voices in Games is looking for “sponsors and other institutions” who can help with the financial side.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, the volunteer-run network is working with game developer Rasheed Abueideh on <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-rami-ismail-arabic-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dreams on a Pillow</em></a>, “a pseudo-3D stealth adventure game about a land full of people being made into a people without land,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/504479/dreams-on-a-pillow-palestinian-1948-nakba-game-funded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per Abueideh’s description</a>; comic artist Iasmin Omar Ata on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XlIa9Fa1lxJT6jgPrdioMoSrZsT77oAF/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Being 2</em></a>, a point-and-click visual novel set in “a futuristic Palestinian space- colony;” designer Yusra on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riyafagame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>RiYafa</em></a>, a game based on “the story of her family and community based in the West Bank;” and developer Yasmine Batniji on <a href="https://gabbahbaya.itch.io/pomegranates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pomegranates</em></a>, a game in which the player is “tasked with tracing echoes of the current war at the renovated Al-Ahli hospital.”</p><p>“The game industry has often been complicit in the othering of people from the Middle East, by creating and promoting games that depict them as enemies and serving the propagandizing efforts of western militaries to justify their occupations and interventions, a representative of Palestinian Voices in Games told Aftermath in an email. “It has long been time for developers to push back against these narratives and make a change. We are moved to help our Palestinian colleagues and friends in any way we can, so that their voices may be heard.”</p><p>Colonial and military narratives have been a backbone of the video game industry for decades, but indie developers have been pushing to shift that narrative, the Palestinian Voices in Games representative said. Still, Palestinian game developers have not had the same opportunities to share their stories through video games.</p><p>“In such a critical historic moment, in which a genocide is being perpetrated in Palestine in front of all of our eyes and the voice and memory of a people is being destroyed, it is more important than ever for Palestinians to be able to speak loudly, so that their stories can be heard and remembered, and so that their humanity and the injustice of the terrible violence they continue to undergo can be fully recognized,” the representative said.</p><p>Support looks different depending on a developer’s project and needs. <em>Dreams on a Pillow</em>, for instance, is a larger project that’s been in the works with an experienced development team, so the group has focused efforts on recruiting volunteers to assist in production work, like artists and animators.&nbsp;</p><p>“For Yusra's <em>RiYafa</em> we have been arranging sessions with industry mentors from different disciplines (production, game design, etc.),” the Palestinian Voices in Games representative said. “For <em>Pomegranates</em> we had volunteers work on production design and writing.”</p><p>Palestinian Voices in Games is choosing projects and developers that are within their current means. They’ve scaled up their efforts several times already—the representative said the group has been working behind the scenes for years—but are nearly at their capacity; they’re looking for more volunteers to help continue the efforts to support the current group of Palestinian developers and expand the program to more.</p><p>The representative said solidarity has been strong among individual game developers and small studios, but that “no large companies or publishers have taken the time to offer support or aid.”</p><p>“Those with the most power and resources have remained silent,” they said. “We truly hope this changes soon and that larger game companies will have the courage to stand up for Palestinian game developers as well.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-dc-ice"><h3>Playing Is This Seat Taken?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159179/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>This review was originally published in May 2014. We're updating and republishing it in honour of the game's arrival on Switch 2 as part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-gba-game-ranked">the Nintendo Classics GBA lineup</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Starting life on the PlayStation in 1997, at a time when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> had just brought the gaming world triple-jumping headlong into the era of 3D platforming, Namco's Klonoa series has always done things differently. Klonoa's first outing, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/klonoa_door_to_phantomile">Klonoa: Door to Phantomile</a>, was a pioneering foray into 2.5D, mixing polygonal backgrounds with sprite-based characters, and restricting movement to a two-dimensional path while letting the path itself wind its way enchantingly through a three-dimensional world.</p>
<p>It was breathtaking then and continues to captivate today, as Nintendo gamers discovered with the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/klonoa">Wii remake</a> in 2008. But Klonoa's earliest appearance on a Nintendo system was back in 2001, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/klonoa_empire_of_dreams">Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</a> for the Game Boy Advance. Given that one of the series' defining features is its innovative use of 2.5D, does this fully two-dimensional performance manage to capture the charm of Klonoa's original adventures? Absolutely, and in the process, Empire of Dreams delivers one of the finest puzzle-platforming experiences found anywhere.</p>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159182/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Rabbit, cat, or both? Klonoa's species is never really explained, and isn't worth fretting over; in-game, he's referred to simply as a "Dream Traveller". Empire of Dreams' story revisits the series' staple theme this time in the Kingdom of Jillius, where an insomnia-stricken emperor has outlawed dreaming within the realm. Naturally, Klonoa runs afoul of this law and is tasked with ridding the kingdom of various monsters to atone for it. Told through mostly static cutscenes, the story is charming and more engrossing than you might expect, and backed up by wonderfully engaging gameplay.</p>
<p>The main hook of the series is that Klonoa can use a short-range "Wind Bullet" from his ring to lift enemies above his head, inflating them in the process in a visual homage to Namco's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/dig_dug">Dig Dug</a>. From there, he can hurl them at other enemies or throw them towards the ground mid-jump, leapfrogging over them to perform his signature double-jump.</p>
<p>It feels great, and re-imagining enemies as stepping stones rather than strictly obstacles makes for a very different kind of platforming experience. It means that just moving around the levels (or "Visions" as they're called here) involves light puzzling elements, and collecting the three stars, plus 30 optional gems that require creative use of Klonoa's skills and puzzle-solving prowess.</p>

<p>Barring some head-scratchers in the later areas, these puzzles are never difficult. But they're not designed to stump you. Rather, they're meant — like Klonoa's central double-jump mechanic — to engage you in your surroundings, and to encourage full use of the environment. By design, Empire of Dreams is a game that invites you to enjoy the little things.</p>
<p>An array of different foes and environmental elements are introduced as you progress, bringing new puzzle-solving techniques with them and making each world feel fresh in gameplay as well as visual style. The level design is fantastic throughout, and keeps a strong sense of forward momentum even when there's backtracking involved. It's very difficult to get lost, and since enemies and objects respawn automatically, you'll never be stuck having to restart a Vision.</p>
<p>The main puzzle levels are broken up by two faster-paced stage types, with both forced-scrolling platforming and side-view hoverboarding sequences thrown into the mix. Yes, Empire of Dreams hails from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2</a> era, when every mammalian mascot worth their salt added some sort of extreme board sport to their résumé, but Klonoa feels like he comes by his hoverboard honestly. These stages are a lot of fun, and collecting all 100 optional gems requires quick thinking, split-second jumps, and likely a lot of replay. The forced-scrolling levels in particular are beautifully designed, easy enough to complete without being frustrating, but with gems placed tantalizingly just out of reach so that you're always tempted to risk squeezing in another double-jump or potentially deadly detour.</p>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159185/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Even as an early Game Boy Advance release, Empire of Dreams looks wonderful, making excellent use of the system's impressive 2D capabilities. Sprite scaling and rotation add real personality to Klonoa's foes, environments, and boss battles, while parallax scrolling brings the multi-layered backgrounds to life. Animations are beautiful, the sprites are charming, and the bright colour palette — which thoughtfully lent itself to easy viewing even on the non-backlit first generation Game Boy Advance — shines brilliantly. The visual themes in the different worlds also skip the usual platformer clichés of fire, ice, and so on, and are much richer for it; the opera house-themed second world is a real highlight.</p>
<p>The soundtrack was a standout feature of both Klonoa's console outings, and this portable version lives up to their musical legacy, albeit on a smaller scale. The loops are shorter, but the series' trademark sound is still here in spades, with catchy melodies lilting over the action and often evocative of the wind mentioned in our hero's Japanese name (<strong>Kaze no Klonoa</strong> - "Klonoa of the Wind"). The impressive voice samples included are also a treat, and Klonoa's trademark <em>"Wahoo!"</em> adds a gleeful sense of triumph to every double-jump.</p>
<p>Empire of Dreams has 40 Visions spread out over its five worlds, and while it's not a lengthy game by today's standards (you could easily beat it in a weekend), the focused stages are perfect for quick trips into Klonoa's world. You can return to previously cleared Visions at any time, and there are extras to be unlocked by collecting every gem in every level, which significantly extends the replay value for ambitious players.</p>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159183/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The restore points afforded by the Wii U's Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online (plus the latter's rewind function) are largely unnecessary, given the game's save system and relatively short levels, but the emulation extras are handy additions.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Game Boy Advance was blessed with an enviable and nearly endless parade of platformers over its lifespan, and this game stands out as one of the very best. With thoroughly satisfying mechanics and more charm in the opening stages than many games manage by the closing credits, Klonoa: Empire of Dreams is an absolute joy and well worth revisiting.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed Klonoa's big screen adventures, you'll love Empire of Dreams both for the same reasons and for its distinct, pocket-sized personality; if you've never had the pleasure of taking a trip with Namco's fuzzy Dream Traveller, this is a wonderful place to start.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-portal-mode-gameplay-ea-battlefield-studios/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-portal-gameplay-appears-online-shows-just-how-far-the-editor-can-be-pushed.1309014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-debuts-battlefield-6-campaign-trailer/">we got our first look at the campaign mode</a> in Battlefield 6 during Sony's State of Play presentation. Today, gameplay from the upcoming Portal mode in Battlefield 6 has appeared online, and it's a major showcase of just how far players will be able to push this new Portal.</p>



<p>If you're unfamiliar, the Portal in Battlefield 6 is where players can access other player-made game modes and levels that drastically change everything about what it is to play Battlefield 6. It's a full-blown creative mode where you can make seemingly anything you can think of using assets and models already in Battlefield, and this year's version of it seems to be more expansive than ever before.</p>



<p>A short teaser trailer for the mode from EA and Battlefield Studios that was <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1971228205387317485">posted to X (formerly Twitter)</a> shows a bit of what this new tier of level-crafting potential looks like, with quick shots of the editor and how granular players can get.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6RGo76uyTk&amp;t=5s">YouTuber JackFrags</a> shows off some of the Battlefield Studios-made modes that really show off how you can just create whatever you want in Battlefield 6's Portal mode. Want to recreate Counter-Strike? Check. Want to create your own Battlefield version of Call of Duty Zombies? Check. Want to make a version of Only Up where you're competing against other squads to race to the top and hold that position? Check. Racing F-16s, creating your own conquest maps, re-drawing out-of-bounds lines, adjusting every detail of the gameplay experience? Check.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Portal Gameplay and Impressions..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6RGo76uyTk?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's far more freedom than we've seen in previous Battlefield games, and while the modes created by Battlefield Studios shown in the video are just a few of the more obvious options (like a Zombies mode or racing vehicles), you can only imagine the kinds of modes players will make once they get their hands on it.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to find out, as Battlefield 6 arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming October 10, 2025.</p>

              <p>There’s the saying, “good artists copy, great ones steal.” And then there’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-mugen-ananta-anime-rpg-open-world-gta-trailer-1851714840">whatever <em>Ananta</em> is doing</a>. The upcoming open-world RPG from NetEase developer Naked Rain is going viral again thanks to new footage from Tokyo Game Show 2025. While it might look like the latest round of <em>Genshin Impact</em>-inspired <a href="https://kotaku.com/zenless-zone-zero-hoyoverse-rpg-project-mugen-anime-1850772023">mobile anime slop</a>, the developer has confirmed it won’t be relying on exploitative gambling mechanics to earn its keep. It will, however, be ripping off <em>Spider-Man</em> in every way it can.</p> <p>First, let’s start with the new trailer. Released earlier this week, it shows seven minutes of gameplay depicting all the ways you can explore, fight, and hang out in <em>Ananta’s</em> urban playground, and in the process it practically ends up serving as a greatest-hits highlight reel of all the past games the upcoming mobile release is clearly pulling from, including not just<em> Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em> but also<em> Watch Dogs</em>, <em>Sifu</em>, and more. There’s fluid martial arts brawls and smartphone hacking games. And of course, there’s the web-slinging people have been gawking at since the game was first announced.</p>  <p>It looks neat, and it’s impressive this is a game designed for mobile devices and not high-end consoles. Naked Rain is promising multi-level exploration from the ground-level streets to city rooftops, as well as interiors you can explore at different elevations. There are vehicles you can get in and drive, weapons you can pick up off the ground, from guns to golf clubs, and NPCs who will supposedly react to whatever chaos you’re causing while out exploring. “Every choice ripples through the life of the city,” the developers write. We’ll see.</p>

 <p>For some players, this is a win-win-win. Steal one game mechanic and you’re a thief. But take a bunch from all different games, pour them into a blender, see what comes out, and you might be a genius, or at least someone with the potential to make NetEase a lot of money. For others, however, <em>Ananta</em> is a bit too “shameless” when it comes to ripping off the competition. It’s not just that you can web-swing around town like Spider-Man, it’s that you can also use Venom-like powers to smash bad guys with attacks that look straight out of<em> Spider-Man 2</em>. Some of its chase scenes, meanwhile, seem lifted right out of an <em>Uncharted </em>game.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This Ananta game has no shame 😅<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Uncharted4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Uncharted4</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NaughtyDog?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NaughtyDog</a> <a href="https://t.co/ly53Bi6Ebi">pic.twitter.com/ly53Bi6Ebi</a></p> <p>— King J 🤴🏿 (@JMaine518) <a href="https://twitter.com/JMaine518/status/1971228406328250840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marvel's Spider-Man 2: The Anime… I mean, ANANTA looks absolutely incredible!

One other big thing going for it is that, unlike a lot of games in this space, <em>Ananta</em> won’t be hawking pay-to-win character loot boxes&nbsp;in order to make money. Naked Rain confirmed <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53241">to <em>Famitsu</em></a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/gta-style-open-world-anime-game-ananta-will-not-have-a-character-gacha-system-netease-confirms/"><em>Automaton</em></a>) that rather than these kinds of <a href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-whales-hoyoverse-gacha-gambling-spending-1849734889">gacha mechanics</a>, the game’s monetization will instead rely on cosmetics and other customizable features ranging from outfits and cars to the player’s house.</p> <p>It’s not the only post-<em>Genshin Impact</em> mobile RPG to be shifting away from gacha mechanics. The makers of<em> Duet Night Abyss,</em> which arrives on mobile next month, announced they too <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/a-gacha-rpg-is-cutting-all-the-gacha-garbage-so-it-can-just-be-a-better-game-were-completely-removing-all-character-and-weapon-banners/">would be ditching</a> the hero loot box grind and getting rid of star ratings for equipment to limit pay-to-win mechanics. It’s also doing away with stamina limits, another popular way of nickel-and-diming players on mobile. “In the last test,” DecaBear says, “[testers] said our gameplay<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->which is built around fast-paced grinding<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->kept getting blocked by stamina limits,” producer DecaBear said. “And that felt pretty bad.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> developer Gearbox has released the biggest update to the looter shooter since launch, adding a Field of View (FOV) slider on console, various performance improvements, and various Vault Hunter and gear buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The September 25, 2025 update adds new Weekly Activities, stability and performance improvements, adjustments to some rewards/progression, and further refinements across UI, audio, visuals, and gear. Check out the patch notes, from <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Borderlands website</a>, below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of particular note is the addition of a FOV slider on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-confirms-its-exploring-how-to-add-fov-sliders-to-borderlands-4-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-amid-complaints-from-console-players">something players had asked for</a>. Gearbox chief <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/randy-pitchford-addresses-borderlands-4-console-fov-slider-complaints-theres-some-dreams-i-have-where-an-fov-setting-might-affect-fairness">Randy Pitchford had responded to the complaints to suggest fairness might have had something to do with the lack of a FOV slider in Borderlands 4</a>, although all that comment did was confuse fans given the PC version has it and there’s crossplay at launch. While its arrival is welcome, Gearbox warned console players that increasing the FOV past the default could cause some dips in performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Graeme Timmins had flagged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-its-prioritizing-the-first-round-of-buffs-over-patching-out-instakill-knife-builds-but-it-will-eventually-address-unintended-interactions">Gearbox was more interested in buffing than nerfing Borderlands 4 in the short term</a>, leaving broken builds alone for the time being. And today's update reinforces that approach, with no nerfs to speak of. Indeed, Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to say Gearbox had too many buffs to fit into today’s update, so it broke them up into their own balance update that’s due out early next week.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update also includes fixes for the high-profile memory leak issue for Borderlands 4 on console, which causes the framerate to degrade the longer you play. But there’s more to come. “We believe we've made significant improvements there, but we're still investigating data to make sure any remaining issues continue to be resolved,” <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971251482692669832" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timmins explained</a>. “We're confident that today's update makes a big difference though, and we're excited to get feedback/data on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance improvements on PC are also welcome. Borderlands 4 is still on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around PC performance. The tech experts at Digital Foundry have said their <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</u></a> shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><u>which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without an updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

Instead, it wants <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> to keep going for years and years, like veteran MMO RuneScape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jagex’s fantasy MMO RuneScape began life as a browser game an incredible 25 years ago. It’s had over 300 million accounts since, and is still going strong today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, rather than follow Helldivers 2 with Helldivers 3, as the video game industry would perhaps expect, Arrowhead wants to follow RuneScape’s lead.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-boss-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-a-forever-game-like-runescape-that-can-keep-improving-with-no-plans-for-a-sequel/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani clarified the studio’s plans in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420521613207535647" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Discord</a>. “We have no plans for HD3,” he said, “just HD2 for as long as it can go. Think RuneScape.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of a Helldivers 3 had come up recently when Jorjani said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-a-destiny-style-social-hub-for-helldivers-2-its-on-the-feature-list-for-the-next-one-dev-says">a social hub space like the Tower in Destiny was “on the feature list for the next one."</a> But he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nbmucr/comment/nd46h3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later clarified</a> that he was talking about Arrowhead’s next game, not a Helldivers 2 sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His latest comment is consistent with prior statements on the studio’s plans. Jorjani has in the past said Arrowhead hopes to build upon Helldivers 2 to such an extent that it basically becomes a Helldivers 3, but that was clearly figuratively speaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Myself and the directors agree we would love this to be a forever game,” Jorjani added in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420498034395054172" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another Discord post</a>. “Assuming we get a grip on the performance and dev practices we can keep expanding it for a long time. PlayStation is super supportive.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Review Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jorjani’s comments shouldn't come as a surprise. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab"><u>The studio has indicated it plans to support Helldivers 2 for years to come</u></a>, and only recently launched the Sony-published game on Xbox Series X and S and the Into the Unjust update, which added Hive Worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In April, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab">Helldivers 2 production director Alex Bolle told IGN</a> "we want it to be around for years and years and years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And it's almost like, how do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are?" he continued. "And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while Helldivers 3 isn’t happening, more Helldivers stuff very much is. In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production">Sony announced that <u>Helldivers 2</u> was being adapted into a film</a> as part of a collaboration between Sony Productions and Sony Pictures. No other details were offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. Check out IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review-update-now-on-xbox-series-xs"><u>review of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X and S</u></a> to see what we think of the game as it is today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Finally scoring on Switch this November</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's that time of year again when Level-5 reminds us all that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> is a real game, and this time, there's even a brand-new trailer to boot.</p>
<p>The repeatedly delayed football RPG will <em>finally</em> be arriving on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>13th November</strong>, and today's Tokyo Game Show trailer gives us the lowdown on everything that we can expect.</p>
<p>Now, sure, the footage that we see this time isn't particularly different to that which we've been shown before, but in Level-5's defence, we have been tracking this one for a long time at this point.</p>
<p>The new trailer is only available in Japanese for the time being — the caption states that English subtitles will be added "at a later date" — but there's still plenty of gameplay to check out. We get a good look at the game's OTT training minigames, special-ability-based matches and nostalgic 'Chronicle Mode'. There's even a touch of town building-esque pitch customisation thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>It has been a long time coming, but we'd be lying if we said that we weren't a little bit excited for this one to finally kick off in November. Let's just hope that the release date sticks this time.</p>

Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians"><i><span>The Guardian</span></i></a><span> is reporting that Microsoft has cut off the Israeli military’s access to the technology that it has been using to conduct surveillance on phone calls in Palestine. According to the report, the Xbox company told Israeli officials that the military’s spy agency, Unit 8200, violated its terms of service by “storing the vast trove of surveillance data in its Azure cloud platform.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This follows </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud"><span>previous </span><i><span>Guardian</span></i><span> reporting</span></a><span> from August on how Azure was being used to store Palestine communications, as Israel had been surveilling civilian phone calls in Gaza and the West Bank. Following the report, Microsoft had an external investigation conducted into its relationship with Unit 8200, which led to the cancellation of the unit’s access to its cloud storage and AI services. You can read the </span><i><span>Guardian</span></i><span>‘s story for more of the minutiae, but the long and short of it is that this is a huge win for both the employees and external forces that </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5518786/microsoft-protesters-office-israel"><span>have been calling for a boycott</span></a><span> of Microsoft due to its relationship with the Israeli government, as it continues its ongoing attacks on the people of Palestine. Microsoft was </span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox"><span>added to the BDS Movement’s boycott list</span></a><span> earlier this year, with the movement calling the company “perhaps the most complicit tech company in Israel’s illegal occupation, apartheid regime and ongoing genocide against 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza.” This included calls to cancel subscriptions to Xbox Game Pass, as well as boycotting games like <em>Candy Crush</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em>, which are all owned by Microsoft’s various studios. We’ve reached out to the BDS Movement for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p> <p><span>Brad Smith, the Vice Chair &amp; President of Microsoft, sent an email to employees that was published </span><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/"><span>on the company’s blog</span></a><span>, in which he cited </span><i><span>The Guardian</span></i><span>’s reporting as the catalyst for this decision.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>While our review is ongoing, we have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian’s reporting. This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services.</span></p> <p><span>We therefore have informed IMOD of Microsoft’s decision to cease and disable specified IMOD subscriptions and their services, including their use of specific cloud storage and AI services and technologies. We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians.</span></p> <p><span>As I said at our recent employee townhall, this does not impact the important work that Microsoft continues to do to protect the cybersecurity of Israel and other countries in the Middle East, including under the Abraham Accords.</span></p> <p><span>I want to note our appreciation for the reporting of The Guardian. Its reports were based in part on sources outside Microsoft that had information we could not access in light of our customer privacy commitments. This helped inform our review.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>While this is a victory, as both Smith and </span><i><span>The Guardian</span></i><span> note, Microsoft still </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft"><span>has other longstanding relationships</span></a><span> with the Israel Defense Forces, which include access to certain tech and services. But this is the first example of a United States company pulling its resources from Israel since the war with Gaza began. </span></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/">Hades 2</a> has officially launched in full, and the day-one patch notes reveal just how far the game has come since it started its early-access journey. Currently available for PC and Switch consoles, the 1.0 version of Hades arrives with a substantial number of changes to the game, ranging from minor tweaks to new additions that'll keep you exploring the Underworld for hours on end.</p><p>Some of the biggest highlights here include the true ending of the game, so if you want to see how Princess Melinoe's story really concludes, you'll want to go give Chronos a good kicking. Supergiant Games added that this ending will not change key events in the game, and earning it will unlock the final Vow of Rivals rank. Getting to that ending is quite the achievement, and one that will be celebrated with some digital kudos, as 50 different achievements have been unlocked as well.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p>You do not need to start the game over to earn any achievements, so once you load it up, you may be pleasantly surprised to find these retroactively added to your account. Players can also expect new artwork--like visual effects, environmental art, and other visual improvements--new music to listen to, more decorations to liven up the Crossroads, and even more Keepsakes to collect. Beyond that, there are scores of tweaks to virtually every part of Hades 2, from combat to character animations and much more.</p><p>If you feel like scrolling through the lengthy patch notes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512967793587520047" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can click this link to read</a> about every change, big and small.</p><p>"Hades 2 exits early access as a finely-honed and deeply engaging roguelite that builds upon the strong foundations established by the first game," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2 review</a>. "It's larger in every way, with more characters and conversations to enjoy, an entirely new roster of weapons to learn, and deeper customization options to its expanded combat system, yet none of these upgrades compromise Hades' legacy. Rather, Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel that is essential to play."</p><p>If you're looking to dive into one of the best games of 2025, you can check out GameSpot's guides on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-best-endgame-build-tips/1100-6534896/" data-ref-id="1100-6534896">best Hades 2 endgame builds</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-soot-where-to-find-wake-up-hypnos-soundest-of-sleepers/1100-6534788/" data-ref-id="1100-6534788">where to find soot to wake up Hypnos in Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-melinoe-seek-us-riddles-where-to-locate-three-fates/1100-6534873/" data-ref-id="1100-6534873">where to locate the three Fates in Hades 2</a>.</p>

                <p>A major new patch for Borderlands 4 has arrived, adding the promised field of view (FOV) slider on console, making stability and performance improvements, and tweaking some rewards and progression elements.</p><p>It's a beefy patch, but it's not the end of Gearbox's ongoing support, as the developer also said there were "too many" buffs for Vault Hunters to fit into this update, so these changes are coming in their own balance update that is <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">targeting release early next week.</a> That said, this newest patch does indeed contain Vault Hunter changes and balance adjustments for Harlowe the Gravitar, Amon the Forgeknight, Vex the Siren, and Rafa the Exo-Soldier. You can see the specific changes in the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes below</a>.</p><p>Since Borderlands 4 launched earlier this month, players on console and PC have complained about stability and performance issues, and this patch addresses both of those concerns. It also addresses instances of crashes, hitching, and low FPS. Gearbox said it's work continues and it will make "further improvements to stability and performance" in the future.</p><p>For the FOV slider on console, Gearbox said people should know that increasing the FOV beyond the default settings may cause "dips in performance."</p><p>The technical issues with Borderlands 4 prompted Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">post through it</a>, but he's since moved on to <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1970925490556002363" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting a lot about the upcoming Now You See Me movie sequel</a>. Pitchford contributed to the magic elements of the movie and says he was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-more-involvement-now-you-see-me-borderlands-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more involved with that film that the Borderlands movie.</a></p><p>This patch, like any patch for any game, isn't expected to fix every last issue you may be experiencing, but work continues on additional patches to come over time.</p><p>In other Borderlands 4 news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">Switch 2 edition has been delayed indefinitely and all digital preorders are being refunded. </a></p><h2>Borderlands 4 September 25 patch notes</h2><h2><strong>Weekly Activities:</strong></h2><ul><li>Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on.</li><li>The Weekly Wildcard Mission has changed.

With</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/games/mina-the-hollower/">Mina the Hollower</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Yacht Club Games brings their signature retro style into the realm of an open world action-RPG that feels equally inspired by the top-down, freeform exploration of classic Legend of Zelda and the haunting, tense atmosphere of FromSoftware's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The transition [from</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] has been fun but also very difficult," said studio founder and game director Sean Velasco. "In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the screen is smaller, so there is less space to work with. Crafting every screen became a little puzzle we had to solve," he said. "With</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we were working with NES-style constraints, which gave us a lot of structure."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has fewer limitations in some ways, so we had to invent more of our own rules. That actually makes it harder, because more freedom means more choices!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Velasco, Making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">wasn't just about building a new kind of retro game—it was also an adventure in adapting to the new possibilities of Kickstarter in 2025.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dream-casting-and-finding-character-with-your-own-voice-unlocking-the-vault-2" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dream-casting and finding character with your own voice - Unlocking the Vault #2</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kickstarter can be a major marketing tool in 2025">Kickstarter can be a major marketing tool in 2025</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the developers, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the largest game they have made to date. The success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its spin-offs gave the team the runway to move forward with their project. However, as Velasco elaborated, their second attempt at a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yachtclubgames/mina-the-hollower">Kickstarter campaign</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> helped them further expand the vision and build an audience for a game that is quite different from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The game is not entirely funded through Kickstarter. It was a portion of the budget, but it was also a marketing and community-building tool," said Velasco. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">[crowdfunding] campaign went really well. It funded quickly, created a very enthusiastic community, and we even got to work with backers directly through things like "Director for a Day," just like we did back in 2013. It was very rewarding to experience... It was also much easier to fulfill rewards this time compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ten years ago, when we overpromised and were literally packing boxes of dirt ourselves."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Kickstarter has always been a place where niche audiences can make projects happen," he said. "Retro-inspired games fit perfectly there. They may not always have mass appeal to convince a big company to fund them, but crowdfunding shines a spotlight on them and helps them break into the mainstream. Today, retro game nostalgia is a big business, but we still approach it from a very indie place."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/nintendo-spells-out-why-player-communication-should-only-happen-in-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo spells out why player communication should only happen in-game</a></p><p>Image via Yacht Club Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Yacht Club Games ventures into a top-down action-RPG in the vein of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Oracle of Ages/Seasons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the Game Boy Color. Focusing on the plucky Mina, who wields a variety of weapons and can burrow underground to overcome foes and puzzles, she explores an island in mass turmoil as invading armies spread their corruption. The core loop leans into the structure of the Legend of Zelda series, but there's a heightened focus on exploring moody, atmospheric zones filled with different combat encounters. Different scenarios demand different tactics and careful use of Mina's arsenal to overcome them. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was modeled closely after classic 8-bit side-scrolling games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DuckTales </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ninja Gaiden</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has an entirely different pace and flow, moving away from traditional stage progression to a more seamless overworld with towns and dungeons to uncover. The game director stated that he still wanted to deliver a game that felt like their previous work on</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but would open up new avenues for them.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/digging-into-the-combat-design-of-cronos-the-new-dawn-game-developer-podcast-ep-54" target="_self" data-discover="true">Digging into the combat design of Cronos: The New Dawn - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 54</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Every retro-inspired game begins with inspiration from a specific era, genre, or viewpoint, and that creates expectations.

With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the top-down view resembles a classic RPG or action-adventure so that players might expect exploration, dungeons, and interconnected systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In both cases, as developers, we are playing with player expectations. You have to deliver something that feels authentic while still surprising them! The real challenge with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that it is much more complicated, as opposed to linear courses like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It has involved combat, hundreds of items that interact with one another... a giant overworld that can be explored in any order, and more! Designing and balancing systems, such as weapons, trinkets, and sidearms, was an enormous task. Finally, the top-down perspective makes judging the player's position when jumping difficult, which makes platforming a constant challenge to get right."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mimicking the style of the Game Boy era">Mimicking the style of the Game Boy era</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What surprised me most about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that while it retains that modest, expressive visual style of a Game Boy Color game, it's also an ambitious step up for the studio— far surpassing the scope of &nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to Valesco, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can take around 30 hours to finish in its entirety, which puts it in the same neighborhood as the recent </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Mostly I feel grateful that we can keep pushing ourselves to be creative in new ways, and that we have the opportunity to evolve beyond what people expect from retro-inspired games with a whole new game and genre," said Velasco.</span></p><p>Image via Yacht Club Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's rather fitting that Yacht Club Games' latest takes cues from the original Game Boy Color. Despite its limitations, the '90s handheld saw a whole suite of games made by developers that got great mileage out of the hardware: offering deep and involved experiences including The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Gold/Silver</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Quest III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a sense, that's what helped to define the games of the handheld—which pushed the limitations of classic 8-bit game and visual design to create some truly expressive and evocative games on modest hardware. In many ways, Yacht Club Games is continuing that classic legacy with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mina the Hollower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which presents a notably dense 8-bit-style action-RPG with so many layers (and such intentional design).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers have a keen focus on sticking true to the tenants and intentional limitations of classic game design—but also expanding upon them and introducing a modern edge where it makes sense.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

<p>At first glance, you'll notice that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> remains on top, selling a further 33,861 copies. But last week's new release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a>, takes both second and third place, with the PS5 version <em>just</em> edging out the Switch release (physically at least) by 58 copies.</p>
<p>But, if you combine both the PS5 and Switch copies sales, that makes Trails in the Sky the biggest game in terms of sales this week, which is impressive.

<p>Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> remains steady, shifting another 11,300 copies — some consistent numbers right there.

<p>Switching to the hardware side of things, the Switch 2 unsurprisingly remains up top. After surpassing the 2 million mark in Japan last month, it's sold a further 40,711 units, far outselling any other console this week.</p>
<p>The three Switch 1 SKUs have sold a combined 21,660, compared to the PS5's combined 8,384, a pretty significant drop for Sony's console compared to last week, while the Switch remains relatively consistent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's yet another GeForce NOW Thursday, with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-mecha-break/">a new batch of games announced</a> as joining the ever-growing library of games available to stream through NVIDIA's cloud service. This week, 10 games are joining the cloud library, while two games already available get a boost by officially becoming streamable with NVIDIA's new RTX 5080 graphics cards powering them.</p>



<p>The highlights in this week's batch of new GeForce NOW games include Mecha Break from developer Amazing Seasun Games, with the multiplayer PvPvE title joining the service with support from DLSS 4, letting you enjoy the 3v3 or 6v6 matches at high frame rates.</p>



<p>Other highlights come from new indie titles on the scene, including Baby Steps, a game from the makers of Ape Out and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. Baby Steps released earlier this week on September 23, after the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">slightly delayed it in order to get out of the way of Hollow Knight Silksong's launch</a>.</p>



<p>If you've not heard of Baby Steps before, it's a physics-based hiking game where you take control of a 35-year-old man-child in a onesie. You control each of his legs separately, and find yourself on a treacherous hike while winding your way through a story that is as weird as it is hilarious. It was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Wccftech's highlights at a Steam Next Fest earlier this year</a>, and the demo is still available if you want to try it out before jumping in.</p>



<p>Another highlight in this week's batch is the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy collection, which includes all 14 episodes from the first three games. </p>



<p>As for the two games that can be played through NVIDIA's new RTX 5080 graphics card, those titles are Remedy Entertainment's excellent Alan Wake 2, and GSC Game World's Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to GeForce NOW this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aztecs: The Last Sun</li>



<li>Baby Steps</li>



<li>CloverPit</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2</li>



<li>Lost Right</li>



<li>Mecha Break</li>



<li>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li>



<li>Precedessor</li>



<li>Renown</li>



<li>Sworn</li>
</ul>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-dying-light-the-beast/">13 games joined the cloud library</a>, including the new Claws of Awaji DLC for Assassin's Creed Shadows, Dying Light: The Beast, Jump Space, and Two Point Museum.</p>

            <p>Vroom. Vroom vroom. Vroom vroom vroom. Ahem, sorry, dunno what happened to me there. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> EVO, the three-letter-yelling follow up to one on Steam's long-reigning top <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">racing sims</a>, has just gotten its third early access update. It adds in online multiplayer, plus a bunch of fresh cars and tracks to hop into moments before you're unceremoniously punted off by a random.</p>
<p>I've been playing a bit of a waiting game with AC EVO since <a href="https://www.vg247.com/assetto-corsa-evo-feels-like-worthy-heir-to-steam-racing-titans-so-far-but-lot-of-laps-to-go">yapping about it at length for my old home</a> when it first debuted in early access at the start of this year, but this might be the point I hop behind its wheel agaion and see how devs Kunos Simulazioni have managed to flesh it out so far. After all, they've now added in a 90s Merc 190E, which is pretty much square German saloon kryptonite for my will to hold off on checking things out.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Booting the gas to commence my rundown of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3058630/view/543369627969782128?l=english">update 3's inclusions</a>, the headliner's AC EVO's first step into multiplayer via a new mode that lets you hop into races against up to 16 other players who'll no doubt be polite enough not to use your rear bumper as their brake. These races are held in free in-game servers, which run 24/7 and will have the sort of variety of race scenarios, tracks, and weather settings you'd expect to pick between.</p>
<p>A portal for custom servers is said to be coming soon and those are paid, something that hasn't gone down well with players to the extent it looks to be a key factor in the EVO's Steam reviews currently sitting at mixed. In terms of what they cost, a 20 or more slot server that's live 24/7 for 30 days will be €15 plus VAT, while renting a server with unlimited slots for just a day will cost €5. There are discounts if you opt to rent a server for longer periods, those being three, six, or twelve months. It's a controversial way of monetising things for sure, especially for a game that's still in paid early access.</p><p>Beyond that, update 3 brings nine new cars: three GTs, three special racers, and three road cars. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2, and Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport are the GTs, the Caterham Seven Academy Racer, Dallara Stradale, and the Ferrari F2004 F1 car that a certain Mike Schumacher drove are the specials. Finally, the road cars are the Audi RS 6 Avant, BMW M3 Sport Evo (E30), and that Merc 190E Evo 2 I mentioned earlier. New tracks-wise, Belgian rain magnet Spa and energy drink road the Red Bull Ring have arrived.</p>
<p>When fire them up, you'll likely notice a few other new additions like revamped car audio, a recalibrated tyre simming model, and graphical tweaks which bring in global illumination, optimised CPU/GPU performance especially for bigger grids and "significantly reduced VRAM usage"</p>
<p>So, hopefully less stuttery vroom vrooms when jumping into these new online races. Tell the first road rager who cheekily spins you out and then speeds of sniggering like Dick Dastardly I said hi.</p>
