            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Koei Tecmo ups the gameplay ante on its musou Zelda spinoff.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">2020’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity gave us an expanded look on a time in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s history only whispered about in a few flashback cutscenes. The new Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment seems to be following this trend by taking us even further back in time to the founding of Hyrule and the imprisoning of Ganondorf, of which only fragments were shown in Tears of the Kingdom. Just as Tears expanded on everything Breath of the Wild had to offer, Age of Imprisonment seems to be equally upping the stakes, both in taking advantage of the Switch 2’s increased horsepower and showing off some new and welcome features to the hack ‘n slash spinoff series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo I played (which is now also available to attendees of the Tokyo Game Show) comprised a 10-minute chunk of an early mission that also sought to capitalize on Tears of the Kingdom’s new discoveries: exploring The Depths. Given that this creepy underground area effectively doubled the size of Hyrule, I’m excited to see where these types of missions can lead, and what horrors we’ll find lurking in the dark (I can’t be the only one hoping we get some acknowledgement of the creepy giant statues). This iteration of Hyrule Warriors seemed to run a lot smoother on the Switch 2 and I couldn’t spot any dips in the framerate while wading into combat, but being in an early enclosed area it’s hard to say if Nintendo’s new console was truly being put through its paces.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment - September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I began the mission as Zelda, still adjusting to being thrown backwards in time during the events of Tears of the Kingdom, with the ancient Zonai beings Rauru and Minera escorting her toward sacred sites of power hidden away in the Depths. After equipping myself with a few Zonai devices to use in battle, it wasn’t long before I was mowing through enemies in true Dynasty Warriors “musou” style. This time around, Zelda has put down the sheikah slate in favor of a lightsaber, mixing in more straightforward sword slashes with the ability to shoot light arrows from afar, or recall her sword as it dances around to cut swaths through enemies. It’s a great way to make her less of a technical fighter and more of an easy to pick up all-rounder stand-in for Link (who couldn’t make it on account of the whole time travel thing).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zelda has put down the sheikah slate in favor of a lightsaber. It’s a great way to make her less of a technical fighter and more of an easy to pick up all-rounder stand-in for Link.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I was only able to play as three different characters during the demo, I have to hand it to Mineru for stealing the show. Her ability to pull out random complex Zonai death contraptions was something I never got tired of. Whether it was driving a giant spiky four-wheeler of destruction through enemies, or simply hopping onto a giant tire to ride side-saddle instead of running, Mineru has so far proven to be the Green Lantern of this universe with her ability to pull out the wildest creations out of nowhere. Many of her crazier constructs – like summoning a spinning paddle to whack giant orbs into enemies like a bowling ball – had me itching to go back to Tears of the Kingdom to see if I could recreate these death traps myself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though only Mineru got to summon complex machines, each character was able to gather singular Zonai devices to be used in battle as consumable items, and deployed in a few ways. At first I was whipping out my flame emitter to mow down groups of little Frox enemies, but later I was able to set one down to continuously burn a Construct Captain while I flanked from the side with more direct attacks, making it an effective 1-2 punch combo. All devices will drain your battery, making their deployment a tactical choice unless you’ve stockpiled battery rechargers. I was only able to mess around with a few, but with different characters using devices in various manners, there’s a lot of room to find great times to deploy them – especially on boss fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with deploying devices, holding R also allows you to activate special unique skills in combat that cover wide areas and blast through the opposition with some bombastic attacks. Each character I got to play had two different abilities, and I was also able to map them alongside Zonai devices for easy use. While they can be used to mow through hordes of grunts, they really shine when facing tougher bosses and captains that stand between you and your objectives. Even the most generic of construct captains can employ strong unblockable attacks that can cover a wide area and do heavy damage, signified by a glowing aura that spreads out from them. Koei Tecmo has seemingly taken a page from another of its action series, Nioh, in presenting the best way to stop an unblockable strike is to overpower it with one of your own. Being able to anticipate, react, and shut down a deadly foe with a trick of my own was immensely satisfying and rewarding (and at least this early on, I was given a pretty generous reaction time before their attack would unleash).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I also appreciate the steps Age of Imprisonment has taken to make your allies feel more tangible, as they are now able to assist you in battle with bigger attacks when you’re running out of skills to deploy. In one instance, a boss readied its charge attack, while both of Zelda’s skills were still on cooldown. Suddenly I was given the option to swap to Rauru waiting on the other side of the arena, and I was able to deploy his unique skill to intercept the boss and save Zelda in a moment that felt truly cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An even bigger upgrade to making more use of your allies is a new ability - a sync strike that can be triggered when you and your ally have dealt enough damage to fill a meter. This lit up their portraits on the side, and also helpfully showed when I was in range of a character to perform the strike with by highlighting the ground to the person in range. Not only are these moves as dramatic as they are powerful, but they’re also unique to the two characters you sync up, opening up the floor for a lot of possibilities and tactics. Pairing up Zelda and Rauru allowed me to shoot out twin beams of light that I could aim independently with each control stick to focus on two bosses at once, while having Zelda synch up with Mineru for a strike let her ride on the back of the Zonai’s mech to wade into battle alternating powerful slams and magic explosions. Given the nature of some of these attacks, I’m really hoping that co-op play will allow each player to direct their own attacks during these sync strikes, though nothing has been confirmed yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though my time with the demo was criminally short, I’m already looking forward to seeing how more of its characters fight in sync – especially the tiny korok musketeer and enigmatic looking Zonai construct that looks very similar to a notably absent hero. Luckily I’ll only have just over a month to wait until Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment arrives on November 6th.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-evolved-into-an-even-better-legend-of-zelda-complement]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here's a new trailer to make up for it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some breaking news from Level-5, with the company today confirming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> will no longer arrive on the Switch and Switch 2 this year.</p>
<p>This update comes alongside the latest trailer at the Tokyo Game Show. It's now scheduled to arrive at some point in 2026. Here's the <a href="https://www.layton.jp/jouki/en/topics/250925/">official statement via the Layton website</a>, which notes how the team wants to deliver the title in the "best possible form":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"LEVEL5 Inc. would like to begin by offering its sincere apologies to all fans who have been looking forward to the release of Professor Layton and the New World of Steam. Although the release was originally scheduled for 2025, in order to deliver the game in the best possible form, the launch has been rescheduled for 2026. We deeply regret any inconvenience this delay may cause and greatly appreciate your understanding and continued support."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>When we hear more about when exactly this game will be releasing for Nintendo's platforms, we'll let you know. This new Professor Layton outing was originally revealed by Level-5 in 2023 and was targeting a 2025 launch until this latest delay.</p>
<p>In some other delay news, 2K Games yesterday announced it would push back the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> on the Switch 2.</p>

The journey begins on each player’s planet, where <a title="Companies > fuzz [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y Neighbors can connect their home planets. As bonds deepen and planets flourish, Luca, the planet’s vitality, will shape each unique planet with different landscapes, brimming with life and energy.</p><p>As a life sim, <em>Petit Planet</em> unfolds everyday life with various joyful yet relaxing activities—planting, fishing, beachcombing, mining, <a title="Genres > Cooking [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>, and <a title="Genres > Crafting [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a>.

These fuzzy companions can be invited to settle, and friendships can grow through heartfelt conversations, thoughtful gift exchanges, and unique interactions that make every bond distinct. As the planet prospers, so do the friendships upon it. <em>Petit Planet</em> weaves relationship building into daily activities to unlock deeper connections, turning ordinary encounters into cosmic wonders.</p><p>Even so, connections built in <em>Petit Planet</em> are never confined to your own planet. Players may board their trusty vehicle with helpful Neighbors to take a Starsea Voyage, venturing into unknown <a title="Games > Islets [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/islets">Islets</a>, discovering rare creatures, uncovering hidden recipes, and forging unexpected friendships across the galaxy. Beyond exploration lies the Galactic Bazaar, an ever-bustling social hub where conversations spark over coffee, festival events bring joy to the sky, and friendships are formed with other players, turning a fleeting moment into a lasting connection.</p><p>Featuring 3D cartoony and stylized art, <em>Petit Planet</em> marks <a title="Companies > HoYoverse [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo/hoyoverse">HoYoverse</a>‘s first step into the life simulation genre.

<p>Koei Tecmo today announced a remaster of Dynasty Warriors 3 and it will be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 next year on 19th March 2026.</p>

Google apparently agrees. Today, it’s finally elevated its <em>Epic v.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The balance of power has changed once again in Marvel Rivals Season 4, which introduced plenty of hero adjustments to shake things up. If you're wondering which characters are routinely dominating lobbies, or who we think is perhaps a more situational choice, we've got you covered with our Marvel Rivals Season 4 tier list. Below, you'll find our ranking, with S rank being the strongest characters and D being the weakest.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Tier List</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>S-Tier:</strong> Emma Frost, Doctor Strange, Magneto, Wolverine, Loki</li><li><strong>A-Tier:</strong> The Thing, Groot, Thor, Magik, Namor, Psylocke, Angela, The Punisher, Winter Soldier, Cloak &amp; Dagger, Luna Snow, Phoenix</li><li><strong>B-Tier:</strong> Peni Parker, Venom, Hela, Human Torch, Iron Man, Moon Knight, Spider-Man, Invisible Woman, Ultron, Hulk, Iron Fist, Captain America, Squirrel Girl, Black Panther, Rocket Raccoon</li><li><strong>C-Tier:</strong> Hawkeye, Mister Fantastic, Star-Lord, Storm, Adam Warlock, Mantis, Scarlet Witch</li><li><strong>D-Tier:</strong> Black Widow, Jeff the Land Shark</li></ul><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>S-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Emma Frost</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Emma Frost has been a force to be reckoned with ever since she debuted in Season 2; she's a good old-fashioned tank. With Emma, you can run up to the front line and clear a path for your team to move forward, and even throw up a shield to defend her teammates. But the best part is her Diamond form, which she can use to essentially shut down any incoming dives and cut off potential ultimates that require a build-up. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Doctor Strange</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all the tinkering, Doctor Strange remains one of the best characters. He can fit into any build and is incredibly useful: he can shield himself and everyone around him, and with a well-placed attack, he can be a distraction for the frontline while popping some shots at healers. The best thing about him is his portal. When this is used in overtime, it can make all the difference between winning or losing a round.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Magneto</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Magneto is an excellent hero for a lot of the same reasons as Doctor Strange. They play very similarly to one another and can both fit into any build. What makes him especially dangerous, though, is his ult: if timed right, it can one-shot a Cloak &amp; Dagger, Luna Snow, or Invisible Woman while <em>they</em> ult.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Wolverine</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Wolverine is a constant threat in any circumstance. Even though he's small in size, he has a large presence on the battlefield. Much of Wolverine's kit is built around diving the backline or making a hole for the team to push through. A well-placed Wolverine can easily make all the difference, because if he's not making the healers run for their lives, he's bullying the tanks in front. If that's not dangerous enough, he can heal himself and get away on a moment's notice. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Loki</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Loki is a multipurpose healer, thanks to his clones. He may be one of the most complex characters to master, but learning him is well worth it. His clones can be used to set up a line of fire that can hold down a position until backup arrives, and being able to confuse your opponents about who's the real one can buy your team time to attack. If you ever find yourself in a close battle, his ability to turn himself into whatever character he wants can make all the difference in a close fight.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>A-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">The Thing</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's The Thing… he's just great. This orange pile of rocks is easily one of the best additions to a support tank. His recent buffs last season have made him even more dangerous, because not only can he shut down dive players, but he can now smack flyers out of the sky. He's straightforward in that he only has a couple of attacks, but each one can pack a serious punch. If you're looking for a tank that can rush straight into a fight, The Thing is the one for you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Groot</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Groot has always been good right from the start, but he's lost some of his flair throughout the last couple of seasons. He's still a danger whenever he pops up in a game, though. Being able to wall off opponents and prevent them from escaping or getting healed is an absolute game-changer. If you find yourself being terrorized by a diver, you can simply trap them in the backfield and quickly take care of them before they become more of a threat.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Thor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Thor has slowly been improving since Season 1. He wasn't much use initially, and getting a lot of mileage out of him required some real planning. But thanks to a handful of buffs he's received, he's now one of the standout characters. Like the Hulk, he can be played in a couple of different ways, meaning that you can have him on the frontline and take some damage, or you can dive the backfield with him to create a distraction. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Magik</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really hard to go wrong with Dive heroes. Even though they're extremely annoying to deal with, having one on your team can make you feel like an unstoppable force of nature. Magik is easily one of the best dive characters to have, largely because of the portals she can set up that allow her to get from A to B as quickly as possible. This, paired with her high damage combos, makes her a great addition to any team.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Namor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to shut down <em>and</em> have dive potential with the same character, Namor is the perfect choice. He thrives at playing the backfield and can take pop shots at anyone he sees. Plus, setting up squids in key spots where your healers are is enough to prevent anyone from sneaking up on you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Psylocke</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a highly mobile hero with a high damage output, Psylocke is the perfect one to play. Even though she's not necessarily a dive character, she can absolutely play like one. Perhaps the most dangerous thing about Psylocke is her ult. If you happen to catch one or two people by themselves in the backline, she can easily eliminate them.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Angela</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Angela is the latest hero to join the game's ever-growing cast of characters, and she's already made a big name for herself. Having a flying tank is game-changing, and what's nice is that there aren't a lot of people who can really counter her while in the air. She can be played like a dive character, but she can also take a lot of damage on the frontline thanks to her shield. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Punisher</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Punisher has always been a solid character and fits into just about every list. Even though all of his attacks are ranged, you can still get up and close thanks to his shotgun. He's excellent at holding down areas due to his machine gun turret and ability to shut down a lot of flyers who may be in the area. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Winter Soldier</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It often feels like the Winter Soldier is one of Netease's favorite characters. It's hard to think of a time when he was ever bad. Like The Punisher, he can fit into any list and can fill plenty of different roles; For example, he's adept at dealing with flyers and can shut down any dives thanks to his hook attack. On top of that, his ult allows him to clear large groups all at once.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cloak &amp; Dagger</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Cloak &amp; Dagger are perhaps one of the most straightforward healers to learn, and have a huge presence on the battlefield. You don't even need to hit someone with your heals; as long as you get the general area, you'll heal them. Being able to switch between characters that also assist with damage and blinding enemies is a huge bonus, too, and a well-timed ult can easily pave the way to the objective when need be.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Luna Snow</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though Luna is a healer, that doesn't mean she can't dish out some damage. If, for some reason, you find yourself on the frontline, you can freeze someone to give your team some time to line up an attack. This is also a great way to fight off anyone trying to dive at her. Similar to Cloak &amp; Dagger, her ult can guide a struggling team to touch the objective and give them a fighting chance.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Phoenix</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a Phoenix on the team is never a bad idea. Most of her attacks dish out a lot of damage, and having her in the backfield to serve as a sniper is perhaps one of the best things she can do. Plus, having her paired up with a Wolverine is a match made in heaven, and if your team happens to be giving up ground, her ult will make sure that's taken care of right away.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>B-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Peni Parker</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Peni can really shine in certain situations. Specifically, when you're on defense on the Convergence map, or when you're playing Domination, her ability to set up nests and plant mines is extremely useful. These mines can easily take out one or two heroes if they're not paying attention, or at least damage another tank enough for someone else to finish the job. Plus, her ability to web characters and stun them out of an ult makes her especially  dangerous.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Venom</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to diving, Venom is a great character to play, but he's not the best fit in every game. You'll need at least one other diver to help, and if no one else is playing tank, you'll leave everyone on the frontline to deal with everything on their own. But don't let that deter you, because you can often buy your team enough time to run up the field if you focus on the healers and more squishy characters.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hela</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a poke character is never a bad idea. Hela is one of the most dangerous characters in the game. She has high damage input, and her ult only amplifies that. Thankfully, Season 4 is helping her even more with the new Symbiote Shenanigans team-up. If you're looking to stop the enemy team's range characters, she's a good counter to most of them.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Human Torch</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Johnny just has a certain flair. A well-placed Human Torch can be very scary. As a flyer, he always has a good view of everything, can dish out a lot of damage, and can get away relatively fast. Although First Steps may not be the most powerful team-up, being able to drop The Thing in the backfield is enough to disrupt the backfield for your team to push up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Iron Man</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Man excels when he's paired up with the right people (Ultron, mainly). But he can also stand on his own with his kit, shooting at folks from a distance. Being able to terrorize a tank with what sometimes feels like an ultimate beam is great in just about any situation. His ult still remains one of the best in the game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Moon Knight</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Moon Knight has seen a lot of nerfs and buffs, but he's always been a reliable hero to have on your team for a couple of key reasons. One of them is Ankh, which allows him to damage multiple people at once and dish out a lot of damage while doing it. On top of that, his ult is a great way to clear out anyone  standing on the objective.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Spider-Man</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Spider-Man used to be an absolute menace, like J. Jonah Jameson used to claim. Even though he's seen a lot of nerfs and changes that don't make him as scary anymore, don't let that fool you because he still is, in the right hands. Being able to grab just about anyone and throw them off the map with his webs is still one of the scariest things about him, and that's without mentioning how fast he is in being able to escape any danger he might find himself in. As a healer, nothing is scarier than seeing the webbed menace coming your way.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Invisible Woman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Invisible Woman is an ideal pick whenever you have any of the other Fantastic Four members on your team, because her team-up allows them to heal teammates in the heat of battle on their own. On top of that, she's great at trapping divers from escaping thanks to her push ability, and if she does get caught, she can easily turn invisible and run somewhere safe. Like Cloak &amp; Dagger and Luna Snow, her ult can make all the difference in a key fight.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ultron</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultron is great to have on your team, but only if you have a healer like Cloak &amp; Dagger, Luna Snow, or Invisible Woman. This is because he can't deliver as many heals as most of them can. But he makes up for it when it comes to damage output, and this is especially true when the Stark Protocol is in play. Playing Ultron can always be a gamble because you often sacrifice heals for damage, and his ult only reflects that, which can often cost important fights. But if you can place your drones on the right characters, this<em> can</em> be avoided.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hulk</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hulk can be a mixed bag at times. Even though he has a lot of mobility, it can often come at a cost. Whenever he's on the field, it often feels he's often targeted by the entire lobby. But if you're able to maintain composure, you can remind them why Hulk is the strongest there is. Similar to Thor, he can be played on the frontlines, or you can jump your way to the backfield and attempt to take out a healer or two.  Even though his attacks consist of his right and left hands, they can pack a serious punch. Whenever the Gamma Charge is in play, the combo is strong enough that you're almost guaranteed to shut down dives.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Iron Fist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Fist has always been a blast to play. Nothing beats jumping into the backfield and giving the enemy healer the good one-two combo. Plus, if you're good enough with him, you can easily solo just about any tank that comes your way. It's worth mentioning, though, he requires a lot of skill to play well and can die extremely fast.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Captain America</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Captain America is a lot like Iron Fist because he's a lot of fun to play, but he's a tricky character to learn. He used to be one of the most standout tanks, but due to a series of buffs, that's sadly no longer the case. Captain America doesn't fit into a lot of builds anymore and is more of a situational tank for when you're looking to jump on the point or distract the team for a while. But if you learn how to properly play him, he can easily be one of the most dangerous heroes on the field.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Squirrel Girl</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Squirrel Girl is often a safe pick whenever you find yourself playing on a Convergence or Domination map. It's because you can often hide someone in the corner and spam acorns, and you're almost guaranteed to get a hit. Even with her most recent nerf, she's still worth picking because of how easy she is to play.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Panther</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Panther has always been a character to watch out for. This is especially true thanks to the Gamma Charge team-up that he's now part of. Even though he's not as strong as he was in Season 3.5, he's still a danger on the field.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rocket Raccoon</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Rocket Raccoon can be a challenging hero to play, but if you have a good one on your team, you'll be set up for success. This is largely due to how small he is; he's often an easy target to miss. Plus, if everyone is dead on point, he can easily run around in circles for a few seconds without being caught. Like Cloak &amp; Dagger, you don't need to hit someone with your heals because they'll receive it as long as you shoot it in their general area. The other thing that really makes him sense is his respawn beacon that'll bring back one person as soon as they're killed. One thing you really need to be smart about, though, is where you place his ult, because of how quickly it can be destroyed. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>C-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Hawkeye</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hawkeye has always been a character that's hard to master, but he's gotten a little bit easier to play thanks to a series of buffs and team-ups that he's a part of. Being able to one-shot a lot of enemies with a well-placed headshot is always a good feeling. Plus, his ability to hit just about anyone with his ult is why he's not lower on this list.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mister Fantastic</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until Season 3.5, Mister Fantastic was a solid pick because he could easily double as a tank if need be. Thanks to a series of nerfs, though, he's no longer as good as he used to be. But one thing he still shines at is shutting down dives, and this is thanks to his ability to hit people at a distance. So even if they are getting away, you can potentially eliminate them before they flee to safety. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Star-Lord</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Peter has had quite the journey since the game's launch. He used to be one of the best characters to play, but sadly, that's no longer the case. That being said, he can still dish out a lot of damage, and his ult can be good if there's not a shield character on the other team. That being said, there's often a lot working against him, and you're usually better off with another Duelist hero.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Storm</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, Storm falls into the same category as Star-Lord. She's, by all accounts, a fun character to play, but many other flyers are more ideal than her. Even with the Jeff-Nado team-up, it's not worth having her or Jeff on the team when there are many better options to pick from. But the one thing that really makes her stand out is her ability to buff the team if they're within her radius, and at times, this can make a difference during a fight.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Adam Warlock</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Adam Warlock has always been a risky healer to play. Like Ultron, he doesn't have many moves to heal people. The heals he does have are placed on cooldowns, and if you're not smart with them, you can easily set up your team for failure. It is worth mentioning that even though his ult is useful, if done in a poor location, it'll usually be a waste of time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mantis</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Mantis is another healer who can be a bit of a gamble. Even though she has some useful items in her kit, like the ability to stun enemies, her healing output isn't the best. The same can be said about her ult, which often feels like a weaker version of Luna Snow's.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Scarlet Witch</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet Witch is an ideal character if you're new to the game. That being said, there are a lot of better options out there. Even though she can dish out a lot of damage, there's a lot working against her. One prime example of this is her ult, because anyone with a shield can block it, and she can be stunned out of it with Emma or Penni.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><u>D-Tier Marvel Rivals Heroes</u></h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Widow</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Widow has always had a tough time in Marvel Rivals. She's easily the least powerful Duelist in the game, even with the buffs and team-ups she's received. Oftentimes, it's not worth playing her if you're looking to go poke, when other heroes like Hela do a better job than her and require less skill.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jeff the Land Shark</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though Jeff the Land Shark has a simple kit to understand, that's where a lot of his usefulness ends. He has a poor output rate as a healer, and there are often better picks than him. On top of that, his ult is less than ideal for a healer, because if you find yourself in a key battle where both healers use their ults, his will often feel like a waste and end up costing the fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luis Joshua Gutierrez is a freelance writer who loves games.

                <p dir="ltr">I recently got to play around 20 minutes of the newest Hyrule Warriors game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" data-ref-id="5000-671281">Age of Imprisonment</a>, and there's a lot for fans of Zelda and Musou games to be interested in. For the former, it'll come as exciting news that Age of Imprisonment is canon. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity/" data-ref-id="5000-518353">Age of Calamity</a> was pretty wishy-washy with alternate timeline ideas, Nintendo is going all-in for its follow-up and making everything you see in Age of Imprisonment true to the mainline story. We all know what happens in the end with Ganondorf, but there are, of course, a lot of questions about what happened before and after.</p><p dir="ltr">From a gameplay standpoint, Age of Imprisonment will let players get their hands on a good variety of characters from the canon and, given what I saw from just Zelda, Rauru, and Mineru, this is a <em>very</em> good roster filled with very exciting prospects.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Beyond the Legend – Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment – Creator's Voice | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">During my time with Age of Imprisonment, we got to head underground with Rauru, Mineru, and Zelda, the latter of whom mentions that it is her first time in the depths and that she didn't know it existed. Mineru explains that the depths have multiple sites of sacred power and that she's been collecting constructs for her research. She wasn't able to investigate the depths on her own until Zelda and her powers of light came along to give them the ole' beatdown.</p><p dir="ltr">Each character, of course, had their unique style in combat, with Zelda both slashing with a strange Zonaite sword and wielding magical light projectiles; Rauru using spear and beam attacks; and Mineru utilizing a bunch of contraptions cobbled together from Zonai equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">I felt right at home plowing through Little Frox, Frox, and Constructs, as someone who played a whole lot of Age of Calamity, but even those with <em>some</em> experience with any Musou game will likely find it easy to pick up. From the first game, you still have your regular and strong attack combos, dashes, flurry rushes, guarding, weakpoint smashes, crafting materials; the whole shebang. Attacks are flashy, have massive areas of effect, and are always fun to dole out punishment with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4574317-zelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574317" data-ratio="0.5625641025641" data-width="1950" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4574317-zelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574317"></a><figcaption>There are a lot of playable characters in this game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4574317-zelda.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The R button menu has changed from the Sheikah Slate to unique skills in Age of Imprisonment. There's both a powerful dashing and vertical attack, and Zonai devices to either use whenever you'd like, or, in a better use case, can be used to counter an enemy's ability and slap 'em back in the face. The Y dashing version counters opponents dashing towards you, such as the construct's forward lunge, which has been pulled straight out of Tears of the Kingdom. The X version counters aerial or jumping attacks, such as the Frox's leap attack. These attacks can be used on their own for extra damage, but hitting specific counters seems much more worthwhile as they offer an opportunity to execute an extra follow-up at the end. These attacks have a cooldown, just like before with a successful use of a slate ability. The interesting thing is the A and B buttons are customizable Zonai equipment, each with specific properties that are changeable in the directional pad's right menu. This lets you switch your loadout on the fly depending on what the enemies' weaknesses are. The Zonai equipment uses Zonai batteries, which need to be replenished, however.</p><p dir="ltr">The cool thing about this is that some equipment can be placed into the environment and will operate automatically without your input, which can up the damage-dealing potential available. Since there's no friendly fire, there's a lot of opportunity to, for example, drop a flame emitter and work it into your overwhelming offense--thank Hylia.</p><p dir="ltr">Enemies also have traits and weaknesses that carry over from Tears of the Kingdom. Frox eat bombs, for example, and they're still weak to shots to the eye or attacks to their backside ores. That means that if you played Tears, you'll have a major leg up on the general idea of how to take on what you're up against.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4574319-zelda-age-of-imprisonment-canonical-zelda-timeline-age-of-calamity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4574319-zelda-age-of-imprisonment-canonical-zelda-timeline-age-of-calamity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574319"></a><figcaption>Zelda has a lot of slashing and light-based attacks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4574319-zelda-age-of-imprisonment-canonical-zelda-timeline-age-of-calamity.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Where it really changes from Age of Calamity though is Sync Strikes. This is not just because it's a powerful attack that requires two characters, but it's <em>because</em> it needs two characters, and the nature of Musou games requires you to divide and conquer the map, making you strategize when characters should work together or go separately. This is an interesting twist on how these types of games are usually played.</p><p dir="ltr">Sync Strike attacks are the biggest game-changer in my opinion, because in the Age of Calamity, most characters were undertaking solo ventures and attacking different points of the map. But Sync attacks are so powerful that having two characters working together feels like a reliable way to plow through an enemy quickly and save time. This encourages you to strategize and always reconsider where to send units for best possible results, especially since Sync Strike attacks are slow to charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Sync Strike attack pair up varies depending on who is partaking and what you get ranges from multi-directional beams you can control to a completely alternate form like Mineru's powered-up construct. This means that some of these attacks will likely be better or worse in some situations, so there will no doubt be plenty of opportunities to test and experiment to optimize builds and runs. Just thinking about the final possible roster for this game and designing an interacting Sync attack across all characters sounds like a very daunting task, but as players, that means there's likely to be plenty of depth.</p><p>While the preview was fairly short, with a little teaser at the end, I got a pretty good idea of how good Age of Imprisonment feels, and it feels <em>damn</em> good. I think the fact that this game already has good legs, and I'm yet to see the characters I really want to see just makes me more excited for its release on November 6.</p>

Anything I can clock in to, go into a meditative state while performing it then clock off, sign me up. I've loved chopping vegetables and washing dishes because I could listen to music the whole time, and I've walked the streets delivering catalogues because I was trying (and failed) to learn a language through my headphones at the same time.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Easy Delivery Co. | Official Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ScyShsuxcwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That's why whenever I retire from all of this<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DK_4SGvNCtK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I'd love to moonlight as a postman</a>, and it's also why I've had such a great time this week with <em>Easy Delivery Co.</em>, a game I have described to my friends as "horrificute".</p><p>You play a delivery driver (well, delivery cat) working in a desolate, low-poly world, with bleak weather and off-kilter inhabitants that would all be a very good take on <em>Silent Hill</em> were it not for the fact everyone you meet looks and talks like they've just stepped out of <em>Animal Crossing</em> instead.</p><figure></figure><p>Which creates a wonderful duality of all these cute animal guys chirping their lines and ostensibly being friendly to you and asking you to help perform odd little jobs, while at the same time the game has a brutal survival element to it (you can freeze to death, which then leads to...stuff). Everything those cute animal guys are saying isn't <em>quite right</em>,<em> </em>and thejob interface interface comes served in a bleak, almost dystopian wrapper of capitalist servitude.</p><p><em>Easy Delivery Co.</em> has you driving to a job, picking up some packages then delivering them across a small map (<a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my favourite kind!</a>), which consists of a handful of towns, some big bridges and a <em>lot </em>of snow. After you deliver a package you get some money, take a new job then do it all again, over and over, for around 4-5 hours, with just the weather, a map (on-screen waypoint markers are limited) and some lo-fi music to keep you company out on the road. It's unsettling, in a way, but also reassuring; the snow makes your journeys feel as comforting as they are dangerous, and the act of driving around, helping some animals out and listening to music is as meditative as I like my work to be.</p><figure></figure><p>What really got me in the mood to clock in and do some work, though, is the game's truck. Look at it! That cute little kei truck! It's great! Best of all, it works like a real truck and is kinda pedantic about it, in that to begin and end a delivery you need to park, get out, drop the tray flap, unload the cargo, then put the tray flap back up, making a very satisfying <em>thunk</em> sound as it goes.</p><p>I just can't get enough of little procedure touches like that. If this game had just asked me to drive somewhere and then my package was just magically marked as "delivered" I'd have probably made it 15 minutes in before bailing. But get me lost in the work and I'll drive that truck all day long.</p><p>(<em>Easy Delivery Co.</em> is<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3293010/Easy_Delivery_Co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> out now on Steam</a>).</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/soulframe-bear-stomach-interview-digital-extremes"><h3>Inside The Soulframe Scene Where You Go Inside A Bear</h3></a><p>"There is a running gag that I watched over 40 hours of bear colonoscopy videos"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon"><h3>Netflix’s Kiss Or Die Is Yakuza’s Cringiest Eroge Substory Turned Into A Full-Blown Variety Show</h3></a><p>A sketch show with comedians, AV actresses, and a high-budget production that's more insufferable than entertaining</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism"><h3>I Love Silksong Even When It Bugs Me</h3></a><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is a once-in-a-generation platformer and a labor of love.

		<p>Ah, Let it Die. Quite possibly one of the most enigmatic free-to-play games of all time, it’s been 9 years since the original launched on PS4, where it introduced the world to Uncle Death, the Tower of Barbs and its Souls-lite hack and slash combat. It also introduced the world to the idea of paying real money to revive yourself, and while that might not have particularly caught on, the fact that it’s still going nearly a decade later shows that it got a lot of things right. Fans of the series can rejoice then, with the announcement of Let It Die: Inferno, a brand-new, full-price entry in the series that looks to take all those things that the original got right and make them better.</p>
<p><iframe title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Tower of Barbs is gone, and instead you’re about to embark on a mission into hell, descending through the different levels on the way to… well, I’m not sure yet, since Death appears at the start of the game, and it’s called Let It Die. Perhaps the things it wants you to let die are all the beasts and badniks that get in your way, and from the look of the announcement trailer, there’s going to be plenty of those to send on their way. </p>
<p>Touted as a ‘survival action roguelike’ Let It Die: Inferno is due to launch on the PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on the 3rd of December, 2025. Just like the original game, Let It Die: Inferno is being published by GungHo Online Entertainment, but where that was developed by Suda 51’s Grasshopper Manufacture, the team at Super Trick Games, who span off from the original developers and worked on the short-lived battle royale Deathverse: Let It Die, are once again taking the reins. </p>
<p>It already looks amazing, and seems to mix the characterful combat of the original with a thoroughly modern take on the Roguelike genre, while shifting to Unreal Engine 5 and a full-price release, which should hopefully remedy many player’s number one complaint with the first game. We’ll be checking it out over the next two days at the Tokyo Game Show, and we’ll be sure to let you know how it feels!</p>

The books retell the events of the first two Metal Gear Solid games and were written by Raymond Benson, who has also authored several official James Bond novels.</p><p>It's worth noting that Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima's latest project, Death Stranding, also received <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-Official-Novelization/dp/178909576X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an official</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-Official-Novelization/dp/1789095786?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">two-part novelization</a>. While there are similarities in visual design language, detailed world-building techniques, and even gameplay elements between Death Stranding and Metal Gear, Death Stranding leans more heavily into overt sci-fi elements. Nevertheless, it's worth checking out if you're looking for more reading material based on Kojima's works. Both volumes are available in paperback and Kindle editions at Amazon.</p><p>Speaking of which, Kojima also wrote a nonfiction book in 2021, titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Gene-inspired-creator-Stranding/dp/197472591X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Creative Gene</a>, which compiles his memoirs and essays on creativity, game design, art, and more. While it won't answer lingering questions about Metal Gear lore, it offers insight into his creative process and details important events from his life.

                <p>Annapurna Interactive went to Tokyo Game Show with three game reveals ready to go, and the results of its three-pronged showcase have resulted in an eclectic slate of upcoming games the company will be publishing. The team showed off a new puzzler in a strangely cozy dystopia, a turn-based RPG that's also part musical, and perhaps most interesting of them all, a game that looks quite like a Legend of Zelda sequel. Here's what you need to know about all three.</p><h2>D-topia</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up28VDHtDgU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/up28VDHtDgU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>D-Topia is described as a puzzle game in which you play the role of a "Facilitator" working at the D-topia residential facility. There, you'll address concerns of the residents while uncovering a secret at the heart of the AI-run society. The "perfectly happy world" that the game is set in seems to be nothing more than a facade, and it's up to you to expose the reality of the situation. D-topia is developed by Marumittu Games and it's coming to PC, Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox in 2026.</p><h2>People of Note</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXjlS7DLP4I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EXjlS7DLP4I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>People of Note is one part musical, one part turn-based RPG. Basically, it's the dream game for GameSpot's Jordan Ramee. Both the story and the game's combat mechanics lean into the musical aspect of the experience, giving players a big cast of characters who can belt out solos and beat down rivals. People of Note comes from Iridium Studios in 2026 for PC, Xbox, and PS5.</p><h2>Demi and the Fractured Dream</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWZHj4OraIA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xWZHj4OraIA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This is the one Zelda fans ought to circle on their calendars (if people still kept physical calendars, anyway). Demi and the Fractured Dream stars its titular hero, Demi, in a world called Somnus. Demi's quest has him chasing a means of escaping his "cursed fate" and is an ode to classic action-adventure games, with its hack-and-slash combat, environment puzzling, and an emphasis on its story and world. From the team at Yarn Owl, Demi hits PC, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox, and PS5 in 2026.</p><p>This was Annapurna's first time bringing news to Tokyo Game Show, but not nearly the first time it's revealed games I quickly wishlisted.

<p>Introducing Fire Emblem Shadows</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo's mobile game line has today been expanded with the shadow drop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zaha&amp;pli=1">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fire-emblem-shadows/id6746113513">iOS</a>.</p>
<p>This title is a spin-off of the main series and introduces a new style of battle featuring role-playing, real-time strategy and social deduction. According to Nintendo, this is a "free-to-start" experience, with optional in-game purchases available.</p>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect, courtesy of Nintendo's official Japanese website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gameplay of <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> combines real-time strategy and social deduction. One of the three allies participating in each battle is secretly a treacherous disciple of shadow. Players choose to take on the role of either a disciple of light, aiming to find their way through the labyrinth, or a disciple of shadow.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>After the initial battle, players vote to determine who they believe is the treacherous disciple of shadow. The outcome of the vote affects whether the next battle is more favorable or more challenging. Whether the disciples of light can correctly discover the traitor—or the disciple of shadow can successfully deceive the others—holds the key to how the next battle unfolds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This title is set to be available in more than 70 countries and regions, including Japan and the US. It also supports 10 different languages and has been developed in partnership with Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd and DeNA Co., Ltd.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-shadowdrops-new-mobile-title-fire-emblem-shadows.1307946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo's acting a bit sus, because this new announcement came out of nowhere. A social deduction game, set within the&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>universe? It's called&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>, and it's out literally now.</p>

<p>A press release from Nintendo Japan announces&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows,</em>&nbsp;a brand new mobile-exclusive title with role-playing elements, as well as social deduction -- common games in such a genre include&nbsp;<em>Werewolf, Mafia</em>, or much more recently,&nbsp;<em>Among Us.&nbsp;</em>It's out today, but as of writing not yet available to download on iOS.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250925.html" rel="nofollow">The press release</a> goes into little detail on gameplay other than that gameplay revolves around three players. Two players take the role as a "disciple of light" while another works against them as the "disciple of shadow." The ultimate goal is to traverse a labyrinth or uncover the imposter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The press release continues to be vague on the details, but it mentions an "initial battle" that, after completing, players will vote for the supposed disciple of shadow. Depending on if your guess is right seems to have an outcome on the following battle. Again, there isn't much information battles beyond that.</p>

<p>From a story and lore perspective, it will be interesting to see if&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>&nbsp;is set in the universe of an existing game such as<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fire-emblem-three-houses" rel="nofollow">Three Houses</a></em>, or if it's standalone and wholly original. The fact that there's an "imposter" reminds me of&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses' </em>own elusive group of imposters, Those Who Slither in the Dark.</p>

<p>It stands to reason it may be a part of the&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>&nbsp;universe given that the recently announced&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow"><em>Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</em></a>&nbsp;is set in the same universe, but we'll definitely find out more when it's available on&nbsp;</p>

<p>The press release says it is free to play, but there are in-game purchases, so cosmetics seem likely.&nbsp;The good news is, the release for&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>&nbsp;is September 25, 2025 on iOS and Android, so by the time you're reading this, it's probably already be out. I have word it's on Android already, so soon we'll all be diving into the abyss.</p>

That shared love and passion for the quintessential slasher is one of the many reasons why our team is so honored and excited to collaborate with Malek Akkad, Ryan Freimann, and Gun Interactive to bring the world of Haddonfield and the iconic masked murderer Michael Myers to players in the first major <em>Halloween</em> video game. We’re even more excited to partner with <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> to share our first look at gameplay and the official release date for <em>Halloween</em>.</p><p>From its earliest iterations, <em>Halloween</em> has been crafted to deliver an immersive horror sandbox experience that can be enjoyed through a standalone singleplayer story or dynamic asymmetrical multiplayer matches. We wanted to empower players to create their very own horror movie moments, whether they’re stepping behind the mask of Michael Myers or taking the role of one of the heroic residents of Haddonfield. Our team is working diligently to ensure this quiet suburban town is brimming with 70s-era charm and effectively serves as a virtual playground filled with innocent townsfolk that players can either save or slaughter.</p><p>As Michael, your goal is to find, stalk, and kill the residents of Haddonfield before Halloween night ends. While the aptly named “Boogeyman” lurks in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, the townsfolk NPCs are innocently living their lives, engaged in everyday household activities. In an effort to properly embody the personification of evil, players have the freedom to leverage the terrifying power of Michael Myers to creatively murder anyone unfortunate enough to cross Michael’s path. We’re offering a shocking amount of gruesome executions that are guaranteed to put huge smiles on the faces of horror enthusiasts like ourselves. We hope players have some fun with our interpretation of Michael’s inexplicable tendency to suddenly appear in completely unexpected places and catch victims off-guard with Michael’s “Shape Jump” ability as well.</p><p>Thankfully for the families of Haddonfield, our brave playable hero characters have a chance to thwart Michael’s murderous intentions and rescue their neighbors. As a Hero of Haddonfield, it’s your duty to warn those around you of Michael’s presence, convince the townsfolk NPCs to alert the authorities, and gather weapons and items that can be used to fight back against The Shape. With the right gear and some smooth-talking, you can even instruct the townsfolk to follow you to various points on the map, including a police-provided escape. For those looking to brawl with evil, it’s worth noting that while you can knock Michael down to buy precious time, he can’t be killed. However, with enough police presence, Michael can be detained.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When players dive into <em>Halloween</em> for the first time, we want Haddonfield to feel like a living, breathing game world. Our team aims to elevate the unpredictability and tension of each match through a series of dynamic map features, believable NPCs, robust gameplay options, haunting visuals, striking audio, and much more. We’ve developed several asymmetrical multiplayer horror titles and fully understand the desires and expectations of our players, and have been hard at work constructing something genuinely worthy of the intellectual property with <em>Halloween</em>. We’re also thrilled to offer a standalone single-player component to this package that allows players to witness key narrative events of “The Night He Came Home” through the eyes of Michael Myers.</p><p>It’s an amazing moment to present gameplay to the public for the first time, and we appreciate you all sharing it with us! While we’ve given players some pieces to chew on, it’s only a taste of what we believe is shaping up to be a truly special and murderous sandbox horror experience, and we’re looking forward to sharing more in the coming months.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Halloween Gameplay + Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bua7X-ClkgY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/halloween-game-launches-september-8-2026]]></content:encoded>
