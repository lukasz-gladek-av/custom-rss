			<p>A new Control update has gone live today on PC, introducing a new ray tracing preset, official HDR support, NVIDIA DLSS updates, and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://controlgame.com/control-march-2025-update-notes-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.30 update</a> brings to all users content that was previously available only as a pre-order bonus, such as the Astral Dive Suit, the Tactical Response Gear, and the Urban Response Gear, as well as the Dr. Yoshimi Tokui's Guided Imagery Experience featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima, which was only available as a PS4 Digital Deluxe Edition pre-order bonus.</p>
<p>Besides making pre-order exclusive content available to all, the new Control March 2025 PC update introduces plenty of technical improvements, such as a new ultra ray tracing preset which gets the user more rays per pixel and higher temporal stability, ultrawide resolution support up to 48:9 aspect ratio, updated SDR to 10 bits to reduce visible color banding, support for resolutions higher than 4K and more. Additionally, the new update also updates NVIDIA DLSS to version 3.7 with higher temporal stability and adds DLAA and arbitrary resolutions support, among other things.</p>
<p>The Control 1.30 update also finally brings official HDR support to the game, but <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-patch-for-remedys-control-just-dropped-adds-fake-hdr-despite-true-hdr-being-available-via-semi-official-mod.1129878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to online reports</a>, it only caps the overall brightness value without adding additional highlight detail, so the<a href="https://wccftech.com/control-unofficial-hdr-ultrawide-patch-version-1-4-brings-hdr-and-dlss-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> unofficial implementation</a> still continues to be the way to go for those with HDR monitors.</p>
<p>Control is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One worldwide. <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/">A sequel</a> is currently in the works, alongside a spin-off multiplayer game called FBC: Firebreak, which will launch<a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/"> later this year.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-sales-hit-1m-in-first-48-hours.1130133/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios' new co-op action-adventure platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone, the two studios have announced, and it only took the game a measly two days to get there.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Hazelight's Bluesky page,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>managed to sell a million copies within its first 48 hours, which is a pretty impressive milestone. Hazelight says it's "beyond happy" with the result and that it "can't stop enjoying [fans'] amazing reactions".</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s strong performance probably shouldn't come as a surprise given that it was EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-ea-second-most-played-game-steam" rel="nofollow">second most-played game of all time on Steam</a> just a day or so after its release, losing out only to battle royale shooter&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>(and I can't exactly blame it on that score).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-sales-1m-sci-fi.jpg?itok=kYAo-5hT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-sales-1m-sci-fi.jpg?itok=EV7NyvLS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has done pretty well for EA and Hazelight sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>For context, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-hit-1-million-copies-in-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">took around a month</a> for&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>to reach the same milestone. That game would go on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">sell more than 20 million copies</a> at last count, so it's entirely possible that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>will do even better for itself.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios.</p>

<p>Like the studio's previous games (with the exception of&nbsp;<em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em>),&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>can only be played as a co-op game; there's no single-player mode here, since the story and gameplay both revolve heavily around two individuals.</p>

<p>However, if you do happen to want to try out the game, the Friend's Pass <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">means you can play it with anyone on any platform</a>, whether they own the game or not (as long as you do, of course).</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

It's available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXvkb?object_uuid=dd9b580c-ead5-4882-b0b5-bf79e0f3a7d8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder now at the LEGO Store</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally spotted <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-new-lego-mario-kart-set-aimed-at-adults-has-appeared-online-ahead-of-an-official-announcement/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popping up on some store listings</a>, Lego has officially unveiled the set, which includes both Mario and his Standard Kart from the Mario Kart series. It's a detailed model, meant for display and decor, with a special stand meant to showcase Mario and his kart at various angles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-72037" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lego's site</a>, the company clocks the Mario Kart build at 1,972 pieces with a recommended "18+" Ages rating. This is due to the complexity of the build, it seems, and the intention of the product versus sets meant for play. "This building kit is part of a large assortment of LEGO Sets for Adults designed for people who enjoy hands-on creative activities to relax," Lego said in its description.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Here we go! 🏆 Launching May 15th 🏁 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOSuperMario?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LEGOSuperMario</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKart</a> <a href="https://t.co/NZ13sCIFHo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1899083988142092785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The tenor of this build certainly seems aimed at the older, "advanced" builder of Lego.

Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nuovo Award nominee </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an experience in movement and transformation across stunning,&nbsp;alien worlds that you're tasked with bouncing, flinging, and leaping through.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer caught up with Sam Atlas, the Nuovo Award-nominated game's creator, to talk about its surprising origins in body horror, the thought and design processes that go into shaping the game's colorful landscapes, and the challenges that come from creating visual accessibility features in a game that can sometimes border on visually-overwhelming with its shifting cosmos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm Sam Atlas! I did everything except the music and some other sound effects for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which were composed and recorded by DL Salo.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is my 4th standalone game and the follow-up to the</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Space Hole </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">trilogy. Before my own games, I made mods especially on the Source (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half Life 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) engine (I generally made level pack style single-player mods).&nbsp;I've got a background in general software, so I approach game development from a holistic/ synergistic approach (i.e. mix tech and design).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It started as a vague project called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flesh</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was going to be more of a horror game about an organism seeking humanity through the mechanical accumulation of human parts.&nbsp;It was a brain in a void, and the game would have been in first person, with real-life footage of hands/organs as the tools you use. These tools would be used to, for example, paddle your hand to swim the psychic-brain around.&nbsp;Accumulation and the imitation of humanity were themes; but it was more body horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity, chatGPT, VSCode, Blender (lightly for certain 3d), Unity ProBuilder (the majority of custom 3d meshes), Paint.NET, Davinci Resolve, Audacity, and my camera phone! I take videos/photos of natural patterns, such as waves or light reflecting on water, or fire, and loop those in the video editor (by flipping and tessellating the videos).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> explores many different forms of movement as you explore its dizzying visual landscapes. What thoughts went into creating the various ways players could evolve to move around? What made a form of movement feel interesting to you to include in the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One core design idea for the game was "a platformer where every pickup extends your range."&nbsp; The main design idea here was to begin stumbling—a speck of dust or a pebble rolling/shambling—and by the end to be a maximally-empowered platformer (i.e., fling yourself, drive up walls, hang in the air indefinitely etc). So, a lot of the form design derived from trying to find a middle ground between "can go anywhere" and "can only tumble along the ground."&nbsp; The name "Extreme Evolution" alludes to this: starting at the most basic (a clunky, oblong egg) and eventually the most obscene (Deity, a hovering orb that spits out projectiles that seek pickups and count as part of your body). "Drive to Divinity" is also a reference to this, and another literal description of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Movement often comes with unique shapes that feel alien, but also convey some of their capabilities to the player through shape and form. What thoughts went into making movement feel somewhat clear while also keeping things mysterious?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this, I think the key is to make the rules of the world consistent and to use visual cues to explain how objects interact. Furthermore, I have a short flavor text for each form, which, when combined with its name, was intended to convey some efficient expectation to the player. For example, "Cor" is "the oblong car," and it is both a corrupted motorcycle and a corruption of the word "Car."&nbsp; But as is the case in nature, the "Car" remains around in the world as well. I wanted the world to have a sense of logic and consistency to it, as well as a mix of earth-references and references that seem alien.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You put a great deal of thought and work into the visuals of your games, crafting this sense of moving through higher realities of color and shape. What feelings were you looking to evoke in the player with the cosmic visual work in this game?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My goal is to create an environment that you haven't seen before. I think the fun of the game is a repeating cycle of "what's over there?" and following intuition. I want to encourage the player to feel in control of their experience. I make games essentially by playing through them extremely slowly, making the levels in front of me as I go. So, whichever game I make tends to represent my feelings during development, or the feeling that I wanted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into birthing this whole new visual cosmic universe? How do you craft whole worlds to platform in that capture this sense of being otherworldly and alien through your use of color and shape?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Iteration, willingness to cut ideas/areas, and gradually narrowing the focus of my work as a level progresses. It takes many, many coats of paint (and sometimes major cuts) to make sure each zone has a good feeling.&nbsp; For this game, the whole overall thing was "playable" a year before release in an alpha form, but everything went through major revisions following that.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basically, I become more focused/editorial as I get deeper into development, but every level starts with some kind of simple idea (for example, "Thyroid" was conceived as "Jump," a delta where you are given many exits to choose between; the name "Thyroid" was chosen due to the geographical notion of the thyroid as a gateway to the body from the head). Sometimes, the name of the level is a remnant of that original idea and separate from the actual level (which sometimes is funny, so I leave it in). Often, levels become most extreme at some middle point in development—the most visual elements, the most pickups, etc. Then, over time, like a sine wave, I cut/uncut stuff until it feels right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges do you face in creating visuals that can be so powerful they border on overwhelming? What is it like to pore over these visions as you weave them together while developing the game?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I like to develop the game intuitively, so the border between "too much" and the right amount is always revealed only by the end of the project (but really, many years after).&nbsp;I also will sometimes revert to an earlier version but keep a single element from the newer (cut) revision, resulting in a hybrid that is mostly the old but with some specific improvement. I also have learnt to be sensitive (and un-offended) to the way people respond to visuals; people respond in a very specific way (they avoid playing) if it's making them nauseous, so I do mix my own feelings with the (sometimes visceral) player reactions. If you go too far everywhere, it also reduces the sense of change when entering spaces that are more or less intense.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You have put in some systems to help players who may have difficulties or health issues that are affected by the game's visuals, but they cannot be turned all the way off. What ideas go into balancing the need to protect the player with preserving the vital visual style of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution: Drive to Divinity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think of accessibility as a natural tool to make games better. I think it's absolutely a balance; another element of this issue (ensuring people don't have a physically painful experience playing the game) is to represent the game as accurately as possible in marketing materials. And, while you can turn lots of the effects off, there is a limit because I wanted to make sure every version of the game at least emphasized the separation of foreground and background.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using the Mod menu (unlocked about an hour into the game) you can go further into untested effects. However, because of the large amount of complex color correction, there are cases where turning an effect off might result in the ground and sky being too close in color. The major effect which produces nauseous feelings in my game is using uncleared buffers; this results in pixels which can change each frame as their behavior becomes so unpredictable. To balance this, I've tried blurring in the past, but now I use blur (and motion blur) as sparingly as possible because I find it tends not to be worth its nauseousness-to-budget, so to speak.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The representation of nothingness as infinitely-complex static feels too perfect and fitting for the game and the game's themes (nothingness/everythingness) to not be on by default in my mind, but I also have no qualms about the idea that some future playerbase might prefer it off. Ownership and setting your own goals is an intention of the game. I mostly focus on making sure the geometry of the level still reads and making sure the default modes reflect what I personally prefer when enabling accessible graphics options. I'm happier with how I've managed the accessibility features in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Extreme Evolution</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Space Hole 2020</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but it's something I spend a lot of time thinking about for future projects.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figcaption>Unforgettable Verdansk Teaser | Call of Duty: Warzone<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX2LeqDlkBg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzones-classic-verdansk-map-returning-next-year">return of Verdansk was revealed last year</a> - it's the original map for the battle royale that's no longer available.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-season-delayed-verdansk-return-now-expected-next-month">Activision announced a delay to Season 3 last week</a>, which was widely expected to include the Verdansk map. Now it's officially confirmed.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it's time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories 🪂</p><p>Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 💥 <a href="https://t.co/Ot7i77VOtd">pic.twitter.com/Ot7i77VOtd</a></p></div>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1899083215802904607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Verdansk's return follows a similar move from Epic with the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s classic OG map, which resulted in its highest-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours. It's now a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">permanent addition to Fortnite</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-is-doing-a-fortnite-and-bringing-back-its-original-island-map">PUBG also brought back its original map</a>, Erangel.</p>
<p>It's hoped this new season can turn around the fortunes of Call of Duty so far this year.</p>
<p>Ahead of the second season's launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">Activision stated it was dealing with rampant cheating</a>, acknowledging cheaters "are frustrating and severely impact the experience for our community".</p>
<p>Before that, the company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">accused of using "AI slop"</a> following artwork of a six-fingered zombie Santa. Then in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision admitted to using AI</a> in an update to the Call of Duty Steam page.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A concept album for the now-cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a> from the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> has been released by composer Lena Raine.</p>
<p>Back in January, Extremely OK Games cancelled its "2D explor-action" game, which would have followed up the widely celebrated platformer Celeste.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">first look at Earthblade</a> was shown in December 2022 at The Game Awards, but nothing has been shown since. As such, this new album from Raine provides a taste of what we could have expected.</p>

<figcaption>Earthblade - Game Awards Reveal<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafFds3Ppb0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Raine worked on the soundtracks of Minecraft, Celeste and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a>, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> and Chicory: A Colorful Tale.</p>
<p>Earthblade - Across the Bounds of Fate is available to listen to on <a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/earthblade-across-the-bounds-of-fate">Bandcamp</a> and can be purchased in full for $7.</p>
<p>It's typical of Raine's style, particularly with the focus on striking melody and a mixture of electronic and real instruments. The beautiful track Verdant Mysteries includes a strange vocal too, while the eight-minute long Lineage is a mesmeric piano piece and the opening Accept Your Fate begins with Vangelis-esque chords before a mournful tone takes over.</p>
<p>"[Earthblade] was in development for a number of years, and over that period of time I wrote quite a few pieces - both conceptual, and implemented tracks - that began to depict the world of the game," wrote Raine in the album's description. "Because we'll never get a chance to tell that story in game form, I decided to cobble together every bit of music I'd written for the game to the point of its cancellation in order to tell my own version of it.</p>
<p>"Across the Bounds of Fate, more so than a soundtrack, is a concept album. The music I wrote for the game is highly dynamic, in the tradition of what I wrote for Celeste. I took it many steps beyond, in ways that temporally-constrained pieces of music can't really do justice. But I did my best to arrange them into the emotional arc of their progression, much like I would for any soundtrack release."</p>
<p>Raine's inspiration includes the aforementioned Vangelis (best known for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>), as well as Joe Hisaishi's score for Studio Ghibli's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, and Yoko Kanno's work on animes Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell.</p>
<p>Said Raine: "For now, tuck in and enjoy around 30 minutes of music that paint the picture of what I hoped Earthblade might be."</p>
<p>Extremely OK Games studio director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-studio-cancels-2d-explor-action-game-earthblade-nearly-four-years-after-its-announcement">Maddy Thorson called the cancellation of Earthblade</a> a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".</p>
<p>One factor leading to the cancellation was a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste between Thorson and Noel Berry on one side, and studio founding member Pedro Medeiros on the other.</p>
<p>However, Thorson stressed "Pedro isn't to blame", adding: "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."</p>
<p>Thorson and Berry are now prototyping again for a new project. In the meantime, we have Raine's score as a lasting reminder of what Earthblade could have been.</p>
<p>"Melody encompasses so much of how I relate to music that it's hard for me to just write a piece that sinks solely into texture and rhythm. I do it, obviously, but I'm always humming something on top," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-composer-lena-raine-on-her-musical-style-im-a-big-fan-of-musical-metaphor">Raine told Eurogamer in a discussion about her compositional style</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of these apparently included a Scooby-Doo theme complete with mini-figures, sound effects, and an “incredibly elaborate” PowerPoint presentation.</p><p>“It was <em>Scooby-Doo and The Haunting of Merkmiss Manor</em>, and they had to go and figure out who the Merkmiss monster was, and unmask a bunch of local townspeople, and then clearly they weren’t the real villains,” he told Semafor. “It was evil Lyle Blackwood who was trying to steal the Blackwood fortune.”</p><p>It’s unclear exactly how much of that particular session was made with the help of AI, but Cocks said he believes AI is “supercharging fandom” and will be “a great leveler for user-generated content” in the future. He also sees financial upsides for Hasbro. Possible examples mentioned by <em>Semafor</em> are “subscription services letting other Dungeon Masters enrich their D&amp;D campaigns, or offerings to let parents customize Peppa Pig animations.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Cocks has praised the possibilities for generative AI in the toy and gaming space. “I’m probably more excited, though, about the playful elements of AI,” he said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://futurism.com/hasbro-ceo-ai-dungeons-dragons&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://futurism.com/hasbro-ceo-ai-dungeons-dragons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during a Goldman Sachs conference last year</a></span>. “I play with probably 30 or 40 people regularly. There’s not a single person who doesn’t use AI somehow for either campaign development or character development or story ideas. That’s a clear signal that we need to be embracing it.”</p><p>In the past, Cocks pointed to having ChatGPT help with scripts and Bing’s image generator create the art. It seems like it’s only a matter of time before Hasbro is trying to sell <em>D&amp;D</em> versions of those features directly to players. “We can leverage all of that to be able to build very interesting and compelling use cases for AI that can bring our characters to life,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/how-hasbro-is-jumping-on-the-game-opportunity-chris-cocks-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/how-hasbro-is-jumping-on-the-game-opportunity-chris-cocks-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said last fall</a></span>. “We can build tools that aid in content creation for users or create really interesting gamified scenarios around them.”</p><p>That philosophy appears to be on a collision course with the current official stance by Wizards of the Coast’s D&amp;D team, which currently bans the use of AI in generating final products. “For 50 years, D&amp;D has been built on the innovation, ingenuity, and hard work of talented people who sculpt a beautiful, creative game,” the team wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a 2023 statement</a></span>. “That isn’t changing. Our internal guidelines remain the same with regards to artificial intelligence tools: We require artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the D&amp;D TTRPG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final D&amp;D products. We work with some of the most talented artists and creatives in the world, and we believe those people are what makes D&amp;D great.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach is the sequel from the mind of Hideo Kojima. Its release date was finally confirmed, and if you want to hear more about the follow-up, we’ve got the main details you need to know.</p>



<p>Hideo Kojima springs to mind when I think of auteurs across any medium of media. He’s produced and directed games featuring over-the-top mecha combat, hallway-based horror, and most notably strategic stealth and surrealism. Death Stranding was arguably his most “out there” work to date, and Death Stranding 2’s release will inevitably try to one-up it.</p>



<p>With a stellar cast and even a curious homage to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solid Snake</a>, let’s check the latest on one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest PS5 releases</a> coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-coming-out">When is Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No words. Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach has a June 26 release date—making it one of the Summer’s biggest launches if it meets its announced release date.</strong></p>



<p>Originally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 was a rumor</a>. The worst-kept secret became official at The Game Awards 2024. Screenshots, trailers, and gameplay have been shown off periodically over the last several years, but a release date was notably lacking.</p>



<p>This was until Kojima Productions unveiled an official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 release date</a>. It was great news, and fans also got to see the full extent of the action title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-colelctors-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collector’s Edition</a>.  </p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-platforms">Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>A <strong>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach</strong></strong> <strong>PlayStation 5 exclusive launch is happening, with PC, Xbox, and any other platforms having to miss out for now.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a rare PlayStation-only launch. Exclusives are seemingly coming few and far between in 2025. Death Stranding 2 On The Beach can only be purchased on its June 26 release date for PS5.</p>



<p>But all is not lost if you’re a PC player without a PS5 console. The original Death Stranding was one of a few PlayStation-exclusive titles that eventually came to PC. Sony has made a habit of releasing its recent library of exclusives on PC—exposing titles to a wider audience, and making more money.</p>



<p>Meaning, <strong>a Death Stranding 2 On The Beach PC port is not out of the question</strong> a year or two from now.</p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-editions-amp-price">Death Stranding 2 On The Beach Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>You must choose between Death Stranding 2 On The Beach’s Standard Edition ($69.99/£79.99), Deluxe Edition ($79.99/£79.99), and Collector’s Edition ($229.99/£249.99).</strong></p>



<p>Look at each Death Stranding 2 edition below, and see which one is the one for you.</p>

<hr>



<p>Death Stranding 2 On The Beach is without doubt one of the biggest games (on paper) in 2025. Expect more to be added as it looks to shake the reputation of being a walking simulator. Are you picking up the sequel? What did you think of the OG Death Stranding? Let us know.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Xbox representatives have suggested that the console brand is due for a shake-up in recent months, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer stating that the next Xbox should be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/">more innovative</a>." A new report claims that the next console from Xbox might not be a traditional console at all, and that it might be targeting a 2027 launch rather than 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">On a recent episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAOt7CKUEFY">Xbox Two podcast</a>, reporter Jez Corden said that Microsoft's plans for the new Xbox are more akin to a gaming PC. He describes the machine as a "PC in essence, but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind." He further suggested that similar to existing consoles, developers will know what these specs are, so they'll be able to optimize their games accordingly.</p><p dir="ltr">Corden also poured cold water onto the rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2026-could-drop-last-gen-systems-and-make-other-big-changes-report/1100-6529841/" data-ref-id="1100-6529841">Call of Duty 2026 is being developed</a> with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/" data-ref-id="1100-6528636">next-gen Xbox in mind</a>, stating that he's heard that the new hardware is targeting a 2027 release, not next year. "The devkit talk is more about what kind of specs they've been told to target for the next Xbox," he said. "I'm pretty sure the new hardware is not 2026, it's 2027."</p><p dir="ltr">As always, these rumors should be taken with a grain of salt. It's unclear if this hypothetical PC-like Xbox would feature the more extensive non-gaming functionality that you get with a PC, such as work apps, productivity software, and more. However, this is far from the first inkling that Xbox is considering a drastic change with its next console. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfdz5alCu8g">a recent interview</a>, former Xbox executive Peter Moore went so far as to suggest that the console war is essentially over, and if given the choice, Microsoft would stop making hardware entirely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/creature-caravan-review-what-ride<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the wooden wheels of your cart rumble along the dusty earth, you look back in wonder at the caravan you’ve assembled. Strange beasts flap heavy wings in the air, a frog-man ambles along peaceably, someone’s riding a giant snail? Sure, why not! This is the wonderful world of <i>Creature Caravan</i>, a brand new board game designed by <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/11854/ryan-laukat" rel="nofollow">Ryan Laukat</a>, and published by <a href="https://www.redravengames.com/" rel="nofollow">Red Raven Games</a>.</p>

<p>Red Raven Games provided me with a review copy of the game when I visited their booth at PAX Unplugged, and now that the game’s back in stock I thought it would be the perfect time to dive in and see what it’s all about!</p>



<blockquote>
<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> Stats:</p>

<ul><li>1 - 4 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 60 Minutes</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Tableau Building, Dice Assignment</li>
	<li>Complexity: Medium</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> tasks players with competing to score the most points as they trek across a varied landscape full of strange creatures and dangerous Ember Zombies. As the name implies, players will slowly build up their caravan in the form of creature cards that they place by their board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-full-game-setup.jpg?itok=EMWnirWD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-full-game-setup.jpg?itok=bGAGFTN7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Trek across the plains in Creature Caravan!</figcaption></figure><p>After playing through multiple rounds of the game, players will accumulate points by traversing the land, defeating zombies, trading in goods for points, and adding creatures to their caravan. The player who scores the most points wins after 12 rounds wins.</p>

<h2>How Do You Play <i>Creature Caravan</i>?</h2>

<p>To play the game, you’ll roll five dice and assign those dice to actions on your board. When you start the game, you’ll only have a few options available on your tableau. You can assign dice to gain creature cards to your hand, gain resources, or battle Ember Zombies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=PSQrBrrL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=t9CCVtka 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The game board offers places to assign dice you roll each turn.</figcaption></figure><p>Where the complexity comes in is with the introduction of those creatures cards. As you add them to your tableau by paying resources to play their cards, you’ll unlock new slots to place your dice.</p>

<p>Placing dice in new slots unlocks additional benefits, like the ability to travel faster/further on the board, more attack to fend off Zombies, more card draw, etc.</p>

<h2>How Does It Feel To Play <i>Creature Caravan</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> is one of my favorite types of games: the kind that starts fairly simply, and slowly gets more crunchy and complex as you play. Because of this, it’s easy to introduce new players right into the action.</p>

<p>I really like the mechanic of rolling dice and assigning them to spots on your caravan (you can assign dice of a matching number or higher to its associated spot - in other words, a die roll of a 4 could be placed on a 4, 3, 2, or 1 spot on your board).&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-player-board.jpg?itok=X_qGNULZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-player-board.jpg?itok=Kes1QWuX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What starts simply with the above options soon blossoms into many different ways to spend your dice</figcaption></figure><p>I never spent a turn without at least a few interesting options in front of me, and as the game grew in complexity I ended up having <i>too many</i> cool things I wanted to do in a turn.</p>

<p>The only area of the game that feels a little less-baked than the rest of the game are the mechanics around Ember Zombies. These zombies show up when you arrive at various spots on the map, and place tokens on your board.</p>

<p>You can then add dice to slots to attack the zombies, which is really just another place to score points on your board. Of all the elements in the game, this feels least intuitive - though for my opponents who went all-in on attacking beat me pretty squarely, so maybe shows how much I know!</p>

<h2><i>Creature Caravan</i> Stuns With Its Art and Creature Design</h2>

<p>As usual, Ryan Laukat doesn’t <i>just</i> shine as a game design, but puts his artistic talent on display by illustrating all of the artwork for the game as well. It’s this artwork, I think above all else, that gives the game so much personality.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-map.jpg?itok=KC1iMi5v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-map.jpg?itok=CwXk-nWe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Move along the board with your caravan!</figcaption></figure><p>Set in the world of Arzium, which also includes Laukat’s games <i>Above and Below</i>, <i>Near</i> <i>and Far, Now and Then</i>, and the all-new <i>Arzium RPG</i>, this is a setting full of bright colors, quirky characters, an internal logic that pulls it all together.</p>

<p>Without knowing all the in’s and out’s of the world, I can tell this game is illustrated by a creator who knows his universe down to the smallest bug and largest lumbering dinosaur.</p>

<h2><i>Creature Caravan - </i>Let the Cards Surprise You!</h2>

<p>I have a hot take for new players: I do <i>not</i> recommend going through and looking at all the character cards before you start playing. I know some of you might be screaming right now about “open information,” “optimal gameplay,” and “combo effects,” but it’ll be okay! Hear me out:</p>

<p>I don’t think your first play through is likely to be optimized for the best combing of creature effects anyway, so going into the game and letting each new flip of a character&nbsp;card surprise you will add a whole layer of brilliant discovery to the game!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-creature-cards_0.jpg?itok=cIbi9I_6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-creature-cards_0.jpg?itok=izmtjD9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The creature cards add so much personality to the game!</figcaption></figure><h2><i>Creature Caravan - </i>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There’s a cleanness of design on display in <i>Creature Caravan</i> that allows the player to truly settle into the game before adding creatures to your tableau expands the horizon of options. As I’ve mentioned above, the length this goes to welcoming players into the game cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a game that let’s you roll dice (which we love, of course), plot movements carefully, collect a cadre of cool characters, and sink into evocative illustrations, <i>Creature Caravan</i> is the game for you!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steel-seed-release-date-close-to-the-sun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher ESDigital Games and developer Storm in a Teacup have announced the release date for their stealth-action game&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>, and it's coming next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC and current-gen consoles on April 10th. It's Storm in a Teacup's next major project after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-store-exclusive-close-to-sun-launches-may-2nd-on-pc" rel="nofollow">2019's&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>-inspired horror adventure <i>Close to the Sun</i></a>, although&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>isn't related to that game in terms of story or setting.</p>

<p>Instead, it's a post-apocalyptic stealth-action game in which you play as Zoe and her drone companion Koby as they explore a massive underground facility filled with hostile machines. It'll play out in a third-person perspective, too, as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Close to the Sun</em>'s first-person viewpoint.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steel-seed-release-date-stealth.jpg?itok=XbPpKfGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steel-seed-release-date-stealth.jpg?itok=Huwt-bP5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>is a stealth-action game from the makers of&nbsp;<em>Close to the Sun</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Steel Seed</em>'s world is "hand-crafted", according to Storm in a Teacup, and it'll present plenty of opportunities to discover the game's "immersive narrative" and "environmental storytelling".</p>

<p>While stealth looks to be the main tool in your arsenal, Storm in a Teacup is also promising "dynamic combat" against a range of enemies, as well as "challenging bosses" and three different skill trees containing 40 upgrades between them.</p>

<p>Koby serves as both Zoe's narrative companion and a helper for&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>'s puzzles, so I'm very much hoping this isn't a&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>-style situation where everything's solved for me. At the very least, if it is, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-puzzle-hints" rel="nofollow">let me turn down the hint frequency</a>!</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>, which gives a sense of the game's story and the world in which it takes place, right here.</p>




<p><em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>boasts the involvement of BAFTA winner Martin Korda, a writer and consultant in the industry who's worked on projects like&nbsp;<em>Destiny: The Taken King&nbsp;</em>and several&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>(now known as&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>) career modes.</p>

<p>Storm in a Teacup says the game will feature "an intriguing main character's evolution" and "a compelling and deep narrative experience" thanks to Korda's involvement. We'll have to wait and see whether those promises ring true.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/458430/Steel_Seed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010794/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nc-america-ceo-hopes-the-industry-and-her-company-is-on-upswing-after-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since the nascent period of online games in the late '90s and 2000s, publisher NCSoft and its massively multiplayer online role-playing games have been a mainstay. The company's one significant edge against competitors like Blizzard Entertainment's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was its focus on bridging the divide between Western and Eastern MMORPG audiences with a cross-continental portfolio including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lineage II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Aion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guild Wars 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As live service games have become increasingly high risk for the industry, the long-running publisher sees a path through the turmoil, with its sights on company expansion. In 2025, the publisher intends to double down on its live service business in the wake of layoffs and restructuring to reaffirm its position on the global market—all with a focus on its MMORPG pedigree.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Current CEO of NC America Jeonghee Jin said she hopes the industry—and the company—is on the upswing after laying off workers. According to her, NCSoft is recalibrating its approach to supporting Western game developers, with the hope of not repeating mistakes from years past.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building a new NCSoft">Building a new NCSoft</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While NCSoft has maintained steady success with legacy titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lineage II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guild Wars 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the company has struggled across other ends of its portfolios. During the 2010s, NCSoft made efforts to expand in the United States, but that ultimately led to the shuttering of the sci-fi MMO </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wildstar </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and its developer Carbine Studios, and the online music-rhythm game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fuser </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">from developer Harmonix (now owned by Epic Games). In recent years, it's laid off workers and underwent a general restructuring in late 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The last two years have been pretty bad for many game companies, including NCSoft, but honestly, I've seen cycles like this in the game business, and most other businesses," said the CEO. "We are always seeing these ups and downs, and especially right after the COVID lockdown period. We're now seeing a lot of layoffs and cancelations of promising projects, but I'm still actually very hopeful because I feel like we're kind of at the bottom of that cycle, and that a rise is happening."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2024, Jin was named CEO of NC America following her time as the former senior vice president and CEO of Pearl Abyss America, where she helped expand the reach the South Korean MMORPG </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Desert Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Since she joined the company, NCSoft has made numerous investments within European and Korean development studios for new IPs, including a new first-person shooter from Moon Rover and an RPG known as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breakers </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">from Vic Game Studios, respectively.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin acknowledged the publisher's past misfires, saying she joined the company with the hope of learning from its mistakes. "When I joined, I had a lot of thoughts on where we can do things with NCSoft," they continued. "This publisher has such a rich history within the MMORPG space across the Korean and western markets, and that makes it such a unique company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Going back to the '90s, NCSoft was one of the first MMORPG developers, and they've done a lot of experiments with trying to break through to other markets. Generally those titles have been doing great mostly in Asia, but to a lesser degree in western regions, which we want to work on more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There have been a lot of investments with NCSoft over the years, and a lot of experiments, and some of them went great, but others not so much. I think a lot of people only remember failures, but there are a lot of achievements as well which definitely paved the way for other Korean companies and Asian developers who wanted to go global. I feel very optimistic now as we invest more within the western market, which we see a growth opportunity for."</span></p><p>Image via NCSoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via NCSoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now in 2025, Jin is heading up the new NCSoft office in Southern California following a notable restructuring effort. According to Jin, her current vision for NCSoft is a publisher that releases modern games that are more approachable for wide audiences—which includes the online shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project LLL</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NCSoft will also lean into its steady successes within online live service games, which they still see growth potential in. Along with titles from Moon Rover and Vic Game Studios, a recent investment in Mistil Games and their upcoming third-person shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Time Takers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> show how NCSoft is heading into new territory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's good for us to have more diverse genres in the portfolio, and with NCSoft America and the Western divisions, we are now in a better position to bring these titles to a broader audience."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding success within the live service model">Finding success within the live service model</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The video game industry within recent years has been a volatile and challenging space for developers to operate in. With record layoffs and studio closures, studios are also juggling ballooning development budgets and expectations for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think there are still a lot of successful titles right now, and they're still being loved by so many players, and not really having a really negative impact on their communities," she continued. "So I see a lot of bright and some dark sides of the business right now. But I know we're going to see that rise once again, and we'll do it all together as industry comrades. I'm also really looking forward to all the projects that we are working on, so I'm very positive and optimistic about the future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin explained that NCSoft still thinks its central publishing role supporting a wide variety of studios has advantages over being a studio supporting one game. Live service games need "happy" players, and tracking player behavior can be a task that's too big for one dev team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It can be very stressful...for any publisher and developer working on live service games, they hear a lot of harsh comments and feedback all the time," she said. "But that's why a core publisher exists for [live service games]. A really good team has to support that and figure out how to engage the community and guide the game over time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For online games, the communities they foster can be a driving factor in future success. Along with maintaining a successful launch for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Throne and Liberty,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> NC America also has the western launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Blade &amp; Soul Neo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a visual and gameplay remaster of its popular martial-arts action MMO—aims for a "nostalgic" trip back to a classic MMO experience for long-time fans, and the type of game that NCSoft plans to spotlight in the years ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm feeling great about the current projects we are working on, like one potential project we are preparing just made me feel very optimistic about the future of NCSoft's business in the West, and I feel I have a clear vision about how I want to run the business at this point," said Jin. "In the first few months while I was here, I did a lot of studying and reflecting on the history of NCSoft—what did well and what didn't, and I talked to as many people as possible at the headquarters to figure out their perspectives about the Western regions and the growth opportunities there."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm in a very good place where I can plan confidently for our next projects—I feel good for what's ahead."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.
