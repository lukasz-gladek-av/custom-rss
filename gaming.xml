We're here once more to carefully open your digital missives as we open the door and put the little flag down on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>.</p>
<p>Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings. Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>It's November, which means games are being launched at us like T-shirts from one of those cannons we've only ever seen on The Simpsons. So let's crack on quickly so we can get back to cramming for GOTY a month from now...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - November 2025</h2>
<h3>"gramers" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, real talk. Grammar talk for grammar-conscious gamers: gramers.</p>
<p>Where do you stand on the use of ‘release’ as an intransitive verb? As in, “the game releases next month.”</p>
<p>It feels like it’s become increasingly popular over the last few years, even in official advertising, though I could just be growing more sensitive to it.</p>
<p>Most dictionaries list only the transitive use (“the game _was_ released (by Nintendo)”/“Nintendo released the game”), but that doesn’t seem to be holding people back from using the verb sans object.</p>
<p>Is this a new thing, or has it been around for as long as video games have been… releasing?</p>
<p>I consider myself to be more of a descriptivist than a prescriptivist, so try not to object to the lack of object. But I want to here you’re professional opinions on this mater as experiensed righters with a cute sence off prefect grammer &amp; speling, ect.<strong><br>
Maxz</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very good. That last sentence got me twitching.</p>
<p>I don't care for it. However, 'it releases' is so common, I gave in and use it myself these days. It doesn't sound unnatural to my ear anymore, and mixing it up with 'launches' gives some lexical variety.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the grammar police have larger problems with which to concern themselves. I'm currently playing whack-a-mole with 'addicting'. And let's not start on the true grammatical evil of our times, 'I could care less'... <em>*retches, weeps, withers*</em> <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"boulder-falling"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With "Close to You" as Nintendo Picture's first in house produced short film, I wonder if we'll see dormant Nintendo franchises rise from the ashes in the form of animations. It's a lot less of a time and monetary investment to make an animation, than it is to make a new AAA game. Nintendo could make short animations of dormant franchises to truly gauge interest on if a new game would be of interest to them. Imagine an F-Zero race fully animated to be as cinematic as possible or the Golden Sun boulder-falling intro animated like a Miyazaki film.</p>
<p>These are just a few ideas off the top of my head, but what would you like to see, and more importantly, do you think positive reception to animations could result in new games?<br>
<strong>Kazman2007</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a nice idea, but I don't see it happening. A cinematic F-Zero race would be awesome for four minutes, and then talk would <em>immediately</em> turn to the reason behind the short. "We just wanted to do something neat!" wouldn't be good enough for diehard fans. They/we would feel snubbed, duped, <em>trolled</em>, despite the cool F-Zero thing.</p>
<p>Pikmin is a going concern for Nintendo; they just updated Pikmin 4, all the other games are on Switch, and Pikmin Bloom is still trucking along. Even if they're essentially training exercises for Nintendo Pictures, they're not going to waste their marketing potential on IP you can't buy.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for a Rhythm Heaven short next year, then. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"every single box"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, Nintendo Life!<br>
Recently, due to its appearance on this site, I picked up Trails in the Sky 1st chapter, and I absolutely adored it. I'm on the next game in the series (on my PC, unfortunately.) and I really do feel like I found a franchise that checks every single box of what I love in a game. Fantastic OST, a giant focus on character interactions, a JRPG, general more cozy vibes, and I just love the characters and the world. The only other game I've felt like is made expressly for me isn't even out yet! (Hazuki Dies: She Has No Name on steam, check out the demo)<br>
Two things. First, thank you for featuring Trails the 1st on your website Nintendo Life! I really do appreciate it. Second, have any of y'all found that "perfect game series" for yourself? I'm curious.<br>
Regardless, thanks for what you do! I really appreciate it.<br>
<strong><em>Bluelink45</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we appreciate you, Bluelink! If it's done well, I can't think of a genre I flat-out don't like, which, conversely, makes picking out a 'perfect' series tough. Pikmin, perhaps? That has a brilliant mix going on, but really it's variety that keeps me going.</p>
<p>'This is a game about trauma' in the PR blurb is a <em>personal</em> red flag right now - I'm looking forward to when I'm not noping outta there for self-preservation purposes. Fortunately, variety is Switch's greatest strength, and Nintendo's forte is upbeat vibes and playful locomotion. Speaking of which... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"good guesses"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nintendo Life,</p>
<p>Been a member of this fabulous community for a good while now and this is the first time I'm writing to you folks. <i title=":smiley:"></i></p>
<p>I know you folks aren't Nintendo themselves, but any good guesses on when the next 3D Mario game would get announced/released for the Switch 2? The mainline Super Mario series is my favorite game series of all time and I'd love to see what kind of adventures await Mario on Nintendo's newest console. And yes I did play Donkey Kong Bananza - it's a good game for sure. But I really want that next 3D Mario!</p>
<p>Hope you're all having a lovely day.<strong><br>
D-Star92</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're all waiting for the next proper 3D Mario, but trying to predict Nintendo is a fool's game. Fortunately, I am that fool, so let's say <em>*peers into the middle distance while opening a tab on the laptop and looking at decades of Nintendo Direct dates*...</em></p>
<p>Wednesday 10th June announcement for a Thursday 10th September release. You heard it here first, folks! Pulled that one right out of my... mind. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="7703043cba3d1"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7703043cba3d1/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"lukewarm"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Mario Kart World Appreciation<br>
(Sorry if this letter is too long!)</p>
<p>I continue to be surprised by the lukewarm reception for Mario Kart World. The dismissiveness seems to come from people who aren't aware of the high skill ceiling and depth of gameplay. In a way, I understand the opinion, because I agree that plodding along the main path through a track like Salty Salty Speedway is pretty boring. The thing is, people who love Mario Kart World don't race that way. We are lining up for wall rides and rail combinations that often allow us to skip over entire sections of the track. Eventually, a racer starts to see water as an obstacle to be avoided (because it's slower than other surfaces) instead of as the inevitable path. Add in the strategic decisions about when and where to most effectively use items and which of the multiple routes is best for the moment and you have a game with a ton of depth and replayability.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Even though Mario Kart is a classic for casual gaming, I wish more people would take the little next step of really learning a track in Time Trials. First, watch the included Nintendo staff ghost to see the main shortcuts and understand how it looks to race a clean line. Once you can beat the staff ghost, if you dare, look at the ludicrous world record ghost to see just how high the skill ceiling goes. You start to see that you’re losing time with slightly sloppy corners and by overlooking creative turbo boost opportunities, not to mention the truly advanced moves like jumping off the track on turns to wall ride along the skinny edge of the road instead and chaining shortcut combinations that emerge where genius Nintendo track design meets ridiculous skill. (Did Nintendo design that crazy shortcut intentionally? You never really know!) There are levels to the skill ceiling and you start to see just how much risk and difficulty you are willing to take on in Time Trials and then also out in your other favorite game modes, too.</p>
<p>By the way, count me in among the fans clamoring for updates. I absolutely am hoping for more tracks, a dedicated mode for classic 3-lap races, and 200cc. The idea I've seen about more elaborate missions in Free Roam for things like unlocking new characters or tracks could be pretty neat, too. But goshdarnit, I love Mario Kart World already! It's given me stretches of gaming bliss that are becoming rarer as the years go by (to the point of nearly activating parental controls on myself after staying up playing until 2:00 AM for a third night in a row). Happy racing everybody!<strong><br>
Scott</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree there's oodles of depth and World will be my default Mario Kart for years to come - I just haven't played it in a while because of everything else!</p>
<p>And we're <em>definitely</em> going to be getting updates. I hear they sold quite a few copies of this. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"a level of fun"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m at the point where I feel I need to stop buying Pokémon games. I was looking at the flat, N64-level wall textures in Legends Z-A and finally, the veil has been lifted.<br>
I’ve been loyally buying Pokémon games as a habit throughout the whole series, and having a level of fun with them. Generally though it’s more just to play the new one because I played the old one. They have had very little innovation over the decades. This is the most profitable entertainment franchise in the world and comparing the love and effort put in to Zelda, Mario, and many others - not to mention indie games with thought and love put into every frame - frustrates me to no end. We expect so little from them and they respect their loyal fans so little.<br>
At this point, I won’t lose much by missing the next entry in Pokémon and I’ll be voting with my dollar.<br>
<strong><em>Barton</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-when-did-good-enough-become-good-enough-for-pokemon">'good enough' isn't good enough</a> for games like this. There's no shortage of software out there, and given the last generation of Pokémon games, you'll probably survive sitting the next one out and investing that dollar in a good handful of indie gems instead.</p>
<p>Or just wait a few months and see how things pan out. Being there day one to be part of the conversation is nice, but the games aren't going anywhere. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"excited for a Bubsy"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, I'm always a fan of a good redemption arc. Bubsy 4D is coming soon (that demo was actually fantastic) and it leaves me baffled I'm excited for a Bubsy game, but here we are.</p>
<p>Then again it's being made by Fabraz, who made the amazing Demon Turf (easy recommend btw) and are also making its sequel, Demon Tides, which looks gorgeous.</p>
<p>To a lesser extent, Yooka Replaylee just came out and the general consensus is pretty glowing.</p>
<p>Any good gaming redemption stories you can think of? Cheers lads. Happy gaming!<br>
<strong>Lewis</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cyberpunk springs to mind immediately. No Man's Sky, definitely (thanks, Jim). It can happen! There's still hope for Mighty No.9! Maybe when I get my 3DS code... <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Please Nintendo, Navi says "Listen!" But will you?" - <strong>YoshiTails</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>*takes out Airpods*</em> Sorry, what was that? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Just wanted to check in and see if you had a chance to consider our idea on enhancing home environments for better health." - <strong>Dennis</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah, you're alright, Dennis. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hey there! Just popping back into your inbox to see if you're ready to unlock the secrets of stellar data collection." - <strong>Randall</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in data from the cosmos or just really top-notch data collection? Dennis might have been off-topic, but at least he was clear. Please be more specific with your spam, Randall. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Machine Offers Equal or Better Performance Than 70% of Gaming PC Rigs, Says Valve]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-than-70-of-gaming-pc-rigs-says-valve.1355026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Out of Valve's <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three hardware announcements made on Wednesday</a>, the Steam Machine was undoubtedly the one that got people the most excited. Sure, Valve already tried and failed ten years ago, but the successful hardware launches of the Valve Index and, especially, the Steam Deck have proven Gabe Newell's company can do hardware really well. </p>



<p>One of the main changes compared to the previous Steam Machine iteration is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will feature a large selection of games</a>. However, Valve also needs to make sure <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the device has competitive pricing</a> while still delivering decent performance. In that regard, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkW3wTHT-p8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a video interview with Adam Savage</a>, Hardware Engineer Yazan Aldehayyat claimed the new console-like platform is comparable to or better than 70% of the user rigs registered in the Steam survey.</p>



<p><em>Well, there's looking at it from two different directions, right? The first one is that it needs to have enough performance to play all your Steam games. That was really important to us. We want it to be a pretty simple experience. You don't have to worry about, oh, I play these games. I don't know if it has enough performance to play these games. That was the first hurdle: we needed to make sure that there's enough performance in the Steam Machine that you don't have to worry about that.</em></p>



<p><em>But we also kind of wanted to target more of an entry-level device. We understand that affordability is really important, right? The price point definitely plays a huge factor into what performance level we're trying to target. Essentially, we kind of used those two directions to triangulate what we think makes the most sense. Another thing that we actually looked at is just the Steam hardware survey. Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at in terms of performance, and the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home. That's also another way to think about it where we kind of arrive at that performance level.</em></p>



<p>Still, based on the specs revealed so far, the hardware's performance could fall between that of the Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5, so don't expect anything extraordinary, especially <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-new-steam-machine-packs-just-8-gb-vram-is-that-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given the 8 GB VRAM</a>. In the video interview, Aldehayyat also confirmed that Valve did not bother to tune any of the silicon, using an 'off-the-shelf' chip. They did, however, customize the 'firmware and software bits' so that the Steam Machine would be optimized for the SteamOS environment.</p>



<p>With the platform slated to launch in early 2026, it shouldn't be too long before Valve provides more details, such as the final price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Citizen Hits 13 Years of Development & Nearly $900 Million In Funding, And It’s Still In Alpha]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-hits-13-years-of-development-nearly-900-million-in-funding-and-its-still-in-alpha/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-hits-13-years-of-development-nearly-900-million-in-funding-and-it%E2%80%99s-still-in-alpha.1355020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long road to Star Citizen’s full release looks to be continuing, as it’s been 13 years since the game was announced. We’ve checked back in from time to time, and the latest update is that Star Citizen is still in alpha, and it’s swiftly closing in on $900 million of crowd-funded money.</p>



<p>Say what you want, yes, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Citizen</a> actually looks like a quality game. On the other hand, it probably should do when it’s had the development time that many multi-game franchises get and enough money to fund several Hollywood-level movies. Cloud Imperium Games’ Star Citizen could end up being one of the most fascinating games of our time.</p>







<h2 id="h-star-citizen-approaching-1-billion-in-funding">Star Citizen Approaching $1 Billion In Funding</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is the game lost in space? Credit to Cloud Imperium Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Star Citizen has been playable since 2017. To be fair, it somewhat mirrors Escape From Tarkov, which was first playable in 2016, and eventually came out in 2025 for its 1.0 launch. However, there doesn’t seem to be anything similar planned for Star Citizen right now, and the team continues to work on refining the game and adding new content.</p>



<p>There does come a point where the lines are blurred between ‘early builds’ and a complete release. You could argue that a game can’t stay in testing forever, especially not 8 years of alpha testing.</p>







<p>Since it was announced in 2012 (13 years ago), as of October 2025, Star Citizen has accumulated <strong>$885,286,273</strong> in funding—At the time of writing.</p>



<p>It’s figured that Star Citizen is in the top 3 most expensive video games ever made. The data varies from source to source. The crucial difference here is that funding shows no signs of slowing down. We expect the space-based combat simulation game to cross $900 million before long, and unless the beta phase—or full launch is announced—the $1 billion mark surely beckons.</p>



<p>Let’s make it clear: We are not criticizing the game or its development. But it certainly is a curious case, and after we learned a few months ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-loses-integral-staff-responsible-for-server-meshing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Integral Staff’ responsible for Server Meshing</a> are no longer with the company, you have to wonder if this road ever has an end.</p>



<p>Have you played Star Citizen or contributed to its ongoing funding? Give us some insight: Why do you enjoy it, and what do you think the holdup is?

            <p>Ubisoft has told Anno 117: Pax Romana fans that it will be replacing an AI-generated loading screen image, insisting it had "slipped through" and had only meant to be used as a placeholder.</p>
<p>The Steam page for Anno 117: Pax Romana carries an "AI Generated Content Disclosure" - the first for an Ubisoft game - but that hasn't stopped fans complaining about the image, or insisting that they expect better from a premium game from a developer like Ubisoft.</p>

<p>The image, which can be viewed in full <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-ai-background-art-is-pretty-low-quality-unfortunately-v0-yi4z7xs7o11g1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D3399%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D2d42be908c532ce0df76c17431201e223ab81955">here</a>, shows a number of tell-tale signs that it's been generated rather than drawn, including disfigured or out-of-scale facial features, missing limbs, and strange set-dressing. A touched-up version is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-ai-background-art-is-pretty-low-quality-unfortunately-v0-jjptto1zr11g1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D2683%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc930b5ce57dcbe6d89cd4b02d4dc69af9a83d85e">considerably less jarring,</a> but some fans still take issue with the fact that it was based on a prompt rather than an original piece of art.</p>
<p>"If they are going to go with cheap tools in their game, I will wait till the game is cheap," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1ow3v75/comment/nonhwqr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one unhappy fan.</p>
<p>Another, leaving a negative review on Steam, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsAnny/recommended/3274580/">wrote</a>: "I don't want to live in a future where every big studio that very well could afford paying artists instead chooses to steal from artists by using AI generated images. AI tools are bad for the environment, bad for the job market, on top of that the images look awful, genuinely an eyesore in a[n] otherwise beautiful game."</p>

<p>Responding to <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399">Kotaku</a>, Ubisoft said: "This image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process. The final image is attached here and will replace the current version of this artwork with the upcoming 1.3 patch. With Anno 117: Pax Romana being our most ambitious Anno yet, we’ve assembled the largest team of artists ever for the franchise and to help meet the project’s unique scope, they use AI tools for iterations, prototyping, and exploration. Every element players will experience in the final game reflects the team’s craft, artistry, and creative vision."</p>
<p>And it's not just images that seem to have been generated by AI, either. According to some players, the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1onip56/german_text_localization_is_still_ai_generated_in/">text localisation is also allegedly "still AI-generated"</a>, too.</p>
<p>u/Taubenangriff posted a number of examples they believe were translated by machine, writing "nobody who has ever played an Anno before was let near translation work, and it is still AI generated slop to a large part. They got six million euros cultural (!) sponsorship from the German state, but the result is outright disrespectful to the German language".</p>

		<p>PIONER’s beta has ended and developer GFA Games has released an update on what players should expect next as part of the game’s development journey. First off, GFA Games has confirmed that anyone who took part in the open beta will get the “Combat Classic” weapon skin and 200 Efritan Crystals, which is PIONER’s premium currency, should they purchase the game when it releases.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Frontier" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGXEA0Exa50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PIONER open beta did have lots of issues identified by players, including progression saving bugs and server stability issues. On these issues, GFA Games said, <em>“The test build contained several critical issues, and we acknowledge that more thorough pre-testing would have resulted in a smoother experience. It is undoubtedly our responsibility to ensure player comfort. <wbr>We will not promise quick fixes, nor will we announce new content until these fundamental issues are resolved. Our top priority is to use the data gathered during testing to ensure the game runs stably at release. <wbr>Work on fixes continues with doubled effort. Thank you for staying with us and helping us make PIONER better.”</em></p>
<p>In addition, there will be a further PIONER stress test, but GFA Games has not yet confirmed when that will be. PIONER is an MMO FPS that has both PvE and PvP gameplay, with players free to spend as much time in either. On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. However, to survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand. The devs still have 2025 as a targeted release window but with only around six weeks until the end of the year, that does seem like a short amount of time to implement fixes and do a new stress test.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-%E2%80%9Cwe-need-regulations%E2%80%9D.1355008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Much of the Black Ops 7 discourse since launch has focused on the game’s AI usage. Activision has admitted to using AI in the creation of various art and materials in the game, and US Congressman Ro Khanna has issued a statement on AI use in general.</p>



<p>Certain gaming subjects leave us all divided. However, the use of AI is a fairly one-way street where opinions are concerned. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-accused-of-using-generative-ai-art-for-black-ops-7-calling-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision was accused of using AI for Black Ops 7 Calling Cards</a>. Amazingly, and to their credit, the company responded quite soon after the accusations became loud, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responding to the AI claims in full</a>.</p>



<p>The conversation is getting loud as even the US Congress is getting involved, to an extent.</p>







<h2 id="h-us-congressman-responds-to-black-ops-7-ai-use">US Congressman Responds To Black Ops 7 AI Use</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Does AI need to be limited, or removed altogether? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>American politician Ro Khanna (a Member of the&nbsp;U.S. House of Representatives) was quoted as saying: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. They should share in the profits and there should be a tax on mass displacement.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Interestingly, the message was used with a quote tweet of Pirat_Nation’s X message about the Black Ops 7 Calling Cards and AI claims.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 uses a large amount of AI-generated artwork across core assets (calling cards, posters, reward icons) instead of human-crafted art—despite being a major blockbuster title charging full price. <a href="https://t.co/vGbtG8NYM7">pic.twitter.com/vGbtG8NYM7</a></p>— Pirat_Nation 🔴 (@Pirat_Nation) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirat_Nation/status/1989339040945233984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Since all of this happened, Ro Khanna has been spotted reposting a CharlieIntel message about his response to Black Ops 7 AI, and the politician has gone one step further by posting a fresh statement on the controversy:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A company replacing artists with AI is not much different than one that replaces truck drivers. AI cannot just be for enriching tech billionaires. AI must be for us, not them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>AI use has become ubiquitous across all industries in the last few years. The gaming landscape has certainly been rocked by AI, and there’s a fear that too many talented artists and developers will be phased out in favor of AI. </p>



<p>We learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-developers-used-ai-extensively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Steel Frontiers developers used AI ‘Extensively’</a>, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexon’s CEO has defended ARC Raiders’ AI Voices by saying ‘Every Game Company’ is doing it</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2b568f8b1f0c9"><a title="Inazuma Eleven - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2b568f8b1f0c9/inazuma-eleven-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are back with this week's clash of the covers! Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>.</p>
<p>It was a trio of designs for the NES' <strong>Dragon Power</strong> that went head-to-head (to-head) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-dragon-power-nes">last time</a>, though neither the European nor North American artwork stood a chance against the eye-catching Japanese variant, which gobbled up 72% of the vote and left with the win.</p>
<p>This time, to celebrate <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Victory Road</a> <em>finally</em> making it to Switch, we're throwing things back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/inazuma_eleven">Inazuma Eleven</a>'s debut entry on DS. This is the game that kickstarted the football RPG series, complete with OTT abilities, a player roster as long as your arm, and the kind of professional-quality anime cutscenes that we always love to see from Level-5.</p>
<p>You'll have to wait a little while longer for our full Victory Road review, but until then, here's a match-up between <em>two</em> covers (it didn't arrive in North America until the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/inazuma_eleven">3DS digital re-release</a>) for the game that started it all.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:15013,193735 @ 1763298066 -->
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="ddcc8ce31a18b"><a title="Inazuma Eleven -" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ddcc8ce31a18b/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10834-inazuma-eleven">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We'll be the first to admit, there's a lot going on in this European design. Mark and Axel take centre stage, naturally, but a large portion of the cover is occupied by headshots of the other players you can recruit, accompanied by the boast that you can choose between over 1,000 of them. We like the football pitch stretching off into the background, but sometimes, less is more.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="137905c3429fa"><a title="Inazuma Eleven -" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/137905c3429fa/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/10834-inazuma-eleven">Level-5 / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese cover shoots for something different. This is all-out action. The pitch backdrop is replaced by a deep red, hiding the faces of some of the recruitable ballers. The central duo take more kinetic poses, and everything that isn't absolutely essential *<em>cough headshots cough</em>* is gone. It's as vibrant as they come, but there's no denying that it's eye-catching.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-mod-out-now-offering-up-to-2x-fps-in-cpu-intensive-scenes/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new Frame Generation mod for Fallout 4 was released yesterday <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/98208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Nexus Mods</a>. As you probably remember, modder PureDark released Frame Generation mods for Bethesda's open world RPG, first <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-dlss-3-mod-60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for NVIDIA DLSS</a> and then for AMD FSR, over two years ago. However, PureDark's mods are still locked behind the paywall of having to be a Patreon subscriber of his.</p>



<p>This mod, on the other hand, is completely free of charge. Created by doodlum, the main coder behind The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Community Shaders graphics enhancement suite, it is the modder's second submission after <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-gets-perfect-skies-graphics-mod-long-15-quest-mod-due-december-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Skies for Fallout: New Vegas</a> for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-modathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 2025 Modathon</a>, a Nexus Mods competition among modders that started on October 23 (Fallout Day) and ends on December 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Doodlum's Fallout 4 Frame Generation mod is powered by AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 technology, more specifically through the <a href="https://gpuopen.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly available</a> AMD FidelityFX SDK GPUOpen API, and thus uses a DLL signed by AMD. It works through a custom-made DirectX 12 swap chain proxy and is compatible with any DirectX 12-capable graphics card, which is not surprising given that it relies on AMD FSR 3.</p>



<p>The modder says Frame Generation can smooth performance in the most demanding scenarios, such as in cities. Moreover, mods like the popular Sim Settlements 2 can further increase the CPU load, making Frame Generation even more important.

<p>By default, the mod only enables itself when detecting monitors with a refresh rate of at least 120Hz; however, users can force it to be enabled in the .ini file.</p>



<p>The mod requires Address Library for F4SE Plugins and High FPS Physics Fix, and also for you to set Fallout 4 to Borderless or Windowed mode in the game's launcher. It is compatible with ENB and also with PureDark's free <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/68586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 upscaler mod</a>, provided you set the latter to DLAA or native AA. It does not, however, work with the VR version of the game, though that's not an issue since VR's spacewarp already provides a similar and more effective frame generation technique.</p>



<p>Fallout 4 just celebrated its tenth anniversary <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since its original launch</a> with the release of a new Anniversary Edition (which broke a lot of mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompting some users to revert to the previous version</a>). In other Fallout news, rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest</a> both a Fallout 3 and a Fallout: New Vegas remaster are in the works at Bethesda.</p>

<p>Use these Spin A Brainrot monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including a variety of Dice and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spin A Brainrot isn’t all that different from all the other brainrot-related games that have been trending on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> over the last many months. With the younger generation consuming more and more brainrot content every day, the likelihood of every brainrot game that comes out gaining massive popularity is quite high.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Spin A Brainrot does have a few minor differences, though, as unlike the other games in the genre, it allows players to acquire brainrot characters by simply spinning a Dice. That’s easier said than done, however, as Dice spins don’t come cheap in this game. To make the grind a little bit smoother, players can make use of the following codes. These codes reward players with different kinds of Dice, making it easier to acquire your favourite brainrot in no time. With items like potions and passive stat upgrades on offer as well, using these codes can help players get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday deals</a> continue to drop early. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH16KDQG,B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Physical versions of EA Sports FC 26</a> are available at a nice discount after only having just launched a few months ago.

The Switch version is usually listed for $60, while the other three are typically $70. You'll notice that Xbox versions of the game are absent from this list, as they aren't included in the Black Friday sales for the time being. While annual sports games don't typically hold value long after release, a steep discount like this so soon after launch is a welcome deal. The discounts only apply to the standard editions of the game, but the upshot is these versions include the digital pre-order bonuses. The Switch 2 version is notably on a Game-Key Card, meaning none of the game data is on the physical cart, so you'll have to download it onto your console before you can play.</p><div title="EMBARGO Nov. 16 12AM PT: EA Sports FC 26 Black Friday" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4900" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="EMBARGO Nov. 16 12AM PT: EA Sports FC 26 Black Friday" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">EA Sports FC 26 (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH132GYR,B0FH16HB7V,B0FH16KDQG,B0FH1NBZKC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$35 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 version of EA Sports FC 26 will definitely be the most stable in terms of performance -- It's able to run at a stable 60 frames per second in performance mode.

                <p>You can get Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Day One Edition for a small discount thanks to this early Black Friday deal at Amazon. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6SRFLCF?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6RSM3BB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> versions are both currently $40, saving you $10 off the game's original $50 price. This is the lowest price we've seen for the game, making it a good deal for a title that's only a few months old.

The Day One Edition bonuses are a nice inclusion to an already quality Soulslike experience. We scored the Soulslike action game an 8 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review-aint-nuthing-ta-pluck-with/1900-6418385/" data-ref-id="1900-6418385">our review</a> back when it released this past July. The game offers numerous customization options and multiple ways to engage in combat. Unlike other Soulslikes, dying plays a crucial role in both the mechanics and narrative in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, thanks to the Madness mechanic. You gain Madness by killing enemies or dying, and unlock different abilities the more you have. So instead of just setting you back and dropping some currency after you die, slowly build up Madness. At 100% Madness, you deal more damage--but take more damage, too--and if you die in this state, you'll be reset. It's a high-risk, high-reward system that sets it apart from other Soulslikes.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Batman Bundle Is $70 Off, Comes With $50 Amazon Gift Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-collector-bundle-amazon-deal/1100-6534680/">Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller</a></li>   </ul> </div>

They're the perfect opportunity for fans of the originals to revisit their old favorites with modern design sensibilities or quality-of-life features, and they aim to introduce new audiences to games that pioneered genres and gave rise to iconic characters. These Tomb Raider remasters achieve exactly that, offering the first six titles in the series. The Tomb Raider franchise jump-started the action platformer genre and inspired games like Naughty Dog's Uncharted games. They all come with updated visuals and performance enhancements in addition to their mechanical improvements.</p><p>For physical game collectors, both of these Deluxe Editions are beautifully packaged, and despite their oversized nature, they don't take up too much space. The height and width of the boxes are slightly larger than regular game cases, so they should fit on your game shelf just fine. The glossy gold and brown colors really help the boxes pop, and at this price, they are great premium items for any fan of the series.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Batman Bundle Is $70 Off, Comes With $50 Amazon Gift Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-collector-bundle-amazon-deal/1100-6534680/">Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>While the announcement already had many cowboys jumping for joy, in case you missed it, Rockstar Games has also confirmed this will be a completely free upgrade for existing owners. This applies to current owners of Red Dead Redemption on the Switch and existing PlayStation and Xbox owners.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nO48QYAS9Kg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnO48QYAS9Kg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed362f9fpgxhzk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>You'll even be able to pick up where you left off. Here are the full details about this from <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258282o585k1ka/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix-ios-android-ps5-xbox-series-and">Rockstar's official announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Current owners on PS4, Nintendo Switch, or the digital backward compatible version on Xbox One will be able to upgrade digitally for free. Anyone who owns the PS4 version can utilize previous PS4 save data to pick up where they left off, and Switch 2 players can continue with their previous save data from the previous Nintendo Switch console."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you already have the Switch release, you can update your copy when this upgrade rolls out on <strong>2</strong><strong>nd December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will come packed with the "complete single-player experiences of both games, and also include bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition". Additionally, it features support for DLSS, HDR, mouse controls, and "the same fluid 60 frames per second gameplay at high resolution".</p>
<p>In some other news, the rumour about <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a></strong> potentially coming to the Switch 2 has also resurfaced this week following the latest announcement – with the same podcaster and YouTuber 'NateTheHate' <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/11/14/natethehate-reiterates-red-dead-redemption-2-switch-2-port-is-still-happening/">claiming it's still happening</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of yet another week, and hopefully, you’re maintaining that NYT Connections streak. If you’re just starting out, I’m still here for you, providing the best NYT Connections hints you’ll find anywhere. Today’s puzzle is a trickier one in that respect, as very few of the words seem to relate to one another.</p>



<p>Regardless, I’ve got you covered with the NYT Connections solutions for today’s puzzle. Read on to learn what you need to know.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-16">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 16)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #889:</p>



<ul>
<li>RUGBY SHIRT</li>



<li>PEDESTRIAN</li>



<li>APPROACH</li>



<li>AVENUE</li>



<li>BARCODE</li>



<li>EVERYDAY</li>



<li>SCHOOL</li>



<li>TAX</li>



<li>IBM LOGO</li>



<li>BANAL</li>



<li>RAILROAD</li>



<li>PHILOSOPHY</li>



<li>HUMDRUM</li>



<li>ZEBRA</li>



<li>METHOD</li>



<li>PARKING</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about the way someone “goes about” something, not the thing itself.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>This set sits firmly in the realm of routine and low sparkle.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Don’t just look for animals—think design language and uniform aesthetics.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Zero in on square names, board events, and charges you might encounter while circling the track.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 16.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-16-889">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 16 (#889)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– APPROACH, METHOD, PHILOSOPHY, SCHOOL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BANAL, EVERYDAY, HUMDRUM, PEDESTRIAN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BARCODE, IBM LOGO, RUGBY SHIRT, ZEBRA</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – AVENUE, PARKING, RAILROAD, TAX</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lg-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-its-240hz-34-inch-curved-oled-monitor-now-at-new-all-time-low-2000644620</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg%E2%80%99s-240hz-34-inch-curved-oled-monitor-goes-at-new-all-time-low-black-friday-has-started-early.1354942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s always been a given that gaming monitors come with a high price tag, especially when you’re talking about OLED technology with specs that push the limits of what’s possible. LG’s 34-inch Ultragear has been the reference point for serious gamers, but its $1,399 price kept it out of reach for many enthusiasts. Amazon just drastically upended that equation by dropping this curved beast down to $679, or nearly half off the original price. This all-time low opens up premium OLED gaming to a much wider audience who have been just looking for the right moment to improve their screens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5610/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Curve Meets Speed</h2>
<p>This<strong> 34-inch display features an 800R curvature</strong> that aggressively wraps around your field of view compared to most other curved monitors you might have laid eyes on. LG steepened the curve enough to draw in peripheral vision into the action for an immersive experience not possible with flat-screen monitors. The curve works a treat in racing games or flight simulators where spatial awareness counts. You’ll notice how the edges of the screen stay within your natural viewing angle without requiring constant head movement.</p>
<p>The <strong>OLED panel delivers perfect blacks</strong> because each pixel can turn off completely and creates an infinite contrast ratio in practice. LG rates this at 1.5 million to one, but the real-world impact is in dark game scenes where you can actually distinguish details in shadows. The 1300-nit peak brightness might sound excessive, but it makes HDR content truly pop with highlights that leap off the screen.</p>



<p>The anti-glare coating does a great job <strong>with ambient light for an OLED display</strong>; you can game during the day without fighting reflections from windows or overhead lights. The 3<strong>440 x 1440 resolution gives you 34% more pixels than standard 1440p displays</strong>&nbsp;while the 21:9 aspect ratio expands your horizontal view in supported games. This ultrawide format is particularly great in competitive shooters where you can see more of the battlefield and that will give you an edge</p>
<p>It pushes four times more frames per second <strong>at 240Hz</strong> than the standard 60Hz monitors. This makes quite a difference in fast-paced games in which split-second reactions often make a lot of difference. You notice the difference clearly in the moments of fast panning of the camera or tracking fast-moving objects across the screen. With a <strong>response time of 0.03ms</strong>, you get almost zero motion blur or ghosting during rapid movements.</p>
<p>Both <strong>AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility</strong> ensure that your gameplay will be silky smooth. These technologies synchronize your GPU’s frame output with the monitor’s refresh rate, thereby eliminating screen tearing and stuttering. You can push frame rates above 200 fps in esports titles and still maintain perfect visual fluidity.</p>
<p>Cloud gaming services such as Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna and Blacknut run directly from the monitor. You’ll be able to experience demanding game titles without the need for expensive hardware but with a good internet connection and a controller. The USB Type-C port also provides 65W of power delivery so you can charge your laptop while using the monitor as a display.</p>
<p>There is more than one HDMI 2.1 port on this monitor with support f<strong>or complete 4K at 120Hz from both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles</strong>. You get the full next-generation console experience with variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode working without a hitch. Basic audio is taken care of by onboard speakers, but serious gamers will want dedicated headphones or external speakers for the best sound.</p>
<p>This is a new all time low price on Amazon, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Fans Have Strong Opinions on Black Ops 7 Campaign]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-reddit-reactions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-fans-have-strong-opinions-on-black-ops-7-campaign.1354912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With Black Ops 7 now on the market, Call of Duty fans have expressed their opinions on the game’s campaign. However, the reactions are a bit underwhelming than what they expected.</p>







<p>In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the campaign brings the series back to the Mason family, particularly David. The family, which was featured from Black Ops to Black Ops 2, has taken a back seat until now. With Black Ops 7, the campaign, fully multiplayer, takes players on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nightmare-induced fever dream</a> where the team, including David, confronts Menendez and The Guild. Compared to other titles, especially last year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-ops-6-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, it’s a bit of a crazy one. As you can expect, some have some strong opinions, good and bad, about how things were handled.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-campaign-garbage-lackluster-says-call-of-duty-fans">Black Ops 7 Campaign ‘Garbage’, ‘Lackluster’, Says Call of Duty Fans</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since Black Ops 7’s release, the Call of Duty Reddit has been going through the motions, in a way. The reactions towards the game have ranged from hot garbage to series-best. However, there is a common thread between them: the game’s co-op campaign is not great. In a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/cod_the_warzonification_and_zombification_of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AdBudget5468</a>, the user argues that the success of other modes like Zombies and Warzone have ‘ruined’ campaigns, with Black Ops 7 being a prime example. </p>



<p>In the comments, many fans expressed the same reaction. For some, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novr5x3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Solid_Snek120</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/noxcdq6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shadowdemon210</a>, it feels reminiscent of 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, which had a very controversial campaign. Others, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novtolj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Top_Limit_</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/nowr2da/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SetScary9216</a>, brought up how polished Black Ops 6’s campaign was and how Black Ops 7’s just doesn’t match up. </p>



<p>Currently, the game isn’t doing as hot as Activision may like. As it stands, Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t even reached 100k</a> while rival shooters ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 still get over 200k and even 300k on Steam. Despite this, the title will likely sell well, though it’s unknown just how well compared to other entries. Hopefully, as someone who enjoys the campaign, the next games can take from Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare and craft something all can enjoy without being a ploy to earn a battle royale mode.</p>







<p>What do you think of Black Ops 7’s campaign? Is it as bad as people said? Worse? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

              <p>Gas generators solve power outages but fill your garage with fumes, wake the neighbors with engine noise and require constant fuel runs that get expensive fast. Portable power stations eliminate all those headaches while delivering clean electricity that works safely indoors during winter storms when you need heat, light, and charged devices the most.</p>
<p>The good news is that the <strong>Jackery Explorer 2000 v2</strong> just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/">dropped to an all-time low of $699 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,499 price</a>. This massive 2042Wh battery costs roughly what budget gas generators do, except it runs silently, produces zero emissions and charges from wall outlets or solar panels.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Crushes Gas Generator Alternatives</h2>
<p>Jackery Explorer 2000 v2 is capable of providing <strong>up to 2200W continuous power via three AC outlets</strong>, and runs multiple appliances at the same time during outages or off-grid. That wattage capacity will run space heaters, electric blankets, mini fridges, laptops, and medical equipment all at once without overloading the system. The 2042Wh translates into real-world runtime that matters during extended winter power outages, keeping a typical space heater running for about four hours and charging laptops 30 times over.</p>
<p>Jackery engineered this unit using Cell-to-Body technology borrowed from electric vehicle manufacturing. CTB optimizes internal space by incorporating battery cells directly into the structural frame. This design approach minimizes wasted space and unnecessary materials, so this massive-capacity power station weighs just 39.5 pounds. That’s a <strong>41% weight reduction and 34% size decrease compared to typical 2kWh LiFePO4 power stations</strong> from competitors.</p>



<p>The secret to differentiating this Jackery from its slower competitors is multiple fast-charging pathways that get you back to full power quickly. Wall outlet AC charging <strong>pushes the battery from zero to 80% in just 66 minutes</strong> and gives you usable power fast when storms approach and you’re racing to prepare. The Emergency Super Charging mode accessible through Jackery’s smartphone app completes a full charge in 102 minutes; this accelerated charging generates more heat and should be reserved for genuine emergencies, though.</p>
<p>Silent Charging mode charges the battery to full capacity in five hours <strong>at whisper-quiet 30dB noise levels</strong> which is quieter than a library or a bedroom at night. This mode proves invaluable for overnight charging sessions where you may be trying to sleep or work without distraction from fan noise. The smart temperature control system constantly monitors internal component temperatures and automatically adjusts cooling fan speeds based on actual thermal load rather than operating fans at maximum speed regardless of conditions.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB-C PD 100W port charges laptops, tablets, and phones</strong> at the maximum possible speed, without separate power adapters that you’d otherwise need to plug into the AC outlets. Two more USB-A ports and a 12V car port handle smaller devices and accessories efficiently. The pure sine wave AC output protects sensitive electronics from the power quality issues that modified sine wave inverters create, and allows safe operation of everything from computers to medical equipment.</p>
<p>For $699, you’re paying budget gas generator prices for clean, quiet, indoor-safe power that charges multiple ways and lasts a decade.</p>

<p>In August, XSEED Games announced the <strong>Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack</strong> was coming "exclusively" to the Nintendo Switch in 2025. This pack was set to include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/corpse_party">Corpse Party</a> (2001), <strong>Book of Shadows</strong>, <strong>Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Base</strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/corpse_party_blood_drive">Blood Drive</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Now, though, it's been cancelled in the west. Multiple games in this pack did not comply with the "current platform guidelines". This has resulted in the physical version of this pack (and digital offerings of previously unreleased titles) being axed. The publisher did not elaborate on this, but it's not the first time something like this has happened with an upcoming Switch release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wgoquk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the official update about this via the XSEED Games social media account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corpse Party fans:</p>
<p>We know how much you were anticipating the release of Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack. Though we previously released entries in the Corpse Party series on console platforms and digital storefronts in the West, we were informed that the contents of several games in the Tetralogy Pack did not comply with current platform guidelines. As a result, we are unable to release these games as intended and have subsequently canceled the physical release of Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack, as well as the digital offerings of previously unreleased Corpse Party games featured in the Tetralogy Pack.</p>
<p>We apologize for any confusion and disappointment this may have caused. We remain committed to working with our partners at MAGES to bring Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion to the West and will share more details on its release when we can. Thank you for your understanding and continued support of XSEED Games and the Corpse Party franchise.</p>

<p>As noted, XSEED still aims to work with MAGES to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/corpse_party_ii_darkness_distortion">Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion</a> locally in the future, so if there are any updates about this, we'll let you know.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-dumps-its-vostro-1tb-laptop-for-70-off-now-selling-for-what-generic-budget-laptops-cost-2000644605</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-dumps-its-vostro-1tb-laptop-for-70-off-now-selling-for-what-generic-budget-laptops-cost.1354876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptop shopping is overwhelming when you’re staring at options ranging from $200 Chromebooks that barely function to $3,000 premium machines loaded with specs you’ll never use. Most people just need something reliable for everyday tasks like web browsing, document work, video calls and media streaming. The Dell Vostro 15″ <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5607/">1TB model just crashed to an all-time low of $599 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,999 sticker</a>, and this 70% discount puts a brand-name business laptop at literally the same price point as generic budget machines.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5607/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Value for Money Laptop</h2>
<p>The Vostro 3530 is powered by Intel’s 13th Generation Core i3-1305U, a five-core chip with one performance core and four efficiency cores. It divides the workload smartly between those efficiency and performance cores, depending on how demanding the task is. The performance core <strong>runs at a turbo frequency of as much as 4.5GHz for resource-intensive tasks</strong> such as video editing or a heavy spreadsheet while the efficiency cores do the background work without consuming much power to give you extended battery life.</p>



<p>Dell equipped this laptop with a <strong>massive 32GB of DDR4 RAM, placing it firmly in the realm of a professional workstation</strong> rather than basic consumer laptop specs. That amount of memory lets you run dozens of Chrome tabs, have multiple Microsoft Office documents open, stream background music, host video calls, and still have some headroom left over. Students can research papers with innumerable reference tabs open alongside writing in Word and chatting on Discord without their system choking.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD is plenty to store years</strong> of documents, photos, and videos, and apps in a way that doesn’t require you to live in constant file management or cloud storage subscriptions. Modern SSDs like this one access data at speeds that make traditional hard drives seem prehistoric: they boot Windows 11 Pro within seconds of start-up and load programs almost instantly.</p>
<p>That<strong> 15.6-inch Full HD display refreshes at 120Hz</strong> instead of the more common 60Hz seen on most budget laptops, and it makes motion noticeably smoother as you scroll through documents, web pages, or video content. In practice, that doubled refresh rate reduces eye fatigue during long work sessions because the subtle flicker and stuttering common with lower refresh displays are gone. The anti-glare coating and 250-nit brightness let you work near windows without reflections destroying visibility, while the narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without increasing the laptop’s physical footprint.</p>
<p>With it, <strong>you get Windows 11 Professional pre-installed</strong> rather than the Home edition found on consumer laptops, offering extra security features, remote desktop capability, and business-focused tools that matter for professional environments. The Pro edition supports BitLocker encryption for protecting sensitive data, domain joining for corporate networks, and advanced group policy controls needed by IT departments.</p>
<p>Connectivity options fill both modern and legacy needs with a practical mix of ports. A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C handles fast data transfers and can connect to modern docks and displays, while traditional USB-A ports ensure the existing peripherals work without adapters. The RJ-45 Ethernet port provides you with dependable wired network connections that surpass WiFi in stability and speed in a home office or dorm room. External monitors or projectors are connected via HDMI 1.4 output for presentations and expanded workspaces.</p>
<p>You’re getting here 32GB RAM, 1TB storage, a 120Hz display, and Windows 11 Pro for $599, which is what most people pay for basic 8GB Chromebooks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-controllers-see-their-first-major-black-friday-deal-now-selling-for-new-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000644601</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-controllers-see-their-first-major-black-friday-deal-now-selling-for-new-all-time-low-on-amazon.1354870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First major Black Friday deals just landed on Amazon and Xbox controllers finally joined the discount party with their deepest price cut ever. Gaming controllers take a beating from intense button mashing, thumbstick abuse and the occasional rage-induced floor meeting so having a backup or upgrade becomes essential rather than optional.</p>
<p>The Xbox wireless gaming controller in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Carbon Black just hit an all-time low of $49 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $64 price</a>, and over 20,000 people grabbed one this month as stock moves incredibly fast. This 2025 model works across more devices than any previous Xbox controller which makes it useful beyond just console gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cross-Platform Gaming</h2>
<p>Microsoft designed this controller with universal compatibility extending well beyond the Xbox consoles, wirelessly <strong>connecting to Windows PCs, Android phones and tablets, iOS devices, FireTV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong>. This means that you buy one quality controller and use it everywhere, rather than having different gamepads for every different platform you own.</p>
<p>That <strong>Bluetooth connection rapidly pairs with any device</strong> it’s hooked up to, which sidesteps the clutter of dongles and adapters found with older controllers. You can easily toggle between playing Halo on your Series X, streaming games on your phone during your lunch break and changing media on your Fire TV Stick without juggling multiple remotes or controllers.</p>



<p>The ergonomic design refines the proven Xbox controller shape that’s felt natural in gamers’ hands for over two decades with subtle improvements to grip texture and button placement. The textured surfaces on the triggers, bumpers and back casing provide a secure grip even during sweaty gaming sessions or when your hands get slick from snacks. Microsoft positioned the buttons and thumbsticks at distances that reduce hand fatigue during extended play, so you can game for hours without developing cramping or soreness in your thumbs and fingers.</p>



<p>The hybrid D-pad delivers accurate input for fighting games, platformers and any title that requires precise directional commands. This design marries the best aspects of traditional cross-shaped D-pads with the faceted style that most hardcore fighting game players prefer, providing you with tactile feedback for each direction press without mushy or ambiguous inputs. You’ll nail complex move combinations and rapid direction changes more consistently compared to cheaper controllers with spongy or imprecise directional pads.</p>
<p>Textured grips on the triggers and bumpers improve control in those split-second moments of intense gaming that determine victory or defeat. The triggers feature smooth analog travel that works perfectly for racing games where gradual acceleration and braking come into play, while also providing crisp digital clicks for shooters that need instant fire response.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life runs on two AA batteries that are expected to give about 40 hours of gameplay</strong> before needing replacement, giving you weeks of casual gaming or several marathon weekend sessions between battery swaps. The AA battery design lets you choose between disposable batteries for convenience or rechargeable batteries for cost savings and environmental benefits in the long term. You can also connect the controller via USB-C cable for wired play that eliminates any potential wireless latency while simultaneously charging rechargeable batteries if you’re using them.</p>
<p><strong>The 3.5mm headset jack</strong> connects any wired gaming headset directly, thereby routing game audio and chat through your headphones without the need for separate dongles or adapters. This direct connection reduces the audio latency compared to wireless headsets and gives you instant sound feedback, which helps in competitive gaming when hearing the enemy’s footsteps or gunshots a fraction of a second earlier provides strategic advantages.</p>
<p>At $49, you get Microsoft’s official controller quality for less money than most third-party alternatives that lack build quality or platform support.</p>

            <p>
I'm not sure I've ever been so quickly transported back in time than I have in I Write Games Not Tragedies. It's not that I completely relate to what takes place in the game, but its sense of place, of atmosphere and feeling, is one I understand in my soul. The emo amongst you have probably already caught on to the vibe with its title, and for those of you that haven't, the game's aesthetics, writing, and soundscape certainly will.
</p>
<p>
Set in some nowhere British town in the distant past of 2009, you play as Ash, a babby goth who thinks everything in his life is unbearably terrible, and that everyone around him is insufferable and deserving of his (internally narrated) belittlement. The popular kids are much too popular, his parents won't let him hang out on the roof in the rain, and of course there's school, yuck! No one understands him, but when he puts on his red Skullcandy headphones (what a throwback), he can escape into the world of music… which is where this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> game morphs into a rhythm game, uh, game.
</p>
<p>
Now, this isn't a revolution of rhythm game mechanics. There are three buttons to tap, and you must time your taps to certain words in the lyrics of whatever song is playing. You can jam out at certain moments, but in the demo I couldn't get that to work, a point I'm sure could be solved with some updated tutorialisation.
</p>
<p>
I'm not particularly bothered by the fairly lackluster rhythm mechanics because of the ways it commits to itself in so many other ways. The soundtrack, for one, is composed of tracks from indie punk artists from the UK, Japan, and Hong Kong, which itself is a thematically appropriate commitment to make. The backgrounds look like they were made on Paint circa 2009 (complementary), but there are also cringey anime drawings of Ash's classmates, as well as some of his himself where he looks much too cool. This pencilly, sketchy, crayony vibe translates to certain bits of character art too, albeit a bit more refined, and very much in the vein of something like Scott Pilgrim.
</p><p>
That feeling of cringe permeates a lot of the demo, and presumably the rest of the game. Ash kind of sucks, specifically in the way that teenagers sucked in the late 2000s. He drinks WKD at some canal with a boy he clearly has a crush on, a drink so notoriously unable to get you drunk unless you are literally 14, and one anyone would be mocked for drinking as an adult. I was not Ash, but I've known Ash, and I have cringed at Ash.
</p>
<p>
In the years since knowing my own Ash, or Ashes I supposed, I've since acquired some rose tinted goggles thick enough that at least allow me to look back on such a time and chuckle a little bit, even if it's also a bit embarrassing to think about. That same feeling comes through in I Write Games Not Tragedies, and that might not be for everyone. If you've ever listened to My Chemical Romance and you grew up in some nowhere British town, however, you probably owe it to yourself to give it a go.
</p>
<p>
I Write Games Not Tragedies is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3396670/I_Write_Games_Not_Tragedies/">available on Steam now</a>.

              <p>Virtual reality stopped being a futuristic fantasy the moment Meta cracked the code on affordable and high-quality headsets that actually work without a gaming PC tethered to your head. The <strong>Quest 3S brings premium VR experiences at a fraction of what you’d expect to pay</strong>, and Amazon just dropped both storage configurations to record-low prices for early Black Friday: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">128GB model (including a Gorilla Tag bundle) now costs $249 instead of $299</a>; and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the 256GB version (including Batman: Arkham Shadow) sits at $329 down from $399</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Quest 3S Destroys the Value Competition</h2>
<p>Meta equipped the Quest 3S with the same core processor inside the flagship Quest 3 <strong>and offers you identical graphical processing capability for significantly less</strong>. That Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip boasts double the GPU performance of the Quest 2 for rendering virtual environments with sharper textures, smoother frame rates and more complex objects.</p>
<p>The Quest 3S runs <strong>entirely wireless and frees you from the cable management nightmares that plague PC VR setups</strong>. You simply charge the headset, put it on, and jump into experiences without configuring external sensors or worrying about tripping over cords mid-game. This standalone design means you can play in your living room or even outside if you want with the h<strong>eadset tracking your movements</strong> through built-in cameras and sensors. Battery life typically gives you<strong> two to three hours of active play</strong> before needing a recharge which feels about right for VR sessions before eye strain sets in anyway.</p>



<p>Both bundles include<strong> immediate access to more than 40 games</strong>&nbsp;and avoids the sticker shock of buying a headset only to find out you’ll have to spend another hundred bucks on software. The 128GB version includes an exclusive Gorilla Tag bundle, while the 256GB model throws in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>, along with a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+, which unlocks even more premium titles.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing that’s become a cultural phenomenon in VR, it’s Gorilla Tag, which lets you swing through environments using only arm movements in a shockingly physical workout disguised as a game. Batman: Arkham Shadow is a full-fledged superhero adventure built specifically for VR with hand-to-hand combat and detective work that feels genuinely immersive.</p>
<p>Storage considerations matter more than you might think with VR headsets, too. Games with detailed environments and high-resolution textures can easily consume 10GB to 20GB each, and the Quest 3S does not support expandable storage. The 128GB model gives you enough room for roughly eight to ten major games plus several smaller experiences, which works fine if you’re comfortable deleting and redownloading titles as you rotate through your library. The 256GB version doubles that capacity and lets you maintain a larger installed library without constant storage management.</p>



<p>The visual experience inside the Quest 3S uses <strong>Fresnel lenses with a resolution of 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye</strong>, and matches the Quest 2’s clarity while benefiting from that doubled processing power. Colors pop with better saturation, black levels deepen in dark scenes, and the overall image feels crisper during gameplay. The Quest 3 does offer slightly better optics with pancake lenses that reduce the headset’s overall bulk, but the visual improvement doesn’t justify the $250 price premium for most users.</p>
<p><strong>Meta’s mixed reality capabilities</strong> transform your real room into a game zone by mapping your furniture and walls, then seamlessly integrating virtual elements. You could place a virtual chess board on your real coffee table, have a movie screen floating above your couch, or defend your living room from virtual invaders crawling across your real furniture.</p>
<p><strong>The Quest 3S weighs about 515 grams</strong> and distributes that mass across your face with adjustable straps that take into account head size and shapes. Comfort will, of course, vary from person to person, but most people can handle hour-plus sessions before taking a break. The included elastic strap works well enough, though more serious VR enthusiasts often upgrade to Meta’s Elite Strap for better weight distribution during longer play.</p>
<p>At these early Black Friday prices, the Quest 3S completely rewrites the entry cost for quality VR. When you’re paying almost double for marginal improvements, the regular Quest 3 simply can’t compete on value. And for PC-based headsets, an expensive computer is needed in addition to the investment into the headset itself. Meta nailed the sweet spot between performance and affordability with this model.</p>

I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> was much more of a turning point for Sony than most people really discuss. The argument for PlayStation used to be its exclusives, those tentpole games like Uncharted, Ratchet and Clank, LittleBigPlanet, the list does go on but you get the point. On the PS5, completely original first-party games feel few and far between, as Sony has joined in on the whole intellectual property above all else train that every other company has hopped aboard. So hearing Guerilla Games' studio director Jan-Bart van Beek say the Horizon series was always thought about as a multiplayer game feels like the last piece of the puzzle has been inserted.
</p>
<p>
Here's what van Beek said specifically, in referencing the just announced Horizon MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-an-mmorpg-twist-on-sonys-series-about-plinking-robo-animals-with-arrows-is-coming-to-pc">Steel Frontiers</a>: "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game. LEGO Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we’re taking a bigger one. There is much more to come, and we’re excited to show you what is coming."

<p>
Apologies for taking a curmudgeonly attitude towards this, but of course that's how it was always thought about! Well, assuming this is true across the board. I imagine there are plenty who worked on the original that won't feel that way. The top brass feeling that way does make sense, however. Ultimately the goal isn't striving to make something fresh, but something that can keep you playing, and presumably paying, for longer.
</p>
<p>
Live service is constantly on Sony's mind, and it is pretty clear that multiplayer is on Guerilla's. Clearing up some confusion, industry secrets knower <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">Jason Schreier took to Bluesky</a> to say that the NCSoft developer Horizon Steel Frontiers MMO isn't that rumoured - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-12-minutes-of-early-horizon-multiplayer-game-footage-leaks-online">and leaked</a> - Horizon Multiplayer game. That one is still in the works at Guerilla, and is apparently their next big project.
</p><p>
But it's this reality where Horizon was supposedly always meant to be multiplayer that my feelings on the original being a turning point come from. A mobile-only Ratchet and Clank multiplayer shooter was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlblXRS14Mg">just announced this week</a>, for heaven's sake. As much of a farce as the Sony first-party game was, at least every now and then it would offer up something new. Ah well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pilot-a-shrimp-and-do-battle-with-giant-eldritch-sea-monsters-in-the-armored-core-adjacent-shrimp-game?view=comments">at least we have Shrimp Game</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-flea-market-locked-level-40/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-won%E2%80%99t-unlock-the-full-tarkov-flea-market-until-level-40.1354804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update is here, and fans worldwide are enjoying it – or those who can <strong>access the game are</strong>, anyway. It’s the dawn of a new era for the stellar extraction shooter, which has grown over the last decade to become a staple of the industry and a leader of the genre.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update brings stacks of changes, and one that players are struggling to contend with concerns the game’s <strong>Flea Market </strong>mechanic. It has been discovered that ‘categories’ of the Flea Market are locked until you progress to a fairly high level.</p>







<h2 id="h-flea-market-locked-down-again">Flea Market Locked Down Again</h2>



<p>The latest changes to Escape from Tarkov have been a mixed bag. On one hand, the new map, faction, weapons, and 1,000 bug fixes are welcome, but the shattered servers that are having issues hosting the hundreds of thousands of players trying to get into the game, we can do without.</p>



<p>One change that’s proving to be divisive is the alteration made to the game’s Flea Market, the peer-to-peer trading solution that allows users to buy and sell gear they find, craft, or steal.</p>



<p>With 1.0, players are now being forced to hit minimum level requirements to open up sections of the Flea Market, with certain categories remaining under lock for quite some time.&nbsp;The base Flea Market unlocks at Level 15 as always, but there are higher restrictions now in terms of levels.</p>



<p>Here’s what we’ve seen so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bolt-action rifles – Level 20</li>



<li>Assault rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Marksman rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Backpacks – Level 25</li>



<li>Foregrips – Level 20</li>



<li>Light and laser devices – Level 25</li>



<li>Muzzle devices – Level 20</li>
</ul>



<p>It gets a bit more extreme in some places:</p>



<ul>
<li>Barter items – Level 30</li>



<li>Gear components – Level 30</li>



<li>Injectors – Level 30</li>



<li>Keycards – Level 30</li>
</ul>



<p>And some high-tier ammo will remain locked for a very long time:</p>



<ul>
<li>PS12B – Level 40</li>



<li>M80 – Level 35</li>



<li>Blackout CJB – Level 40</li>
</ul>



<p>(Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/LogicaISoIution/status/1989786400330584192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LogicalSolutions</a> for the spot)</p>







<p>This is believed to be an effort to counter cheaters trying to participate in RMT (real-money trading), but it has rubbed some fans the wrong way.</p>

            <p>
Video games don't have mysteries any more. There are too many people and too much internet to allow for such a thing, anything without an answer can, must, and will be solved by someone, often in a timeframe faster than developers expect. So I appreciate when developers refuse to divulge details, or indulge individuals in their desire to know exactly how much they have on their checklist, one such developer being Tonda Ros of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> developer Dogubomb.
</p>
<p>
In response to a question from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/i-will-probably-never-fully-acknowledge-whether-or-not-everything-has-been-solved-says-blue-prince-creator-there-are-certainly-mysteries-still-in-the-game/">PC Gamer</a> regarding whether there are any mysteries left to be found in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game, Ros said that there certainly are, and that "there will probably always be some mysteries in the game. And in order to preserve that mystery, I will probably never fully acknowledge whether or not everything has been solved." Music to my ears!
</p>
<p>
Ros goes further, saying, "I know that for some games, they'll have, like, a canary in the coal mine, right? I think it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> that has a website that's like, 'Has everything been found yet?' That kind of serves as a canary." As it turns out, such a website does exist, it's <a href="http://haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com/">haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com</a>, and I'll let you click to find out what the answer is.
</p>
<p>
For Ros, that question of whether everything has been found in Blue Prince is one he thinks people will always ask. "The only thing I will say is that there are still mysteries," he said. "Not to say that they're necessarily things that can be solved in definitive ways, but they are things that you can piece together answers to, oftentimes intuitively."
</p><p>
I truly hope this is something we see more of from developers going forwards. There is such a massive inclination towards complete and utter player satisfaction, but to me there is nothing more satisfying than to be left wanting more, a reason to keep coming back, even if the gaps between return trips end up being days, weeks, months or years at a time. Lay unto me your mysterious developers! I may not solve them, but I will think about them.
</p>
<p>
And while you're here, I'd like to remind you that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-team-behind-blue-prince-puts-out-a-call-to-get-one-of-the-puzzle-games-devs-a-life-saving-kidney">one of the lead playtesters on Blue Prince is in desperate need of a kidney</a>, something you genuinely might be able to help with.
