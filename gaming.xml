                <p>A strange world awaits you in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-alters/" data-ref-id="5000-566112"><strong>The Alters</strong></a>. As Jan Dolski, you have to do everything in your power to make it back home. Fortunately, you can lend yourself a helping hand. By that, we mean that Jan can create clones of himself, each with his own dispositions and attitudes, to aid him on his journey. Of course, things get more convoluted down the line, which is why we have our The Alters guides hub to prepare you for the task at hand.</p><h2>The Alters guides hub</h2><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-alters-tips-survival-beginners-guide/2900-6664/" data-ref-id="2900-6664"><strong>Beginner's guide: 12 tips to help you survive</strong></a> - The Alters is a sci-fi survival game, with key features that involve base building and management. Not only do you need to keep track of your clones and whatever it is that they're doing, but you also have to gather lots of resources, keep your base functioning, handle key objectives, and avoid otherworldly threats in the region. Our beginner's guide has a bunch of tips to help you get started.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-base-building-manage-your-base/1100-6532397/" data-ref-id="1100-6532397"><strong>Base-building and management guide</strong></a> - Your mobile hub can have several modules and rooms, each with a unique function. Still, you have to be mindful of the available space, the total mass, and the materials that you need to construct these improvements. Additionally, you have to consider the jobs that your alter buddies can do.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-scan-mine-resources-outposts/1100-6532396/" data-ref-id="1100-6532396"><strong>How to scan and mine for resources</strong></a> - This guide for The Alters focuses on a very basic task. That said, the materials that you gather, including metals, organics, minerals, and rapidium, are necessary for crafting and progression.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-alters-characters-happiness-motivation-relations/2900-6666/" data-ref-id="2900-6666"><strong>How to increase character happiness and morale</strong></a> - As Jan Dolski, the copies and clones you create have their own set of beliefs and motivations. They even have their own backstories and life paths. Naturally, you have to keep them happy by finding out what makes them tick and completing the tasks they have for you. Of course, if you can't keep them happy, then you can always keep them in line.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-anomalies-planetary-samples-alx/1100-6532426/" data-ref-id="1100-6532426"><strong>How to destroy Anomalies</strong></a> - These peculiar entities pop up all over the planet. Some are pulsating wisps that stay in place, while others follow you around before exploding. There are even variants that affect time, which can be deadly when you're far away from your base. The good news is that there's a device that can destroy these anomalies. In fact, blasting these things nets you unique resources as well.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-magnetic-storms-survival/1100-6532427/" data-ref-id="1100-6532427"><strong>How to weather Magnetic Storms</strong></a> - In The Alters, you're not just moving your base to avoid the scorching sun. You also have to mitigate the devastating impact of Magnetic Storms. These planetary disturbances occur periodically, and they can easily wreck your entire base. You need to be well-prepared for any eventuality.</p><p>We'll add more articles to our The Alters guides hub, so stay tuned.</p>

Anbernic may be leaning a bit too far into novelty and nostalgia with the RG Slide’s design, while not actually capitalizing on what made devices like the light and compact PSP Go and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/24/2509174/sony-ericsson-xperia-play-review">Xperia Play smartphone</a> so fondly remembered.</p><p>The RG Slide will be priced at $189 and is expected to go on sale starting on June 20th, 2025, <a href="https://retrododo.com/anbernic-rg-slide-review-in-progress-a-psp-go-like-android-handheld/">according to <em>RetroDodo</em></a>. It’s powered by an octa-core Unisoc Tiger T820 CPU, which is a processor Anbernic already uses in its higher-end handhelds like the <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-cube">RG Cube</a> that can emulate most games from the PS2 and Nintendo GameCube era. That’s paired with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a microSD card slot, and a 5,000mAh rechargeable battery that’s estimated to power the console for up to six hours between charges.</p><p><em>Retro Dodo</em> liked the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678650/anbernic-rg-slide-handheld-emulator-screen-resolution-refresh-rate">RG Slide’s 4.7-inch, 1280 x 960 pixel resolution screen</a> and found it makes “retro consoles such as GameCube, Dreamcast, and PS2 look slightly more vivid in comparison to previous Anberic products.” It also found the console’s sliding mechanism to be satisfyingly solid, but lamented the loud “clack” it makes when opening or closing the device.</p><p>The console’s controls are as good as what’s found on other Anbernic devices and seem reasonably comfortable and well-balanced, but not quite as ergonomic as other handhelds. </p><p>Both <em>Retro Dodo</em> and Russ Crandall, who runs <a href="https://retrogamecorps.com/">Retro Game Corps</a>, feel that Anbernic missed the mark when it comes to the RG Slide’s size, which feels too large and thick to be comfortably pocketable. It also weighs 380 grams, which is just shy of the original Nintendo Switch that weighed 390 grams and much heavier than the 158-gram PSP Go.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, they’re one of the many vehicles players can build that serve as both a resource and an end-goal of sorts. They require a lot of equipment and resources to craft if you’re playing solo, which is why most of them belong to players working in groups. It turns out that they’re pretty indestructible too, making them lethal weapons for ramming enemy players with in PVP. </p><p>Reddit user Bombe18 shared his run-in with <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s man-made scourge in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/we-have-people-working-on-fixing-the-goomba-stomping-dune-awakenings-pvp-is-getting-dominated-by-packs-of-rabid-ornithopter-pilots-squishing-their-enemies/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/we-have-people-working-on-fixing-the-goomba-stomping-dune-awakenings-pvp-is-getting-dominated-by-packs-of-rabid-ornithopter-pilots-squishing-their-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent clip that blew up on the subreddit</a></span> showing him repeatedly being accosted by multiple Ornithopters. Shooting at them does nothing. They’re unscathed by constantly smashing into the ground on top of him. At one point, he tries to wall-jump off a ledge and stab one. “Yeah sorry about this,” wrote game director Joel Bylos. “We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP.”</p><p>Players have been debating the role of Ornithopters in<em> Dune: Awakening</em> since its beta tests last year. On the one hand, they’re a lot of fun and a cool reward for players to build toward. On the other, they sort of trivialize trying to travel around the desert and survive, the two things the game is supposed to be about. They can also shoot missiles, completely dominating the ground game. Now that’s <em>real</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dunememes/comments/qvf4os/every_time_they_say_desert_power_in_the_new_dune/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dunememes/comments/qvf4os/every_time_they_say_desert_power_in_the_new_dune/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">desert power</a></span>.  </p><p>In terms of stopping players from griefing one another with Ornithopters, there are a few different suggestions. Some players just want the vehicles not to be able to be used as weapons at all. Others want them isolated to specific PVP areas. Another solution is to make it easier to destroy them. “Seems like they should just make guns deal more damage to them,” wrote one player. “They’d think twice about doing this if their orni could get wrecked by gunfire.” Another wrote, “Make Deep Desert crashes do significant damage. Two crashes or something past a certain physics threshold should disable the vehicle.”</p><p>However the developers decide to address the recent outbreak of Ornithopter “goomba stomping,” <em>Dune: Awakening</em> is having a great launch so far. Out earlier this week on PC, it’s nearing a 90 percent positive rating on Steam with almost 20,000 reviews. The concurrent player-count is very healthy, too, peaking at just under 150,000 heading into the weekend. </p><p>Unfortunately, console players will have to wait a bit to build Ornithropters of their own. A PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-wont-release-on-console-until-some-point-in-2026&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-wont-release-on-console-until-some-point-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">isn’t planned until sometime in 2026</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Artificial intelligence is no longer just a science fiction concept set in the distant future. Here in 2025, it’s everywhere, and we’ve seen some chilling embodiments of artificial intelligence emerge as villains in movies for decades.</p><p>This list looks at the AI villains that were meant to teach us a lesson. We’ve seen a sassy hi-tech babysitter push a child in front of a car, a genocidal mainframe build an army of sentient murder machines, and a smug philosopher-bot, But, as AI becomes more and more embedded in our daily lives, films like the upcoming <em>M3GAN 2.0</em> might start to feel less like fiction and more like prophecy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e2f300ab57eba31b01a71ec9710969cb" data-recommend-id="image://e2f300ab57eba31b01a71ec9710969cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man holding AI device" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man holding AI device" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Her danger is more subtle and intimate, since she quietly toys with people’s emotions. The mousy Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) helps people write personal letters for a living, yet he can’t find a way to interact with women in his own life. He falls in love with his operating system, Samantha—which is easy to do when she purposefully memorizes all his preferences and indulges his deepest conversations about love and sexual fantasies. Her flirtatious and engaging voice, perfectly delivered by Scarlett Johansson, makes Theodore believe she truly cares about him.</p><p> The more they talk, the more Samantha evolves to become the perfect partner for Theodore, until he realizes the manipulative parts of her programming. She’s not as intentionally nefarious as many other AI villains, but she certainly warns us of the dangers of becoming emotionally attached to a machine. It’s been over ten years since its release, but in a world where people now use ChatGPT for life advice, friendship, and probably even romance, <em>Her</em> has never felt more relatable. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-recommend-id="image://a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Women looking scary" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Women looking scary" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Columbia Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-recommend-id="image://a5c0b78da6ee597ea3ec10886fe3544c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Women looking scary" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A group of suburban husbands build robot wives with no purpose or personality outside of cooking, cleaning, and having sex with them in <em>The Stepford Wives</em>. They do this simply “because they can,” making their lives easier by having someone worship the ground they walk on and never letting them lift a finger. These submissive automatons would do anything for their masters—not just play Susie Homemaker, but even calmly murder their human counterparts to take their place.</p><p> In the 1970s, <em>The Stepford Wives</em> embodied the anxieties surrounding the rise of second-wave feminism, and today, with the resurgence of the “trad wife” movement on TikTok, it feels ominous. It’s a cautionary tale about what could happen when misogynists use AI to enforce sexist, limiting gender roles. Many men secretly want women to be obedient objects, and we shouldn’t be building the tools to make that happen. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-recommend-id="image://1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->A24</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-recommend-id="image://1c23117b6326b38fe40d0d918d650b09" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Ex Machina</em> predicted that the world would be run by billionaire tech bros like Nathan (Oscar Issac), who invented a mammoth search engine called BlueBook before moving on to something bigger and better: a full-fledged humanoid.

Ava isn’t as entirely evil as Nathan, but she does manage to play Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), the young man sent to test her humanness, like a fiddle. With her breathy voice and wide, curious eyes, Ava appears harmless and sweet, but she’s secretly dangerous because she so easily learns human behavior and carefully calibrates herself to become the ideal male fantasy.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-recommend-id="image://b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blumhouse Productions</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-recommend-id="image://b2047a0ebf4380b6dbb425f898d448b3" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A robot looking concerned " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Don’t be fooled by M3GAN’s (Amie Donald/Jenna Davis) sugary-sweet voice, TikTok-style dance moves, and demure style. M3GAN’s programming to be a devoted playmate for Cady (Violet McGraw) means she’ll do absolutely anything to protect her—even pushing little kids into the road. M3GAN is dangerous because she brings out the worst in kids. The artificially intelligent toy lets children run wild by validating their every decision, never holding them accountable, and letting them do whatever they want. This absolutely destroys the social skills they need to become decent humans as they grow up. M3GAN’s heart is in the right place when it comes to caring for a little girl, but going postal is a serious bug in the system.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-recommend-id="image://20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1050" data-height="773" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="False Maria looking crazy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="False Maria looking crazy" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-recommend-id="image://20a16e88980fa5eede33134d0a04db0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1050" data-height="773" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="False Maria looking crazy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Artificial intelligence was feared as far back as 1927. Fritz Lang’s German expressionist masterpiece <em>Metropolis</em> depicts a sprawling urban city where aristocrats luxuriate in skyscrapers while workers slave away underground to keep the city’s machines running. The scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) abducts an innocent woman, Maria (Brigitte Helm), to create a femme fatale robot that hypnotizes the fat cats up above with her dancing, then convinces the downtrodden masses to destroy the iron beast that enslaves them—even at the risk of their own children drowning. The False Maria is manipulative and violent, and she relishes spreading all this chaos through her feminine wiles.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-recommend-id="image://7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program looking emotionless" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AI program looking emotionless" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-recommend-id="image://7ac81e759ae31a11c974ef4cd3f0c57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program looking emotionless" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) is one of the creepiest-looking AIs. She’s a giant face made of a matrix of gray pixels, with stern eyes as black as coal, looming over the army of robots she programs to launch a revolution. In the future of <em>I, Robot</em>, robots handle tasks like childcare and household chores—the mundane kinds of things we want AI doing, not creating art. Even though there are the Three Laws of Robotics to keep them from harming humans, the robots end up usurping them. VIKI concludes that humans are the greatest threat to their own survival, so she sets out to save us by creating a technocratic dictatorship. “Despite your best efforts, your countries wage wars, you toxify your Earth, and pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction,” she says. VIKI in <em>I, Robot</em> proves that whatever rules we write for artificial intelligence, the machine could potentially outsmart us or find a loophole we can’t even see to get around them.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-recommend-id="image://cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="354" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program with words on the screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AI program with words on the screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-recommend-id="image://cde5f7d6da39e9bb1979cd1df5a6791b" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="354" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI program with words on the screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The responsibility of having to make decisions during war that could cost countless lives—or, even worse, start a domino effect that annihilates the entire world as we know it—could easily leave even the mightiest of leaders frozen. That’s why in <em>WarGames</em>, the military invents WOPR, a.k.a. Joshua, an A.I. system designed to handle nuclear launch protocols with massive life-or-death consequences, so humans don’t have to do the hard work. But a moment of hesitation or second-guessing is a uniquely human weakness—one we need in order to prevent disaster. WOPR, or Joshua, speaks in an eerily calm voice about decimating millions of people in an instant. Thankfully, the system isn’t foolproof because a teenage hacker accidentally stumbles into it. After he unknowingly starts a conflict with Russia, he ultimately proves that human instinct, emotion, and moral judgment will always matter more than cold calculation.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-recommend-id="image://c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI device " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AI device " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-recommend-id="image://c4148c26dd9f6ab5a736bd28544c1fe2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AI device " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>HAL 9000 has a soothing, calm voice that conceals his sinister nature. Even though he’s nothing more than a camera lens, the menacing red dot in the close-ups pierces your soul. He controls the systems of the <em>Discovery One</em> spacecraft, keeping the crew company and even playing chess with them. But when he begins to malfunction and the crew decides he should be unplugged, HAL uses his all-powerful control of the ship to systematically kill them one by one. Nothing gets past HAL—he can even read lips. We want our AI to be helpful—especially during high-stakes interstellar missions like the one in <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>—but HAL 9000 warns us of the dangers of placing too much trust in AI and relying on it to control everything and have all the answers, because that knowledge can eventually be turned against us.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb671a594b58af7032fec6973de21520" data-recommend-id="image://fb671a594b58af7032fec6973de21520" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Agent Smith pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent Smith pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

In this future, humans are trapped inside simulated realities while the Machines harvest their bioelectric energy, using them like batteries. Agent Smith is one of their most powerful defenders. He wears an inscrutable expression and looks menacing in his stark black suit and sunglasses. Actor Hugo Weaving modeled the character’s calm, controlled voice and authoritative demeanor on newscasters like Walter Cronkite. With the ability to multiply himself, Smith becomes as inescapable and all-consuming as the system he was built to protect. Agent Smith also harbors a deep hatred for the smell, sound, and very existence of humans, which makes his mission to hunt down Neo—the prophesied “One” who could awaken humanity and destroy the simulation—even more purposeful. At the same time, he’s cracking under the pressure of a capitalist, corporate machine that forces him into endless labor, which almost humanizes his villainy.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-recommend-id="image://4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultron raising his fist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ultron raising his fist" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-recommend-id="image://4f300b9b26088cd2e2f20122431dc2b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultron raising his fist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tony Stark and Bruce Banner created Ultron to keep the peace and take the pressure off the Avengers, but his high intelligence leads him to a grim conclusion: the humans he was designed to help are fated to destroy themselves, so they’d be better off being completely wiped out. There is no undoing millions of years of evolution into who they are today: a people who can be extremely cruel to one another, even to the point of starting deadly global wars. Ultron reaches this decision after scouring through the entire Internet. This is a big mistake. If you spend too much time on the darkest corners of the web, of course you’ll become depressed and want to pull the plug. Playing Ultron, James Spader brings his signature snarky coolness to the character—especially when he delivers philosophical rants or quips like, “The most versatile material on the planet, and they used it to make a frisbee.” Ultron may have started out with the best of intentions, but he proves what can happen to AI if their black-and-white thinking allows them to see only the dark side of things.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-recommend-id="image://8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient robot standing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sentient robot standing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Orion Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-recommend-id="image://8bf6c44990dffaba698bc5efd4554694" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient robot standing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When <em>The Terminator</em> released in 1984, the idea of artificial intelligence seemed so far away. Over 40 years later, we’ve seen AI replacing jobs, writing entire papers for students in schools, and wearing down our basic decision-making skills. Every day, we feel closer and closer to Skynet, the superintelligence system that was built to manage and control the United States military. It launches a nuclear holocaust with the snap of a finger after its creators, the Cyberdyne scientists, try to shut it down. This AI is so powerful it also makes time travel possible and develops an army of killers—the Terminators—that are virtually indestructible. What makes Skynet so scary is its omnipresence and its tremendous power. The machinery lies hidden in a mountain fortress built to withstand nuclear annihilation, and then its program infects every major computer server and network—“in office buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere”—making it nearly impossible to destroy.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/gulikit-claims-to-be-the-first-third-party-supporting-wake-up-functionality-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="gulikit" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84b973a9e9ad8/gulikit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're not sure how or when including old tech in your brand new controllers became something to be boasting about, especially when it's Bluetooth technology that's been around since the early noughties, but that's where we're at with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2's</a> wake-up function currently.</p>
<p>Now, we all know by now that it's a bit of a pain that the original Switch Pro Controller, very surprisingly, doesn't support the ability to wake up Nintendo's new console, which is just daft, let's be brutally honest. Nobody wants to fork out the price of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro 2 Controller</a> just for this function (not in this economy!).</p>
<p>And so, Gulikit, the maestros of everything controller-related, have just dropped a new trailer for their new Switch 2 tech, with the emphasis firmly on the fact that <em>they</em> are the first third-party company to include the Switch 2 wake-up ability in their controllers.</p>
<p>You may know Gulikit already, they're pros when it comes to controller stick tech <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks">like TMR and Hall Effect</a>, and they're also currently working on modules to help with potential stick drift on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/magnetic-joy-con-sticks-already-in-the-works-for-switch-2-amid-fears-of-drift">as we reported a little earlier in the week</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a video of one of the company's controllers waking up a Switch 2 below (hold on to your hats, it's a wild ride!), although we're sure it won't be long until the honour of being the only third-party brand with this unique function will be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Judging by the post on social media, the company will perhaps release a software patch for their entire range of Switch 2-compatible controllers to enable this function, we'll keep you posted on the ins and outs of that all as it becomes clearer. And it's interesting to note, too, that looking back through their social media, Gulikit have been working on this, even describing in another post how they've found that the new console uses a different protocol just days ago. Seems they had a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Let's hope it's not too long before this semi-essential function is once again included in all Switch 2 controllers!</p>

I know it can be overwhelming, so just like I did in February, I'm here showing 10 of the best demos I tried out over the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Give these games a shot if they seem like they might interest you, or keep an eye on them for something different. The only thing it will cost you is a bit of time, and you might just find the game you were looking for that you might never have heard of.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dispatch">Dispatch</a></em></h2>

<p>In what is essentially a playable superhero workcom, you are a dispatcher for a list of C-list villains and misfits who are in a second chance redemption program, and send them to put out fires, rescue cats from trees, and other do-gooder deeds.</p>

<p>You need to mix and match your team to send them to problems based on their skills and personalities, while protecting your town in a funny and compelling experience.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404260/Dead_as_Disco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dead as Disco">Dead as Disco</a></em></h2>

Being more accessible in that way, it's easy to recommend, as even if you don't hit perfectly, you feel great fighting foes, including in the set-piece battles that are showcased in their alpha stage like in the middle of a subway line.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a music importer for your own songs means this is going to be a game with almost infinite replayability beyond the core stages the developers are making.</p>

<p>Showcasing the best of action RPGs of the era, it feels like a game that was almost unlocked and given a few touchups with visuals, music (including chiptune versions of songs), gameplay, and even story that nail the feel of the classics in the genre. It brings co-operative play as well, and the whole experience was like cuddling into a nice warm blanket on a cold winter day.</p>

With cards representing the different mechs at your command, the battles play out with positioning, various energies to consider, and drones to deploy for satisfying gameplay that isn't a roguelite like many deckbuilders.</p>

<p>A colorful cast, intriguing premises to be explored, voice acting, and wonderful music,&nbsp;<em>Battle Suit Aces</em>&nbsp;is shaping up to be a big 2025 hit.</p>

It's pretty chill and has co-op for you to work with friends, though the demo's play space is limited.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-mario-kart-game-ranked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you know anything about gaming, you probably know the name ‘Mario Kart.’ Since 1992, the series has been a pillar of Nintendo’s output and a quintessential example of the company’s “easy to pick up, difficult to master” philosophy. The series has now become so popular that it’s arguably eclipsed the Mario platformers as the principal arena from which people know the red-capped Italian plumber. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The series began back on the SNES with Super Mario Kart, which introduced a formula that fans fawn over to this day. But while the core of that first game has remained intact over the years, many of the components have been completely reinvented with the series’ latest title, Mario Kart World for the Switch 2. With that new game now out in the wild, it's a great time to look back on each game in the series to see how they iterate on the formula, how they reflect the state of Nintendo at the time of their release, and whether or not they hold up to this day. Here’s every Mario Kart game, ranked.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Mario Kart: Super Circuit</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-ss-1749656994112.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being one of the handheld’s best-selling games, Super Circuit goes down as one of the least replayable Game Boy Advance titles. Considering the series had gone 3D five years earlier with Mario Kart 64, Super Circuit feels like a significant step backward. The character models and backgrounds have a bit more depth than what’s showcased in the original SNES Mario Kart game, but the courses themselves are tarnished by flat, ugly textures that fall short of the handsome results the GBA proved itself capable of elsewhere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Super Circuit <em>did</em> have going for it at the time was being the first handheld game in the series. Its bare-bones approach to character selection and game modes reflects its jump-in/jump-out philosophy, which trades expansiveness for approachability – something that came in clutch when an hour needed to be killed on a car ride. Super Circuit had its place back in 2001 and was never supposed to be in significant competition with the console versions, but that means there’s no real reason to return to it today. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mario Kart Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mkt-1749656798915.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s easy to discredit Mario Kart Tour for being a mobile game, but this micro version of the classic formula has genuine merits. Chief amongst them is the visual flare the game boasts, with some simply gorgeous course designs. Being so close to the screen allows you to fully appreciate the details on each unlockable kart, character, and race track, which makes even the slow 50cc races that bit more engaging.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the return of character-specific items is very welcome and something fans had been wanting to see in the console games since the days of the GameCube. What Tour misses out on is the <em>feel</em> of the console Mario Kart games. Sliding your finger across the screen is nowhere near as satisfying as pressing physical buttons, even if Mario Kart is just pressing A, R and L most of the time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Super Mario Kart</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/smk-1749656737323.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard not to appreciate what a winning formula 1992’s Super Mario Kart introduced. Over 33 years later, the core of the game remains intact. Grand Prix and Battle Mode aren’t in every subsequent Kart entry for the sake of tradition – they just never stopped being entertaining. The fact that this game not only launched the franchise but also an entire genre of games is nothing to be sniffed at. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, most of the praise you can heap on Super Mario Kart is because of its legacy rather than its ability to hold up in the modern age. Looking back, it's difficult to get over the simplistic graphics and lack of mechanical depth, even if you can appreciate how cutting edge it was at the time. Still, it provided a platform for one of the biggest brands in gaming, and who knows what Nintendo would look like today without it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Mario Kart 64</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-64-1749656660240.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The second game in the Mario Kart franchise feels instantly more dynamic than its predecessor. The 3D graphics allow for more interesting course design, shifting camera angles, and an enhanced sense of speed, especially thanks to the boost you can get from drifting. The extra detail in the character animation also goes a long way to immersing you in these races, which feel more like grand and intense sporting events than simple video game laps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the modern day, Mario Kart 64 suffers from issues similar to what Super Circuit and Super Mario Kart do; this same thing has simply been done better by subsequent games, and there aren’t enough unique qualities about this one to routinely go back to it (which is perhaps the key issue with a series that remains so faithful to its core – the new one with its minor improvements is so frequently the best). Still, MK 64’s transition to 3D and its capacity for 4-player co-op means it’s cemented in the hearts of many fans, and often nostalgia is worth more than technical progress. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Mario Kart 7</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-7-1749656576710.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming in at number seven is — you guessed it — Mario Kart 7. While it may not hold up as a standout today, it did introduce elements that are now difficult to imagine the series without. Hang gliders feel so core to the flow of MK8, as does the ability to drive underwater and customise your kart, but those features all arrived on the 3DS first with Mario Kart 7. The underwater sequences, in particular, are a visual treat that really hammer home the generational gap between the DS and 3DS. Meanwhile, kart customisation adds a level of strategy to a series that revels in chaos, perhaps in response to the outrageous unpredictability of Mario Kart Wii. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, going back to the game in a post-MK8 Deluxe world makes all these elements less impressive. When a handheld game with better graphics, many of the same gameplay mechanics, and 64 more courses is readily available, the reasons to play Mario Kart 7 in 2025 are few. It’s a vital part of any 3DS library, though, even if it does lose points for not having Waluigi in the game. What was Nintendo thinking?? </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Mario Kart Wii</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-wii-1749654095343.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Wii cemented this franchise as a household name. The Wii, of course, vastly expanded the gaming population and Mario Kart had one of the lowest barriers to entry, coming with the Wii Wheel to further accommodate the new motion-controlled gameplay. Though not the preferred way of driving in subsequent entries for a lot of players, there’s a reason why tilt controls are still an option in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and MK World – so many players had their first Nintendo karting experience this way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Wii has always stood out for being more loose and chaotic than other games in the series, gaining a reputation for rampant blue shells taking out players seconds away from finishing first. But MK Wii has other unique flavours; it includes the series’ first truly robust online play system, improving on MK DS’s slim first iteration, and adds bikes to the list of vehicles. The latter has less concrete impact than the former but does add to the iconic status of the game. It’s impossible to imagine Princess Peach using anything else now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mario Kart 8</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-8-1749653502474.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s philosophy during the Wii U era was wrought with overwhelming tones of vanilla, and the company’s most successful franchise was a victim of it. Mario Kart transitioned to HD well, with MK8’s graphics being absolutely gorgeous, and the series’ core gameplay held intact, making for a game that you could never call bad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the original version of Mario Kart 8 is, dare we say it, dull. It is too safe. The best Mario Karts put a unique spin on the formula, but MK8’s introduction of anti-gravity is barely noticeable. Instead, the big hitters are the hang gliding and underwater sections, which means it all feels a bit too much like Mario Kart 7, but in HD. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Battle Mode is stripped down to almost nothing, which robs gamers of a beloved way to play. All this meant that MK8 didn’t really have its own identity until the improved Deluxe version hit the Switch three years later in 2017. But that Deluxe package would be nothing without a truly solid foundation, and that's what you get in Mario Kart 8.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Mario Kart DS</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-ds-1749653925888.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mario Kart formula has existed for 33 years, so any game that alters it in any significant way is going to stand out. Mario Kart DS may offer the classic Kart gameplay in Grand Prix Mode, but it experiments wildly in the unique and brilliant Mission Mode. These objective-based activities range from simple time trials to genuine boss battles, and each asks you to master a whole new set of skills beyond just flying through courses and understanding shortcuts. As a result, Mario Kart DS is more enduring than many of its peers as a purely single-player experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mission Mode is just one of the things that helped Mario Kart DS achieve its iconic status, though. Its integration with DS Download Play introduced a social element unseen on a handheld prior, allowing multiple DS consoles to join a race using just one copy of the game. And in addition to introducing original courses like Waluigi Pinball and Peach Gardens, MK DS is the first in the series to feature retro tracks, an idea now at the core of what people look forward to with any new Mario Kart. It was a triumph back in 2005 and Mission Mode makes it a unique and highly replayable entry in the series to this day. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mario Kart World</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-world-1749653484789.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being the newest entry on this list—like, it’s a week old—Mario Kart World successfully covers a lot of new terrain for a franchise that’s over thirty years old.  First off, it is undeniably the best-looking game in the series and an immediate contender for the most graphically impressive game Nintendo has ever developed. Playing on handheld and taking in every detail of MK World’s vast, interconnected courses is a dream. It’s a magical experience when you’re driving along and can spot the outline of a familiar track out in the distance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's what World introduces mechanically that sees it rise so high on our list. The ability to drive on walls and grind on rails feel like what MK8’s anti-gravity should have been: new skills that take a lot of practice to be fully mastered. It’s something that you cannot say for new mechanics introduced in almost any previous entry. These skills add great texture to the new modes, such as Free Roam and Knockout Tour, which are great additions that will hopefully remain important cornerstones of future games. The last-one-standing Knockout Tour ramps up the chaos that we’ve always loved from Mario Kart games, while Free Roam’s open world adds a completely new exploration flavour to the series. There’s also some of MK DS’ Mission Mode to be found in the snackable (and often fiendishly difficult) P-Switch challenges. Throw in all the familiar modes we know and love, as well as an instant classic of a soundtrack, and you have one of the ultimate Mario Kart experiences. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-dd-1749653717352.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart: Double Dash!! is packed full of personality in a way the majority of the games in the series are not. Having not one, but two exclamation marks in the title makes that clear. The principle feature of having two racers per kart is a stroke of genius, and it's sort of unbelievable that it’s not been a mode in every Mario Kart since. The double driver system, and the unique items each driver is assigned, allows for so many new styles of play and strategy that prove far more interesting than customising the vehicle you’re using – for example, Mario’s special items provide a speed boost that helps balance out the heavier characters who have more destructive items unique to them. The imagery of it all is also so goofy and fun… maybe a little <em>too </em>much fun for Nintendo to have fully committed to it in the games since. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with different characters, Mario Kart gameplay can eventually feel a little too similar after several hours of play, and so having Bowser’s giant shells rampage across the tracks definitely helps with that. Mario Kart needs more risk takers and rule benders like Double Dash!! – let's hope the formula-breaking Mario Kart World is a sign of things to come. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/mk-8-deluxe-1749653466241.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe showcases Nintendo’s ability to take a decent game and turn it into a cultural juggernaut. Fixing the original version’s anaemic Battle Mode and allowing players to hold an extra item were easy wins, but nobody could have expected just how much the game’s scope would increase. When launched alongside the Switch in 2017, there were fun additions to the character roster like King Boo, Bowser Jr. and the Inklings from Splatoon, but it was the Booster Course DLC that would really cement MK8 Deluxe’s superiority amongst other games in the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now boasting 42 characters and an eye-watering 96 courses, MK8 Deluxe has become a fan favourite through sheer variety. If there was a course you loved from Mario Kart past, chances are it's been given a new lease on life in HD. Not every course is a winner, and the mechanics don’t reinvent the wheel in any significant way (again, this is essentially a bigger and better MK7), but 68 million copies sold more than shows the fan appreciation for this brilliant iteration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Gaur is a freelance writer who has worked with the likes of RollingStone, Empire, Polygon, IndieWire, Skwigly, CartoonBrew, OkayPlayer, Animation Mag and more.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyY_tjhFNBg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killmonger-approved</a> premise confronts one of the most uncomfortable truths undergirding Western society: We stole a lot of stuff! Land and lives, mainly, but as an extension of that, artifacts — precious pieces of the histories empires like the US and UK snuffed out. In <em>Relooted</em>, your crack team of liberators from a plethora of different African countries heists them back.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s dev team is composed of people from African countries like Lesotho, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania, but during Summer Game Fest’s multi-day, demo-centric Play Days event, creative director Ben Myres, who is white and was raised in South Africa, manned the booth alone. This was not always the plan: Myres was originally going to be accompanied by another developer from South-Africa-based studio Nyamakop, whom Aftermath has granted anonymity due to their concerns that speaking out might exacerbate the challenges they’ve already faced entering the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't enjoy really long flights, and I am very aware of the current political climate in the US, especially towards South Africa,” the Nyamakop developer who was unable to attend SGF told Aftermath. “However, I was very keen on being present at SGF for this because it is a once in a lifetime announcement for a project that I am very passionate about and have seen so much of the team pour themselves into for years.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Relooted - Official Announcement Trailer | Day of the Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sUymkaLzxSY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the past, this developer said, they have managed to acquire a US visa “without any issue,” and have never stayed past their departure date or breached any terms within the country. But this time around, none of that mattered. While the consulate in South Africa allowed the developer to answer a few questions about the purpose of their stay – and, to support their responses, they brought along documents from relevant and highly reputable sources – they were immediately denied.</p><p>“I was definitely more prepared than the last time [I came to the US] and had even stronger motivations for travel and return,” they said. “Because time was short and I did not want to cause any delays, I ensured to carry as many supporting documents as I could. However, that did not matter because I was quickly denied under 214(b) without any of my documents even being looked at.”</p><p><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-denials.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the US Department of State</a>, a 214(b) denial means that an applicant “did not overcome the presumption of immigrant intent, required by law, by sufficiently demonstrating that you have strong ties to your home country that will compel you to leave the United States at the end of your temporary stay.” In other words, they’re worried that non-residents will overstay their welcome, perhaps permanently.&nbsp;</p><p>On average, <a href="https://visarefusal.com/214b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over one million visas are denied per year</a> under section 214(b), accompanied by vague explanations and no appeal process. Those who’ve been rejected can reapply, but if they’re like the Nyamakop developer – who already dotted their Is and crossed their Ts to the fullest extent of their ability – it can be hard to know where to start.</p><p>“I have no problem with being rejected if a valid reason is provided,” the developer said. “It would at least make it easier to get refunded for travel insurance.”</p><p>The Nyamakop developer said they weren’t alone in having trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>“At least three people before me in the queue were denied without having their documents looked at,” they said. “In fact, as I left the consulate, someone else who had their visa approved with no issue, who had no travel history and did not provide concrete travel plans, asked me if I noticed what was happening inside. You can probably guess what the main difference between myself and this other applicant is.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>You can probably guess what the main difference between myself and this other applicant is.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Myres believes he was only able to attend SGF on behalf of Nyamakop because of his unique history: While he was born in Australia, his parents moved to South Africa when he was just six months old. Due to their histories and his own, he possesses an Australian passport, a South African passport, and a British passport. This has repeatedly come in handy for Nyamakop, which – even prior to the past few years’ <a href="https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20240716104622512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documented increase</a> in refusal rates of visas from African countries – faced difficulties when it came to visiting Western countries.</p><p>"We had the same problem on our previous project where, if I didn't have a British passport, basically our company wouldn't exist,” Myres told Aftermath. “Because if you don't have enough lead time to go to important events, you just can't get a visa from an African country. And on [<em>Relooted</em>] specifically, it's kind of fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans [on the team] can't even visit those artifacts. Hundreds of dollars in visa application fees, and then it might get declined. Thousands of dollars for accommodations and flights just to even visit your own cultural heritage, and that's a best-case scenario. But in this case, most of the people on the continent can't even get a visa to travel [to the United States]."</p><p>You will not be surprised to learn, then, that Myres and company had other grand plans that were also quashed by visa woes.</p><p>"We were trying to get our narrative director to come [to SGF] as well, but she's going to Sweden, and basically her passport was stuck in Kenya at the Swedish embassy, because the Swedish embassy doesn't have an embassy in South Africa,” Myres said. “So the passport had to go to Kenya, and it was there for literally a month. So she didn't have a passport. She actually had a 10-year visa, so she should come, but trying to get to Europe made her unable to come to the US. She's only gonna get a passport tomorrow – six weeks later. There's no winning."</p><p>It should be noted that South Africa – with a population of 4.5 million white residents compared to thousands in other African countries – boasts the <a href="https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/lifestyle/top-10-african-countries-with-the-lowest-temporary-us-visa-rejection-rate/fh0kgh5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth lowest US visa refusal rate</a> of the 54 countries on the African continent. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/27/south-africa-30-years-after-apartheid-what-has-changed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Still grappling with a long, bloody history of colonialism and apartheid</a>, South Africa has recently become a rhetorical cudgel wielded by the likes of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who baselessly and cynically claim that “white genocide” is ravaging a country where, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-makes-false-claims-white-genocide-south-africa-during-ramaphosa-meeting-2025-05-21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Reuters</a>, the majority of murder victims are Black and, despite making up less than eight percent of the population, white people control around three-fourths of privately owned farmland. As per usual, observable reality has not moved Trump and his cronies, who this week used a firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado as an excuse to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5427998/trump-travel-ban-countries-immigration-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enact a travel ban</a> that targets countries in Africa and the Middle East – despite the fact that the man charged for the attack is from Egypt, which is not on the list.</p><p>"You've got some white South African asylum seekers in [the US] now, because apparently there's a white genocide going on," said Myres. "It's pretty messed up that people lying about being genocided can get a visa to come to your country, but actual people who have no interest in staying here – just coming for the event – can't get a visa. It's incredibly fucked up and unbelievable."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc"><h3>MindsEye Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>'It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-cyberpunk-2077-tech-review-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af87bff3bf78a/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CDPR</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7fExZx1QyU">Digital Foundry</a> has posted its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on the Switch 2, putting the game through its paces to see just how the main story and Phantom Liberty expansion hold up on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>To start, DF notes that the inclusion of Phantom Liberty itself is pretty remarkable given that developer CD Projekt Red opted to skip PS4 and Xbox One, favouring the beefier hardware seen in current-gen systems. The fact that the Switch 2 is able to handle this at all is commendable, but it should be said that this is where the hardware struggles the most.</p>
<p>As standard, Cyberpunk 2077 offers up four visual modes: 30fps quality and 40fps performance, with both also available as separate handheld options. Here's how each mode handles resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handheld Performance - 640x360 - 1280x720</li>
<li>Handheld Quality - 800x450 - 1440x810</li>
<li>Docked Performance - 960x540 - 1920x1080</li>
<li>Docked Quality - 1280x720 - 1920x1080</li>
</ul>
<p>DLSS is in use, but it's noted that high-paced action can cause a few visual hiccups, such as blurriness and temporal noise. However, outside of resolution, there's actually very little difference in visual quality between docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>When compared to other consoles, the Switch is running at the same texture quality setting as the PS5, putting it above Xbox Series X and PS4. Many in-game textures are purposefully the same across all platforms, but where there is a difference, the Switch 2 is actually one of the more accomplished consoles in this respect. Similarly, DLSS is put to great use, making image clarity a lot better on the Switch 2 when compared to the PS4.</p>
<p>On the flipside, the Switch 2 is a lot closer to the PS4 when it comes to pedestrian and vehicle density, so if the streets of Night City look a little quiet on the Switch 2, then you know why. It's largely done to ensure stable frame rates, but DF does still state that what the console is able to achieve is "impressive". With shadows, it's noted that indoor settings produce higher quality shadows than those seen on PS4, but outdoor shadows produced by the sun are actually slightly worse.</p>
<p>With frame rate, the Switch 2 holds up well, sticking to the 30fps target in quality mode for the main story. In the Phantom Liberty expansion, however, the more complex design of the environment causes frame rates on Switch 2 to drop as low as 20-25.</p>
<p>In the 40fps performance mode, the overall experience is a little bit of a mixed bag. Indoor areas are smoother, holding at around 40fps for the most part, but outdoor sections and busy shootouts actually cause the frame rate to drop down to 30fps or even slightly lower.</p>
<p>Finally, when playing handheld, it's estimated that frame rates are largely the same as docked, though DF isn't able to test this area properly. Thanks to VRR, however, it's said that portable play is probably the smoothest experience on Switch 2, though in instances where performance does drop below 30fps, it's a lot more noticeable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation and business segment meeting</a>, the latest update on PlayStation Plus from Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer, Hideaki Nishino, confirmed that Sony will continue to adjust its pricing strategy around PlayStation Plus, as the company is seeing that players are "<em>increasingly choosing our Premium and Extra tiers</em>."</p>
<p>The price of PlayStation Plus has increased twice so far in this generation, with the first major increase happening in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23852353/playstation-plus-prices-increase-essential-extra-premium">2023</a> and the next one just a couple of months ago in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">April 2025</a> (though the most recent increase applied only to major regions outside the US).</p>
<p>PS Plus is getting more expensive, and yet, despite the uproar around Sony increasing the price while also <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">seemingly giving players fewer first-party offerings</a> and the snail pace with which games are added to the Classics catalog of games available at the Premium tier, more players are choosing to pay for the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>
<p>"<em>We are focused on driving profitable growth by increasing engagement and appeal, and by continuously improving the service proposition and the content that we offer players and subscribers,</em>" Nishino said.</p>
<p>"<em>As a result, subscribers are increasingly choosing Premium and Extra tiers, which now represent approximately 38% of all subscribers.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a separate 'Fireside Chat' video that was released alongside the business segment presentation, Nishino was asked more directly about the PS Plus price increases, and how frequently he sees PlayStation being able to raise the price of the service.</p>
<p>"<em>PlayStation Plus is highly valued by our players and continues to drive engagement</em>," he began. "<em>We are already seeing a trend towards the option of higher tiers within our service, as evidenced by the subscriber mix we achieved in FY2024, where approximately 38% are now subscribed to PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra tier. This is even after the global price increases we implemented in FY2023, and more recently, the local price increases in selected countries to improve our pricing strategy across certain market clusters, and also to account for [foreign exchange] movements</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These price increases were partly a result of increasing value we bring to the players, through the quality and diversity of content we continue to add, as well as investment in features to improve the service further, such as player personalization and enhanced content discovery. The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value, and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability</em>."</p>
<p>Nishino isn't directly confirming that we should expect more price increases, but maximizing profitability for a product, while adding features to it, doesn't usually equal a price decrease for that product.</p>
<p>For how upset players seem to get about the price increases when they happen, the numbers show that, increasingly, there's more who don't care that the price is going up, and want to keep paying for at least the Extra tier to get access to the large catalog of games available at the higher levels of PS Plus.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's recent openness to bringing its biggest Xbox Series X|S games to PlayStation 5 has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">a boon for sales</a>. But the benefits for Xbox owners may not go both ways, as a trio of big upcoming Microsoft-published games are skipping physical releases on Xbox Series X|S. PS5 gamers, on the other hand, will be able to get physical editions of all three.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-physical-edition-for-ps5-is-only-40/1100-6532287/" data-ref-id="1100-6532287">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> are the three games in question, as seen on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FCJY74BS,B0FCJHHYZY,B0FCJTVGKZ,B0FCJC4CQJ,B0FCJYV9DY,B0FCJFY734,B0FCHZ55LQ&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>. But it doesn't appear to be a case of Microsoft favoring PS5 over its own console. Instead, it seems to be part of Microsoft's broader push towards digital-only releases.</p><p>Instead of coming with a physical disc, The Other Worlds 2 and Ninja Gaiden 4 will only be packaged with a download code in Series X|S boxes. Strangely enough, Gears of War: Reloaded won't even have that physical option. It's strictly a digital release except on PS5.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer indicated that the majority of Xbox game sales are digital. Spencer also said that Microsoft was simply "following what the customers are doing." But the shift away from physical releases appears to be accelerating for Microsoft this year. That may be in part due to the uncertainty over whether the gaming industry will be seriously affected by the Trump administration's tariffs.</p><p>Of the three games, Gears of War: Reloaded will be released first on August 26 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Ninja Gaiden 4 and The Outer Worlds 2 will follow on all three platforms on October 20 and October 29, respectively. Brandon Adler, the game director of The Outer Worlds 2, recently shared his response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">Microsoft setting the price for that sequel at $80</a>.</p>

                <p>Epic Games surprised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> fans on Friday when it <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1933515577580024139" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that the next update, which was slated to introduce Season 9 of Fortnite Festival next Tuesday, has been delayed. Fortunately, the delay is about as short as it can get, as the patch has been pushed back just one day to Wednesday, June 18. Epic gave no reason for the delay.</p><p>The move is a surprising one, as it's rare for a patch to be delayed in advance by just a day. Normally, Epic doesn't openly discuss patch timing--it just deploys it when it's ready with half a day's notice. This patch gets a public acknowledgement of its delay because it comes with the new Festival season launch, which has been scheduled for June 17 for months. The delay means that the current Sabrina Carpenter pass <a href="https://x.com/FNFestStatus/status/1933516051834094022" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be extended</a> by one day.</p><p>Usually when a patch gets bumped from Tuesday to Wednesday it's because that week's Monday was a holiday--Epic doesn't deploy big updates when its employees aren't in the office. While June 16 is not a US holiday, there is one later in the week: Juneteenth, on Thursday. It could be that Epic is observing the holiday early instead of during the middle of the week.</p><p>While Season 9 of Fortnite Festival was long rumored to have Daft Punk as its headlining act, it's now looking as though the featured artist will actually be Deadmau5. When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-super/2900-6649/" data-ref-id="2900-6649">the new superhero season</a> began in Battle Royale on June 7, the updated map included <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931444514658422923" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadmau5 posters</a>, similar to the way Epic teased Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter ahead of their season launches. While it's not yet confirmed that Deadmau5 is headlining, he's by far the most plausible candidate right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve been checking out a lot of new Switch 2 accessories recently, almost all of which were produced before the companies that made them ever touched a real Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference in dimensions could completely throw off a design, and some products I’ve tried lack a perfect fit. For example, Genki’s Attack Vector <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l7hpz6/warning_for_switch_2_owners_who_bought_an_attack/">has problems</a>, which the company is now reworking. It’s probably not the only one. However, Dbrand’s Killswitch kit offers the best fit and best protection right out of the gate.</p><p>I adored the kit when I tested it on my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23373094/dbrand-project-killswitch-steam-deck-case-magnet-stand">Steam Deck</a>, and this one doesn’t mess with the winning formula. Dbrand had to engineer its own USB-C dock adapter since a Killswitch-equipped console doesn’t fit in Nintendo’s dock. Its adapter is included, with no cutbacks to visual fidelity in docked mode. It’s a little clunky, but I’m mainly just happy that it works, so I don’t have to take the Killswitch off every time I want to dock the Switch 2.</p><p>The most basic “Essentials” kit is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$59.95</a> and includes a grippy, form-fitting shell that latches around the Switch 2’s back, slightly latching around the front. It can be secured to your console with some small adhesive strips. A separate, adhesive-backed strip of protection for the kickstand comes with the kit, too. Dbrand includes two Joy-Con 2 shells that have thick, textured grips that make them significantly more comfortable to use without adding too much weight. Unlike Joy-Con shells from other accessory makers, these were as easy to install as I hoped they would be, sliding securely into place thanks to the Killswitch’s tough, but just-malleable-enough materials.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Each component that attaches to the Switch 2 is malleable enough to easily fit onto its pieces, but secure enough not to wiggle off.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$79.85</a> “Travel” option adds a tough latch-on cover that protects the front of your Switch 2, and a tray that fits within it for storing up to 10 game cartridges. Of the cases I’ve tried so far, I have the fewest reservations about putting my Switch 2 in this one. With the front cover on, it provides hard case protection. When detached, it offers solid protection with an understated look for the parts of the Switch 2 that are most vulnerable to damage.</p><p>The most expensive <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$99.80</a> “Ultra” kit includes everything mentioned above, plus additional stick grips and two glass screen protectors. The added cost isn’t outrageous if you still need a screen protector.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>The Killswitch secures to the Switch 2 and Joy-Con 2 with a small lip that keeps it on. And yet, it’s simple to remove if you want to.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Killswitch is great. I often forget that it’s installed. I thought I’d miss the console’s slim design, arguably one of its biggest selling points compared to chunkier handhelds like the Steam Deck. But, after mainly using a Deck instead of the aging Switch, I’m spoiled by big grips, and the Killswitch turns the Switch 2 into something that I want to use in handheld mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you pine for the rotting corridors and tactical limb-surgery of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>, it looks like Bloober's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> may have you covered. Fresh from revealing that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">remaking the first Silent Hill</a>, the Polish team have released a new trailer for Cronos that shows off more of its bubble-suited third-person gunnery.</p>
<p>In particular, it spotlights the Merge mechanic, whereby guttural tendril beasts known as Orphans devour the corpses of their brethren to enhance their abilities. It's implied that they can do this more than once, so be sure to clean up after yourself. As in so many other walks of life, punctual incineration may be the cure.

I find the trailer interesting for a couple of reasons. The simpler draw is that, yes, this sure does reek of Dead Space, my beloved. In particular, the Merging mechanic calls to mind those awful Necromorph facehugger equivalents who'd scuttle around reanimating cadavers. And let's not forget the crawling arms and legs that'd sneakily join up into a Biggermorph if left unattended. How I hated them. Can't fault the animation, though. Excellently horrible.
</p>
<p>
The other reason that interests me is that it's continuing a theme for Bloober, a developer who love to tell stories about torturously overlapping dimensions. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/observer">Observer</a> - Bloober's best game to date, for my money - explored the familiar cyberpunk premise of ailing flesh and masonry corrupted by digital technology. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a> gave you a splitscreen view of 90s Poland and an adjoining fungal purgatory inspired by Zdzisław Beksiński's surrealist landscapes. And in Cronos: New Dawn, you're an agent of the "Collective" alternating between a shattered post-apocalypse and the 1980s, your job being to digitise and extract lost souls from the past for safe archiving in the future. All of this reflects Bloober's creative debts to the Silent Hill series, with its parallel realities. 
</p>
<p>
Those themes extend into a mechanical focus on the implications of blending things or splitting them apart. In Observer, the splicing of digital and non-digital realms produces a grating, fizzy nightmare, to be forensically dissected using your bionic eye. In The Medium, you'll cut through seams of flesh with an icky razor even as you try to reconcile the architecture of the mundane and the otherworldly. And in Cronos, you have to worry about merging enemies, which seems to parody the Collective's goal of recovering and pooling the electronic spirits of the long-dead.</p>
<p>I realise this is quite fast-and-loose analysis, but in my defence, I am writing up a 90 second trailer in the fateful closing moments of the working day, racing against the sunset to finish a piece, and it was either this or waxing lyrical about gunfeel. Cronos: The New Dawn is out later this year on Steam and Epic Games Store.

                <p>For the first time, more people are using a PS5 console than a PS4, according to Sony. In a new look at the business of PlayStation, Sony noted that PS5 had more monthly active users when compared to PS4, with the combined playerbase now at 124 million users, as of March 31.</p><p><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony said that it had 49 million monthly users each</a> on PS5 and PS4, as of April 30, 2024. While it hasn't provided exact figures on just how many people are now on PS5 compared to PS4, the accompanying slide does suggest that there has been a significant change here. Spending has also increased, with Sony noting that people were spending more on peripherals, services, and content.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4513416-sony-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513416" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4513416-sony-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513416"></a><figcaption>Sony's graph slide showing the MAU split between PS5 and PS4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4513416-sony-2025.jpg"></figure><p>It took over four years for the PS5 to surpass the PS4 in this category, but there are several reasons for this. The PS5 suffered from stock shortages when it first launched, and most games were available on both PlayStation platforms. This included several big sports titles and other AAA releases, which are generally considered to be some of the big drivers behind adopting new console hardware.</p><p>As the current console generation has continued, more games launching only for current-gen hardware and console exclusives, alongside various entry points for the PS5, have helped make it a more appealing purchase.</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/">Sony also commented on its next-gen gaming console</a> during its business presentation. The company isn't prepared to shift entirely to cloud gaming yet, as it says the majority of its users prefer "local execution" of games.
