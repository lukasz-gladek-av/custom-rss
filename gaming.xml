			<p>With mere days separating us from the official launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-beta-has-been-canned-campaign-length-is-around-12-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2</a>, Saber Interactive has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4238536974144553830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> with the community a detailed post-launch roadmap that covers a full year of support.</p>
<p>Season 1 will include some free updates, such as support for Ultrawide displays, Private PvE lobbies, and a Sparring Arena to be added in the Battle Barge. Meanwhile, Season Pass owners will get the Ultramarines Cosmetic Pack.</p>
<p>In Season 2, slated to go live around the end of October, the developers will introduce new PvE missions, a new enemy, a new Lethal difficulty, and a new weapon (the Neo-Volkite pistol). Those who bought the Season Pass are receiving a Champion Pack, a Cosmetic Pack, and a Weapon Skin Pack themed around the Dark Angeles.

            <p>
Bandai Namco will shut down the servers of its anime MMORPG Blue Protocol in Japan and has cancelled its release in the West.
</p>
<p>
Blue Protocol was released in Japan in June 2023, with the forthcoming western release managed by Amazon Games.
</p>
<p>
However, in a new statement from the <a href="https://www.playblueprotocol.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-blue-protocol">developers on the game's website</a>, the "difficult decision" has been made to end service as "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".
</p>

<p>

"We know this is disappointing news, and we share your disappointment. We love the world and characters of Blue Protocol, and we were excited to welcome players around the world into Regnas. We join Bandai Namco Online in expressing deep gratitude to the passionate fans who followed Blue Protocol development and participated in the Closed Technical Test."
</p>
<p>

Further, a <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507">statement from Bandai Namco</a> reads: "We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.
</p>
<p>
"We know there has been great anticipation for Blue Protocol since the first announcement of the game. We wanted to deliver an experience that is like stepping into the world of anime, and we have been challenging ourselves to create a world where each and every player can enjoy adventures as the main character of the anime. We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply apologise for the sudden announcement."
</p>
<p>
The Japanese servers will remain online until Saturday 18th January 2025.
</p>
<p>
I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol last year</a>, which was set to follow the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> and New World as Amazon Games' next big MMO. However, I had concerns of whether the game could differentiate itself from its key competitors.

</p>
<p>
The game didn't receive a particularly positive response from Japanese players, but it's a shame the game has been cancelled before it really got started with a global audience.

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that they are shutting down their online action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> in Japan, and cancelling their plans to release the game in the West in collaboration with Amazon Games.</p>
<p>The Japanese version of Blue Protocol will shut down on 18th January 2025.</p>


<p>On the West-facing site for the game, the team behind it said, “<span>We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of BLUE PROTOCOL, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.”</span></p>
<p>Bandai Namco’s more general statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>We regret to inform you that the Japanese version of Blue Protocol will be discontinued on Saturday January 18, 2025.</p>
<p>As a result, we have also canceled our plans to release a Western version of the game in collaboration with Amazon Games. We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.</p>
<p>We know there has been great anticipation for Blue Protocol since the first announcement of the game. We wanted to deliver an experience that is like stepping into the world of anime, and we have been challenging ourselves to create a world where each and every player can enjoy adventures as the main character of the anime. We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize for the sudden announcement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blue Protocol took an intriguing approach to the MMORPG, featuring a classless character system that would allow a great deal of flexibility for setting your own role within a player group, and a fun anime-styled world that quickly grabbed 600,000 players shortly after the game’s launch in Japan.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco partnered with Amazon Games to bring the game to the West, entering into a degree of co-development that sought to tailor the game through Amazon’s more Western perspective. The game had targeted a 2024 release round these parts, but never got the chance, as Bandai Namco has now pulled the plug on the project as a whole.</p>

Crytek is working to remove the footage from YouTube, with videos now displaying a message that confirms a copyright claim by the company. However, <a href="https://youtu.be/mvCXa21r3Ug?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some remain live</a> at the time of publication.</p><p>Crytek never announced Crysis Next, and it appears it was canceled in favor of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/crysis-4">Crysis 4</a>, which was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crysis-4-announced">announced in January 2022</a>. Crytek declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p>Given the battle royale boom sparked by PUBG and Fortnite in the late 2010s, it's perhaps no surprise to learn that Crytek experimented with the genre. Many developers tried their hand at capitalising on battle royale during the period, some successful, some less so, some even failing to launch.

The first game in the series, released in 2007, was often used as a PC benchmark given the demands it would make of PCs at the time. Crysis was so demanding that it spawned the now infamous catchphrase, “But can it run Crysis?”, which was used in the years following the game’s release to deliver a verdict on a PC spec.</p><p>The last mainline game in the series, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/crysis-3">Crysis 3</a>, came out in February 2013.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-5-0-releases-new-natlan-region.965706/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/genshin-impact-releases-new-natlan-region<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> 5.0 has brought Natlan, widening the world of Teyvat to include its sixth region, as part of the 'Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn' update.</p>
<p>Natlan is available to everyone who's completed the Mondstadt Archon Quests; meaning, even if you're a Genshin Impact newbie, you can still travel beyond the Sumeru desert to the Nation of Pyro. Though, if you want to explore its storyline, you'll have to be Adventure Rank 28 or higher and have completed all of Liyue's Archon Quests.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Genshin_Impact_Natlan_2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>HoYoverse</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When journeying across Natlan, you'll encounter the tribes who make their home there and live alongside the Saurians - creatures who are also known as the dragons of Natlan. While there are six tribes in total, only three are available upon Genshin 5.0's release and you'll be able to learn more about them through the Tribal Chronicles. Replacing Story Quests, the Tribal Chronicles offer you the chance to learn more about each tribe through completing a three act quest.</p>

<p>Genshin 5.0's unique feature, however, are the Saurians and how you'll gain the ability to embody the three connected to the tribes released as part of the update - the Tepetlisaurus, Yumkasaurus and Koholasaurus. (Try saying those names three times.) I mean that literally too as you'll physically transform into the Saurian of your choosing; granting you access to both its traversal and combat abilities.</p>

<p>Having been given a preview of Genshin Impact 5.0 during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last week, I'll openly admit I spent most of my time messing about as a Saurian; tunnelling up a cliff as a Tepetlisaurus or shooting myself through the air as a Yumkasaurus. These traversal abilities succeed in cutting down the amount of time you'll spend journeying across Natlan. After all, why would you waste time walking up a hill, when you can simply dig to its summit? Fighting as a Saurian does take some getting used to - I kept accidentally burying myself underground as a Tepetlisaurus and you can't switch characters - but, once you find your combat rhythm, you'll find the Saurians to be quite effective. Though keep in mind that, while you travel freely as a Saurian in Natlan, you can only conduct the transformations in specific locations. Due to this, it's worth considering exactly where you are when you return to human-form to avoid spending time hunting down the nearest transformation spot. </p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Genshin_Impact_Natlan_4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Kachina. | <span>Image credit: <cite>HoYoverse</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally, as is the way with HoYoverse games, a new update means a new roster of characters for you to pull from Banners. (And spend your real world money on if you really must.) The first half of Genshin 5.0 brings Mualani, a five-star Hydro catalyst wielder, and Kachina, a four-star Geo polearm wielder. Though you can recruit Kachina for free by completing Act 1 of Natlan's Archon Quest. Meanwhile, the second half of Genshin 5.0 sees the release of Kinich - a five-star Dendro claymore user who's mates with a little sunglasses wearing pixel dragon. No. I'm not joking.</p>

            <p>
Final Fantasy 14 producer and director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> would like to "further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers" following the release of the MMORPG on Microsoft's console.
</p>
<p>
The game's arrival on Xbox was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-heading-to-xbox">announced at the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in Las Vegas last year</a>, where Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> took to the stage. It then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-gets-official-xbox-release-date">released on 21st March</a>, with latest expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail</a> being the first to release alongside PC and PlayStation.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, Yoshida noted players have been "waiting a long time for the Xbox release" but it's had "a really strong response" with communities growing on the platform.

<p>

He then spoke more generally about bringing Final Fantasy games to Microsoft's console.
</p>
<p>
"Of course, when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a> was released, at that point in time Final Fantasy 14 was not available on Xbox," he said. "And it is a fact that currently, Final Fantasy 16 is not available on Xbox. So with that in mind, it is true that because of the amount of time that has elapsed since then, the Final Fantasy fanbase on Xbox has reduced.
</p>
<p>
"With Final Fantasy 14 as an opportunity, we can take this opportunity to strengthen the community on Xbox towards the Final Fantasy franchise. I think this is where we would take more communication and work on establishing the community moving forward. And this is important, not for Final Fantasy 14, but, I would say, for Square Enix. With Final Fantasy 14's release on Xbox, Phil Spencer spent a lot of his time and a lot of effort and put in a lot of hard work into making it a reality. So we would like to make the best of that and further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers moving forward."
</p>
<p>
Yoshida noted, as a general argument, that Xbox has struggled in Japan due to the low number of users. "Naturally, because we are Japanese developers, we have a desire for many people in our country to play our games," said Yoshida, adding it's "really a tough point in terms of a business standpoint".
</p>
<p>
He continued: "However, at Square Enix, we have been changing our policy. So now we are moving towards the policy of releasing our games on a multiplatform basis, and we really want as many players as possible to play our titles. So with Final Fantasy 14 as the starting point, we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox. So I hope players will look forward to future things to come on the platform."
</p>
<p>
Back in May, Square Enix released a medium-term business plan alongside its financial report, stating the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">company is "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a> as part of a move to "diversify earnings opportunities".

</p>
<p>
It seems the release of Final Fantasy 14 on Xbox - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">company's most profitable game</a> - is a major step forward in this strategy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/star-wars-outlaws-002-patch-notes-ps5-save-file-new-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has released a hefty patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> after the game’s Early Access release, and before the full launch on 30th August, and it comes with a big pain point for players on PS5, potentially forcing them to restart the game entirely. Not a good look, Ubisoft…</p>
<p>Version 1.000.002 is out now across all platforms – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> and PC – weighing in at around 8.5GB, and coming with the following, very brief patch notes:</p>


<ul>
<li>Adds 40fps support for compatible displays</li>
<li>Addresses performance issues</li>
<li>Numerous bug fixes across the game</li>
</ul>
<p>Exclusively for PS5, though, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/star-wars-outlaws/article/star-wars-outlaws-issues-with-an-outdated-version-on-playstation-5/000109614?origin=search">Ubisoft note</a> that “We are aware of an issue in Star Wars Outlaws where some players on PlayStation 5 may be playing on an outdated version of the game.”</p>
<p>The only way to resolve this is to install version 1.000.002 update and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/star-wars-outlaws/gameplay/article/starting-a-new-game-in-star-wars-outlaws/000109496">start a new game</a> to avoid “any potential issues and blockers”.</p>
<p>This is so significant for player progression in the game, that they have even been emailing early players of the game to prompt them to make sure they have downloaded the update and restarted the game, potentially wiping out hours of game time. Frustratingly, these emails are <a href="https://x.com/Fabio_vincent/status/1828534168600617187">seemingly coming 4-5 hours into the game</a>, well after the patch has already been applied.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1f2rbpu/just_got_this_email_from_ubisoft_everyone_who_got/">The email reads</a>: “To best experience the Outer Rim, we rolled out a maintenance to make sure everyone is playing the latest version of the game. As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after the recent patch. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. […] Once you’ve confirmed you have the latest version, please start a new save to fully enjoy Star Wars Outlaws as our team intended. If you continue on a prior save, you will unfortunately face issues and progression blockers.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, we weren’t affected by any issues while reviewing the game over the past week, and it’s possible that not all players are affected. Given the timing, it’s also fairly likely that the most players are already on the updated game before starting their game.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed our time in the Star Wars universe, with Gamoc saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">our review</a>, “Star Wars Outlaws is an open world scoundrel-’em-up that clearly builds on Ubisoft’s familiar format, but that’s not a bad thing. The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It’s not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.”</p>

            <p>Workers at Nacon-owned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall 2</a> studio Spiders have penned an open letter “to their employer” detailing grievances over a period of several years, and called for a strike in response to “management’s continued refusal” to take their concerns seriously. 44 of Spider’s 95 workers have signed the <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/">document, made public through French union Stjv</a> in the hope that it “will finally push management to act in the best interests of employees and the company.”</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>This document covers several years of known problems, which have been greatly amplified over the past year with the arrival of the current head of the company: instability, opposition to anticipating problems and securing working conditions, global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems, refusal to acknowledge worker representation and blocked negotiations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The open letter is the second that unhappy Spiders employees have penned, following an earlier document and related strike on January 19. “Since then,” the workers in question write, “new negotiations have begun on wages, and conditions in the studio have continued to deteriorate.”</p>
<p>The document itself consists of 20 pages outlining the issues, and ends with a list of demands “to secure our lives, our careers and the company in the short and long term.” The listed issues include “a blatant lack of transparency on all aspects of the company”, “A difficult production cycle for Greedfall 2”, and “Management's adamant refusal to acknowledge collective action”.</p>
<p>Their demands, broadly, are greater transparency and worker representation, an end to an “authoritarian and ineffective centralization of power”, greater freedom to work from home, wage increases commensurate with other Nacon studios, and “immediate rectification of all wage discrimination against women and non-binary people”.</p>
<p>The document also features several cartoons featuring characters from Spiders’ games.</p>

<p>“In light of management’s continued refusal to discuss, take the problems raised seriously and act to rectify them”, Spiders staff are calling for a strike to take place next week, starting September 2. “In particular, we will be organising pickets on September 2 and 3 in front of the company’s offices and online on a Minecraft server created for the occasion.”</p>
<p>We’ve had some positive news recently on the labour front. In the same week last month, both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">World of Warcraft workers</a> formed wall-to-wall unions.

            <p>There’s nowt more magical than the lambent inscriptions of tangled sigils required to spell places like Ainderby Quernhow, Weedley Copse, or Upper Poppleton. A shiny whippet to the first of you to correctly identify which of these are real, and which were invented for “roguelite word <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sternly-worder-adventures">Sternly Worded Adventures</a>. Actually, scratch that. I’m not made of whippets, and you can just as easily find out yourself via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2562130/Sternly_Worded_Adventures/">Steam demo</a>. I think you should, if only because “I killed a slime by spelling out the word Toblerone” is easily in my top ten gaming moments of the year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Wait. What?! What do you shitting mean ‘Toblerone’ isn’t a word?</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/20240828080957_1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>A bloody travesty, is what that is. I’ll show you sternly worded, mate. Here’s how the game describes itself. Although, as we’ve already established, it’s not above lying to your actual face.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sternly Worded Adventures is a roguelite word puzzle RPG inspired by Bookworm Adventures where you travel through a forested peninsula with Yorkshire-sounding place names fighting monsters with the power of words to uncover whatever dark secrets may be lurking beyond.</p></blockquote>
<p>The game also boasts over 8 different classes, 15+ enemies, 180+ items, and the chance to “Spell words with over 25 different letters”. That last one took me a second, but I actually forgive you for the Toblerone affront now.</p>
<p>The demo itself seems pretty generous, giving you a good chunk of adventure, plus “full access [to] both of the Wordle and Minesweeper inspired minigames, without limit.” Big fan of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wordle"> Wordle</a>, despite never having played it, on account of it effectively allowing me to complain about Toblerones for a living.</p>
<p>I couldn’t end this piece without asking for an opinion from our resident Yorkshireman Edwin, of course. Here’s what he had to say about the game making a mockery of the good people of Wigglesworth: "Wigglesworth is in North Yorkshire, the Oop Northenest of the northern English counties - Durham, Cumbria and Northumberland don't count because they've been infiltrated by the Scots and turned into factories for battered Mars Bars, and don't even get me started about chuffing Tyne &amp; Wear, which sounds like a brand of shaving foam. I used to live on the border of North Yorkshire as a lad. We didn't get any Toblerones in those days, just foil-wrapped pieces of drystone wall, and if we'd seen a slime crossing the green we'd have et it. This game looks daft as a brush."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Cats are meant to have nine lives, but it looks like no-one told a mischievous black tabby named Pluto that. Eviscerated by a careless driver on a rainy night, poor one-life Pluto finds himself stuck in the afterlife. Where, after a comical misunderstanding over a few broken statues, he is commanded to clean cat ‘purr’gatory – cat puns, this review’s got ‘em – for all eternity. Still, it’s not all bad, as this neat storyline set-up sends Pluto on a charming video game adventure, one that is a delight from beginning to end.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crypt Custodian – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSgnBzIrRtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Played from a top-down perspective, Crypt Custodian mixes an old-school Zelda aesthetic and accompanying sword-slashing gameplay with the labyrinthian structure of a modern-day metroidvania. Pluto searches the afterlife, makes cute friends, solves ingeniously devious puzzles, discovers satisfyingly secret paths, and bashes a fair few brutal bosses for good measure. The narrative accompanying Pluto’s adventures is easy going and genuinely humorous. Indeed, if someone was trying to cram in cat puns, they might even refer to the dialogue as being, ‘hiss’terical. Sorry, I’m just kitten around.</p>


<p>Visually, Crypt Custodian is simple, but simply oozes charm. With just a few frames of animation, Pluto has more charisma than numerous AAA protagonists. The world he explores is equally as engaging; fish can be seen swimming in deep-blue water, haze glimmers across moonlit swamps, and caves glisten with unearthly light. The fact that the whole game was put together by just one guy is frankly mind-blowing, Kyle Thompson must get up very early in the morning to make games this good.</p>


<p>Looking at Crypt Custodian it would be tempting to think that the whimsical visuals and light-weight storytelling would lead to flaccid combat, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Pluto is a dab paw with a broom, so much so that he’d make a Samurai Pizza Cat green with envy. Thwacking a foe will have you feline good. Each strike is cathartic in its impact, with a genuine sense of collision as the unwitting baddie is sent flying. Meanwhile, Pluto can dodge and dash with the agility of a, <em>well, </em>cat. In short, the combat is fast, thrilling and responsive, particularly as the screen fills up with foes to take out.</p>
<p>This is a challenging game, no doubt. And with no easy mode, not necessarily an accessible one either. But, if you like your games tricky, then thanks to some supremely smart design decisions, Crypt Custodian never lurches into frustration. Take the enemy attack indicators, which clearly demonstrate when a cute demon jar thingy is going to attack and where, all you need to do is react accordingly. Soon you’ll be analysing the risks of a room-full of baddies, assessing each upcoming attack to time your dodge, plan your route through the melee, and follow-up with a right good broom bash.</p>

<p>The same applies to the brilliant platforming, which might just be the best example of the jumping art that I’ve ever seen integrated into a top-down game. Leaping from a top-down perspective can be fraught with difficulty, as it’s often impossible for the player to tell if they are going to land safely or not. Kyle’s elegant solution to this conundrum really is the cat’s whiskers. A simple on-screen icon lurks around Pluto’s lower paws, if it’s white in colour you know you will land on solid ground, if it switches to red you know you’re going to plummet to your doom. Then, with a generous dose of mid-air control, the player can correct their landing with confidence. This balance of precision and control has allowed Kyle to really ratchet up the platforming intensity, creating some thrilling set-pieces that will push your skills to the limit, but never your patience.</p>
<p>Crypt Custodian is suitably vast in scale, with huge areas to explore and then re-explore with your new-found abilities. Yet the world is so cram-packed with creatures to meet and secrets to uncover that the enormous environment feel alive. Which is more than can be said for poor one-life Pluto. Yet, when the afterlife is this much fun, perhaps having nine-lives is overrated?</p>

            <p>Exterminatus. Exterminatus. You’re all exterminatused. None of you are free of sin. Except, maybe Focus Interactive are actually? While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-boss-explains-space-marine-2s-microtransactions-people-dont-want-to-be-sold-horse-armour-anymore">extra for cosmetics</a> a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/">year one roadmap</a> does at least look piously forthright.</p>
<p>Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/screw-it-im-building-a-house-of-graphics-cards">made out of graphics cards</a>), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Oblivion</a>'s infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a>’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.</p>
<p>Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:</p>

<p>“The Season Pass has been envisioned as a way to enhance your customisation for your character,” reads the update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/">on Steam</a>. “All the gameplay additions listed here in the roadmap (including weapons, game modes, and maps) are intended to arrive in *free game patches* and will be accessible to everyone.”</p>
<p>The paid portion of the roadmap is only available to season pass owners. Currently, that means players who purchase either the £80/€90/$90 “Gold Edition” or the £90/€100/$100 “Ultra Edition”. Of the bits listed on the plan, I can see the Dark Angels pack stinging a bit - they’re one of the more visually distinct chapters, all flowing capes and ornate livery. This guy even has a <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/dark-angels-azrael-2023">personal helmet Jawa</a>. For the price of the ultra edition, you could buy three little plastic helmet Jawas <em>and</em> a meal deal <em>and then </em>you could balance your Double Decker on top of the three helmet Jawas <em>and then</em> you could say “render my snack unto me, faithful servants.” It wouldn’t work, but it’d be a good time regardless.</p>

			<p>The Blue Protocol development team <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that the free-to-play MMORPG will soon shut down in Japan. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-debut-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> in 2019, the game launched in Japan in Spring 2023. However, it didn't gather a large enough fanbase to keep going, and the live service is now scheduled to end on Saturday, January 18, 2025. The developers said they'll keep updating Blue Protocol with new stories until near the end, though.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-global-may-never-launch-as-bandai-namco-online-goes-insolvent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on developer Bandai Namco Online Studios going insolvent a couple of months ago, which cast a long shadow on the scheduled global launch. Indeed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-confirmed-for-2023-launch-on-pc-amazon-will-publish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publisher</a> Amazon Games stopped referring to Blue Protocol's Western debut a while ago, and they have confirmed today that the launch outside Japan is not happening.</p>
<p><em><span>In their statement announcing the end of service, Bandai Namco Online said, “We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of BLUE PROTOCOL, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.” </span>We know this is disappointing news, and we share your disappointment. We love the world and characters of BLUE PROTOCOL, and we were excited to welcome players around the world into Regnas. We join Bandai Namco Online in expressing deep gratitude to the passionate fans who followed BLUE PROTOCOL development and participated in the Closed Technical Test.</em></p>
<p>Blue Protocol offered action-packed combat with five classes and lots of dungeons and raids to go through. The news is certainly disappointing for MMORPG fans, although Amazon remains highly committed to the genre, as evidenced by the imminent releases of <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a>&nbsp;(October 1, following a small delay) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-qa-amazon-confirms-amd-fsr-hdr-support-and-keyboard-mouse-option-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World Aeternum</a> (October 15), not to mention the ongoing work on The Lord of the Rings MMO, which however is still at an early stage of development.</p>

<p>Crysis Next was a developing free-to-play battle royale shooter set at the heart of the Crysis universe. It was penned to be a multiplayer-focused, third-person game that had years of work put into it before it was assumedly and quietly cancelled by Crytek. In 2020, rumours regarding the Crysis battle royale game started to surface, but this is one of the first occasions that we’ve seen gameplay leak.</p>



<p>Crytek, the series’ developer, has been issuing takedown notices against those uploading the content and sharing it online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>In the gameplay videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvCXa21r3Ug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">showcasing Crysis Next</a>, the cancelled battle royale project, we get a glimpse at a rudimentary multiplayer platform that looks as though it wasn’t too far into the development cycle.</p>



<p>It was never formally acknowledged by Crytek, and before the team had a chance to confirm it existed, Crysis 4 was announced. It has been around two years since the firm revealed that a new Crysis game sits on the horizon, and nothing more than a short teaser has been delivered, leaving fans to wonder what’s happening with the long-awaited sequel.</p>



<p>It has been more than a decade since the launch of Crysis 3, and players are hungry for more nanosuit-powered adventures.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Crysis Next, which was poised to take advantage of the battle royale boom, will never see the light of day. It had <strong>potential</strong>, giving players the ability to customise and control a powerful nanosuit and assume one of three roles: Frontliner, Tactician, and Flanker. It would have assumedly been a power-driven battle royale with large, open maps, but that’s mostly conjecture.</p>



<p>It’s not known <strong>when </strong>Crysis Next was cancelled, we just know that it <strong>was</strong>.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco and Amazon Games have jointly confirmed that Blue Protocol, an anime-inspired MMORPG, has been cancelled and will no longer see a global release. It was due to launch worldwide after being released in Japan, but Bandai Namco announced today that in January 2025, the game will be shut down entirely.</p>



<p>This news comes after almost a decade of development, with Amazon Games confirming in 2022 that it has been in the works since 2015.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-be-possible-to-provide-a-service-that-satisfies">‘Not Be Possible to Provide a Service that Satisfies’</h2>



<p>In a statement published on <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Bandai Namco website</a>, the shutdown of Blue Protocol was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We regret to inform you that the Japanese version of Blue Protocol will be discontinued on Saturday January 18, 2025.</p>



<p>As a result, we have also canceled our plans to release a Western version of the game in collaboration with Amazon Games. We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.</p>



<p>We know there has been great anticipation for Blue Protocol since the first announcement of the game. We wanted to deliver an experience that is like stepping into the world of anime, and we have been challenging ourselves to create a world where each and every player can enjoy adventures as the main character of the anime. We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.</p>



<p>We deeply apologize for the sudden announcement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Featuring sumptuous visuals, innovative character and enemy designs, and a semi-open-world environment, Blue Protocol had all the makings of a solid MMO. It impressed players during testing phases, and it was due to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in all markets next year.</p>



<p>It’s a sudden shock, but this live service game will be sunsetted in January 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-tarkov-pve-good/</link>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s relatively new PvE offering split the global community down the middle. On one side, you had the players falling in love with the fresh mode put forward by Battlestate Games, and on the other, there were the players that rebelled against it, stressing that it’s ‘not the point of Tarkov’.</p>



<p>I’ve been neck-deep in Escape from Tarkov PvE for several weeks, being one of the first players to access it by purchasing the controversial Unheard Edition of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>So, is Escape from Tarkov PvE good, or is it a complete waste of time?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-escape-from-tarkov-pve-worth-it">Is Escape from Tarkov PvE Worth It?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform offers almost everything that the primary PvP platform does, but it brings with it countless benefits. Firstly, your load times are almost completely eradicated, with some raids taking less than 20 seconds to load. That’s a huge win – especially when a wipe has just hit Escape from Tarkov and server queues are massive.</p>



<p>On that topic, that’s another advantage. In PvE, the game only wipes when you want it to – Battlestate Games doesn’t force it upon you. If you’re a slower player with less free time, this is a <strong>massive </strong>win, as it means you can progress through the game at your pace, hitting milestones that you never would have been able to if you were confined to the six-month wipe schedule that’s typically in Tarkov.</p>



<p>Many players have opted to jump into Tarkov PvE to avoid the plethora of cheaters that plague the main game. It’s no big secret that Escape from Tarkov has an issue with cheaters, but they’re not there in the PvE environment, which means you’ll <strong>never </strong>be killed by a suspicious player.</p>



<p>And talking of other players, PvE is also cooperative, which means you can still enjoy a raid or two with friends to back you up.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-tarkov-pve-have-the-same-features-as-pvp">Does Tarkov PvE Have The Same Features as PvP?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov PvE offers <strong>everything </strong>that the core game does. It has the Flea Market, the Trader system, all the tasks, and even AI-powered PMC enemies and a full-fledged Hideout. The PMCs can be a little hard to manage at times and can be dramatically unpredictable, but overall, it’s such a similar experience to the PvP platform that you’ll often not notice the difference.</p>



<p>PvE in Tarkov still has Boss characters, every map is open, and the loot loop is identical. It’s possible to play the entire game through in PvE, and that includes the pesky tasks that require you to kill PMCs. Some are quite tough, such as the tasks to kill PMCs in specific areas, but it’s still doable.</p>



<p>The only <strong>real </strong>difference in Tarkov PvE is that you won’t run into other players, which makes for an easier and more enjoyable session as you are less likely to be blasted across the map by a sudden suppressed sniper shot that hits you out of nowhere. In Tarkov’s PvE mode,<strong> you </strong>are the only Chad.</p>



<p>Of course, that means you’re unlikely to get that huge feeling of satisfaction after winning an intense fight, but that’s a small price to pay.</p>



<p>If you’ve had Edge of Darkness or The Unheard Edition of Escape from Tarkov, you already have access to PvE. If you <strong>don’t </strong>have one of those versions, you can buy and keep PvE forever for just $20 from escapefromtarkov.com.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Escape from Tarkov PvE is fantastic and super enjoyable, and it has firmly brought me back into the Tarkov fold. I was put off for the longest time by the difficulty level, having less time to play, suffering from FOMO, and the cheaters that ruined the fun for everyone else.</p>



<p>Now I don’t have to worry about any of that – <strong>and </strong>my raids load in 30 seconds or less. What a huge win.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/big-boss-requiem-statue-preorder/</link>

<p>If you’re a die-hard Metal Gear Solid fan, you’ll need to step up and prove it by pre-ordering one of the most expensive statues to ever emerge based on the series. Priced at a <strong>minimum </strong>of $500, the Big Boss Requiem statue is one hell of a collectable, and at the most expensive tier, you’ll be parting ways with an eye-watering $700 to snag one.</p>



<p>It’s a fantastic piece, though. The base statue recreates Big Boss’ iconic salute at the end of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, but the ‘Definitive Edition’ of the statue also offers a string of props to really make the figure pop wherever you might choose to display it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-big-boss">Big Big Boss</h2>



<p>The Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Big Boss Requiem statue was revealed last year, but it’s only now that it has become available to pre-order. It’ll be released late next year, and for fans of the franchise, it’s the ultimate collectable.</p>



<p>The statue, which stands at a whopping 55cm tall, has Big Boss saluting in front of the grave of his mentor, The Boss. There are three ‘tiers’ to this statue:</p>



<ol>
<li>Big Boss Requiem – This is just the base statue on a plinth</li>



<li>Big Boss Requiem Exclusive Edition – This is the base statue on a plinth, plus decorative props: a gravestone, flowers, and The Boss’ Patriot rifle in a case</li>



<li>Big Boss Requiem Definitive Edition – This top-tier version is the base statue, the decorative props, plus a ghostly visage of The Boss floating behind Big Boss</li>
</ol>



<p>Every statue will feature a limited edition numbering and an authentication card. It’s a massive piece, too – the topmost edition stands at 60cm tall and weighs almost 14 kg. It’s a solid resin statue with intricate details, and in images, it looks phenomenal. </p>



<p>It’s available to <a href="https://www.first4figures.com/big-boss-requiem-exclusive-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preorder from First4Figures</a>, which has previously released items such as a life-size bust of Solid Snake, huge statues based on Dark Souls bosses, and a massive range of high-quality statues pulled from the likes of Spyro, Darksiders, Gears of War, and <strong>many </strong>more.</p>



<p>Are you going to invest in the Big Boss Requiem statue?</p>

Each of them features unique movesets and abilities to dominate the arena!</p><ul><li><strong>Balzarr</strong> – Nicknamed the Demon Star, Balzarr is a new Titan that came to Earth from outer space as a blazing meteor. It is equipped with a powerful blade tail and high agility, which allows it to leap around the battlefield while cleaving its enemies into pieces. It can also enter its signature Predator Stance, allowing it to perch on walls and even on its own tail to unlock the use of more deadly abilities.</li><li><strong>R.O.J.A.K.</strong> – Five minds in one body; R.O.J.A.K. is a battle mech controlled by an uncoordinated team of Mighty Warriors serving as mankind’s last line of defense against Balzarr. Chomp down your foes with your T-Rex torso, kick enemies into the sky with your cannon-powered boots, snipe foes from afar with your Dragon arm, launch Durian bombs at your enemies, and more. Landing an attack with each body part will allow the pilots to synergize and activate the mech’s full potential.</li></ul><p>With the release of this new downloadable content release along with the past collaboration with the Tokusatsu genre titans such as Godzilla and Ultraman, <em>GigaBash</em> now has a grand total of 18 playable characters in its roster. So will you help the R.O.J.A.K. team protect humanity from this celestial invader, or will you play as Balzarr and unleash hell on Earth?</p></blockquote><p><em>GigaBash</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,815 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,998 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,439 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,883 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,098 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546400/GigaBash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/gigabash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concernedape-eric-barone-stardew-valley-crossover-with-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Creator Eric Barone says there are no plans yet, but he's open to the idea of a collaboration with Fortnite.</h2></div><section><p>Stardew Valley is no stranger to nods to other games. Among other references, Patch 1.6 has a well-placed Terraria easter egg. Nevertheless, Stardew Valley has never really appeared in another games, though creator Eric Barone aka ConcernedApe definitely has some ideas in that front.</p><p>In a Discord conversation shared by Panedwards on X/Twitter, Barone talks about the possibility of a Stardew Valley collaboration, acknowledging that he's open to a crossover and saying that he would love to have Pam in particular in Fortnite.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The creator of 'Stardew Valley' aka <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ConcernedApe</a> has been trying to make a <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FortniteGame</a> collaboration happen and is open to anything. <a href="https://t.co/wnaEfgIc5q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wnaEfgIc5q</a></p>— Panedwards (@Panedwards_YT) <a href="https://twitter.com/Panedwards_YT/status/1828161152817254710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"It doesn't have to be Pam though, I would be open to anything," Barone adds. "Abigail &amp; Sebatian could be good. Stardrop or Joja Cola item? Galaxy sword or slingshot?"</p><p>All of these items would be fun additions to Fortnite, and Stardew Valley's aesthetic is certainly in line with Epic's ultra-popular sandbox shooter. Pam would hardly look out of place next to Buff Peter Griffin, Solid Snake, and all the other Fortnite crossover characters. But could it actually happen?</p><p>Reached for comment, one of Barone's representatives acknowledged that the screenshot is real, but added a bit of additional context from ConcernedApe.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/27/pam-stardew-valley-1724797104836.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Pam would definitely be a monster in Fortnite.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I have a small team of people who help me with Stardew updates, admin and business stuff. Sometimes, we play games together, and one game we enjoy playing is Fortnite (Zero Build). One time we were playing and someone said 'what if there was a Pam skin in Fortnite?' And it kind of became a meme for us, like we were imagining us all playing as a squad with identical Pam skins. It was just a silly fun idea," Barone explained in a statement sent to IGN. </p><p>"Then someone asked me if I would collab with Fortnite and I mentioned the Pam thing. There's nothing official in the works or anything like that, but yea we would find it amusing and fun if we were able to play as Pam (or any other Stardew character, really) someday. Other than the occasional gaming session, my team and I are completely focused on Stardew Valley development and ports right now."</p><p>Indeed, ConcernedApe has been busy recently amid the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Stardew_Valley_1.6_Update">release of Patch 1.6</a> and ongoing work on the anticipated release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-haunted-chocolatier-developer-may-have-teased-the-return-of-a-beloved-stardew-valley-character">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. Fans are still awaiting the release of Patch 1.06 on the Nintendo Switch, which failed to materialize during the Nintendo Direct earlier today. As for Fortnite, it's in the midst of its latest Marvel collaboration, having added <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-to-get-disney-villains-incredibles-characters-and-a-season-with-doctor-doom-d23-2024">Doctor Doom for Chapter 5 Season 4</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.
