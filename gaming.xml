<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update" rel="nofollow">the first part</a> of the Worlds update back in July, Worlds Part 2 introduces "stranger, more alien terrain" for you to explore, including "new mountains, deep valleys, and sprawling plains on untouched planets".</p>

<p>A new class of star has been added in this update in the form of Purple-class solar systems, which bring new worlds for you to discover along with a new story to unravel.</p>

<p>There's plenty more to discover in this update as well, from bigger features like new gas giant planets and new creatures through to smaller improvements like one-button inventory sorting.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game that takes place in an "infinite procedurally-generated universe".</p>

<p>The game got off to a rocky start when it was released in 2016, but after many updates, Hello Games has managed to shape&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>into something resembling the game its fans were originally promised.</p>

<p>The planned DLC for Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition has been cancelled, developer World’s Edge has announced.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/age-of-empires-iii-definitive-edition-dlc-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message posted</a> on the game’s website, the studio says it was a decision that “was not made lightly.” They said that when the announcement of the DLC was made, it was done so “prematurely”. </p>



<p>“While considering the inclusions for last year’s show, we wanted to ensure that&nbsp;<em>Age III: DE</em>&nbsp;players felt part of the franchise celebration as we know you have huge passion and love for the game,” they said. “However, pushing to ensure that the game was included meant we announced content before it had been built…</p>



<p>“We know that this is a huge disappointment, and many of you were excited for more content. We were able to put out a patch for the game towards the end of last year but understand that it was not the size and scope you were hoping for.”</p>

<p>Despite the DLC no longer happening, World’s Edge says that it will continue to maintain the game’s servers as well as rotate available civilizations in the game’s free trial. There’s also the currently available DLC that was released over the last few years for those who want more than the base game.</p>



<p>Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition first launched in 2020 on PC. The game is available via Steam and on Xbox’s PC Game Pass. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaidens-revival-perfect-antidote-to-the-soulslike-phenomenon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the reveals at the 2025 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced"><u>Xbox Developer Direct</u></a>, the revival of Ninja Gaiden has to be one of the biggest. The classic action franchise is receiving multiple new games, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-microsofts-xbox-developer-direct-2025"><u>Ninja Gaiden 4</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-announced-and-its-out-now"><u>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</u></a>, the latter of which shadow dropped right after the event. Such a 180 degree turn for the series was certainly a surprise, since outside of the Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection compilation, the last time we received a proper entry in this franchise was Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor’s Edge all the way back in 2012. But it also heralds what could be a pivotal turning point for games as a medium: the return of old school 3D action games after years of the genre being dominated by Soulslike games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where once games like Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry and the original God of War series ran the action scene, that style of game has been all but supplanted by the likes of FromSoftware entries such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring. We don’t dislike that type of game, to be clear, but there should be room in the AAA marketplace for both, and the return of Ninja Gaiden could be the balancing of the scales the action genre desperately needs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Dragon Lineage</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ninja Gaiden series was once <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ninja-gaiden-black/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>widely considered</u></a> the pinnacle of action games. The 2004 relaunch on the original Xbox was a far cry from the 2D action platformers that popularized the series on the NES, but the new take on Ryu Hayabusa’s adventures became instantly iconic for its buttery smooth gameplay, remarkably fluid animation and extreme difficulty. Sure, there were plenty of other hack and slash action games on the market, and some were even known for being hard like Devil May Cry. But Ninja Gaiden stood apart from the pack, practically daring players to give up before they even finished the first level. Many players have told stories about being beaten into submission by Murai, a master of nunchaku and the first boss of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But despite the challenge, anyone who’s spent a decent amount of time with the game will tell you that aside from some camera woes that lead to being attacked by off-screen enemies from time to time, the difficulty of Ninja Gaiden is mostly fair, all things considered. Deaths are common but come from player mistakes and not being fully in-tune with the rhythm of combat, the delicate dance of movement, defense and counter-attacks that expert players use to decimate their opponents. From the iconic Izuna Drop, the overwhelming power of Ultimate Techniques, and a litany of combos to master for all the various weapons, there are more than enough tools at the player’s disposal to overcome every challenge the game throws at you.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Players loving Ninja Gaiden for its brutal challenge and conquering the hardest difficulty settings influenced the mindset that Soulslike fans have</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If all of that rhetoric sounds familiar, it’s because Ninja Gaiden, ironically enough, was a progenitor to the Soulslike phenomenon and the fan community that spawned around it. Players loving Ninja Gaiden for its brutal challenge and conquering the hardest difficulty settings influenced the mindset that Soulslike fans have, of seeking the satisfaction of finally besting what initially felt like insurmountable odds. Few action games require such mastery of their mechanics in order to succeed as Ninja Gaiden does, and FromSoftware and the games it influenced took that idea and turned it into an entire subgenre. Yet it may have done too good of a job, because the Soulslike model has consumed action games over the past decade, much to their detriment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Follow the Leader</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not a coincidence that Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, the PS3 port of Ninja Gaiden II that is widely considered an inferior version and the start of the series’ downfall, came out the same year as Demon’s Souls. Released in 2009, the PS3 action RPG received <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/demons-souls-2009/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>strong reviews</u></a> and set the stage for the release of Dark Souls in 2011, which was a landmark title that has been frequently called one of the greatest video games ever made, <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-games/16" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>including by IGN</u></a>. Around the same time that the disastrous Ninja Gaiden 3 and its somewhat better rerelease Razor’s Edge were cratering the Hayabusa saga, Dark Souls was carving out a sizable space in the action market. The game received two direct sequels and led to FromSoftware making further refinements to the same gameplay style in Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The massive popularity of FromSoftware’s mechanics spilled into other franchises, such as Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and its sequel Jedi: Survivor, Team Ninja’s Nioh, and Game Science’s Black Myth: Wukong. Now, most of the games we just listed are beloved by players and critics alike. There’s nothing <em>wrong </em>with the Soulslike model in a vacuum. But this style of game has suffocated the AAA action space to the point of classic style 3D action games being few and far between. Ninja Gaiden is only just coming back after over a decade in the cooler. The last proper Devil May Cry entry, DMC5, was released in 2019. God of War was revived in 2018 but lost a lot of its mechanical personality in the process, being stripped of its linear, fast-paced hack and slash gameplay in favor of a more industry standard semi-open world with slower, more methodical combat. The new God of War games aren’t an exact copy of the Soulslike style, but they certainly feel more akin to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said style has many hallmarks that gamers can instantly recognize: Difficult combat built around timing dodges and parries, stamina management, a need to create a build for your character with customizable equipment, large open-ended level design, and save points healing the player character while also respawning non-boss enemies in the environment. FromSoftware using this model for its games makes sense because they invented it, but so many other developers copying their homework means gamers are now overdosed on this style. Now that Ninja Gaiden is back in the mainstream with the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, the strengths that are specific to character action games have a new chance to shine.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Master Ninja Returns</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is the breath of fresh air that the action genre has needed for quite some time. The lightning fast combat, wide variety of weapons, and the return of the blood and gore from the original release that the Sigma iteration dropped makes this the best version of Ninja Gaiden 2 you can play on modern hardware, and the perfect place for franchise newcomers to see what all the fuss is about. Some franchise veterans might decry the difficulty adjustments and enemy counts, but it’s important to remember that the original Ninja Gaiden II barely held together from a technical perspective and sometimes fell into cheap traps due to its unbalanced design. Of all the game’s iterations, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black works best as a complete package, maintaining a high level of difficulty and reinstating the gore absent from Sigma 2 while keeping much of the extra content that version added, such as the bonus characters and levels (although they thankfully dropped the statue boss fights no one liked).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 4 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This new remaster is also a stark reminder of what was lost when games of its kind stopped being a pillar of the action space. It can be hard to remember now, but games inspired by Ninja Gaiden and God of War were all over the place in the late 2000s and early 2010s, such as PlatinumGames’ Bayonetta, Visceral Games’ Dante’s Inferno, Vigil Games’ Darksiders, and even FromSoftware’s attempt to copy Ninja Gaiden in the long-forgotten Ninja Blade. Frenetic, combo-based battles against dozens of foes and an array of giant bosses presented in a curated, linear format is such a tried and true formula that it’s shocking how much the template evaporated as the Soulslike model took prominence. Now, games that use similar mechanics as Ninja Gaiden aren’t completely gone (Hi-Fi Rush’s rhythm-based take on the same gameplay loop was released in 2023), but Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is one of the most prominent examples of the form released by a major developer in years pretty much by default.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, replaying Ninja Gaiden 2 in its latest incarnation highlights why the experience of games like it can’t be replicated elsewhere. There’s a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-ninja-gaiden-black-is-the-best-pure-action-game-of-all-time"><u>purity</u></a> to action games like Ninja Gaiden where there are no real “cheats” to get ahead; no builds to copy off of a guide, no experience points to outlevel the enemies, no stamina bar to limit your abilities. It’s just you and the game, and you do the best with the small handful of tools you’re given. You either master the combat put in front of you or you find yourself staring at a Game Over screen over and over again. So while we don’t anticipate Soulslike games losing their hold on the gaming populace anytime soon, hopefully the return of Ninja Gaiden starts a new golden age for action games. Surely there’s enough audience to go around for both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

Ritsuki was eager to aim for the school’s primaries for the national competition, but first year students were forbidden from participating in the contest.

Here's the full list of enhancements for each one:</p><h2>Dino Crisis</h2><ul><li>Full Windows 10 and Windows 11 compatibility</li><li>English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese language localizations</li><li>Original, Arrange, and Operation Wipe Out modes included</li><li>Improved DirectX game-renderer</li><li>New rendering options--Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more</li><li>Increased rendering resolution to approximately 4K (1920p) and color depth to 32-bit</li><li>Improved geometry calculation with more stable transformation and texturing</li><li>Enhanced alpha transparency</li><li>Improved game registry settings</li><li>Smooth animation, video, and music playback without issues</li><li>Reliable saving system (the game no longer corrupts save files after leaving dropped weapons)</li><li>Full support for modern controllers</li><li>Validated stability</li><li>Cloud saves support</li></ul><h2>Dino Crisis 2</h2><ul><li>Full Windows 10 and Windows 11 compatibility</li><li>English and Japanese language localizations</li><li>Easy difficulty, Dino Colosseum, and Dino Duel included</li><li>Improved DirectX game-renderer</li><li>New rendering options--Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more</li><li>Improved music playback and volume scaling</li><li>Enhanced item-rendering and fogging</li><li>Improved cartridge boxes alignment</li><li>Smooth video playback, task-switching, and game exit</li><li>Full support for modern controllers with optimal button-mapping for both wired and wireless modes</li><li>Validated stability</li><li>Cloud saves support</li></ul><p>The first Dino Crisis game was released in 1999 for the PlayStation, and with Shinji Mikami as game director, there was quite a bit of Resident Evil DNA in its design. The franchise expanded with two sequels and a lightgun spin-off, but since then, it has been in hibernation.</p><p>The good news is that a spiritual successor called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dino-crisis-like-game-is-ps5-exclusive-because-youre-all-sickos/1100-6528895/">Code Violet is in development as a PS5 exclusive</a>, but don't expect it to come to PC. Developers at TeamKill Media say this is because they want to stop modders from being able to use the game and its assets to create sexually themed mods, as part of its efforts to protect the game and the voice talent who worked on it.</p><p><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/" rel="nofollow ">GOG has also announced Dreamlist</a>, a tool that'll let people vote on games they want to see brought over to GOG and given a similar enhancement treatment as Dino Crisis. This system will allow the owners of those IP to see how much interest there is in a game, and currently, Freelancer is sitting at the top of that wishlist, beating other games like Resident Evil: Code Veronica X, Final Fantasy 7, and No One Lives Forever.</p>

		<p>Focus and developer Saber Interactive have released a new gameplay overview trailer for RoadCraft, their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mudrunner">MudRunner</a> spin-off themed around the mechanised recover efforts after natural disasters. RoadCraft is coming out on 20th May 2025 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

<p>RoadCraft is following in the tyre tracks of Expeditions, though is doing it without the MudRunner branding. There’s some inherently familiar gameplay ideas here, with things like the depth sensor for when driving through water, but instead of focussing on exploration, everything has been channelled in to disaster recovery.</p>
<p>Their’s eight regions that have been stricken by a variety of natural disasters, from floods to relentless sandstorms, with players then having to take on the effort to assess the damage, clear the destruction and rebuild in the aftermath to restore key infrastructure including roads and bridges. Fans of large construction vehicles will be overjoyed to see the dozens of vehicles that include big yellow diggers, cranes, logging vehicles, some stupendously large cutter wheels, and more. There’s a greater emphasis throughout the world on physics interaction, so you can push boulders around, clear up debris and then let you lay the sandbanks and asphalt that’s then steam-rollered to create new impromptu roadways.</p>
<p>RoadCraft will be playable solo, of course, but also has support for up to four player co-op, which will help every job go faster… so long as you don’t keep stopping for tea breaks!</p>


<p>Looking back on the last game in this loosely defined series from Saber, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-review/">Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, Dom said</a>, “While Expeditions is undoubtedly fun, it’s focused, intense and challenging fun, and it’s not for the sort of person who looks for a quick and easy way to test how deep the water is. If you struggle to play games that require planning, sneaking or puzzle solving these are all applicable skills you’ll need to succeed in Expeditions.”</p>
<p>RoadCraft sounds like it will be very similar in that regard.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/massive-update-releases-for-no-mans-sky-adding-new-storyline-deep-sea-diving-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update has been announced for No Man's Sky, with this major update being titled Worlds Part II. Already 2025 is off to a great start for the team over at Hello Games, as they've continued to work on No Man's Sky for the ninth year in a row. The game has come incredibly far since its rocky release, where it <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/">initially wasn't received well by the players at all</a>, and has quickly become a fan favorite for those who like galactic exploration. Hello Games has assured that they are still continuing to work hard on Light No Fire, but wanted to make sure to continue showing love to No Man's Sky at the same time. Below will be the trailer for the new update that you can watch, explaining the new update for the title while we break down some of the new features being added in this expansive update.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lG2DTjP-_M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep dive video</a> has been released which you can find linked here.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Worlds Part II Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/75bfyy-XkQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The universe has grown even bigger than it already was, with tons of new solar systems and a multitude of planets that you can explore, all with new biomes and terrain that you can explore. Terrain has received a major overhaul, with it being more detailed than ever before, with plenty of variety in the forms of mountains, chasms, and water.</p>
<p>One of the most significant features that has been added in this update is the highly requested feature of Gas Giants. These planets are massive, and are ten times bigger than the biggest planets in No Man's Sky. You will be able to see them looming over other planets, with storms raging on the surface. Exploring them will be a huge challenge, as it is meant to be end-game content, but it will still provide an exciting time all around.</p>
<p>Deep sea diving is a new feature in this update, where you'll be able to go even further into the depths than ever before. Not only this, but you'll even find new creatures down in the ocean, such as Giant Squids and Seahorses. These oceans are perilous and can be frightening to explore, as they are only illuminated by the corals in the water.</p>
<p>For a<a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full list of all of the features</a> that are being added to No Man's Sky in this gigantic patch, you can check out the patch notes on Hello Games' website, which lists all of the new features and adjustments that have been made to provide a smoother experience to the players.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dino-crisis-1-and-2-brought-back-to-life-on-pc-via-gog.1094811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has resurrected Capcom's dino-hunting horror classics&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis 2</em>, and now, the storefront wants your help in deciding what it should bring back to life next.</p>

<p>Both&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>games "come DRM-free with their original content fully intact", as is GOG's mission statement. However, they're also a part of the GOG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which means they've had some spring-cleaning done in order to ensure smooth playability on modern systems.</p>

<p>Updates for both games include increased resolution support, fixes for some common issues, and, of course, modern controller compatibility, and the first game also features its Original, Arrange, and Operation Wipe Out modes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-gog-dinosaur.jpg?itok=BH2AeNVy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-gog-dinosaur.jpg?itok=6zWZIGrs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now enjoy the first two&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>games on PC via GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>Alongside the&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>announcement, GOG has also revealed the <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dreamlist</a>, an evolution of its Community Wishlist feature that serves as a way to tell the GOG folks what you want to see revived next.</p>

<p>The Dreamlist is essentially a list of all the games GOG has not yet brought to its storefront, and by voting on your favorites, you can tell the storefront which games you want to see given the&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>(or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/original-resident-evil-2-gog-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil</em></a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow"><em>Warcraft</em></a>) treatment next.</p>

<p>GOG staff will also periodically highlight games that they think might be worth your time to vote on. At time of writing, highlighted games include&nbsp;<em>Freelancer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Code: Veronica X</em>, and the original&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, among many others.</p>

<p>Of course, if you don't like the sound of the highlighted games, you can browse the full list to find your favorites, and you can even tell GOG staff if there's a game that's missing from the list.</p>




<p>Game preservation is becoming a more and more serious problem as the industry moves forward. According to GOG's numbers, 87% of games released prior to 2010 are no longer available, and that's a shocking statistic, frankly.</p>

<p>Thankfully, GOG's efforts to preserve older games continue. You can grab&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis 2&nbsp;</em>via GOG right now, and they're also available as <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">part of a bundle</a> if you want to pick them up together. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments" rel="nofollow">Take that, Shinji Mikami</a>.</p>

After it installs, you’ll have the option to trade any card that’s a 1-star or below in rarity with whoever is on your friends list. And that’s where things go off the rails. Fans have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1iciykf/trades_are_very_expensive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1iciykf/trades_are_very_expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">losing their minds</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1icta5n/trading_is_bad_on_purpose_so_they_can_make_money/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1icta5n/trading_is_bad_on_purpose_so_they_can_make_money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about it all morning</a></span>. </p><p>To trade you need to have enough enough “trade stamina” which slowly refills over time or can be purchased for real money. You also need to have enough “trade tokens.” These are collected by trashing extra copies of cards you already own, and the results aren’t generous. Cards that are 2-diamond and below can’t be turned into trade tokens at all, and even 1-star cards only get you 100 tokens each.</p><p>Meanwhile, it costs 400 trade tokens to trade a single 1-star card with someone else. Both players are effectively trashing four cards, and trading a fifth, just to get one in return. It’s nuts, and yet somehow that’s not even the worst part. When you make someone on your friends list a trade offer, you pick which card to give away but you have no way of telling them what you want in return. The entire thing is ass-backwards. </p><p>The only way to really trade for any cards missing from you collection is to coordinate over DMs in another app or meet up IRL. It’s a weird set of hoops to jump through for very little payoff. You can’t trade for the rarest cards in the game, and new players won’t have nearly enough good cards to get the trade tokens they need to make a worthwhile swap. And even if they do, they’ll have to start DMing with a total rando or find that one friend who also plays <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> and happens to have a card they want. <br></p><p>“As a whale, this game isn’t getting another dime from me,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ick9qr/as_a_whale_this_game_isnt_getting_another_dime/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ick9qr/as_a_whale_this_game_isnt_getting_another_dime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one hardcore player on Reddit. “This trading update is an insult.” Another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1icjnwk/lets_face_it_the_game_does_not_want_you_to_trade/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1icjnwk/lets_face_it_the_game_does_not_want_you_to_trade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>, “Let’s face it, the game does NOT want you to trade cards.” When the game’s developers previewed trading earlier this month, it already seemed like a flawed system.

There may be hope, at least for the types of things players can trade in the future. “We’re planning to expand the range of cards that can be traded,” reads the fine print near the bottom of trading’s in-game announcement. Maybe the ability to trade rarer cards, including even gold crown cards, is coming in the future after all. For now, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s big trading extravaganza is a bust.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>No Man’s Sky has received its latest major update, Update 5.5 also known as Worlds Part 2. This new update for the game sees the addition of new planets, new stars, and a new story.</p>



<p>“The algorithm of the universe has evolved to generate beautiful new&nbsp;mountains, deep&nbsp;valleys, and sprawling&nbsp;plains&nbsp;on&nbsp;untouched planets, waiting to be discovered,” developer <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hello Games wrote</a>.</p>



<p>With Worlds Part 2, a new class of star has appeared as well as new purple-class solar systems that include “countless new worlds”.</p>



<p>“With Worlds Part [2], we added billions of new star systems and trillions of new planets to the universe,” Hello Games founder Sean Murray said. “This allows us to push the boundaries of our engine and technology without changing the things people love about the game already.</p>



<p>“If you settled on your home planet with a beautiful base that you lovingly crafted, that is safe – but now there are new worlds to explore with a level of variety no one has seen before.”</p>



<p>Aside from the new stars and planets also comes a new story for players to experience. The new narrative-driven mission “deepens the&nbsp;<strong>lore</strong>&nbsp;of the universe and&nbsp;<strong>expands upon the story</strong>&nbsp;of Atlas, Atlantid, and the robotic Autophage lifeforms.”</p>



<p>Other big new features with the update include deep oceans with new underwater biomes, better inventory sorting with the push of a button, a new “abandoned” mode that removes all alien life from the game, dynamic weather hazards, and more.</p>



<p>You can check out the extensive list of new features and fixes via the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s official website</a>.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001079.000050711.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (which is in Japanese; we're using machine translation), the game has managed to hit two million sales worldwide, which includes both physical shipments and digital sales.</p>

<p>The new milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>has racked up another million sales since October, when it reached its first million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">after just three days on sale</a>. Naturally, that means sales have slowed down somewhat, but that's arguably to be expected for what is still, in the end, a fairly niche game.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake managed to rack up three million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-hit-3-million-in-just-2-days" rel="nofollow">in just two days</a>, beating out the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which hit the same milestone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-2-ships-3-million-copies-during-first-week-free-dlc-announced" rel="nofollow">inside its first week</a>.</p>

<p>Still, direct comparisons are perhaps unfair.&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>is a series that arguably has more mainstream appeal than&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>, with the latter being more overtly focused on subtler, more psychological horror and the former focusing more on action.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake is also doing significantly better than ill-fated studio Pieces Interactive's&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot, which performed so poorly that it sadly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alone-in-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-shut-down" rel="nofollow">caused the studio to be shut down</a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagined version of the 2001 survival horror classic that comes courtesy of&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Medium&nbsp;</em>developer Bloober Team.</p>

<p>The game's narrative is mostly faithful to the original, but the gameplay has been updated; the action now plays out with an over-the-shoulder camera reminiscent of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>remakes rather than the more traditional fixed-camera approach of the 2001 game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s new RTX 5080 graphics card isn’t as exciting as I was hoping it would be. While the sleek new Founders Edition redesign dramatically shrinks the size of the card compared to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23457556/nvidia-rtx-4080-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test-review">RTX 4080</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24055394/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4080 Super</a>, you’re getting the same 16GB of VRAM and only small performance improvements over the previous generation of cards.</p><p>The RTX 5080, which arrives January 30th for $999, is about 15 percent faster than the RTX 4080 at 4K without the use of any AI-powered upscaling tricks. While the RTX 4080 managed to beat the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs">RTX 3090</a>, and the RTX 3080 dethroned the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/14/17854230/nvidia-rtx-2080-turing-architecture-specs-platform">RTX 2080 Ti</a>, the RTX 5080 isn’t enough to topple the RTX 4090. Nvidia has built up an expectation that the 80-series card will surpass the previous generation’s flagship, and that’s simply not the case this time around. </p><p>The RTX 5080 does comfortably beat its only competition at this price point: the $999 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499697/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-xtx-review-benchmarks-price">AMD RX Radeon 9700 XTX</a>. That makes the RTX 5080 a good card for 4K if you’re willing to drop settings in some games and more GPU than you probably need for 1440p. For meaningfully better 4K performance, you’ll have to spend $2,000 on the RTX 5090. </p><p>If you’re upgrading to the RTX 5080 from the RTX 3080 or RTX 3080 Ti, expect to see average performance gains of more than 50 percent at 1440p and 4K. If you want more than that, you’ll have to rely on Nvidia’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen</a> to create more frames with AI models. As we work our way down the RTX 50-series lineup, it increasingly feels like Multi Frame Gen is going to be the main talking point.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1000</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Sleek two-slot design</li><li>DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen</li><li>Good average power draw in games</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>16GB of VRAM</li><li>Not a big performance boost over the RTX 4080</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p id="gYQTqy"><h2><strong>Hardware</strong></h2></p></div><p>The RTX 5080 Founders Edition model looks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">identical to the RTX 5090</a>. It’s dramatically thinner than the RTX 4080 it succeeds, shrinking from a three-slot design down to two slots. I really like this redesign, which includes double flowthrough fans that exhaust air above the RTX 5080 into the case instead of out of the top and back of the card.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The RTX 5080 has an angled power connector.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Just like the RTX 5090, Nvidia has slightly angled the power connector on the RTX 5080 so it’s easier to fit into a variety of cases. The included dongle, which converts three eight-pin PCIe power cables to fit the card’s 12VHPWR connector, has slightly more flexible cables than the one that shipped with the 40-series cards. You can also ditch the dongle and get a 12V-2x6 or 12VHPWR cable that connects directly to your power supply.</p><p>It’s disappointing to see Nvidia has stuck with 16GB of VRAM on the RTX 5080. AMD’s RX 7900 XTX offers 24GB, and while the RTX 5080 delivers better performance for now, it may well hit video memory limits in 4K gaming in the future.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Nvidia has moved the RTX 5080 to a two-slot card.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p id="8W7W8m"><h2><strong>4K and 1440p performance</strong></h2></p></div><p>For both my 4K and 1440p testing, I’ve paired Nvidia’s RTX 5080 with AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor and Asus’ 32-inch 4K OLED <a href="https://rog.asus.com/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdp/">PG32UCDP monitor</a>. I’ve put the RTX 5080 up against the RTX 5090 — Nvidia’s current flagship — as well as the RTX 4090, RTX 4080 and 4080 Super, AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 XTX, and the RTX 3080 Ti from 2021.</p><p>Without DLSS or ray tracing enabled, the results are largely consistent across both 4K and 1440p: the RTX 5080 is about 15 percent faster on average than the 4080 at 4K and 12 percent faster at 1440p. It’s 12 percent faster than the Radeon RX 7900 XTX at 4K and 11 percent at 1440p, and it beats the RTX 4080 Super by 11 and 10 percent, respectively.</p><div><div><p id="test-machine"><h2>Test machine:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU cooler:</strong> Corsair H150i Elite LCD</span></li><li><span><strong>Motherboard:</strong> Gigabyte Aorus Master</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB G.Skill DDR5-6000</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB</span></li><li><span><strong>PSU: </strong>Corsair HX1000W</span></li><li><span><strong>Case: </strong>Streacom BC1 V2 open benchtable</span></li></ul></div></div><p>That’s enough to make this the best $999 graphics card, but by historical standards, it’s disappointing. I really wanted to see the RTX 5080 beat the RTX 4090, but it lags the older card by about 18 percent. Maybe it was a big ask for a $999 GPU to beat a $1,599 last-gen flagship. The $1,199 RTX 4080 was faster than the $1,499 RTX 3090, but there was only a $300 gap there, not $600. Still, it’s the first time in a long time we’ve had such a paltry increase in an 80-series card.</p><p>Nvidia’s top GPU, the RTX 5090, is 50 percent faster than the RTX 5080 at 4K resolution, but it’s also double the price. That certainly leaves the door open for an RTX 5080 Ti, priced between the 5080 and 5090, that can beat the RTX 4090.</p><p>The RTX 5080 makes the most sense if you’re upgrading from the RTX 30 series or earlier. At 4K, without DLSS or ray tracing, it’s nearly 54 percent faster than the RTX 3080 Ti (56 percent at 1440p), and you’ll also be able to make full use of DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen if you upgrade.</p><div><p id="neKe3j"><h2><strong>DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen</strong></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">Nvidia claimed</a> the RTX 5080 would be twice as fast as the RTX 4080. For those kinds of numbers, you’ll need to turn to DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen.</p><p>Nvidia’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">Multi Frame Generation</a> tech uses the latest AI graphics models, powered by an updated transformer architecture, to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, pushing the RTX 5080’s frame rates beyond what it’s normally capable of at 4K. </p><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350558/nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation-cyberpunk-2077-transformer-graphics-update-patch">the only game with official support for DLSS 4</a> and Multi Frame Gen before the RTX 5080’s official launch on January 30th. In my testing, I’ve found big frame rate increases at 4K with full ray tracing enabled, with fewer graphical glitches than Nvidia’s previous frame-generation tech thanks to the new transformer model. Without DLSS 4, <em>Cyberpunk </em>runs at an unplayable 19fps average with ultra settings and full ray tracing. DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen x4 brings that up to a far more playable 128fps, but it isn’t the same as a true 128fps.</p><p>DLSS Super Resolution — which renders the game at a lower resolution and then uses AI to upscale it — bumps the frame rate up to 38fps. Multi Frame Gen creates the three extra frames to get to that 128fps mark. While motion does look smoother, in terms of input latency, it still feels like a 38fps game. Multi Frame Gen is far less noticeable when the base frame rate with DLSS Super Resolution is higher than 60fps, so at 4K, you might need to lower the quality settings to really see the benefits.</p><p>It’s this Multi Frame Gen that lets Nvidia say the RTX 5080 is twice as fast as the RTX 4080, with the previous-gen card managing 62fps on average in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> with full ray tracing and Frame Gen x2. The RTX 5080 more than doubles this with x4 enabled.</p><p>It’s a better story at 1440p thanks to higher base frame rates. Without DLSS 4, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>averages 39fps at 1440p with full ray tracing and ultra settings. DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen x4 brings that all the way up to 225fps. While it’s still not a true 225fps, it feels a lot better than the 4K equivalent because DLSS Super Resolution gets the base frame rate up to 73fps before Multi Frame Gen kicks in. </p><p><br>This is the ideal situation for Multi Frame Gen because you’re getting the motion clarity benefits and the game still feels more responsive. It’s obviously not as responsive as 225fps would be without Multi Frame Gen if you really dropped the settings, but in a game like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, I think people are going to notice the motion clarity improvements more than the input latency.</p><p>When the RTX 5080 launches on January 30th, there’ll be a new DLSS override feature inside the Nvidia app that lets you force games to use its new Multi Frame Gen and transformer models. I haven’t been able to test this yet, since it’s not available, but if it works, it could be a great way to improve DLSS image quality and Frame Gen in games before developers can officially patch them.</p><p>I focus most of my GPU testing on gaming — because that’s what GeForce cards are designed for — but the RTX 5080 is also very capable of video editing or AI workloads. I found that the RTX 5080 was nearly 10 percent faster than the RTX 4080 in PugetBench’s DaVinci Resolve test, and in Procyon’s AI XL (FP16) test, it was nearly 28 percent faster.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The RTX 5080 isn’t powerful enough to beat the RTX 4090.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p id="3T5lsk"><h2><strong>Power draw and heat</strong></h2></p></div><p>Nvidia recommends an 850-watt power supply for the RTX 5080, which is 100 watts more than for the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super. The RTX 5080’s total graphics power is 40 watts more than the RTX 4080; it maxes out at 360 watts instead of the massive 575-watt power draw of the RTX 5090.</p><p>I’m glad to see that the RTX 5080 doesn’t significantly increase the power draw over the previous generation. I only saw it hit 360W once, in the <em>Metro Exodus</em> extreme benchmark. Even in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running full path tracing and no DLSS, it only got up to 348 watts.</p><p>More impressively, on average, the RTX 5080 drew 278 watts of power across the nine games tested without DLSS or ray tracing. That’s slightly less than the 281-watt average I found on the RTX 4080 but 12 watts more than the RTX 4080 Super. </p><p>The RTX 5080 didn’t heat up excessively in my open bench testing. The highest temperature I recorded was in <em>Metro Exodus</em>, where it reached 71 degrees Celsius (160 degrees Fahrenheit). The RTX 4080 reached 68C in this same test, and the RTX 4080 Super hit a maximum of 63C.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The fans on the RTX 5080 push air out of the top.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>DLSS 4 is really the star of the show so far with the RTX 50 series, but there still aren’t enough games to test it with. Multi Frame Gen has shown early promise, and it makes a lot more sense at 1440p in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the RTX 5080 than it does at 4K. I’m waiting to test more games with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen or even the ability to force these options on with the Nvidia app.</p><p>The RTX 5080 is the best $999 card on the market right now, beating AMD’s Radeon RX 9700 XTX by an average of 11 or 12 percent across the games I tested, without DLSS or ray tracing. It’s a significant upgrade over an RTX 30 series or earlier, with over 50 percent higher frame rates than the RTX 3080 Ti, plus access to the latest Multi Frame Generation technique. The 5080 offers about two-thirds the performance of the RTX 5090 for half the price and a little more than half the power draw. </p><p>But Nvidia hasn’t delivered the pure performance gains I was expecting. The RTX 5080 isn’t the cheaper RTX 4090 many were hoping for. I wanted to see a more meaningful bump to 4K performance than just 15 percent over the RTX 4080 without DLSS. I’m left wondering whether Nvidia will introduce an RTX 5080 Ti down the line and how close the upcoming $749 RTX 5070 Ti will get to the RTX 5080.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From the overall format down to individual hero’s kits, NetEase copiedBlizzard’s homework and didn’t try to change it much. That being said, it’s nice that <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a direct competitor to put its feet to the fire, and if both of these games must co-exist, they both can learn a lot from each other. Here are six things <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>should steal from each other.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b365a117371f0f9726be7a02255b1f8d" data-recommend-id="image://b365a117371f0f9726be7a02255b1f8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two Marvel Rivals teams face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two Marvel Rivals teams face off." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b365a117371f0f9726be7a02255b1f8d" data-recommend-id="image://b365a117371f0f9726be7a02255b1f8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two Marvel Rivals teams face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>NetEase got off to a good start making <em>Marvel Rivals</em> cross-play compatible, meaning no matter if you’re playing the shooter on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X/S, you can play with your friends on different systems. However, one major difference between it and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>is that the game has no form of cross-progression. It took Blizzard years to implement it into <em>Overwatch </em>and <em>Marvel Rivals </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-devs-confirm-cross-progression-is-in-the-works-but-platform-rules-remain-a-barrier&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-devs-confirm-cross-progression-is-in-the-works-but-platform-rules-remain-a-barrier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does have it coming in the near future</a></span>, but for the moment it’s still missing so I will complain. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is free-to-play so people can readily download it to play ranked matches on PC or console with their friends, but they can’t take their rewards and skins with them.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab5c4dcefb921c00bad4c93f1486d195" data-recommend-id="image://ab5c4dcefb921c00bad4c93f1486d195" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reinhardt charges into battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Reinhardt charges into battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab5c4dcefb921c00bad4c93f1486d195" data-recommend-id="image://ab5c4dcefb921c00bad4c93f1486d195" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reinhardt charges into battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are only a handful of heroes in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>that don’t use firearms or some kind of ranged weapon. Yeah, the “hero shooter” genre seems synonymous with shooting, but <em>Marvel Rivals </em>proves that differentiating your characters gives people more choice and playstyles for skill expression. Mister Fantastic and Captain America are two of my favorite heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and both are tanky melee heroes who get in close and brawl without a gun.

But having an option that lets you guarantee there will be some healing Strategists on your team separate from the free-for-all mode we have now hurts no one. It doesn’t even have to be a team-wide 2-2-2 role queue like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has, but maybe one that at least requires two healers so the team can comfortably experiment elsewhere in their composition. I don’t care what the Duelist one-tricks say, you cannot out-damage a team that has good healers when you have no one keeping you alive. So just give us some way to ensure there’s a Strategist on the team without having to berate each other to switch in the chat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51a8cf3b32927bf731e35eba20426e54" data-recommend-id="image://51a8cf3b32927bf731e35eba20426e54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1955" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow, Loki, Storm, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, and Spider-Man are shown perched on top of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow, Loki, Storm, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, and Spider-Man are shown perched on top of a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51a8cf3b32927bf731e35eba20426e54" data-recommend-id="image://51a8cf3b32927bf731e35eba20426e54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1955" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow, Loki, Storm, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, and Spider-Man are shown perched on top of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I could write another dozen paragraphs about how disappointing it is that <em>Overwatch 2 </em>seemingly abandoned its long-awaited story campaign. Instead, I’m going to shout out how <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has been integrating lore and forward narrative momentum into a genre that has historically struggled with it. On top of explicitly telling short stories within each map and match, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is adding lore drops, even if they’re just in text form at the moment, as part of its seasonal events. Each season’s theme plays into an actual story development occurring in the game’s multiverse, while <em>Overwatch </em>mainly uses its seasons to explore an aesthetic idea for skins. Blizzard has yet to publicly acknowledge <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-22/blizzard-entertainment-makes-big-changes-as-overwatch-2-struggles&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-22/blizzard-entertainment-makes-big-changes-as-overwatch-2-struggles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the reported cancelation of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s story missions</a></span>, but if there’s any hope of us seeing that story play out, integrating it into each season would be a great start.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="82361f0871b18e7bc7f601d30acb51fa" data-recommend-id="image://82361f0871b18e7bc7f601d30acb51fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1955" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange opens a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange opens a portal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82361f0871b18e7bc7f601d30acb51fa" data-recommend-id="image://82361f0871b18e7bc7f601d30acb51fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1955" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange opens a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A small quality-of-life change I’d like to see in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is the ability to immediately leave a game when it’s over, rather than having to sit through all the debriefing that follows. In <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can quit out of a match the second a team completes an objective and is declared the winner, allowing you to skip past the victory animation and play of the game clip and hop right back into the queue. This shaves off minutes of downtime between playing, and after years of being able to jump right out in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, I feel my momentum screech to a halt in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>as I’m forced to sit through the post-match breakdown. It’s a little thing, but I notice it every time I finish a match.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9f223ce5c235896add23e05f8c76aa3d" data-recommend-id="image://9f223ce5c235896add23e05f8c76aa3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mercy reaches out to someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mercy reaches out to someone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f223ce5c235896add23e05f8c76aa3d" data-recommend-id="image://9f223ce5c235896add23e05f8c76aa3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mercy reaches out to someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This has been my biggest takeaway while comparing <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. NetEase’s game feels like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>without all the baggage and expectations that come with being a competitive game with esports aspirations. It’s pretty unbalanced by most live-service standards, has more heroes than it knows what to do with just a month after release, and half the roster feels “broken.” But who gives a fuck? <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has lost so much of its sauce, cutting off big plays at the knees by reworking and flattening its characters, while <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’<em> </em>heroes make it feel like the <em>Overwatch </em>of old. Adam Warlock’s ability to revive his whole team like Mercy used to be able to in <em>Overwatch </em>echoes a simpler time. I like to believe <em>Overwatch 2 </em>isn’t so far gone that it can’t be like that again. They’re exploring going back to the 6v6 structure; hopefully that’s a sign that the old <em>Overwatch</em> spirit isn’t out of reach.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>No doubt fuelling speculation about a series revival, Capcom has released the original Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2 into the wild once more, adding them to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/">GOG.com’s Preservation Program</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dino Crisis | Trailer [GOG]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFj7yBrt6So?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dino Crisis was a PS1 hit from the Resident Evil team, sharing a lot of similar game concepts to the zombie mansion thriller, but with dinosaurs and a much faster pacing. That survival horror of the first game was then ditched almost entirely for more of an action-shooter style for the sequel a year later.</p>
<p>With the success of the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-review/">Resident Evil remakes</a> that brought a much more modern third person view and gameplay to the classics, and with the dinosaur-filled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/24/exoprimal-review/">Exoprimal</a>, fans of Dino Crisis have been feeling a bit left out in the cold.</p>
<p>The Dino Crisis duo have had some major restorative work in their re-release on GOG.com, with the GOG Preservation Program ensuring that there’s full compatibility with modern Windows systems, added render options with up to 4K resolution support, and added functionality for a menagerie of gamepads. They’ve even gone in and fixed bugs like a save corruption issue when leaving dropped weapons!</p>

<p>The games are available individually for £8.99 or in a bundle for £15.29.</p>
<p>Here’s the full breakdown:</p>
<h3><strong>Dino Crisis</strong>:</h3>
<ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has made some major leadership changes, ditching the co-CEO strategy that saw Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino heading up PlayStation together and switching to a more traditional hierarchy.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/new-leadership-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Sony reveals that Nishino has been appointed the sole president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. Hulst will remain in his position as head of PlayStation Studios, but he'll be reporting to Nishino now.</p>

<p>Additionally, Sony president and COO Hiroki Totoki, who served as interim Interactive CEO after Jim Ryan <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jim-ryan-retiring-as-playstation-ceo-after-30-years-at-sony" rel="nofollow">retired last year</a>, will now serve as Sony president and CEO, while SIE corporate strategy SVP Lin Tao will become the CFO of Sony as a whole. Her successor at SIE hasn't yet been appointed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hermen-hulst-playstation-leadership-shakeup.jpg?itok=VgjfS5a4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hermen-hulst-playstation-leadership-shakeup.jpg?itok=FOrUN63C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hermen Hulst will remain as head of PlayStation Studios, but he's no longer the co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>In essence, not much has actually changed in terms of Hulst and Nishino's roles; Sony says that Nishino will still serve as president of the "Platform Business Group", and that Hulst will remain head of "Studio Business Group".</p>

<p>In that role, Hulst will "continue to lead the development, publishing, and business operations of SIE's first-party content", and he'll also continue working with PlayStation Productions on bringing Sony IP to other media, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" rel="nofollow">like movies</a>.</p>

<p>This change is more of a hierarchical one; rather than serving on the same level, Hulst will now report to Nishino.</p>

<p>It's not clear what's prompted this change, but we do know that it's coming after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">failure of first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>, which is arguably one of the most disastrous flops in the company's gaming history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sony-leadership-shakeup-concord.jpg?itok=yvFkoe0c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sony-leadership-shakeup-concord.jpg?itok=IJTlj4ng 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Last year, PlayStation experienced what is probably one of its biggest flops ever in&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Recently, Sony also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled live-service projects</a> in development at PlayStation subsidiaries Bend and Bluepoint, and an in-development MMO based on the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>IP was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">reportedly shut down</a>&nbsp;recently as well.</p>

<p>Given the fact that Hulst is remaining in his position, it's not clear whether these developments are related to the leadership shakeup, but the fact Nishino alone will head up Sony Interactive Entertainment feels significant on that front.</p>

<p>Whether or not this has a material effect on PlayStation's strategy in the future remains to be seen. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>I cherish my fairly sharp memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-pc-review">the 2016 launch version of No Man's Sky</a>, inasmuch as the contrast renders the latest additions to the wistful space game all the more dazzling. Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s Worlds Part 2 update, there is talk of adding "billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets" to a game that already harbours more worlds than any mortal player community could ever explore, including new, somehow walkable gas giants that are "ten times bigger than our biggest planet". Also oceans so deep you can't see the sun. Please excuse me, I think my thalassophobia and agoraphobia have fused into a single sprawling fear of literally everything, "literally everything" being the title of a hypothetical No Man's Sky's update in, oh, let's say 24 months' time. Find a video below with commentary from Hello Games managing director Sean Murray.</p>

<p>Let me attempt to zoom from the terror of the macrocosm to the pleasantries of individual exploration and survival. The gas giants look a bit spesh, don't they? Going by the trailer, you'll be walking on their hard rocky cores or perhaps, hopping around on fragments of solid matter launched into their upper atmospheres. I assume they've wrangled with the problem that the gravity ought to render you two-dimensional. It predictably reminds me of Giant's Deep in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, which always used to make my knees dance a nervous jig whenever I'd fly through the clouds. The <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/">official patch notes</a> may reveal more - they weren't live at the time this was written.</p><p>As for the deeper oceans, this is definitely making inroads on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>'s turf, though existing No Man's Sky oceans are pretty voluminous and atmospheric already. I am always glad to swim amongst dangling sacks of kelp. Please do not eat me, semi-randomised abyssal critters.</p>
<p>The video makes fleeting mention of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-no-fire">Light No Fire</a>, Hello Games's forthcoming fantasy roamabout,  which takes place on one, Earth-sized planet. I continue to like that game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-studio-hello-games-unveil-light-no-fire-a-fantasy-survival-game-set-on-a-single-huge-planet">puckish Carrollian stylings</a>, and letting the designers and artists focus on a single, albeit vast landscape could have interesting ramifications, but the more they flesh out No Man's Sky, the harder it is to see what Light No Fire really brings to the party. Hopefully we'll get a proper demo soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Oceans can be “several kilometers deep” now as well, and a new lighting system lets water reflect clouds, stars, physical objects and ships, while creatures will create more convincing ripples.

<p>Trade Tokens are a unique Pokémon TCG Pocket consumable as they are used to swap Pokémon between friends, and there are ways to gather them fast and easily for higher-profile Trading.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has been a smash hit since day one. Its first month alone made over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$120 million</a>, and its developers have continued to pump constant content into the free-to-play Pokémon title. One absent feature was finally added in January 2025—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-trade-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a>.</p>



<p>Part of the long-awaited function requires you to micromanage a currency called Trade Tokens. This handy guide shows you how to get Tokens, the best ways to do so, and how to use them.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to Get Trade Tokens in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Give up cards in exchange. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket Trade Tokens are earned by exchanging duplicate cards in the “My Cards” section of the app. It has to be a card with a rarity rating of Three-Diamond or higher.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re familiar with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-flair-in-pokemon-pocket-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair</a>, this should be quite straightforward. A quick inspection of your card collection shows you how many of each card you have. You likely have a larger quantity of One-Diamond and Two-Diamond cards than you do anything else.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide to getting Trade Tokens in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>:</p>



<ol>
<li>On the Pokémon TCG Pocket app, press the <strong>My Cards</strong> button found along the bottom bar tabs.</li>



<li>Find a Three-Diamond-rarity Card or higher.</li>



<li>Make sure you have <strong>three or more of the Card</strong>.</li>



<li>If you do, press on it.</li>



<li>Choose <strong>Obtain Items</strong>.</li>



<li>Press on the <strong>Trade Token</strong> exchange option (<strong>it’s the green symbol I’ve shown in the guide already</strong>).</li>



<li>Finally, press <strong>Exchange</strong>.</li>



<li>An animation plays to give you your Trade Token(s) at the end of it.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-fastest-way-to-get-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Fastest Way to Get Trade Tokens in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>The best and fastest way to get Trade Tokens is to open more packs and make sure to exchange duplicates of your highest-rated cards to get more Trade Tokens.</strong></p>



<p>You can’t buy Trade Tokens in the shop, nor can you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-real-money-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spend real money on Trading</a>. Sacrificing your highest-rated swaps is the best way to get more Trade Tokens right now. To do so, open Packs, acquire more Hourglasses from the Shop, battles, and Events, and hoard those Packs!</p>



<p>Remember, you need to have <strong>at least three of a card to use the Obtain Items feature and obtain Trade Tokens</strong>. I was fortunate by the time Trading came around, I had several Three-Star Charizard ex 280/226 cards, allowing me to earn a lot of Trade Tokens from the get-go. </p>



<p>If you’re not interested in Flair, or you favor Trade Tokens, this is currently the way to go.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-trade-tokens-can-you-get-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How Many Trade Tokens Can You Get in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>From zero to hero. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can earn anywhere between 25 to 1,500 Trade Tokens depending on the rarity of the Card you exchange in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick table showing you the exact value of each rarity, so you know what you’re getting in return for the swap.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Card Rarity</th><th data-align="center">Trade Tokens Obtained</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Three-Diamond</td><td data-align="center">25</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Four-Diamond</td><td data-align="center">125</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">One-Star</td><td data-align="center">100</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Two-Star</td><td data-align="center">300</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Three-Star</td><td data-align="center">300</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Gold Crown</td><td data-align="center">1,500</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-are-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What Are Trade Tokens in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>Trade Tokens are one of two items required to perform a Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</strong></p>



<p>It would be nice to do a simple one-off Trade like in the Pokémon games. However, just as Pokémon GO requires Stardust, Pocket adheres to its own consumable item currencies: <strong>Trade Tokens </strong>and <strong>Trade Stamina</strong>.</p>



<p>The better the rarity of the Pokémon, the more Trade Tokens are needed. If you follow my guide though, it should be easier than catching a Weedle with a Master Ball. Stay on top of Trade Tokens and you should always have enough to perform quick Trades.</p>



<hr>



<p>Is Trading something you use a lot in Pokémon TCG Pocket? Are you disappointed it’s only certain rarities that can be traded? Let us know down below with a quick comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> has received its long awaited trading update today and, despite players slamming the mechanic upon developer Creatures Inc. revealing how it would work last week, it's somehow launched to an even worse reception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have taken to social media to share their frustration at the trading feature, criticizing it for having too many requirements and too many restrictions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond">While the latter were revealed upon trading's announcement last week</a>, the former was veiled under the statement "items must be consumed in order to trade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the Wonder Pick feature or opening booster packs, every instance of trading will require two separate, new use of items. The first is similar to those other mechanics, where in order to trade players must have Trade Stamina. This recovers over time or can be exchanged for Poké Gold, meaning real world money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Trade Tokens</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The other item is what's causing a stir amongst the Pokémon TCG Pocket community, however. Trade Tokens are also required for trading any card at 3 Diamonds or higher. 120 Trade Tokens are required to trade a 3 Diamond card, 400 are required to trade a 1 Star card, and 500 are required to trade a 4 Diamond card, meaning an ex Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trade Tokens can only be obtained by essentially selling cards. Players can delete from their collection a 3 Diamond card for 25 Trade Tokens, a 1 Star card for 100, a 4 Diamond card for 125, a 2 Star card for 300, a 3 Star immersive card for 300, and a Crown gold card for 1500. Cards of lower rarities are worthless, though require no Trade Tokens to trade either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means players must sell, for example, five ex Pokémon before they can trade one ex Pokémon, or five 1 Star card (the rarest available to trade) before they can trade one 1 Star card. What's more, selling one Crown rarity card, which are the rarest in the game and may not be obtained even after months of playing, will only net players enough tokens to trade three ex Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Selling one of the next rarity, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">the 3 Star immersive art cards used a selling point for Pokémon TCG Pocket itself</a>, doesn't grant enough Trade Tokens to trade either a 1 Star card or a 4 Diamond card.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/29/screenshot-2025-01-29-121328-1738152907054.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">'A Monumental Failure'</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">"The trading update is an insult," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ick9qr/as_a_whale_this_game_isnt_getting_another_dime/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hurtbowler</a> on Reddit in a post with over 1,000 upvotes, a player who vowed not to spend another penny on the game. "It's just frustrating. The greed is just so excessive I can't be inclined to spend another dollar. They should probably remove 'Trading Card Game' from the title screen. It's just insulting to look at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's silly to have to burn two immersive cards to be able to trade just one 4 Diamond ex," said someone in the comments. "I understand they want to keep people from creating bots and exploiting the system, but this is currently absurd."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others called it "hilariously toxic" and "monumental failure," and lamented that a "safe way for the community to connect more" was sacrificed for something "so laborious." Exchanging something for Trade Tokens also takes around 15 seconds, meaning many will have to spend minutes in menus before they can trade a single card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If these are the trade costs, the app should be renamed to Pokémon Card Game Pocket wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1iciykf/trades_are_very_expensive/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darkmalice</a> in the comments of a post discussing the high costs. "I don't think they want people trading at all," said another user. "That's why they made it so bad."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pay Day</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have complained trading is fairly clearly being implemented as a means of increasing revenue for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">is estimated to have made $200 million in its first month</a>, before trading was possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also evidenced by the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher, as if players could immediately trade for their missing cards, they wouldn't need to spend $10 or $100 or more for a random chance of getting them. It cost one player around $1,500 just to complete the first set, for example, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pockets-next-set-is-a-diamond-and-pearl-themed-booster-called-space-time-smackdown">the third in three months will be available tomorrow</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The trading system is predatory and downright greedy," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1icl551/the_trading_system_is_predatory_and_downright/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACNL</a> on Reddit, who outlined the Trade Token conversion rates. "That's just messed up man. Like who designed this? If there were other ways to get tokens, this might be passable, but at the moment there are no other ways to get tokens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This isn't sustainable at all. On top of that, you can't even burn a card unless you have three copies of it. If you want to trade in this game, you better buy a ton of packs and keep buying them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Creatures Inc. Stays Quiet</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. has not yet commented on the backlash to trading. Doing so is a rare move for the developer but it did so for the initial complaints when trading was revealed last week. "Your concerns are seen," it said at the time. "Once this feature becomes available, I'd like to invite everyone to try it and provide feedback. This way, the game can continue to evolve in an enjoyable way for everyone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This response made it sound as though things may be better than fans expected, but that is certainly not the case. IGN as asked Creatures Inc. for comment on this reaction and if any changes are planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned by some users, the trading mechanic could be rectified somewhat by Pokémon TCG Pocket including Trade Tokens as rewards for missions and such. It's more likely Trade Stamina will feature in these though, as it has so far included adjacent items like Wonder Stamina and Pack Hourglasses as rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the introduction of such a poorly received mechanic today is a bad look for a game about to debut its next big update, which will introduce Diamond and Pearl Pokémon such as Dialga and Palkia to the digital card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
