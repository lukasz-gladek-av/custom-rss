            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Across <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight's</a> 14 chapters, you'll be able to find 103 notes to read that add a good chunk of context to the greater story being told.</p>
<p>The storytelling is arguably the best thing about South of Midnight, so you'll want to find and read all of these notes. Here's where to find all the notes in Chapter 3.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 3</h2>
<p>There are a total of 7 notes to find in Chapter 3, and the first one will come ahead of meeting your big fishy friend.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Happiest Day</strong> - You'll find this note right after learning the double-jump ability. It's once again a painted symbol note that appears just ahead of collecting the first Health Filament, so if you've reached the Health Filament and haven't collected it, turn back.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The St. Sylvain Bulletin</strong> - Right after your conversation with Rhubarb, turn back to look at his house. This note is on the very front, right next to the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Follow the Lights</strong> - Before leaving Rhubarb's house, go around the back of it to find a set of stairs leading down to a dock. At the back of the small building, there's a Floof knot and a note that's attached to a small post.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Ain't Wanted Here</strong> - After following the main path from Rhubarb's house, just past the first expanding bramble hazard you'll face, there's a two-story house you can walk into. Just beyond the door and on the right-hand side, you'll find this note next to a wooden owl.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Gift for Corrine</strong> - Once you've cleared the first stigma that reveals a memory, to your left will be a house that you'll notice has a staircase you can weave. Weaving that staircase and following it will lead you to a Floof knot, but not this note. Instead, go beyond the entrance to the house and follow the path to the right. At the end of the dock here you'll find a note and a piece of metal you can push for some extra Floof's.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Beggin' your pardon, Mayor</strong> - After collecting the last note, follow the main path, and at the end of your first wall-running section you'll enter into a two-story house. On the first floor, on a table to the left, you'll find this note to the Mayor.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Come One, Come All!</strong> - This last note for Chapter 3 is on the second floor of the same house you'll find the last note in, attached to a post and just ahead of another Floof knot.</p>
<p>That's where you'll find all 7 notes in Chapter 3 in South of Midnight. Only 89 more to go, if you've been following along these guides.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/streets-of-rage-finally-hits-nintendo-switch-online-plus-two-more-genesis-games.1161639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/streets-of-rage-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added three more Sega Genesis games to its Nintendo Switch Online library, and one of them is one of the most celebrated beat-'em-up games of its generation.</p>

<p>Having already brought the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-genesis-november-2024" rel="nofollow"><em>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron</em></a>, super-hard platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-june-2023-genesis" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghouls 'n Ghosts</em></a>, and side-scroller&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-gets-new-genesis-games" rel="nofollow">Altered Beast</a>&nbsp;</em>to the Switch Online Genesis lineup, the first game in today's haul is another bona fide classic.</p>

<p>That's right: none other than&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>is making its Nintendo Switch Online debut. You might think you've already played this one on the service, but in fact, you've played the 1992 sequel&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 2</em>, which was, until today, the only&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>game on Switch Online.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-streets-of-rage-genesis.jpg?itok=TKceEK6N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-streets-of-rage-genesis.jpg?itok=sbCc2yz2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>is finally available on Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just about&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>, so if you've never been of the side-scrolling beat-'em-up persuasion, don't worry; there are two more games that might tickle your fancy.</p>

<p>The first of these is&nbsp;<em>Super Thunder Blade</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Space Harrier</em>-slash-<em>Star Fox</em>-style shooter with some impressive (if somewhat hard to look at in the year of our lord 2025) visual effects.</p>

<p>Lastly, today's Genesis haul brings&nbsp;<em>ESWAT: City Under Siege&nbsp;</em>to Switch Online. It's a side-scroller, but it's a shooter with more in common with the likes of&nbsp;<em>Super Turrican&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em>Contra </em>series&nbsp;than with&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>.</p>

<p>All three of these games are available right now with a Nintendo Switch Online membership, although you will have to pick up the Expansion Pack addon if you want to play them.</p>




<p>These Switch Online games come at a time when Nintendo is gearing up to release the Switch 2, the successor to the original Switch (if the name didn't already give that away).</p>

<p>The console is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to launch on June 5th</a>, although pre-orders in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a> have been delayed due to the former's President Donald Trump imposing sweeping economic tariffs on various countries and economic bodies around the world.</p>

<p>With that being said, Trump subsequently issued a 90-day pause for those tariffs in all countries but China, so there's every possibility that we'll get a new pre-order date for the Switch 2 sometime soon. While we wait, you can check out these three new Genesis games on Switch Online right now if you've got the Expansion Pack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It makes sense that other people want to capitalize on the success of Schedule 1. The indie title continues to eclipse all expectations and is one of the most successful games of 2025. Its creator has now commented on other games copying its title, and also given a hint toward a console port.</p>



<p>The days and weeks are going by, and Schedule 1 is showing no sign of slowing up. The player base is reveling in the chance to deal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drugs</a> and show up thugs. An ongoing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-rival-drug-dealer-simulator-says-there-is-no-lawsuit-amid-review-bombing-investigation-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> can’t stop it, and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new updates adding a Pawn Shop</a> and more value-adding features, it’s hard not to love Schedule 1 right now.</p>



<p>Other companies feel this way as they’re using its name. Schedule 1’s developer has taken to X to address the ongoing movement, and also given hope to PlayStation and Xbox fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-developer-would-love-to-port-schedule-i-to-console">Schedule 1 Developer Would “Love to Port Schedule I to Console”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It might not be on a computer screen forever. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tyler1</a> is the main developer at TVGS—the maker of Schedule 1. This is the company’s first game, and they probably didn’t expect this level of success.</p>



<p>On April 11, Tyler took to X to comment on a recent trend concerning the game: “Hi everyone, As you may be aware, there have been some games on the PlayStation store appearing over the past few weeks with the name ‘Schedule I’ in them. Just confirming these are not affiliated with me in any way.”</p>



<p>You get a lot of ‘smaller’ games appearing on the PS Store in the same fashion as Steam. It can be easy for games to slip through the cracks. But as Schedule 1 isn’t on PlayStation, it gives other games (with the name) a chance to be on there. Whether they get to keep the name remains to be seen. But Tyler1 also commented on Schedule 1’s platform status and plans.</p>



<p>“I’d love to port Schedule I to console when the game is at the right stage for that, but I will announce it to the Schedule I community well before it happens,” he says.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Hi everyone,

<p>Search volume for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 console port</a> is high. The people want it, the people need it, and it’s clear TVGS wants to make it happen. We’ll keep on top of this to see if a Schedule 1 console port does eventually happen.</p>

			<p>The first version of the Dark Souls Remastered Seamless Co-op mod is now available for download, allowing PC players to enjoy the entirety of the game together with other players with little to no restrictions.</p>
<p>The mod, developed by Yui, the same developer behind the Seamless Co-op for <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-seamless-co-op-mod/">Dark Souls 3</a>, overhauls the multiplayer component of the vanilla game, allowing up to five players to enjoy the entirety of the game together, removing fog walls and barriers that limit the co-op multiplayer experience of the vanilla game and making game progression and world state sync for all players in a session. To make the experience more enjoyable, the mod also introduces some balance changes with enemy scaling extended to all enemies, unlike the vanilla game, which only has it for bosses, and some quality-of-life improvements, such as the ability to rejoin the session's host from anywhere in the game's world and light sources created by one player in the session becoming available for all players. You can download the mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/899?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and see it in action in the video below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A brand new edition of <em>Catan</em> is now available. The aptly named <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em>, is the first significant evolution of the iconic strategy game since 2015, bringing a streamlined and more accessible experience to players worldwide.</p>

<h2>The <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Catan Studio announced the changes coming to <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em>. Generally, the core gameplay that made <em>Catan</em> a pop culture and tabletop gaming staple is still here. Gathering resources, trading among friends, getting into small arguments over wood and sheep, etc..</p>

It will feature brighter box art alongside updated components and packaging. it isn't as elaborate as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Catan Masterpiece</a> Kickstarter, but it is a modest upgrade nonetheless.</p>

<p>These new components will be part of <em>Catan Sixth Edition's</em> more eco-friendly design. Box trays have been redesigned to be more environmentally conscious, and the box will contain fewer plastic pieces. The box also has expanded storage, allowing it to accommodate the 5-6 Player Extension Pack. This doesn't mean the base box can contain all expansions, but it is a start.</p>

<p>On that topic, <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em> will have several expansions. These include Seafarers, Cities &amp; Knights, and the aforementioned 5-6 Player Extension Pack.</p>

<p>Lastly, the game will feature more inclusive, user-friendly design elements. The game's artwork will portray more diverse character illustrations. The newly textured hex tiles and premium card trays will provide a more tactile play experience. Finally, the updated rulebook will contain streamlined rules alongside visual examples, helping more players understand the core experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For CATAN’s 6th edition, we aimed to enhance the player experience while preserving the game’s core mechanics," said Benjamin Teuber, managing director and game designer at CATAN GmbH. "With updated packaging, refreshed artwork, and a streamlined rulebook, we’re honoring our father’s legacy while making the game more approachable for new and longtime players alike."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Catan Sixth Edition</em> is available right now. The base game is being sold at an MSRP of $49.99. The Seafarers expansion is available at an MSRP of $49.99, and the Cities &amp; Knights expansion is available at an MSRP of $54.99.</p>

            <p>
Tequila Works, the indie developer behind Deadlight, Rime and Gylt, is selling off all of its assets in an open auction after declaring bankruptcy at the end of last year. 
</p>
<p>
The rights and trademarks to its games and several unfinished prototypes are now <a href="https://www.escrapalia.com/en/event/evento-de-subasta-activos-intangibles-de-tequila-works-s-l-202503311113069684">listed for sale on auction website Escrapalia</a>, with bids being taken for the next 32 days.
</p>
<p>
Rime and Gylt are currently both fetching the most interest, with around 150 bids for each and an asking price of €15.5k (£13.5k) for each. At the time of writing, Deadlight is going for €2600 (about £2250).
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, this sale also reveals prototypes for other Tequila Works projects, sold as "vertical slices" the company likely made to pitch to publishers. 
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Mariner is described as an open-world narrative action adventure "focused on human emotions as the engine of gameplay". 
</p>
<p>
Dungeon Tour, meanwhile, would have been a "mid-core cooperative party game for up to four players" where you managed a horde of tourists through dungeons. Tequila Works says it was aiming for a visual and narrative style featuring "dark and absurd humour, in a conceptual mix between Overcooked and Dungeon Keeper".
</p>
<p>
Then there's Brawler Crawler, a multiplayer title focused on combat in "a chaotic urban universe where the player explores and struggles to master their own combat style". This would have featured procedurally-generated lanes with tough raids and bosses.
</p>
<p>
Back in November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gylt-and-rime-studio-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency-says-prolonged-market-conditions-left-no-other-option">Tequila Works announced it was filing for insolvency</a> as "prolonged market conditions" had left it no other option. Founded in Madrid in 2009, the company's most recent game was Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story, which was released under the now-defunct Riot Forge publishing label.
</p>
<p>Announcing the company's shutdown, Tequila Works boss Térence Mosca said he was "proud of what [the team] has accomplished together".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The beta version of an impressive Devil May Cry 3 overhaul mod called Crimson will be released next month, introducing many features and improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remake.</p>
<p>The release date for the mod's beta, May 13th, was announced with a five-minute-long trailer that goes over the many improvements it will bring to the PC version of the third entry in the series, such as inertia for aerial combat, which will allow players to create intricate movement-based combos, Guardfly, a unique mechanic that allows Dante to fly all over the screen using some unique properties of the Royal Guard's Guard abilities while in the air like in Devil May Cry 4, increased jump cancel hitboxes for better jump canceling, increased enemy juggle time, revamped HUD, and a weapon wheel and on-the-fly style switching, similar to those introduced in the Nintendo Switch port of the game's Special Edition released a while back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Devil May Cry 3 Crimson - Beta Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cEVPo9wxjeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/">latest entry in the series</a> having been released a few years back, the Devil May Cry series got into the spotlight once again this month thanks to the release of the Netflix animated show, which has been confirmed to have been renewed for <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910332636712608222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a second season</a>. Unfortunately, with series long-time director Hideaki Itsuno having left CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">last year </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-creator-hideaki-itsuno-joins-tencents-lightspeed-to-work-on-aaa-action-games/">to join Tencent's LightSpeed</a>, the future of the franchise is uncertain, but hopefully, the success of the animated show will convince the publisher to continue the series even without Itsuno-san's involvement.</p>

<p>Balatro creator and developer LocalThunk has praised Blue Prince as one of the best games he’s ever played.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Thunk <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1910361969288225080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>, “Blue Prince is already one of the best games I’ve ever played and I still feel like I’m scratching the surface. Released today but lucky me I’ve been playing it all week (perks of the job)”</p>



<p>“Get a journal, a pen, and buy the game already,” he continued. </p>



<p>Blue Prince is developed by Dogubomb and see’s the player explore a mysterious manor with shifting rooms called Mt. Holly. </p>



<p>“In&nbsp;Blue Prince, you embark on a genre-defying experience, filled with a unique mix of mystery, strategy, and puzzles that weave together to create an unpredictable journey. Will your explorative steps lead you to the rumored Room 46?” the game description reads.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, reviews of the game went live and has amassed a 92/100 score via 31 critics, receiving “universal acclaim” status. For those who played the game, it’s already being hailed as a Game of The Year contender and at the very least, is in the running for winning Indie Game of The Year.</p>



<p>Blue Prince is available now on the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and available via PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <p>Black Mirror may show us a variety of near-future dystopias, but at least those unfortunate to live through one of them can play Balatro.</p>
<p>The poker-themed roguelike Balatro became a smash hit on its release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">selling 1m copies in its first month</a>, and things have only gone from strength to strength for solo developer LocalThunk.

<p>Yes, Balatro is in the new Black Mirror series, in the third episode of its seventh season. This episode is called Hotel Reverie, and its synopsis reads thus: "A high-tech remake of a classic film sends its A-list star into another dimension, where she must stick to the script if she ever wants to make it home."</p>
<p>Balatro is a pastime of the A-list star's agent. When the two are on the phone together early on in the episode, the card game can be seen on the agent's laptop.</p>
<p>This moment was spotted and shared on social media, with LocalThunk quickly responding. "So uh Balatro is now canonically in Black Mirror," the developer wrote. The show's creator Charlie Brooker then replied with a saluting emoji.</p>
<p>I wonder where Balatro may show up next? Hollywood, perhaps. </p>

            <p>
The director of A Minecraft Movie has reacted to the chaotic scenes seen in some cinemas as viewers interrupt screenings to stand up, scream and empty buckets of popcorn over other people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie is a breakout success that's performed far beyond initial expectations</a>, seemingly fuelled by its viral nature among younger viewers. In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">videos on social media have shown crowds reacting wildly to the film's now-notorious "Chicken Jockey" scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while the trend may be popular, it hasn't gone down well with all cinema goers. Viewers have been removed from showings for disruptive behaviour and <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2025/04/08/wasilla-police-eject-rowdy-teens-from-minecraft-movie-showing/">police have been called</a> as the trend has continued - escalating now to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-are-taking-live-chickens-into-screenings-of-the-minecraft-movie-now-as-chicken-jockey-meme-gets-out-of-hand">disturbing incident where someone brought a live chicken into a screening</a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps unusurprisingly, A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess doesn't sound too bothered about it all. 
</p>
<p>
"It's way too funny," Hess told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/movies/chicken-jockey-minecraft-movie.html">New York Times</a>. "It's been a total blast. I'm just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.
</p>
<p>
"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies  - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."
</p>
<p>
Is it okay to dump your popcorn over other people? Hess seems to think so. 
</p>
<p>
"No one's going to get hurt from popcorn," he concluded. "Look, when I go to the movies with my kids, it’s like a popcorn massacre that happens and they're not throwing anything, but it ends up on the ground, regardless."
</p>
<p>
Just spare a thought for the minimum wage employee who has to come along a clear it up.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">the success of A Minecraft Movie has already sparked talk of a sequel</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s been the week of the Switch 2 pre-order. I won’t bore you with the details, but getting mine felt like one of those levels in a game where annoying enemies keep swiping health off you, making you fall down a hole, and sending you back to the start. Still, I got one in the end, and now I can rest easy that I won’t be mournfully watching all my friends playing Mario Kart World on the 5th of June. When I wasn’t doing that, I was playing the excellent South of Midnight, which has to be one of the most beautiful games of 2025, more Yakuza: Like A Dragon and loads of retro stuff as well, including a blast on Sega Rally Championship and Mario Kart 64.</p>

<p>Aran has played and reviewed his first game of the year contender, Blue Prince. He says, “Every puzzle game fan should play it, because this game will be talked about for years. I’ve also started Promise Mascot Agency for review, and that has made me chuckle quite a few times. Review hopefully next week.” Blue Prince is on PlayStation Plus and Game Pass, so you really have no excuse not to play it!</p>
<p>Tuffcub has been Destiny 2ing as well as making a start on Steel Seed. His review of that will appear in two weeks!</p>
<p>Jim is making good progress in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and he says that some of those rougher gameplay edges have been worn down after unlocking various character upgrades. “Naoe has become a truly overpowered Shinobi who can clear enemy castles with ease – that’s probably thanks to me fiddling with some of the stealth difficulty options but it makes the game damn more enjoyable.”</p>


<p>Gamoc has kept things simple this week, playing Hogwarts Legacy and Balatro. Meanwhile, Steve has enjoyed some time revisiting The Simulation in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/10/the-talos-principle-reawakened-review-more-in-heaven-and-earth-than-your-philosophy/">Talos Principle Reawakened</a>, and he says that, “It joins The Blue Prince in possibly the best day of releases for puzzle fans in history. Also finished Atomfall with the self-destruct ending but will replay at some point to clear up stuff I didn’t do. Played some indie games for review so will get those up soon. Still persevering with Skywalker Saga but easing the pain of that by starting the beautiful South of Midnight. Combat is a bit one-note (although abilities are unlocking to help this) but the world is superb and I’ve always got time for a good linear game with a solid story and an identity of its own.”</p>
<p>Tef, meanwhile, has continued to give us a rundown of every game he played on Switch 2, which has only continued to cause jealousy and dissent amongst the team.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played? And did you get a Switch 2 pre-order?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-players-on-pc-wont-need-a-playstation-account-say-bungie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You won't need a PlayStation account to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> on PC, promise Bungie as their shooter's marketing blitz picks up speed. Previous games under Sony's umbrella, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, caused frustration and backlash when PC players were forced to register for a PlayStation account just to play online. But it looks like Sony's recent backpedalling on this requirement will save the upcoming extraction shooter from pissing off PC folks. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox," said the developers in the game's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1359676173122146395/1359709351086129326">official Discord</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/556790/marathon-psn-account-xbox-pc-playstation-bungie">Polygon</a>). A plain and straightforward confirmation that they won't be doing any of that nonsense. Fans reacted with lots of fire emojis and some pink cats, a reference to the cyberdermal kitty that lies down with the corpse of a defeated runner in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungies-pink-cyborg-pussycat-teases-a-proper-marathon-trailer">most recent teaser trailer</a>. </p>
<p>That teaser was released to build hype for another trailer which Bungie plans to unveil tomorrow, and which should show some footage of the actual stuff you'll be doing in the game. I'm looking forward to knowing what the bullets sound like.</p>
<p>The PSN account fiasco began in earnest when the requirement was introduced to Helldivers 2 post-release. Players were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">deeply annoyed at the inconvenience</a>, and some pointed out that it meant the game would become unplayable in certain regions in which PlayStation accounts could not be set up. </p>
<p>PlayStation eventually relented and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">removed the requirement</a> for Helldivers 2 in the wake of angry review bombing but still tried to enforce it on other games, some of them entirely single player in nature, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered. In the end, the company seems to have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">totally backed down from the idea</a>, making a PSN account optional for their upcoming games. And from Bungie's words it looks like this will also be the case for Marathon. Good to know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> may have dominated any and all Nintendo news this month so far, we still have some Sega-related goodness for the here and now to break things up a bit.</p>
<p>Nintendo has today updated its Sega Genesis / Mega Drive catalogue for Switch Online members, and added three more classic games for us to enjoy. These games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streets of Rage</li>
<li>Super Thunder Blade</li>
<li>ESWAT: City Under Siege</li>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/index.html">Snakists</a> is a game by Pippin Barr, author of many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/pippin-barr">small and wonderful ludic experiments</a>. The most pertinent of which, in this case, is <a href="https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISMS/">Snakisms</a>. That one takes the can-I-borrow-your-Nokia-for-a-minute-mate 'em up and explores a smattering of experimental design tunnels based on different schools of thoughts. 'Pessimism', for example, forces you to contend with a prized gobblin' dot placed permanently outside the confines of your snakely entrapment box, 'Asceticism' kills you as soon as you eat a dot, and so on.</p>
<p>Snakists takes this concept and applies it to concepts ending with 'ist'. Deist, purist, sadist, and so on, for a total of 20 different tail-wriggling tales. I enjoy them for how they both celebrate Snake and also employ its relative simplicity as a neutral palette on which to mix colourful synthesis of languages both human and game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For example, 'alarmist' is funny to play because it shouts at you whenever you get even mildly close to a wall. But it also stands as a sharply apt metaphor for the self-fulfilling prophecy that is constant anxiety. The closer you get to wall, the more the screen is obscured by the word 'CAREFUL!', until you can see so little you are all but guaranteed to die. The message is clear: get out of your own way. If you spend all your time worrying about tripping over, your legs will seize up and you will eat shit post haste.</p>
<p>Another favourite here is 'tourist', which is effectively just regular snake played over an image of a nice building. I appreciate its non judgemental attitude, leaving me to consider the implications of tourism on my own time, perhaps outside a nice cafe. Perhaps I'll scout around a bit and see where and what the locals are having, or perhaps I'll get really annoyed because this coastal Spanish town can't get my fried egg and chips the way I like it, as is the English way.</p>
<p>Much to think about. Many dots to consume.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>People often get snarky about Reddit but I consider the work of user _inferno_44 to be better games journalism than anything I've written in at least a month, probably longer. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jvezvr/i_followed_kyle_for_a_week_heres_his_daily">Three</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jvn6um/following_up_our_employee_of_the_year_heres_the">colour</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jw7rxo/by_popular_demand_i_followed_jessi_for_a_day_to">coded</a> spreadsheets blocking out three <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schedule-1">Schedule I</a> NPC's daily routines, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">ox watchin</a>' style.

<p>They're surprisingly detailed for something that's mainly there to get you to hoof around a bit. Plus fixed routines are just good world building for a weed selling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> such as this. They raise pertinent questions. Does the forbidden spinach blur the ache of sharp routine like existential Alka Seltzer? Or does it encourage such contemplation as to appreciate the hidden rapture in the familiar?</p>

<p>Might we imagine Kyle pressing a soft taco shell against his cheek and feeling, for all the world, like he is being caressed by the glove of creation? His is one of the less varied routines, moving mainly between work and home save a half hour break the skatepark. Still, there's nobility in it, I think. Perhaps we've been misled. Perhaps this was the titular Schedule all this time.</p>
<p>Less industrious is Kyle's roommate, Austin, who splits his time between the community centre and the arcade. At 6:00pm each day, he leaves the arcade and furiously drinks for 45 minutes before returning. I get it, man. It's acutely embarrassing to boast to a stranger that you can "beat Time Crisis in one life" only to repeatedly get your bottom mailed to you by a cabinet tuned far harder than the PS1 version. I'd drink too. Heck, I'm drinking now just thinking about it, and also because it makes my breakfast taste better.</p>
<p>Most varied is fan fave product hound Jessi, who visits four separate locations to sit and smoke and consume canned beverages. Like all the NPCs, she walks in real time between destinations. I've been fascinated by this stuff since Oblivion blew my tiny mind when I spotted an NPC's marker move across the map to the destination I was told to meet him at. I can't say it still feels quite as magical as it did then, but it's still retained some wonder for me. Another reminder that there's more going on under the hood in Schedule I than its sudden explosion of memey popularity might suggests. And an extra reminder, for myself more than anything, that sometimes a lot of people like a thing because it's actually good, you shrivelling hipster.</p>
<p>I mean, rarely, but still.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country - the next game in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>'s Mafia series - will seemingly be arriving as soon as August.</p>
<p>Publisher 2K appears to have accidentally revealed the release date for Mafia: The Old Country via a post on Steam: 8th August 2025.</p>

<p>While the post itself no longer has that all-important date attached, many were able to grab a screenshot of the original with those release details included. "Mafia: The Old Country will be available on August 8, 2025. Pre-orders are available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via Steam," read the text.</p>
<p>This date was likely meant to be saved for Mafia: The Old Country's newly-announced PAX East developer panel, which is scheduled for 8th May at 7pm UK time.</p>
<p>"Watch as Hangar 13 developers debut a new gameplay trailer and offer a rare behind-the-scenes look at the past, present, and future of this storied franchise," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999?l=latam">panel's announcement post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year. While the developer has kept many details about the upcoming title under wraps since, it has confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-early-ad-shows-gorgeous-visuals-summer-2025-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that Mafia: The Old Country would launch this Summer. Now, though, we have a semi-official release date: August 8.</p>
<p>The info briefly appeared in a Steam post that announced a developer panel due to take place at PAX East. On May 8 at 7 PM BST (2 PM ET), Hangar 13 developers will debut a new gameplay trailer and provide a behind-the-scenes look at the past, present, and future of the franchise. During the panel, the studio will provide an in-depth look back at the last 23 years of Mafia, insight into how Hangar 13 brought the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily to life in Unreal Engine 5 for Mafia: The Old Country, a Q&amp;A session and more development insights. Studio President Nick Baynes, Game Director Alex Cox, and Cinematics Director Tomas Hrebicek will be there to attend and reply to several questions, including some taken from the community.&nbsp; Any mention of the launch date was quickly amended, but nothing escapes fans these days.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024, slightly less than a year before its planned release date. As hinted by the title, it will be set in Sicily. The goal is to dive into the criminal organization's origins, dating back to the early 1900s. Players will step into the role of Enzo Favara, who survived a childhood of forced labor and is now all too eager to prove himself to Cosa Nostra and, specifically, Don Torrisi's family.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> by Hangar 13, the game will be a linear, narrative-driven action/adventure grounded in authentic realism. Combat will include melee fights with blades and ranged engagements with firearms. In certain segments, Enzo will use horses and even early motorcars. Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and certainly looks the part, although we don't have any info on the system requirements yet.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-xbox-steam-launch-march-2023-arenas-mode/">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap has announced that its new soccer game, Rematch, will launch on <strong>July 19, 2025</strong>, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass when it launches.</p>
<p>Rematch was first shown during <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards 2024</a>, and it definitely wasn't what players would have expected to be Sloclap's next game after Sifu. Sloclap has brought its brand of close-up action to the beautiful game, and the trailer that Sloclap showed off today during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase further shows how this will probably be unlike any other soccer game currently on the market.</p>
<p>Rematch features 4v4 and 5v5 matches for players to showcase their soccer skills. If you're especially keen to give Rematch a try, Sloclap also announced today that there will be an open beta test for the game in a little more than a week from the time of writing. The beta test will run from April 18-19 and will be available to PC players on Steam.</p>

<p>You can sign up for the beta test by visiting the game's <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/">official website here</a>. If you're already sure you'll be buying Rematch, you can also pre-order one of the game's three editions, ranging from $29.99 USD for just the base game to $49.99 for the 'Elite Edition.' Buying either of the two top-end editions of Rematch grants you 72 hours of early access to Rematch, battle pass rewards, and a few in-game cosmetics to show off in multiplayer matches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was announced just yesterday the the next Xbox Games Showcase is set for June 8, and there’s one game that I’m keeping an eager eye open for. I’ve been waiting to hear something about the State of Decay 3 release date for the longest time, and this could finally be when we find out what’s going on.</p>



<p>Presently, the game doesn’t even have a <strong>release year</strong>. The running rumour is that State of Decay 3 will be released in 2026, but Undead Labs and Xbox Game Studios haven’t confirmed a thing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-me-to-the-apocalypse">Take Me To The Apocalypse</h2>



<p>State of Decay 3 is long overdue, in my book. I’m a huge fan of the franchise and adore the sandbox elements of picking a home and building it up while fighting with a band of permadeath survivors to outlive a zombie apocalypse. It’s everything I want in an end-of-the-world, undead epic.</p>



<p>In September 2024, Undead Labs revealed it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-2-end-support-undead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending support on State of Decay 2</a> to focus entirely on the sequel, which means the team will have had almost a year to get the game in shape by the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Last year</strong>, the Xbox Games Showcase played host to a phenomenal new State of Decay 3 trailer, which I and many other fans lapped up.</p>



<p>We don’t know much at all about State of Decay 3, bar the fact that it’s coming. The new trailer that was released almost a year ago revealed a few tidbits, but it’s nothing that we didn’t already expect from the game, such as fearsome undead enemies, vehicular combat, and multiplayer mechanics.</p>



<p>I’d do malicious things to get my hands on the State of Decay 3 release date – hopefully, something is shown at the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase. It has been almost seven years since the last State of Decay game was released.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a new State of Decay game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-look-at-enshroudeds-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-that-titular-shroud.1161498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-look-at-enshrouded-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-that-titular-shroud<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Right, anyone fancy a small look at the next update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a>? Today's Triple-I showcase delivered exactly that, though I have to admit it's pretty brief, and doesn't show all that much. The game's sixth update, Thralls of Twilight, is due out sometime in May, and seems to come with some big additions. For one, there's new enemies that "creep, crawl, and stalk you further," which sounds… pleasant.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The update will give you a few more reasons to dive into the shroud too. There's more resources, the ability to unlock a new weapons customisation mechanic, and more besides that. Improvements have also apparently been made to the game's nighttime cycle, as there'll be enemy groups going around the world at night with some new rewards you can find too. Gems are also being added that'll let you can attach to your weapons that all have special effects.

Enshrouded's creative director Antony Christoulakis had a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/enshroudeds-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-the-shroud-with-new-monsters-resources-and-a-whole-new-weapon-customization-system/">PCGamer</a> recently too, where he explained that this update is focused on the shroud so much because it's "not strong enough yet from our perspective. So, we introduced new enemies that are coming with the next update, as well as improving the topology and adding more points of interest to these [shrouded regions], and also some new mechanics that hopefully make combat also more interesting."
</p>
<p>
The game has been out in early access for a little over a year now, and the intention was originally that it would be out within a year, but obviously the game needs a bit more time. It's also 20% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/">Steam</a> at the moment, so now seems like a good time to pick it up if you're so inclined.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-editions-hands-on-impressions-%E2%80%93-mixed-makeovers.1161486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-editions-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be home to plenty of original experiences, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, but a core part of the system’s early lineup will be “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” versions of Switch titles. These will include upcoming games that will launch simultaneously on Switch 1 and 2, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, as well as a handful of upgrades to older Switch titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>I recently went hands-on with a number of these new editions at a Nintendo Switch 2 preview event (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can check out my general impressions of the hardware here</a>). I’ve already <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chimed in on the Switch 2 version of Metroid Prime 4</a>, but here’s a roundup of my thoughts on the various Switch 2 Editions of older titles. Are these editions a worthy upgrade or underwhelming? Scroll on for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions2.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</strong></h2>
<p>Both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom were said to run at 4K and 60fps by Nintendo reps at the hands-on event, although I suspect some sort of uprezing was going on, as they didn’t look <em>quite </em>as crisp as some of the other Switch 2 Edition titles I played at the event. Some assets didn’t look as sharp as they could have and shadows had quite obvious jagged edges. Of course, that can naturally come from uprezing a game that, in the case of BotW, is over eight years old at this point.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Make no mistake, the games <em>did </em>look much better than on the OG Switch, and the bump in performance was very welcome given both BotW and TotK struggled fairly significantly to maintain even a solid 30fps on the older hardware. Being able to run through Kakariko Village at a solid 60fps after all these years was certainly a cathartic experience. The new versions of Zelda BotW and TotK also support Zelda Notes, a service available through the Nintendo Switch App that provides additional maps, hints, the ability to share items between the two games, and more. As a generally app-adverse person, I don’t know if this will be something I bother with all that much, but I could see it being useful for some.</p>
<p>Overall, the Switch 2 versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are nice to have, and will undoubtedly become my preferred way to play the games, but neither felt quite as transformative as I was hoping.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions4.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</strong></h2>
<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition updates one of the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criminally-underappreciated games on the Switch</a>, and it actually delivers one of the most notable upgrades of the early bunch of Switch 2 Editions. To my eye, the visuals looked sharper than either Zelda game, perhaps indicating Kirby is closer to a native 4K than they are. While the original Forgotten Land was a mostly-solid 30fps, the 60fps boost is noticeable and welcome.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In another departure from the Zelda updates, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is also getting new content in the form of the Star-Crossed World expansion. This largely seems to be a remix of the original Forgotten World, with blue crystal stars raining down and changing up stages. Rather than Waddle Dees, Kirby is now rescuing strange new creatures called “Starries,” while also grabbing new star-like collectibles. Smashing larger crystals will make new crystalline platforms and structures appear, altering stage layouts and making enemies more challenging. There are also some completely new features, including added Mouthful Mode transformations (I got to try out the bouncy new Spring ability). While Star-Crossed World isn't a completely original creation, it felt just as fun as the original Forgotten Land and it seems like it may be quite a substantial add-on, remixing many, if not all, of the original game's stages.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions6.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</strong></h2>
<p>The demos for Super Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition were less about the visual and technical upgrades, and more about gameplay additions that show off the Switch 2’s new control options and accessories. I had the chance to try out a number of new minigames built around mouse controls that had me doing things like guiding toads through an electrified maze and spray painting bob-ombs. Most of these games were pretty fun. The new Jamboree TV expansion mostly focuses on using the new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera to insert yourself into games, which felt more gimmicky and less appealing to me.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions7.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Games</strong></h2>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games demoed at the recent hands-on event weren’t just one thing, running the gamut from technically impressive but perhaps not essential (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom) to a quirky controller and accessory showcase (Super Mario Party Jamboree) to what seems to be a fairly significant content expansion (Kirby and the Forgotten Land).</p>
<p>We also have to take into account cost when we talk about these Switch 2 upgrades, which Nintendo is being slightly opaque about. They have revealed the Zelda updates will cost $10 apiece if you own the original Switch games, although you can get both for “free” if you’re a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriber. If you don’t own the original games, you can buy Switch 2 Editions that will cost as much as the original game plus the upgrade pack (so, $70 for BotW and $80 for TotK). Pricing for the Kirby and Mario Party upgrades that actually add new content hasn’t been revealed, but <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kirby-and-The-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-U-S-Version/15949615341?classType=REGULAR&amp;nrtv_cid=pvlmg302wxpjg&amp;clickid=32BXElxE9xycUPHyS11FHUJPUksy%3AMzkewu5Vk0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_32BXElxE9xycUPHyS11FHUJPUksy%3AMzkewu5Vk0&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_376373&amp;affiliates_ad_id=565706&amp;campaign_id=9383&amp;sharedid=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store listings hint they’ll cost more</a> – up to $20 for the upgrade and $80 if you’re getting the original game + upgrade bundle.</p>
<p>Of course, I need to play more, but these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions seem like a solid deal if you already own the original Switch titles, but may be a bit rich for the blood of folks that also need to buy the base game. All the Switch 2 Edition titles I played seemed worthwhile to some degree, and some, particularly Kirby and the Forgotten Land, were quite intriguing, but you’ll have to pick and choose which ones are worth it for you (or get that NSO+ subscription, assuming all the updates will be available through the service). Your mileage with these makeovers may vary.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom launch alongside the system on June 5. Meanwhile, Super Mario Party Jamboree arrives on July 24 and Kirby and the Forgotten Land is coming August 28. Look for more Wccftech coverage of these upgrades closer to launch.</p>

Yes, there are plenty of games that people are excited about their inevitable release, like Grand Theft Auto 6.

At the same time, many will often play it, slaughtering their prey up until they see the credits or get fed up with it before eventually throwing in the towel.

<p>While this announcement is squarely focused on SaGa, the newly forged partnership with Square Enix (and the fact that its deal with Konami led to content from multiple franchises) hopefully leads to more collaborations with the iconic publisher, as its other franchises like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Kingdom Hearts would also make great additions to the Vampire Survivors roster. The Emerald Dioarama expansion is available now for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS (excluding the Apple Arcade version), and Android.
