            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/druckmann-set-the-story-straight-about-%E2%80%98misleading%E2%80%99-sony-quote.881766/</guid>

<p>Neil Druckmann was recently targeted in the media for a quote recorded in an interview with Sony. Per the statement, he made a bold claim that his next project would ‘redefine the mainstream perceptions of gaming.’ This caused dissent on social platforms, with many believing that Druckmann was getting too big for his britches and trying to make himself look like some God of Gaming, capable of altering the paradigm with a single release.</p>



<p>However, the man himself recently appeared on Twitter (X) with a copy of the interview’s transcript, setting the story straight and confirming that he was effectively misquoted because of ‘edits of his rambling answers.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-truth-will-out">The Truth Will Out</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In his post on Twitter</a>, Neil Druckmann revealed that he was indeed misquoted by Sony, but it was mostly because his answer to a particular question was lengthy and spun off into a few tangents here and there. He did speak boldly about his next game, stressing that he ‘can’t talk about it our (his) bosses will get very mad,’ and he did say that he’s excited to see how the world will react to the ‘incredible moving experience’ Naughty Dog is creating, but he didn’t use the words ‘redefine the mainstream perceptions of gaming’. </p>



<p>The transcript that Druckmann revealed on Twitter was juicy, though. He said that the developing title is something ‘fresh’ for Naughty Dog and that it’s the ‘most excited’ he’s been for a project <strong>ever</strong>. That’s hugely important, as the passion that was poured into both The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II was unparalleled, producing a multi-award-winning series that went on to become one of the most widely beloved live-action adaptations ever made. </p>



<p>The closest Druckmann came to Sony’s quote was:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it just kind of opens the eyes of a bunch of people that just weren’t aware of the kind of experience that exist in games … People even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It isn’t known what Naughty Dog is cooking at the moment, but recently, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-officially-cancelled/">cancelled a planned multiplayer project</a> that would have been set at the heart of The Last of Us’ universe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked-finally-launches-with-fallout/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fortnite has finally launched Chapter 5: Season 3, "Wrecked," and with it come the new unique points of interest and skins for all you madmen out there.</p>
<p>Well, instead of going through the long patch notes released by Epic Games, we'll give you guys a rundown of what to anticipate with the new season. As always, the new Wrecked season brings exciting in-game content for gamers, this time focusing more on a post-apocalyptic theme, fitting the likes of Fallout (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-enters-fortnite-in-chapter-5-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as previously teased</a>), with the Brotherhood of Steel's T-60 Power Armor being the most iconic Battle Pass skin.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the Mad Max-esque map changes first, though. The developers said that a "sandstorm" struck Fortnite Island, creating a new biome on the south side called the "Wasteland." With that, the game sees the inclusion of three new POIs: the Redline Rig refinery, Nitrodrome arena, and Brutal Beachhead operation base, all complementing the Wasteland theme. Below is the new map with the added Wasteland biome, making the island bigger than ever.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Moving on, Fortnite has added new consumables and collectives under the "Nitro" collections, where gamers have access to "Nitro Splash" and "Nitro Barriers," both of which give a severe boost in moving speeds when applied to moving items such as players and cars. When applied to a player, Nitro allows much faster movement, explosive bashing power, higher stamina, quick reloading speeds, and fall damage immunity, giving you the feeling of a madman.&nbsp;Nitro for cars allows fast movement, lesser fuel consumption, and explosive ramming power.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>What's a season without new weaponry? Well, Fortnite has catered to this perfectly by adding interesting weapons, with the first of them being Nitro Fists, which allows you to perform a 3x punch combo and give a "meteoric" impact when you aerial punch the ground. Nitro Fists will have a total of four chargers, with each recharging after eight seconds. Along with that, another weapon is the Boom Bolt, or in simple words, a madman's crossbow. It's a fast-firing crossbow that shoots explosive bolts, and by the looks of it, it does seem like a pump shotgun with a bow attached, or maybe I am missing the old days.</p>
<figure>

<p>Nuke Cola and Kind Cacti are interesting additions to the health department, with Nuke Cola responsible for restoring little health and shields immediately. At the same time, Slurp Cacti heals you when you hit it with your pickaxe after multiple times, even while in a car as well.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>Finally, we also have new vehicles and vehicle mods, all revolving around the Wasteland concept. We'll drop the list for vehicle mods below, but the addition of War Bus is something interesting to discuss. They are driven by patrollers on the island, and two of them are present on the battlefield. Each of them features a cannon on top, along with a horn that comes with an EMP pulse, damaging nearby targets and reducing their health and shields.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Machine Gun Turret</strong>&nbsp;(roof slot): Have a passenger fire a machine gun while someone else drives!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Grenade Launcher Turret</strong>&nbsp;(roof slot): Some would call this littering, but the Grenades will get rid of themselves by exploding.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Spiked Bumper</strong>&nbsp;(front bumper slot): Deal more damage to players and objects on impact.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cow Catcher</strong>&nbsp;(front bumper slot): Boost your ramming power and give your car some defensive armor.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Bulletproof Tires</strong>&nbsp;(tires slot): Tired of tire poppers? Make your tires indestructible!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Chonkers Off-Road Tires</strong>&nbsp;(tires slot): Make your car more off-road friendly. Especially useful if you’re not driving an SUV!</em></li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>Here are the new Battlepass Skins, which will unlock once you level up the pass:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Machinist</strong>&nbsp;(unlocked right away!): Control your fire.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Rust</strong>: Shred the wasteland.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Peabody</strong>: Phil, Earl, and Axle. Three peas in a podcoat.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Ringmaster Scarr</strong>: Rule the chaos. Run the destruction.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>T-60 Power Armor</strong>: Courtesy of the Brotherhood of Steel.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Brite Raider</strong>: Drive fast. Burn bright.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Megalo Don</strong>: Nitro-fueled apex predator.</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reference-design/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-next-will-be-a-%E2%80%9Creference-design%E2%80%9D-for-manufacturers-to-make-their-own-devices-%E2%80%93-rumor.881757/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reference-design/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Next is going to be a very different gaming device compared to its predecessors, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>According to Windows Central's <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1794219028598153613">Jez Corden</a>, Microsoft's next-generation console will likely be a reference device with a heavy Windows slant for manufacturers to make their own devices, like the Surface Pro 11 is a reference device for AI PCs. This would be a huge departure from the previous Xbox consoles, as it would essentially make it a PC that could potentially run Steam games as well, and thus even the former PlayStation exclusives available on Valve's digital store like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-comparison/">Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-this-month/">God of War</a>.</p>
<p>Jez Corden using the Surface Pro 11 as an example is very interesting, as it was rumored earlier this year that the Xbox Next development is being led by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-xbox-surface-team/">Surface team</a>. The next Microsoft console is also said to be released in multiple SKUs, including a handheld one that will be capable of running games natively while also supporting cloud gaming.</p>
<p>As of now, very little is known about the Xbox Next other than that it is in the works and that it will deliver the "<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical leap"</a> ever seen. How this will be achieved remains to be seen, but it is likely that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-ram-storage/">software and storage advancements will play a big part in it</a>, as simply doubling specs, such as RAM, would not be economically viable.</p>

<p>It was recently reported that Bungie has won a lawsuit against Phoenix Digital (Aimjunkies) after alleging that the cheat provider infringed on a copyright. This is far from being the first time that a case like this has unfolded, but per Stephen Totilo, it could be a worldwide first that a jury has had to step in to settle the claim.</p>



<p>With Phoenix Digital filing a counterclaim and stressing that Bungie failed to prove a copyright infringement, it was left to a jury to pass the ultimate verdict – and they ruled in favour of Bungie.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-history">Making History</h2>



<p>Destiny is just like any other multiplayer-based game when it comes to cheaters – there’s a constant slew of malicious operators making their way into the game’s ecosystem and disrupting the ‘legitimate players’. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1792660056435200497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo’s earlier report</a> filed on May 20, it was revealed that – potentially for the first time – a jury would decide the outcome of a copyright claim by a publisher against a cheat provider. That came about because of Phoenix Digital’s standpoint that Bungie was the malicious party in this debate.</p>



<p>In just a few days, that case has been wrapped up, with the jury siding with Bungie. Even though the compensation wasn’t substantial – sitting at just $63,000 – it’s an industry-first result that will go down in the history books. Phoenix Digital has already stressed that it will be appealing the jury’s decision based on a claim that Bungie ‘illegally accessed their computer systems.’</p>



<p>Totilo <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794154042190700617" rel="nofollow">forwarded a statement</a> that was handed to him by Bungie’s lawyer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful for the diligence, professionalism, and care exercised by the Judge, his staff, and the Jury. We’re committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way to trial.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In recent months, the number of developers and publishers filing claims against cheat providers has risen sharply. Activision Blizzard has been a key player in this realm, taking on all comers and – in most cases – receiving a default verdict that often results in multi-million-dollar reparation orders being documented.</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, the number of people cheating in video games seems to be rising.</p>

<p>Deadlock is widely rumoured to be Valve’s next title, a third-person, hero-based shooter rooted in a multiplayer-focused, lore-rich universe. In recent weeks, we’ve seen more than 100 leaks hit social media and content-sharing platforms worldwide, with the quality of said leaks improving over time. From full-fledged gameplay edits to walkthroughs of the character library, a stunning amount of content has been pulled from Deadlock – but Valve has yet to formally acknowledge that the game exists.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-might-as-well-be-here">It Might As Well Be Here</h2>



<p>Some of the gameplay edits that have surfaced on platforms like Twitter (X) have featured scenes that look remarkably well-polished. The earliest leaks from Deadlock looked drab and disappointing, but it’s believed that – despite dropping mere days ago – they were from a much earlier build of the game. Here’s an example of the most recent Deadlock leaks that have been turning heads on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once known as Neon Prime, Deadlock has evolved, turning from more of a sci-fi title to something that’s a diverse mix of various aesthetics. In the game, there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-all-characters-in-valves-deadlock/">a range of characters</a> that float between an array of themes, from robots to Victorian police officers and from traditional monsters to ethereal warriors. With obvious inspirations from Team Fortress 2 leaking through to the surface, Deadlock could be a solid contender to the likes of Overwatch 2. </p>



<p>However, despite all this information and content appearing online, Valve has yet to recognise that the game <strong>exists</strong>. It isn’t known when it’ll be released, but the expectation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/">is that it’ll drop in 2025</a>. These playtests that are causing most of the leaks to surface are seeing plenty of positive feedback about a game that’s cleaning up very nicely.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Deadlock?</p>

<p>On June 2, ASUS will release the ROG Ally X, the next iteration of the substantial handheld device that turned heads almost a year ago. It emerged as a solid competitor to Valve’s Steam Deck but boasted Windows 11 as an OS, which meant it could theoretically play ‘more games’. However, the high-priced handheld failed to hit the mark with a wide audience because of a few key drawbacks – but the ROG Ally X features some new internals designed to tackle those issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-same-but-different-but-still-the-same">Same – But Different – But Still The Same</h2>



<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/the-rog-ally-x-leaks-with-twice-the-battery-of-the-original-and-way-more-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to recent leaks</a>, the ROG Ally X will feature a battery twice as powerful as the one found in the ASUS ROG Ally, launched almost a year ago. That was one of the biggest flaws of the handheld, and playing a top-tier game on ‘Turbo’ mode would leave players with a device that died within around 40 minutes. The 40Wh battery in the original model has been replaced with an 80Wh battery in the ASUS ROG Ally X. </p>



<p>Further, ASUS has cast away the original 16GB of RAM and jammed in 24GB of LPDDR5 RAM, which should boost the device’s gaming performance dramatically. It was suggested that the original AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip would remain unchanged, and the touchscreen – which was also a sticking point for players – would be the same as the one in the original unit. Some minor changes have reportedly been made to the outer shell, such as a smoothing of rougher edges and tactile introductions being made to the buttons. </p>



<p>It’s expected that the ASUS ROG Ally X will retail for around $800. If ASUS has truly addressed the shortfalls present on the ASUS ROG Ally, this could be a killer handheld that dominates the ever-growing market.</p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While <em>XDefiant</em> has had a few errors and glitches after finally launching, most fans agree that it’s a pretty solid shooter, even if the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-weapon-progression-is-criminally-slow-and-fans-want-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progression system is absolutely pants</a>. However, some issues persist, and players have found that one of the strangest bends bullet arcs if you jump too much. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Jump spamming is a pretty big problem in <em>XDefiant</em> at the moment. A player’s hitbox seems to become smaller or just harder to hit with gunfire when they’re moving, so you can be almost invincible if you sprint for the perfect amount of time. Jumping works a treat, too, but now that appears to have its own problem, and it is bizarre. Not only does it increase your crosshair size, it makes shotgun bullets fly sideways out of the barrel.</p>
 <h2 id="h-if-you-jump-too-much-in-xdefiant-your-shotgun-will-fire-left-and-right-not-forward" data-injectable="false">If you jump too much in <em>XDefiant</em>, your shotgun will fire left and right, not forward</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">Fans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1d08sla/is_shotgun_spread_working_as_intended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>XDefiant</em> subreddit</a> have been discussing this issue at length because they can’t work out if it’s intentional behavior or not. User bopchara demonstrates what happens to a shotgun’s bullet spray after you’ve jumped so much that the weapon’s crosshair is as big as it possibly can be. While I’d expect to see some shots veer off to the side a little, shooting directly left and right feels like a joke. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">Bullets shooting to the side of the barrel is obviously not how any weapon is designed to work in a first person shooter, and I’d be surprised if that wasn’t a glitch here. However, as user Billy3King points out, “It could also be to stop people from jump spamming, just a thought.” Herein lies the trouble. We don’t know if crosshairs are meant to behave this way, widening with every jump to deter jump spamming or if it’s a glitch that’s yet to be fixed. </p>
 <h2 id="h-is-this-an-issue-or-a-design-choice" data-injectable="false">Is this an issue or a design choice?</h2> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">I jumped into the game to test this for myself and got the same results that others are reporting. If I jump to maximize the crosshairs with any weapon other than a shotgun, I can still land pretty accurate shots in front of me. With a shotgun, I can barely see any bullet holes where my shots have landed because they fly around me instead of toward the intended target. </p> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="1010" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft will almost certainly address this in a future <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-may-24-update-patch-notes-practice-zone-enemy-health-bar-glitch-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>XDefiant update</em></a>, but user SuttonTM points out that making shotguns suffer more than any other weapons might be intentional. “It’s almost certainly not intended to be that wide, but shotgun’s they have to be very careful with when it comes to adjusting because if they become OP they will easily become the most annoying gun to play against and ruin fun in modes like Hard Point etc, just look at the Akimbo Shotguns <em>CoD</em> recently had like a month back, required no skill to one shot people just by looking at them essentially, and ruined the flow of the game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to argue that shotguns can ruin a shooter if they’re overpowered. I remember playing <em>Destiny 1</em> and using the good old slide and shotgun or shotgun and melee tactics while they worked in Crucible. For now, all I can suggest is that you don’t jump spam in <em>XDefiant</em> so you can avoid an embarrassing encounter when an enemy is up in your face and your shotgun showers them in a glorious halo of pellets before they end you with a single pistol shot to the skull. </p>

<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> has inspired players from launch day with its incredible visuals and gameplay that makes you want to drop into just one more mission all through the night. Fans have created all sorts of artwork that bring its gritty battles to life, but oil and canvas might be the perfect medium for depicting what is now <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-has-entered-a-second-galactic-war-after-players-failed-to-kill-enough-automatons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Second Galactic War</a>. </p> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">Since <em>Helldivers 2</em> was initially launched in February 2024, I’ve seen players make some incredible fan art. From the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/incredible-helldivers-2-fan-film-nails-the-feel-of-every-mission-in-just-over-60-seconds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gritty film that portrays the tension of being inside a Hellpod</a> before deployment onto the battlefield to Terminid miniatures that would look at home in <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cz4e16/check_out_my_recent_helldivers_2_oil_paintings_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit user WriterSafe9019</a> has set a new standard for incredible <em>Helldivers 2</em> art with their oil on canvas series that brings to life the elation and fear of spreading managed democracy around the galaxy. </p>
 <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-oil-on-canvas-paintings-breathe-new-life-into-the-game-s-hellish-war-torn-landscapes" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> oil on canvas paintings breathe new life into the game’s hellish, war-torn landscapes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via WriterSafe9019 on Reddit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">The four oil on canvas paitings by Reddit user WriterSafe9019 were posted on the <em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit, where they’ve recieved understandable praise. While there’s the usual collection of democratic Officer-approved responses and references to these being painted with oil produced from dead Terminids and Automatons, there’s also genuine appreciation for the work. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">User ALargeTuna commented that, “These are great! love the feel of 1 and 3 the most. great scenes and mood.” I agree with the first image being one that stands out, but I prefer the last one over the third because it’s reminiscent of the Anchorage Memorial ion <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-fallout-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 3</a></em>, as well as real statues dotted around the world that memorialize wartime events. </p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">In fact, I’d go so far as saying they make <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s chaotic battlefront look beautiful. From these images alone, you wouldn’t know that Helldivers blast down from ships in orbit and step out into swarms of giant bugs and metal monstrosities that want to tear them limb from limb. </p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">They all make Helldivers look heroic, which is absolutely how the game makes you feel while playing. They also dodge the mayhem that ensues when several Dropships start bombarding your squad or the crushing sadness of watching a Pelican fly away with your team just as you were diving toward the open door to join them.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">I think the whole series is the perfect translation of real wartime paintings we have in museums like the <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/10-paintings-of-wartime-london" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK’s Imperial War Museum</a> today. Artists of the time captured moments they saw both in the heat of the moment during terrifying air raids and long after certain events because of the images etched in their minds. </p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="false">While <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s warfare is obviously restricted to our screens, some battles have been pretty damn harrowing. You only need to mention Malevelon Creek to get some players to shudder with fear, but even in those horrible moments there is beauty to be found and isolated within canvases like these. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa.881640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="381" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the long-awaited release of <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em>, the overall <em>Mad Max</em> franchise has once again been thrust into the mainstream spotlight. The series started its engine way back in 1979 with director George Miller’s <em>Mad Max.</em> Since then, it has become a multimedia juggernaut recognized the world over and beloved for its unique look and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/">many weird and wild characters</a>.</p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">At the same time, just because it has a colorful cast and a sprawling world doesn’t mean the <em>Mad Max</em> franchise is perfect. The lore and overall timeline is a bit confusing, and there’s a lot of ground to cover with ancillary media like novels, video games, and comics. Therefore, it can appear daunting for those new to Miller’s post-apocalyptic creation. </p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true">If you’re one of those newcomers who was beckoned by the chaotic, action-packed <em>Furiosa</em> but doesn’t want to watch <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mad-max-movies-order/">every single <em>Mad Max</em> movie in order</a> to prepare, here’s what you should watch at the very least before checking out Miller’s latest creation.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mad-max-fury-road-makes-for-a-good-starting-point" data-injectable="false">Mad Max: Fury Road makes for a good starting point</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image vis Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true">Released in 2015, <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> is a hard-hitting, visually-stunning watch. It centers on Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), who gets swept up in a feud between the vile ruler of the Citadel, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). This marks her first appearance in the <em>Mad Max</em> series, and between the action, drama, and worldbuilding the film brings, it’s quite an impressive one. After all, it got <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kojima-has-seen-mad-max-four-times-because-he-is-right-and-good/">Hideo Kojima to go see it four times.</a></p>
 <p data-characters="608" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true">In terms of the <em>Mad Max</em> timeline, <em>Fury Road</em> takes place years after <em>Furiosa</em>, so there’s an argument to be made that it should be saved for after a <em>Furiosa</em> screening. However, giving it a watch first can make <em>Furiosa</em> a more interesting viewing. Knowing the title character and who she ultimately becomes ahead of time adds a layer of intrigue to her origin story. It can be rewarding to know her final form and watch what she goes through to reach it. Think witnessing Anakin Skywalker’s journey to become Darth Vader in the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels decades after the completion of the original trilogy.</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Not to mention, if you’re a bit unsure if what you’re getting into stylistically with <em>Furiosa</em> is for you, <em>Fury Road</em> is similar in aesthetic and tone. It can act as a good primer in that regard as well. If you like what <em>Fury Road</em> has to offer and want more, then you can go scratch that itch with <em>Furiosa</em> afterward.</p> <h2 id="h-the-original-mad-max-trilogy-is-optional" data-injectable="false">The original Mad Max trilogy is optional</h2> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">There’s no denying the pop culture influence and overall science fiction awesomeness of the original Mad Max trilogy. <em>Mad Max</em>, <em>Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior</em>, and <em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em> are all worth a watch decades after their premieres, and Mel Gibson’s rendition of Max Rockatansky remains iconic. With that said, these movies aren’t all that essential to one’s viewing of <em>Furiosa</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">The main reason why you can watch <em>Furiosa</em> without having seen the <em>Mad Max</em> trilogy is time. <em>Furiosa</em> and <em>Fury Road </em> are set in the mid-21st century, with the original trilogy spanning the mid-1980s to somewhere between the late 1990s to the early 2000s. These sets of films are so far apart chronologically and their casts are so radically different that, in terms of the core narrative, passing on the trilogy won’t impact your understanding of <em>Furiosa</em> much at all.</p>
  <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">Then again, what if you simply want to learn as much about the lore of this universe as possible? Well, you might still be better off skipping the trilogy, or looking at it as its own entity. Whether the first three <em>Mad Max</em> movies truly are in the same continuity as <em>Furiosa</em> and<em> Fury Road</em> remains a hot topic. Miller hasn’t shared a concrete verdict, and fans continue to debate if Gibson and Hardy are the same Max, if they’re related, or if the name is more of a mantle passed from person to person. </p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">All of that is to say that ahead of <em>Furiosa</em>, you <em>could</em> watch all of the existing <em>Mad Max </em>movies to prepare if you so desire. If you’re seeking narrative cohesion and nothing more, though, your best bet is to stick with <em>Fury Road</em> alone. It ties in the closest to <em>Furiosa</em>, forming a highly entertaining duology with it.</p> <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga </em>is now playing exclusively in theaters.</p>

The landmark decision may be the first time a jury has agreed that a cheat creator violated a gaming company’s copyrights.</p><p>Yesterday’s jury decision awarded Bungie (<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24689095-bungie-v-phoenix-digital-group-jury-decision?responsive=1&amp;title=1">PDF</a>) a tidy sum of $63,210. Bungie counsel James Barker said in a statement emailed to <em>The Verge</em> that the company is “committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way&nbsp;to trial.” </p><p>In 2021, Bungie sued AimJunkies and four defendants (here’s a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.300479/gov.uscourts.wawd.300479.1.0.pdf">PDF</a> of the complaint), alleging, among other things, that they hacked <em>Destiny 2</em> to copy the code used to make cheats. Some of Bungie’s complaints — like that AimJunkies violated a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">DMCA provision</a> forbidding circumvention of copyright protection tech — went to arbitration and saw <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/bungie-wins-4-3-million-award-against-cheat-seller-in-arbitration-230220/">Bungie winning $4 million</a>. AimJunkies appealed after the judge confirmed that award. That appeal is still in process, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161935/bungie-destiny-2-cheating-jury-trial-aimjunkies"><em>Polygon </em>wrote this week</a>. </p><p>Phoenix Digital founder David Schaefer will move to dismiss the jury’s verdict and appeal it if necessary, <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794156492784087319">according to Totilo</a>. However that shakes out, the verdict is significant, given that cheating lawsuits tend to conclude in other ways, like settlements. (For example, a judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/take-two-grand-theft-auto/us-judge-blocks-programs-letting-grand-theft-auto-players-cheat-idUSL1N1V71ZK/">shut down a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> cheat distributor</a> in 2018 following a Take-Two Interactive lawsuit, or when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172558/destiny-2-bungie-cheat-settlement">Bungie settled</a> another cheating lawsuit in 2022 for $13.5 million.)</p><p>The win may only mean pocket change for Bungie, and it won’t likely put an end to online cheating, but it does put a jury on record about the legality of creating such cheats. That makes this more significant than the pocket-change-for-Bungie $63,000 award lets on. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bungie has won its court battle against cheat and mod site, AimJunkies.</p>
<p>As reported by journalist Stephen Totilo, AimJunkies, aka Phoenix Digital, was instructed to pay the Destiny 2 developer $63,210 in damages – that's the revenue the company is thought to have earned selling the cheats – setting a new precedent in what's thought to be the first lawsuit wherein a jury has ruled on a game-cheating case.</p>

<p>The jury threw out AimJunkie's countersuit that Bungie had illegally accessed one of its computers, but founder David Schaefer says they will "fight this" and appeal the verdict.</p>
<p>"We are grateful for the diligence, professionalism, and care exercised by the Judge, his staff, and the Jury," Bungie's lawyer, James Barker, told Totilo.</p>
<p>"We're committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way to trial."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>$63,210 in damages, to be specific</p><p>To my knowledge, this is the 1st time a jury (in the U.S., possibly the world) has ruled on a game cheating case.</p><p>With this, we now have a jury verdict that supports game companies' frequent claims that cheats like these infringe on copyright <a href="https://t.co/qvDhFwq0zK">pic.twitter.com/qvDhFwq0zK</a></p></div>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1794155396065800511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>This isn't the first time Bungie has favourably settled a lawsuit. Back in July 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-player-following-racist-harassment-and-threats-to-employee">the studio won a lawsuit against a player who repeatedly harassed, threatened, and doxxed one of its employees</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">Yuzu, agreed to pay $2.4m in damages to Nintendo</a> and cease all operations in response to the Mario maker's recent lawsuit.</p>

<p data-characters="349" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Magic: The Gathering </em>is packed with a wide variety of creatures whose identities revolve around their abilities and how they fit into a deck’s strategy. No matter what set you started playing MTG during, you’ve certainly seen cards that contain words such as <strong>Flying</strong> or <strong>Haste</strong> which provide abilities to the card they’re printed on. </p> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Some of these cards have “reminder text” printed along with them that gives a brief explanation as to what the words mean. Unfortunately, not every card has enough room to include rules for each Keyword Ability– especially those that contain multiple abilities on a single card.</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">There are currently 18 evergreen Keyword Abilities in MTG. These are abilities that are commonly printed in new releases and have spent years of playtesting to earn their lifetime spot in the TCG. Overall, there are 170+ Keyword Abilities in MTG. Most of them are exclusive to particular sets due to their theme (Ninjutsu or Bushido) or have been banned from the game entirely (Ante). </p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">While Wizards of the Coast tend to introduce new Keyword Abilities into <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/magic-the-gathering-ever-set-released/">every <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> release</a>, knowing the evergreen Keyword Abilities and the rules associated with them will get you through 90% of MTG without issue.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/new-ghost-in-the-shell-anime-is-targeting-2026-release/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-ghost-in-the-shell-anime-is-targeting-2026-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Studio SARU and Production I.G have just unveiled a teaser for an upcoming <em>Ghost In The Shell</em> anime, titled only <em>The Ghost In The Shell.</em></p> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">The original <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is based on the manga of the same name, and this new project seems to be a new adaptation of that. New media in the <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> franchise isn’t necessarily a rare thing, though, with the franchise spanning multiple animated adaptations, video games, and even an infamous Hollywood movie that starred Scarlett Johansson. </p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="TVアニメ『攻殻機動隊（仮）』特報｜2026年放送｜THE GHOST IN THE SHELL" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ix7QURhM7jE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">The project is being helmed by Studio SARU, which recently made <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em> for Netflix, a reimagining of the classic comic that earned critic and fan acclaim for its bold and refreshing take on the beloved story and characters. </p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">Will we be seeing a similar approach with the new <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> adaptation? Fans are already speculating we could be looking into something similar to <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.</em></p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i cant believe they're making ghost in the shell brotherhood. not something i neccesarily want but i guess i shall be seated. i'm curious at the very least</p>— yuuko from nichijou (@headfallsoff) <a href="https://twitter.com/headfallsoff/status/1794393622948794423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">Will Studio SARU pull off something incredible, or will it go the safe route? The teaser doesn’t reveal much, so we might be looking at a couple of years of intense speculation.</p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Despite various other adaptations taking a stab at the story, the original <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> film is still considered the best outing in the franchise and is one of the most beloved works of sci-fi in history. Even if you haven’t seen the original movie, you’ve seen one of the hundreds of properties inspired by it. Though it came out in 1995, it hasn’t aged a day, and its story is still a poignant and relevant tale backed by some of<em> </em>the best — if not the best — animated sequences in the history of Japanese animation.</p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false">The new <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> anime will hopefully land in 2026, but you can currently watch the original <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> on Prime Video.</p>

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re all in love with the wasteland of Fallout thanks to the new Amazon Prime TV show and the graphical update to Fallout 4, but budding Wasteland Wanderers can find plenty of ghoulish joy in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-5-games-that-should-get-a-ttrpg/">these five TTRPGs</a> that explore post-apocalyptic worlds.</p> <h2 id="h-gamma-world" data-injectable="false">Gamma World</h2> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">An absolutely wild game of acid-green nuclear nonsense, Gamma World has been around since the 70’s. Its most recent incarnation, a boxed set from Wizards of the Coast based on the 4th edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is sadly no longer available in print, though you can still get it in pdf. It was filled with the same joyful chaos as Fallout, with mutated animals, treacherous wastes and an enjoyably cartoonish sense of humor. The 4th edition rules, while controversial at the time, find an excellent implementation in this tactical RPG.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"> <figure><figcaption>A typical day in Gamma World. Image from Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </figure> <h2 id="h-apocalypse-world" data-injectable="false">Apocalypse World</h2> <p data-characters="534" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">The big daddy of all Powered by the Apocalypse games since, Apocalypse World leapt onto the scene ready to blow people’s minds in 2010. The striking black and white images, the fast rules that constantly pushed the story forward, and the leading questions that empowered players to share the responsibility for building the world have been hugely influential. Apocalypse World has had an undeniable impact and inspired many other games, including the more community-focused apocalypse narratives of Legacy: Life Among the Ruins.</p>
 <h2 id="h-fallout-the-rpg" data-injectable="false">Fallout: The RPG</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Fallout RPG - How To Play" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WnklTH6aQbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="811" data-injectable="true">Of course we had to mention Modiphius’s Fallout TTRPG. Based on their own 2d20 system and now supported by a vast array of gorgeously-produced books, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-fallout-game-ranked-best-to-worst/">Fallout RPG is stuffed with references to the classic and modern video games</a>. Solve problems with your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, target hit locations in a callback to the VATs system, and delve into a deep scavenging system. You can also get Virtual Tabletop (VTT) versions of most products produced by Modiphius, and the art evokes the setting perfectly.</p>
 <h2 id="h-rifts" data-injectable="false">Rifts</h2> <p data-characters="980" data-current-count="980" data-injectable="true">Gamma World and Fallout are weird, but Rifts? Rifts is really, really weird. While it takes itself a little more seriously than many post-apocalyptic settings, it is also a perfect example of pure unadulterated 90’s TTRPG strangeness. The original TTRPG, published by Palladium, had more than fifty supplements for different parts of the worlds, dimensions and big events in the setting. It was also a completely unique post-apocalyptic setting in which the apocalypse was rifts to other dimensions filled with sci-fi monsters that bordered on the eldritch. Earth was divided into massively detailed factions and many places had returned to idealised sci-fi tinged versions of mythological eras, such as the griffin-riding cyberknights of England, and the dinosaur swamp that took over parts of the east coast of the United States. Pinnacle Entertainment created Savage Worlds Rifts using the well-loved Savage Worlds system, and so the absolute weirdness of Rifts lives on.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mutant-year-zero" data-injectable="false">Mutant: Year Zero</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Mutant Year Zero Tabletop RPG Release Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jk7UBlwUPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="617" data-current-count="917" data-injectable="false">Based on a TTRPG from the 1980s, Mutant: Year Zero from Free League literally empowers the player characters with bizarre mutations and places emphasis on exploration as well as building a home base. Mutant: Year Zero combines the dark humor of Fallout with the grim horrors of the STALKER series of games, creating a world where the player characters are constantly escaping by the skin of their teeth but still get to throw fireballs. Overstretch your resources and you’ll have to risk more to restock, and the question becomes: what’s worth fighting for in a world where everyone is out for themselves?</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24164149/atlas-jennifer-lopez-director-brad-peyton-mech-design</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/respect-to-the-director-of-netflix%E2%80%99s-atlas-for-thinking-deeply-about-mechs.881562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24164149/atlas-jennifer-lopez-director-brad-peyton-mech-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="h5sLC0">A lifetime of scarfing down sci-fi, video games, and comic books brought director Brad Peyton to the job of said lifetime: directing Jennifer Lopez in a frickin’ mech-suit movie. Signing on for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099465/netflix-atlas-jennifer-lopez-scifi-movie"><em>Atlas</em></a>, now streaming on Netflix, was an easy yes: With two big-budget Dwayne Johnson vehicles under his belt, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/11/17226498/rampage-movie-review-the-rock-dwayne-johnson"><em>Rampage</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/2/18/11052008/san-andreas-sequel-dwayne-johnson"><em>San Andreas</em></a>, Peyton was no stranger to A-list-driven spectacle. Still, the film was an intimidating prospect for someone with a deep appreciation for mech suits, mech tanks, oversized mecha, and all the made-up classifications in between. </p>
<p id="x0xVvh">“I was <em>very</em> aware of what had come out ahead of me,” Peyton tells Polygon. The director cites James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em> and <em>Avatar</em> as obvious but undeniable milestones in the art of on-screen mechs. He knew that the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/24/13377822/titanfall-2-review-xbox-one-PC-ps4-playstation-4">Titanfall games</a> put pressure on any new live-action attempt, having created full immersion into the experience of mech fighting. But when he started imagining how to rethink mechs, he returned to the first piece of mecha media that really blew him away: Stuart Gordon’s <em>Robot Jox</em>. </p>
<p id="HUqXkg">Peyton can’t quite explain why <em>Robot Jox</em> was his holy grail, but in talking to him, it’s obvious: Like Gordon’s whiz-bang vision of the future, where Earth’s conflicts are settled by colorful mech duels, <em>Atlas</em> needed clear, well-defined logic that would ground the world-building, but also let him rip in the action department in a way that would delight his inner child. And at the end of the day, he needed to be original.</p>
<div id="sxLCIQ"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4QghULoUfE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="M5yS4I">“My biggest thing was: I knew I had to separate from everything,” Peyton says. “I had no interest in repeating. I said, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/10/7/16441340/pacific-rim-uprising-daredevil-punisher-netflix">Pac Rim</a><em>’s [mechs] are </em>this<em> big. In </em>Avatar<em>, they’re </em>this<em> big. In </em>Titanfall,<em> they’re </em>this<em> big. So mine is gonna be </em>this<em> big. This one might be square and blocky, so mine is gonna be circular.</em> I come from animation. So a lot of it started with me sketching the silhouette and figuring how to make it unique and different.” </p>
<p id="1jzDQC"><em>Atlas</em> takes place in a relatively sunny future that still exists in the shadow of an impending apocalypse. Decades earlier, a rogue artificial intelligence named Harlan (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22633102/shang-chi-review"><em>Shang-Chi</em></a>’s Simu Liu) fled Earth for an alien planet with the intent of one day returning to lay waste to humanity. When scientists discover Harlan’s whereabouts, Terran forces launch a mission to take the fight to the robot army’s doorstep. Leading the charge: Atlas Shepherd (Lopez), a data analyst recruited to go full Jack Ryan on Harlan’s ass. Of course, the attack doesn’t go as smoothly as the Earthlings would hope, and Atlas has to begrudgingly click into an AI-powered mech suit in order to survive an alien planet populated with androids who want her dead.</p>
<p id="8oXSlo">The grounded futurism of <em>Atlas</em>’ Earth led Peyton and his creative team to extrapolate from current military tech for the mech design. Rounded edges and exhaust pipes are lifted from F-18 planes. The interior control panels were built for theoretical functionality. </p>
<p id="DqkJj1">“I had to understand all the tech from the inside out,” Peyton says. “Because of my experience on <em>San Andreas</em>, where I had to understand how a helicopter worked intimately to tell Dwayne what buttons to press and not to press — at least when he would listen to me! — I took that experience and wanted to make a similar experience for [Lopez]. I laid it out with the art department of why there are screens in certain places, why there are holograms in other places. And then on the day, I’m giving her little wires to be like, ‘That’s what this screen is. That’s where the screen is.’ So after going through the blocking, I pulled those away, and she had to memorize where they were.”</p>

<p id="8tKG0K">Drawings and schematics were only half of the equation. After drafting a design, Peyton set out to make his vision come to life. Coming at it from an animation background, that meant animating various walk cycles to see if the bipedal machine could move the right way.</p>
<p id="sfoGct">“The first couple of designs we had when we animated them to see how they would work — very basic animation, walk, run, walk, jog, run cycles — looked so clunky and terrible,” Peyton says. The animation team found a groove when they clarified the dynamic between man and machine. “[The mechs] are intuitive devices. The concept that I came up with was, the soldier is the brain. He doesn’t have to be super strong. He’s not like a grunt — the machine is the grunt. He is the emotional cognitive device that syncs with this thing. So it has to be able to be as fluid as a person who’s been trained in it.”</p>
<p id="anlxlU">As Atlas traverses the biomes of Harlan’s base planet — from snowy tundras to swamps inspired by Peyton’s love for <em>Return of the Jedi</em> — the film’s hero loosens up on her “no AI” stance and forms a cognitive link with her mech’s digital interface. Like a twist on the buddy-cop movie, the two bond for survival, which presents itself as more fluid mech motions. Early on, Atlas might be bumbling around a rocky cliff. By the end, she’s running, rolling, and slapping the hell out of robot assailants with mech-fu. The early walk cycle tests came in handy for the dramatic evolution, which Peyton was able to program into an enormous soundstage gimbal rig that stood in for the mech suit. Lopez was surprisingly well suited for the demands of the mech choreography. </p>
<p id="2JGjOb">“Her background as a dancer is what allowed her to really gauge that quickly,” Peyton says. “As much as she looks like she’s walking, [the mech] is walking her, and she has to react like she’s walking. So that training as a dancer allowed her to step right into it.”</p>

<p id="FD5xmE">It also helps that Lopez routinely performs for thousands all by her lonesome on a stadium stage. Peyton says <em>Atlas</em> turned out to be one of the most demanding shoots of his career, simply because for six to seven weeks, it was just Lopez performing solo on a gimbal rig that would be completely painted over with plate shots, VFX environments, and bursts of other action sequences shot elsewhere. Occasionally, voice actor Gregory James Cohan would dial in to perform the dialogue of Smith, her AI companion. </p>
<p id="92spoJ">All the prep work required to realize a mech with the capacity for real action, and clicking in a star who was up to control it, was in service of jolting the audience, says Peyton. The first time we see the mechs in action isn’t in an act of valor; they’re caught in an ambush, mid-flight. The carrier ship goes down — and so does Atlas, in her rig. Peyton’s imagination swirled at the possibilities, as evidenced in the finished sequence. “[The mech] would be tumbling, it would be spinning, it would be hit by debris. What would it be like to be trapped in that tin can? What would it sound like? What would it feel like? And once I get through that experience, well then, how can I up the ante? Well, what if I fall through black clouds, and I’m falling into basically a World War II dogfight, but with mechs and drones? [...] That’s just the first, I don’t know, 20 seconds of a two-minute sequence.</p>

<p data-characters="533" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The High Republic era of <em>Star Wars</em> is fascinating since it depicts a golden age of peace, long before the events of <em>The Skywalker Saga</em> that would see the Jedi culled and the galaxy dragged into seemingly never-ending war. And yet it faced its own hardships and galaxy threatening perils never been before in other <em>Star Wars</em> media. There are numerous novels that tell stories set during the 500 or so years the High Repulic era lasted for, and we’re here to help break down how you can read all of them and in the correct order.</p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">For context, the High Republic era is divided across three phases, with each one set during a specific period of time: <em>Light of the Jedi</em>, <em>Quest of the Jedi</em>, and <em>Trials of the Jedi</em>. Each phase isn’t wholly comprised of books (there are comics and audio dramas too), but we will be focusing on the novels.</p> <h2 id="h-phase-1-light-of-the-jedi" data-injectable="false">Phase 1: <em>Light of the Jedi</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true"><em>Light of the Jedi</em> ran from January 2021 to March 2022, and consists of two separate trilogies (one for adults and another for young adults), as well as a collection of short stories and a series of novels for children. There are a couple of books for very young children, but we’ll be leaving those ones out since they’re simple adaptations of two of the novels. Here is the recommended reading order:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-chris-chibnall-episodes-of-doctor-who-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-best-chris-chibnall-episodes-of-doctor-who-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="212" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Chris Chibnall is perhaps the least prolific writer of the current generation of <em>Doctor Who</em>, with only 38 episodes to his name as writer. However, what he lacks in numbers, he makes up for in epic storytelling.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Chibnall was the showrunner for most of the episodes featuring Jodie Whittaker as the first female Doctor, but he also wrote some great episodes featuring Matt Smith and David Tennant. I personally love Chibnall’s storylines and feel like they’re underrated, so here’s my top 10.</p> <h2 id="h-10-42" data-injectable="false"><strong>10. 42</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">42 is the first episode of <em>Doctor Who </em>ever to be written by Chibnall and also the first mention of Saxon, who went on to be the next Master.</p> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">This is an interesting episode because it’s the only one in the history of <em>Doctor Who</em> that has ever played out in real-time. The Doctor, played by a baby-faced David Tennant, has just 42 minutes to save the SS Pentallion from its imminent collision with a star. Not only is it full of tension, but the title of this episode is a reference to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and, more specifically, the answer to the ‘what is meaning of life?’ in the book.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-rosa" data-injectable="false"><strong>9. Rosa</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">Co-written alongside Malorie Blackman, Rosa revolves around the story of Rosa Parks and her now historic refusal to give up her seat on the bus during times of racial segregation. When the Doctor and her companions discover that a ‘rehabilitated’ mass murderer is attempting to alter the course of history, they must throw themselves into action to maintain history and keep things on track.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false">I personally love any episode which features a significant historical moment, so this one is definitely up there in my favorite episodes.</p> <h2 id="h-8-arachnids-in-the-uk" data-injectable="false"><strong>8. Arachnids in the UK</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">There aren’t many episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em> that will see me having to shield myself with a pillow between myself and the TV, but thanks to the fact that I have arachnophobia, Arachnids in the UK is definitely one of them.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">Despite that, though, I love this episode. Maybe it’s the adrenaline it causes to surge within me, but I think there’s more to it than that. This is the episode during which Graham, Yaz and Ryan decide to go on adventures with the Doctor, launching them into a whole universe of experiences they never dreamed of.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-7-dinosaurs-on-a-spaceship" data-injectable="false"><strong>7. Dinosaurs on a Spaceship</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">Imagine you, as an ordinary person with no knowledge of aliens or interdimensional travel, were suddenly dragged into the world of <em>Doctor Who</em> and thrust into the center of the action. That’s essentially what happens to Rory’s Dad, Brian, during Dinosaurs on a Spaceship and his reactions during this episode perfectly reflect his bewilderment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">For anyone who’s also a fan of Harry Potter, you can’t help but imagine Mark Williams, who plays Brian, in his role as Arthur Weasley meeting<em> </em>The Doctor<em> </em>and traveling through space alongside Egyptian Queen Nefertiti. It’s such a weird crossover that nobody asked for, but I cannot express quite how much I love this episode. Plus, it’s Matt Smith, the perfect chaotic good, and he gives the perfect “he said the thing!” moment.</p>
 <h2 id="h-6-fugitive-of-the-judoon" data-injectable="false"><strong>6. Fugitive of the Judoon</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">I love seeing places in beloved TV shows and being able to say, “hey, I’ve been there!” and Fugitive of the Judoon offered me that, being set in Gloucester. Besides that, though, this episode is an introduction to the Fugitive Doctor, who pops up in cameo roles moving forward and provides a small hint to the Doctor’s past long before it’s truly revealed in Timeless Children.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">On top of that, Captain Jack Harkness makes a return in this episode, and any episode featuring him is a winner in my book. Beware the lone Cyberman.</p> <h2 id="h-5-the-woman-who-fell-to-earth" data-injectable="false"><strong>5. The Woman Who Fell to Earth</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">As a female Whovian, I have to admit that I was both excited and apprehensive when I heard that the next Doctor would be played by Jodie Whittaker. However, as soon as she appeared on screen and took up the mantle, I knew that she would be incredible as the Doctor, and I was right.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">The Woman Who Fell to Earth is also our introduction to new companions – Graham, Yaz, and Ryan. Not only is this the inaugural outing of the first female Doctor, but it’s also a lesson in love, loss and perseverance.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-4-spyfall" data-injectable="false"><strong>4. Spyfall</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">Spyfall was the two-part opening episode to season 12 of <em>Doctor Who</em>. These episodes see the return of the Master, this time played by Sacha Dhawan and a small but pivotal role played by Stephen Fry.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">My favorite thing in these episodes, though, is the humor injected by Ryan and Graham trying to figure out their stolen spy gadgets. Seeing Bradley Walsh, who played Graham, dancing as he tries to figure out how his laser shoes work is one of my favorite moments from the entire season and never fails to put a smile on my face.</p> <h2 id="h-3-flux-war-of-the-sontarans" data-injectable="false"><strong>3. Flux: War of the Sontarans</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">This episode is a beloved favorite of mine. It’s got everything I could ever want from an episode of Doctor Who – humor (John Bishop is an excellent comedian, and seeing him hit a Sontaran over the head with a Wok is great), threat (the potential erasing of the history of Humanity and Yaz being held hostage by Azure and Swarm), and some history thrown in for good measure (the Doctor working alongside Mary Seacole during rewritten Crimean War).&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">Honestly, all six episodes of the Flux storyline are amazing. Sadly, I can’t include all of them in my top 10 because that would be cheating, but if I were to recommend any Chris Chibnall episodes, it would be the ones that are part of Flux.</p> <h2 id="h-2-the-timeless-children" data-injectable="false"><strong>2. The Timeless Children</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">This episode has proved to be something of a dividing factor in fans. Some swear by it as a perfectly logical progression in Doctor Who canon, while others consider it a retcon, going back on the established lore that the Doctor only had a limited number of regenerations. However, whichever side of the fence you’re on, you can’t deny that Timeless Children is an incredibly hard-hitting episode.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="223" data-injectable="false">Seeing the Doctor trapped in the Matrix, with parts of her past that she doesn’t remember shown to her, it’s difficult to imagine how that must feel. But, her monologue aimed at the Master is inspiring to say the least:</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">“You think you’ve broken me? You’ll have to try harder than that. You’ve given me a gift. Of myself. You think that could destroy me? You think that makes me lesser? It makes me more. I contain multitudes more than I ever thought or knew. You want me to be scared of it because you’re scared of everything. But I am so much more than you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-1-the-power-of-the-doctor" data-injectable="false"><strong>1. The Power of the Doctor</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">The Power of the Doctor has everything – a questionable Dalek with a suspect plan, a sad goodbye to John Bishop as Dan, the return of the Master in the guise of early 19th century Russian mystic Rasputin alongside his Cybermasters, the return of former companions Tegan and Ace, and the glorious return of David Tennant as the 14th Doctor. I mean honestly, what more could you want from a <em>Doctor Who</em> episode?</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">I have to admit, I don’t think any of the Masters have managed to come across quite as unhinged as Sasha Dhawan’s portrayal. He plays the part, and for a brief time, the part of the Doctor, with the perfect level of chaotic, overpowered insanity.</p> <p data-characters="144" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">And on top of all this, the first ever meeting of Companions Anonymous. What I wouldn’t give to be a fly on the wall in one of those meetings.</p>

<p>With the upcoming Summer Game Fest featuring exclusive news and reveals from the likes of Xbox, Ubisoft, Nintendo, Devolver, and others, we’re left wondering about Sony. They fully intend to host their usual State of Play; it’s just a matter of when. So, here’s what we know about the PlayStation showcase this summer!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-playstation-showcase-take-place">When Does the PlayStation Showcase Take Place?</h2>



<p>While there is no official date for the PlayStation Showcase, better known as State of Play, rumors indicate it will coincide with Days of Play, a massive sale focusing on PlayStation Plus and consoles, sometime this coming week. It’s said that Days of Play takes place on May 28, perhaps May 29, and the PlayStation Showcase would either launch at the same time or shortly after.</p>



<p>It doesn’t surprise us that Sony wants to host its showcase before everyone else, especially considering that Xbox will showcase its upcoming titles during Summer Game Fest in June.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-games-will-we-see-at-the-playstation-showcase">What Games Will We See at the PlayStation Showcase?</h2>



<p>There is no official confirmation about the numerous upcoming games we’ll see at the PlayStation Showcase. However, rumors indicate the following titles will make an appearance:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Concord</strong></li>



<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Astro Bot</strong></li>



<li><strong>God of War Ragnarok (PC)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</strong></li>



<li><strong>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, we’re pretty sure there’s something new coming from one or more first-party studios over at PlayStation. Sony desperately wants to maintain its lead in the gaming space, and a new reveal or two could help cement its position!</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s much to look forward to this summer, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ubisoft-forward-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Forward</a> occurring in early June. If you don’t want to miss a single game reveal, don’t forget to subscribe to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years.881541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Novellas have had an&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;resurgence over the past few years. Perhaps we have finally grown weary of the long, multi-book epic.&nbsp;Perhaps&nbsp;we&nbsp;just&nbsp;want bite-sized works to read in the middle of our busy lives. Whatever the case, I’m having a great time because of it.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">As a wizened elder in his&nbsp;mid-30s&nbsp;with a young child who would put and eat many dangerous things in his mouth if I wasn’t watching, novellas provide me with works&nbsp;that I&nbsp;can read in one sitting when given the chance. Beyond that, they also&nbsp;provide&nbsp;some of the best writing&nbsp;you’re likely to&nbsp;find anywhere.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Novellas force authors to be more efficient with their writing, fighting a ton of work into a&nbsp;little&nbsp;space. As such, many novellas include some of the hands-down best writing on a technical level I’ve ever seen. Don’t believe me? Here are some of the best novellas from the past five years. Give one a read and tell me if I’m wrong. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-moves-the-dead-by-t-kingfisher" data-injectable="false">What Moves the Dead&nbsp;by T. Kingfisher</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">This novella can be classified as several things, as it also ends up in horror sections in many stores. A retelling of Edgar Allen Poe’s <em>Fall of the House of Usher</em>, Kingfisher uses incredibly vivid descriptions and a tense atmosphere to create an unforgettable experience. It almost feels like cozy horror, with a slight sci-fi twist that I won’t spoil.</p>
 <p data-characters="498" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">It should be no surprise that Kingfisher’s novella reads well. She won the Hugo for another of her books, <em>Nettle &amp; Bone,</em> just last year. Her characters in this novella are&nbsp;wonderful, memorable, and fleshed out, with bits and pieces of their backstory scattered throughout like little lore nuggets. For fans of Poe, lovers of solid character, or even those who&nbsp;just&nbsp;want to dip their toes into horror without it being too horrific, <em>What Moves the Dead</em> is a fantastic choice.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Elder Race by Adrian Tchaikovsky</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">Fans of sci-fi novels should be aware of Tchaikovsky’s works. His <em>Children of Time</em> series has been a critical darling, winning award after award.&nbsp;Still, for those who want to give his works a try before starting his&nbsp;larger, more dense sagas, <em>Elder Race</em> would be a great place to start.</p>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">To set the stage, we’ll first discuss another author. Arthur C. Clarke, author of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, penned an essay that listed his three laws of science fiction. Perhaps the most memorable is the third: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. <em>Elder Race</em> is that law turned directly into a novella.</p> <p data-characters="750" data-current-count="1089" data-injectable="true">The novella is a story told from two&nbsp;perspectives,&nbsp;one of a person who&nbsp;was told stories of a great wizard who lives high up on the mountain&nbsp;and once saved her people, whom she must now call upon again, and that wizard, who is really just an off-world researcher who puts himself into cryosleep for a decade or so before waking up to collect data with satellites and drones.&nbsp;Watching&nbsp;these characters try to interact, discuss technology, or even just how they perceive situations so&nbsp;differently&nbsp;is fascinating.&nbsp;Pair that with an endlessly&nbsp;cool&nbsp;sci-fi antagonist, if it can be called that, turns the novella into a two-perspective thriller that makes one consider more about the genres of sci-fi and fantasy and what they may have in common.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">This&nbsp;is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Simon and Schuster</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">This&nbsp;is the most breathtakingly beautiful book on this list. It almost isn’t fair. The prose in this book is unmatched,&nbsp;a&nbsp;masterful work that should prove to many that sci-fi is a genre to be taken seriously in the literary world. Written by two authors, the novel takes the form of messages sent between two opposing agents in a time war, fighting to make their future the future.</p>
 <p data-characters="535" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Calling them messages doesn’t even do them justice. These are notes left in the dust of dying stars, taunts&nbsp;etched into cave walls to be read thousands of years&nbsp;in the future. The weft and weave of these characters and their relationship as they move through time is stunning, touching, and unforgettable. I won’t say too much more, as to do so would just be me continuing to gush, but if you’re a reader who likes prose-heavy works&nbsp;from time to time, you won’t find a better one than this.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Empress of Salt and Fortune&nbsp;by Nhgi Vo</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">I&nbsp;straight up&nbsp;don’t understand how Vo accomplishes what she does with this one. I finished reading this and felt like I had just finished reading a worldbuilding epic, with a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;and expansive setting built and fleshed out that encompassed so much. Then I looked back and realized the book was only 120 pages long with a big font.</p>
 <p data-characters="742" data-current-count="742" data-injectable="true">For&nbsp;those who are still fans of fantasy epics but would like to try a novella, this is the go-to choice.&nbsp;The story follows an exiled Empress and her handmaiden, with all the information about the world provided to us either in the form of a story or second-hand as it&nbsp;is told&nbsp;to our characters. Despite this, the world Vo builds&nbsp;is well thought out, provided to us using such&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;means. The pace of this one will be fast, as the information has to&nbsp;be provided&nbsp;constantly as the story&nbsp;is told, but if you can hold on, this book achieves something that no other novella I have read&nbsp;does;&nbsp;matching the worldbuilding of any Sanderson or Jordan book in just over 100 short pages.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Ring Shout by P. Djèlí Clark</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="757" data-current-count="1057" data-injectable="true"><em>Ring Shout</em> is cool, culturally informative, and historically revealing, making it an incredibly dense novella. But, despite this density, there’s still some time for good old demon slaying. <em>Ring Shout</em> takes place in 1922 America, where the movie <em>Birth of a Nation</em>, the movie that single-handedly sparked the rebirth of the KKK, is being shown across the nation. However, the members of the KKK aren’t always flesh and blood. Something that feeds on hate has traveled through the stars and found our planet, where they found enough hate to sustain them among the members of the KKK. In response, fighters&nbsp;are trained&nbsp;to take them down, seeking to put an end to both the KKK and whatever pushes them forward from the edges of our cosmos.</p>
 <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="false">Part look at the black cultural experience in early 1900s America, part action demon shooting devil slicing action, part Lovecraftian horror, <em>Ring Shout</em> tells&nbsp;an awesome&nbsp;tale with a deep level of historical credibility that brings it a step further. For those looking for a viewpoint into African American history and culture, who want a bit of revisionist history with some otherworldly horror mixed in, or&nbsp;just&nbsp;want to read about sick-ass freedom fighters taking a shotgun to some demons, <em>Ring Shout</em> will get you there.</p>

			<p>Gaming in general and AAA gaming in particular are going through a rough patch. While 2023 was a stellar year when it came to well-received AAA releases, the constant rise of game budgets (with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-facing-cuts-playstation-may-close-another-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to have cost $300 million to make</a>) is literally eating into the margins of publishers and developers alike. In February 2024, Sony Chief Operating Officer (COO) and SIE interim Chairman Hiroki Totoki explicitly <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-wants-to-improve-operating-profit-with-a-more-aggressive-pc-first-party-games-release-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> a more aggressive multiplatform release plan on PC would have to be enacted to improve the operating profit.</p>
<p>For its part, Microsoft, through Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-is-confident-in-xboxs-future-but-stresses-the-need-to-find-new-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the industry needs to find new customers and get back on a growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Microsoft has started releasing some of its exclusive games on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch consoles, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more possibly on the way.</a></p>
<p>Amidst all these shifts, the hardest part has been witnessing the record-breaking number of layoffs in 2024. AAA developers like <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riot</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electronic Arts</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-lays-off-5-of-its-workforce-cancels-some-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take-Two</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEGA</a>, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-announces-restructuring-program-crystal-dynamics-says-its-not-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Embracer Group</a> have laid off many thousands of employees to reduce costs. Most recently, Microsoft also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed</a> three internal Bethesda studios: Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games.</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xcoms-jake-solomon-qa-building-a-narrative-driven-life-sim-game-at-midsummer-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the chance to interview Jake Solomon</a>, who worked for over 22 years at Firaxis Games on AAA franchises like Sid Meier's Civilization, XCOM, and Marvel's Midnight Suns. While the main topic was his new studio, which is working on a narrative-driven life simulation game, we also asked his opinion on what's happening in the industry.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the state of the industry following all the layoffs? Is the doom and gloom warranted?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Honestly, it’s terrible. Too many people have lost their jobs, and it’s incredibly frustrating. It’s been nice to actually hire folks these last few months. The last few months have been terrible for a lot of folks, and hopefully, as Midsummer grows, we can provide a great studio home for some of them.</em><br>
<em>It’s a tough market right now. There are these incredible, over-the-top AAAA games that are impossible to follow. You also see amazing AA niche games that are more focused and successful. AAA sits in this awkward middle ground where it’s very expensive but hard to cover costs.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>In many cases, we've seen budgets double or triple between one installment and the next one in a series. Should developers and publishers rein in budgets to avoid these mass layoffs?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>I’m wary of telling other folks how to run their business. But I can tell you what we’re doing at</em><br>
<em>Midsummer. We want to make games in a small, collaborative atmosphere. We want to remain</em><br>
<em>independent. All of those things require that we stay relatively small, act and spend our money</em><br>
<em>in a sustainable manner, and make careful decisions on how we produce our games.</em></p>
<p>Do you believe AAA gaming to be in real trouble, or is this just a temporary phase? Let us know in the comments and through the poll below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-dnd-warforged-5e-subraces-classes-and-stats-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-dnd-warforged-5e-subraces-classes-and-stats-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="225" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Warforged were introduced to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>as part of the Eberron setting, but players with cooperative DMs have pushed them into just about every kind of campaign – probably because being a robot is awesome.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">The Warforged are living constructs, and in Eberron, they were originally created to be soldiers. Since they have a wide range of skills, Warforged have taken on other roles over time, and they can fit into just about any class. There’s almost no downside to making your character a Warforged, and as long as you know what you’re getting into, you can become the heroic robot of your dreams.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="697" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Eberron Wiki</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-what-traits-do-warforged-get" data-injectable="false">What traits do Warforged get? </h2> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">Before coming to 5E in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, the Warforged were released as an Unearthed Arcana – essentially a beta for <em>D&amp;D</em>. There are some differences between the UA version of the race and the one that’s now part of the official ruleset, but Warforged is still an incredibly powerful canvas that players can use to create all kinds of different characters. Here are the base stats and traits for a Warforged character:&nbsp;</p>
 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li>Ability Score Increase: Warforged get +2 to Constitution and +1 to any other ability score.</li> <li>Age: Most Warforged are between two and thirty years old, but the creatures are immune to magical aging effects and are, in general, immortal.</li> <li>Alignment: Warforged usually default to a lawful neutral alignment, but their alignment is often dictated by their creator.– of the beings with which they served.</li> <li>Size: Medium&nbsp;</li> <li>Speed: 30&nbsp;</li> <li>Constructed Resilience: Warforged have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned and resistance against poison damage. They also are immune to disease and don’t need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep.&nbsp;</li> <li>Sentry’s Rest: Instead of a typical long rest, Warforged must remain inactive for six hours. They can’t move, but they also don’t lose consciousness and retain the ability to hear and see.&nbsp;</li> <li>Integrated Protection: Warforged get a +1 to Armor Class. They can only wear armor that they are proficient with, and to put on or remove armor, they must spend 1 hour incorporating it into their construct bodies. As a nice trade-off, no one can remove a living Warforged’s armor against their will.&nbsp; Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor.</li> <li>Specialized Design: Warforged get one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Languages: Warforged can speak common and one other language of your choice.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What are the Warforged subraces?&nbsp;</h2> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">In <em>D&amp;D </em>5E there actually are no Warforged subraces in the official version of the race. Warforged are strong enough on their own that they don’t really need the support of a subrace, but there were some different subrace options when Warforged were still just an Unearthed Arcana.&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true"> <li>Envoy – These were meant to be the multipurpose Warforged and got +1 to two different ability scores.&nbsp;</li> <li>Juggernaut – These were the clear melee Warforged and got +2 to Strength.</li> <li>Skirmisher – These were the roguish Warforged and got +2 to Dexterity.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">If you have an extremely cooperative DM, you might be able to convince them to let you play the Unearthed Arcana version of the Warforged. Don’t worry about it, though, because the official version is plenty flexible enough to fit any type of character you might want to build.</p> <figure data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Eberron Wiki</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What are the strongest classes for a Warforged?&nbsp;</h2> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">Warforged is one of the least restrictive races in all of <em>D&amp;D </em>5E. The stats and features that come with being a Warforged are broadly useful, which means you can slot a robot into just about any class. </p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">The +2 boost to Constitution means that Warforged make excellent melee characters, and you can’t go wrong with a Fighter or a Barbarian. At the same time, every character is going to benefit from more Constitution, so you can use that +1 to an ability score as a way of shaping your Warforged into a caster.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">Do you want your Warforged to be a misguided wizard’s construct with high Intelligence? Or maybe a Warlock that found life thanks to a deal with a devil? My personal favorite build is Warforged Druid, which lets me live out my inner magical Transformer fantasies. In the game, as in the story, Warforged are meant to be shaped by their creators.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-furiosa-went-from-a-scrapped-anime-series-to-a-big-screen-blockbuster/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-furiosa-went-from-a-scrapped-anime-series-to-a-big-screen-blockbuster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="419" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga </em>from director George Miller has finally premiered on the big screen, with emphasis on <em>finally</em>. The latest entry in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">weird and wild <em>Mad Max </em>universe</a>, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, has been in development for some time, but the project wasn’t initially planned as a movie. Rather, Miller envisioned it as an anime series almost a decade ago, only for this idea to crumble.</p> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">The story of Furiosa dates back to the creation of<em> Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, which itself was worked on for decades. Per Miller during a chat with <a href="https://www.timeout.com/film/max-max-fury-roads-george-miller-on-his-post-apocalyptic-classics-and-mel-gibson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time Out</a>, Mel Gibson, the star of the original <em>Mad Max</em> trilogy, was even considered to return as Max Rockatansky at one point. </p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">Come the mid-2010s, however, Miller’s first <em>Mad Max</em> title since 1985’s <em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em> became a reality with Tom Hardy as the lead. The film also received a tie-in comic, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mad-max/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a <em>Mad Max</em> video game</a>, and a tale starring one of the feature’s new characters, Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa, was being laid out.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">Miller revealed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> that Furiosa’s story was actually completed before <em>Fury Road</em> even started shooting, recalling, “So we wrote a story about Furiosa from the time she was taken as a child, as she refers to in<em> Fury Road</em>, until she became the Imperator Furiosa. That ended up as a full screenplay, with concept art and so on.” </p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">With that, he decided the anime route was the best option to bring Furiosa’s origin to life. <em>Fury Road</em> concept artist Maeda was then enlisted to create the show’s aesthetic. Unfortunately, with the delay of <em>Fury Road</em>, the Furiosa anime was put on the back burner and eventually scrapped entirely. </p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">Miller told Polygon he felt “there was no point in making an anime” due to <em>Fury Road</em>‘s halt. In time, some of <a href="https://comicbookmovie.com/action/mad-max/artwork-from-the-cancelled-mad-max-furiosa-anime-finds-its-way-online-a122059#gs.9urpik" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Maeda’s artwork</a> made it online, giving fans an idea of what could’ve been. Meanwhile, Miller maintained that a Furiosa-centric story should come to fruition, and come to fruition it did. </p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">After a dispute regarding unpaid salaries on <em>Fury Road</em> was resolved, Miller began developing the ill-fated Furiosa anime as a movie. He overhauled the plot entirely, recast Taylor-Joy for the lead instead of de-aging Theron, and assembled a supporting cast of franchise veterans and newcomers alike. It was a long, winding road to get here, but at last, Furiosa has a gritty, post-apocalyptic spotlight all her own.</p>
 <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="63" data-injectable="false"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> is now playing exclusively in theaters.</p>

<p data-characters="465" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">No one arguing in good faith could reasonably claim <em>Diablo 4’s</em> new season, Loot Reborn, hasn’t been a massive boon for the game’s longevity. The game reached a new all-time peak of over 28,000 players on Steam over six months after its initial launch thanks to this season’s major overhauls to loot systems, upgrades, class balance, and more. With all this knob-turning and sweeping modification, however, comes a new problem: game balance. </p> <h2 id="h-diablo-4-is-now-too-easy" data-injectable="false">Diablo 4 is now too easy</h2> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">When I say game balance, I don’t mean how one class performs compared to others. Gone are the days of Barbarian and Sorcerer supremacy: now every class has a nearly equally-busted collection of fantastic builds. No, I mean game balance of the player-versus-enemy variety. The game is, for the majority of an average player’s experience, easy to a degree that borders on braindead.</p> <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="906" data-injectable="true">This isn’t an unexpected result of objective increases to player power and agency <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-tempering-guide/">in the form of Tempering</a> and the new, absolutely bonkers affixes it brings. Even just throwing a few build-appropriate affixes on your weapons will give you more felt power than ten or fifteen levels would. But still, in an effort to preserve “fun,” it seems the team more than slightly overshot the mark, resulting in a leveling experience that feels about as frictional as a freshly-Zamboni’d hockey rink. </p>
 <h2 id="h-even-endgame-content-is-a-breeze" data-injectable="false">Even endgame content is a breeze</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot from Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">I knew there was a slightly more serious problem than the game being a little too easy when I was face-rolling Capstone Dungeons (required to progress to the next World Tier difficulty) upwards of 20 levels earlier than I should have been just to <em>feel </em>something. Even then, when I’d progressed to a zone where enemies’ levels displayed an ominous “you’re not supposed to do this yet” red hue, I was cutting them down all the same. </p>
 <p data-characters="644" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">To be fair, blasting enemies in the dozens, hundreds, and thousands <em>is </em>fun.. for a little while. But after reaching level 80 or so my eyes are starting to glaze over every time I enter the game, run headfirst into the Helltide after popping a Profane Mindcage and utterly decimate every foe with the press of a button. Even World Bosses die in a matter of seconds. There’s no longer a measuring stick for player power <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-pit-in-diablo-4/">besides the endgame Pit</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-pit-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a>because from the moment your build starts to function until the moment enemies start one-shotting you in the Pit, the amount of pushback you’ll be getting from foes will remain around zero. </p>
 <h2 id="h-the-diablo-4-grind-is-no-longer-rewarding" data-injectable="false">The Diablo 4 grind is no longer rewarding</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot from Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="683" data-current-count="983" data-injectable="false"><em>Diablo 4</em> is primed to be the perfect “brain-off” game. Action RPGs in general are my go-to “second screen” games that I use to catch up on YouTube videos which may or may not have recently included a four hour essay on the failed <em>Star Wars</em> hotel. But the “brain-off” properties should probably come after you’ve spent some time crafting a build, earning great loot, and upgrading your character until your mere presence causes rooms of enemies to explode instantly. By offering this fantasy almost immediately, players are being robbed of the draw of action RPGS entirely: to start out annoyingly underpowered and eventually becoming a God. </p>

<p data-characters="442" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Upon acquiring Lucasfilm, Disney executives immediately jumped into George Lucas’ makeshift Death Star to annihilate the cherished Expanded Universe, a collection of media spanning decades that had carried the torch for Star Wars stories between films. Ever since the acquisition, what we used to call Expanded Universe has become “Legends,” which is the Disney equivalent of that farm that all beloved animals get to go to.</p> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">The change was an attempt to streamline Star Wars by removing any question about the canonicity of these fan-favorite stories. Fans are still irate about it today, but you have to admit, it was beyond bonkers sometimes. If you think the prequels showed <em>Star Wars</em> at its weirdest, then it’s time you have a look at the absolutely wildest characters and creatures present in the now-defunct Expanded Universe.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-dovin-basals" data-injectable="false">Dovin Basals</h2> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="791" data-injectable="true">The writers of the Expanded Universe wanted to explore a conflict outside the light and dark sides of the force, so they came up with the Yuuzhan Vong, a species so barbaric that the force wants nothing to do with them. The point of the force is that it surrounds and permeates everything that is, so the inception of the Yuuzhan Vong seems to indicate that some writers don’t understand their own material, but the Yuuzhan Vong still aren’t dumb enough to feature on this list. </p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">What we need to focus on are the Dovin Basals, a tick-shaped plant lifeform that the Yuuzhan Vong uses as a weapon because of their gravity-controlling powers. Yes, instead of using the Force, the Yuuzhan Vong employ the Dovin Basals to create protective and offensive gravity fields. That seems weird enough as is, but these wacky things have a huge impact on the Expanded Universe. </p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">You see, even though Chewbacca is alive and well throughout the sequel trilogy, he was dead for a very long time in the Expanded Universe because the Dolvin Basals used their power to have a whole ass <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&amp;q=chewbacca+death&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moon crash on top of poor Chewie.</a></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-of-the-weirdest-and-wackiest-characters-in-the-star-wars-universe/Let's%20have%20a%20look%20at%20the%20absolutely%20wildest%20characters%20and%20creatures%20present%20in%20the%20now%20defunct%20Expanded%20Universe."></a><figcaption>Image via Twitter</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Soon Bayts</h2> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true">At first, you’ll likely sense nothing wacky about Soon Bayts, a completely normal Jedi who only shows up in the <em>Star Wars</em> comics. It’s only when you realize that he’s a Jedi Master that things begin to get weird. I mean, he remains completely dependable when it comes to his ways in the light side of the force, but it’s just a bit weird that you have a character who goes by Jedi Master Bayts. </p>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">Are we looking at a Freudian slip that tells us more about the infamous Jedi celibacy than we ever asked about? Not really. Bayts was created by writer Randy Stradley, who was just trying to play a prank on his editor, but it made it through to publication. In the end, Bayts is killed by General Grievous, who takes his lightsaber as a trophy but probably wouldn’t if he knew what we now know.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Nobot, the possible murderbot</h2> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">When you watch <em>Star Wars Episode 1</em>, your eye might catch Nobot, a droid that bears a striking resemblance to C-3PO. He’s in that movie as no more than an unwittingly confusing easter egg, but the Expanded Universe decided to give Nobot a background worthy of a horror movie.</p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">The EU speaks of Nobot as somewhat of a cursed entity, a droid followed by the dark side or actual evil spirits. He’s constantly roaming Tatooine for reasons unknown and, despite being just a useless protocol droid, always manages to find his way back to Mos Espa.</p> <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">A vendor claims that Nobot repeatedly plays the recording of a woman pleading for her life right before she gets killed, which leads many to believe Nobot is the perpetrator.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="KOTOR Nago Sadows Tomb easiest/simplest way to kill the Terentatek" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPgKZX8z9Qs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Tarentateks</h2> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">The Tarentateks feel like a knee-jerk answer to someone who claimed that the Rancor just wasn’t scary enough. Instead of big and lethal, the Tarentateks are a type of creature mostly immune to Force powers, something Obi-Wan clearly states in the first movie that influences all things in the universe. </p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">The worst part about the Tarentateks is that you can’t just read about them and go, “phew, good thing I only have to read about them and not actually fight that dumb made-up thing.” You have to face a few of them in <em>Knights Of The Old Republic</em>. They suck so much that if you search for the words Tarentatek and <em>KOTOR</em>, most results will be about ways to cheese these things — like the clip above.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wookiepedia</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Just plain ol’ zombies</h2> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">Remember when <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-zombie-games-of-all-time-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zombies</a> were the biggest thing in the world? <em>Star Wars</em> needed a piece of that pie, so it shamelessly introduced actual zombies in the Expanded Universe canon. </p>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">What the hell is one of the most unapologetically R-rated monsters in cinema doing in the most PG galaxy in entertainment? Undead Stormstoopers make only a few appearances in Star Wars, and are explained as being victims of the battle on Hoth who were reanimated by a virus. </p> <figure data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via the Star Wars official website</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">BoSheck</h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">One of the Expanded Universe’s best aspects is its ability to flesh out random characters in unnecessarily ridiculous ways. BoSheck is present in the first film of the original trilogy, but he’s just some guy who is only on screen for a few seconds, does nothing important, and then vanishes forever. </p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true">In the Expanded Universe, however, BoSheck is both Force-sensitive and so good of a pilot that he managed to beat Han Solo’s Kessel run record. One’d have thought that these skills probably should’ve been put to use in, say, destroying the Death Star instead of having a kid do it.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">R5-D4, aka skippy the Jedi droid</h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">If you think Bosheck’s secret backstory is dumb, wait til you get a load of R5-D4. Much like BoSheck, R5-D4 also shows up in <em>Star Wars</em>, and he actually does something — he dies. R5-D4 is that droid whose head circuit explodes for no discernible reason — as far as you know.</p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">If you look into the Expanded Universe lore, however, you’ll find out that his head got fried because this droid was somehow Force-sensitive. He predicted that having his brains explode <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Skippy_the_Jedi_Droid">right there and then</a> was the only way to change the fate of the galaxy for the better.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wookiepedia</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Lak Sivrak, aka Wolf Man in the cantina</h2> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">I’m kind of cheating because this guy shows up in the original cut of <em>Star Wars</em>, but he was cut by George Lucas for the 1997 Special Edition, so he probably ended up in the same waste disposal facility as the rest of the Expanded Universe. </p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">There’s nothing wrong about this Sivrak. He’s just chilling at the cantina. I just find it really funny that Lucas must have looked at this guy and wondered if people would notice that this actor was clearly wearing a leftover werewolf suit costume and realize that he clearly didn’t belong in <em>Star Wars.</em> </p> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">Werewolves would be a pretty cool concept to explore in a universe featuring a bunch of planets with lots of moons. Sivrak’s erasure shows a bit of Mr. Lucas’s lack of vision.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wookiepedia</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Beldorion</h2> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">When not making bonkers choices, the Expanded Universe tends to just repeat what people already seem to enjoy about <em>Star Wars</em>. This means a lot of Hutts tend to be crime lords even though they’re surprisingly easy to kill, which is rather problematic when you’re surrounded by murderers 24/7. </p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Repetition isn’t the problem with Beldorion, though. He’s not a crimelord, but a Jedi. Yes, I know that <em>Empire</em> <em>Strikes Back</em> taught us that even seemingly harmless and mad creatures can be great Jedi. Still, the prequels did show us that Yoda was also immensely skilled with the lightsaber. So, I’d really like you to imagine a Jabba-like creature attempting to perform some crazy spin moves with their saber on.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wookiepedia</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">C-3PX</h2> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">It’s the final entry, so I can finally admit that I absolutely loathe C-3PO and get as little blowback from that as possible. I like that creepy, useless thing less than I like Jar Jar. Still, if that helps, there’s one thing I like even less, which is attempts to make C-3PO look badass. That’s when C-3PX comes in. </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">C-3PX is a droid that looks just like C-3PO but is also equipped with guns. He was even employed by Darth Maul as an assassin at some point. Getting a protocol droid that is ill-equipped for any sort of physical activity to be your assassin is dumber than having Anakin build C-3PO to help his mother around the house.</p> <p data-characters="197" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="false">If you’re in the market for a “badass” droid, you’re better off with BioWare’s efforts and the very vile <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-characters-in-star-wars-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HK-47, the murderbot</a> who views all organic beings as meatbags.</p>

<p data-characters="298" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During today’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/indie-live-expo-when-where-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Live Expo 2024</a>, <em>Hotel Barcelon</em>a, a game in development with the renowned creators Swery and Suda51 studios, received a brand new trailer and a gameplay demo that details exactly what you can expect when the game launches later this year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. </p> <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true"><em>Hotel Barcelona</em> got its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hotel-barcelona-swery-suda51-new-trailer-tokyo-game-show-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first trailer late last year</a>, dividing fans with its intriguing concept that’s juxtaposed by harsh visuals that would look more at home on the Nintendo Wii. The game is the result of an original idea by Suda51 but written and directed by Swery. The concept of the game is as bonkers as you might expect from the creators of <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, <em>The Good Life</em>, and <em>No More Heroes 3</em>. It’s a time-looping horror action title where you face off against serial killers and aliens inspired by slasher films. </p>
 <h2 id="h-you-can-discover-exactly-what-hotel-barcelona-is-by-watching-the-gameplay-demo-now" data-injectable="false">You can discover exactly what <em>Hotel Barcelona</em> is by watching the gameplay demo now</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="INDIE Live Expo 2024.5.25 (English)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMEflpy4t0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">You can check out <em>Hotel Barcelona</em>‘s new trailer in the Indie Live Expo stream VOD above from <strong>4:19:00</strong> to get a sense of what this game is about before heading to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> and wishlisting it if it looks like your cup of tea. While we know it’s going to be released this year, there’s no official release window right now. </p>
 <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">In <em>Hotel Barcelona</em>, up to four ghost characters can help you each time you die and jump back into the world. These characters are based on your past runs, but the enemy placement in the world will change every time you jump in, meaning you’ve got to work with yourself if you want to beat the game. Protagonist Justine has an insane serial killer living inside of her, and she’s got to slash her way through every serial killer in the US who has all gathered at a luxurious hotel just outside of Pittsburgh.</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">The style on show in the gameplay demo is amazing, pulling together Suda51’s comic book and video game visuals with classic slasher movie posters. Every boss is an experience packed with a character inspired by some sort of villain, be it a killer alien or a murderous baseball player. </p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">The game looks like it’ll subvert every expectation you have for it, with giant metal sharks, a huge alien monster, and superpowers that transform the player character into a raging monster that clears the field. I love the 2.5D view, and I think it’s a great fit with the incredible Metroidvanias we’ve had in 2024 so far, such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-tales-of-kenzera-zau/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">The most recent game I’ve played from either creator behind <em>Hotel Barcelona</em> is <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-good-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Life</a></em>, a slice-of-life title about a journalist who can also transform into an animal to help solve problems around the village they’ve become trapped in. I’m looking forward to jumping into this demo today to get another taste of that zany style that you just can’t get anywhere else. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-rpg-that-inspired-final-fantasy-dragon-quest-and-demon%E2%80%99s-souls-is-now-more-playable-than-ever.881499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162697/wizardry-remaster-final-fantasy-dragon-quest-demons-souls<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oV4CNC">When game director Hidetaka Miyazaki tried to explain his then-new game <em>Demon’s Souls</em> to the masses, he chose another game as its reference point: the classic, Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired role-playing game <em>Wizardry</em>.</p>
<p id="Fj75S0">FromSoftware wanted to “make the fun and charms of a classic RPG interesting all over again with the latest technology at hand,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121017051415/http://www.1up.com/news/sony-reveals-demon-souls">Miyazaki told Famitsu in 2008</a>. “Having long weapons bump into walls, lighting the area in real time with the torch in your hand [...] taking the things you did through menus in <em>Wizardry</em> and letting you carry them out in real life.”</p>
<p id="lay03u">Miyazaki wasn’t the only one thinking this. <em>Wizardry</em> — alongside another RPG powerhouse of the early ’80s, <em>Ultima</em> — has been cited by dozens of Japanese game developers as a major influence on their defining work. That includes Final Fantasy creator <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/06/29/hironobu-sakaguchi-talks-about-his-admiration-for-dragon-quest-and-upcoming-projects/?sh=26cc9d3d15b5">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>, Dragon Quest creator <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/03/dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-accepts-lifetime-achievement-award-at-22nd-annual-game-developers-choice-awards">Yuji Horii</a>, and <em>Secret of Mana</em> game director <a href="https://shmuplations.com/secretofmana/">Koichi Ishii</a>. <em>Wizardry</em> and <em>Ultima</em> defined the formula of menu-driven, turn-based RPGs for decades to come, inspiring developers to adhere to its template and to break free from it.</p>
<p id="YMZtCY">Thanks to the newly released <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em>, it’s now very easy to experience what dazzled dungeon-crawling fans of the early ’80s. <em>Wizardry:</em> <em>Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> is a modernized overhaul of the original Apple II game, with gorgeous new 3D visuals and dozens of quality-of-life improvements that make <em>Wizardry</em> more easily playable — but by no means <em>easy</em> — in 2024.</p>

<p id="nu7YRJ">The new <em>Wizardry</em> serves as a streamlined entry point into a game designed for a very different kind of player, someone who would bash their head against the RPG’s unexplained rules and rudimentary graphics to savor its authentic D&amp;D-style, party-based gameplay. The new version is lavishly repainted with graphics that ooze the atmosphere of classic tabletop RPG book art and vintage <em>Wizardry</em> magazine covers. It also makes the stats and percentages more visible, explaining why you might have failed an encounter with a party of angry kobold skeletons, slimes, or bushwackers. There’s even a rich bestiary that provides new lore entries on the game’s 101 monsters and other menaces.</p>
<p id="6I8wic">Running underneath the hood of the <em>Wizardry</em> remaster is the game’s Apple II source code, restored by developer Digital Eclipse from the original Pascal programming language. All the dice rolls and random encounters defined by classic <em>Wizardry</em>’s rules are present in the new version.</p>
<p id="XZbEoI">Alongside that reverent attention to the original game rules, Digital Eclipse has inserted a long list of quality-of-life features into its new <em>Wizardry</em>. You can easily put together a party of adventurers with the click of a button — or you can craft your team of fighters, thieves, priests, and mages completely from scratch. There’s a lovely graphical interface that lets you easily jump from the inn, where your characters rest and level up, to the shop, where there’s actual useful information about the weapons and armor you can buy, to the maze, where you’ll do your perilous, first-person dungeon crawling. </p>

<p id="kUgQ1Z"><em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> does a wonderful job of letting players have it both ways; Digital Eclipse lets you choose which streamlining features you want to keep and which you don’t. The remaster even provides the option of different maze layouts, letting you choose between either the PC version or the 8-bit console versions. (You can also opt to see the original Apple II visual running in the corner of the screen, so you can regularly marvel at 40 years of graphical evolution.)</p>
<p id="SE1dqL">During my first playthrough of the remaster, I defaulted to the most streamlined version of <em>Wizardry</em> and soon found that those changes definitely do not make the game a coddling experience. <em>Wizardry</em> remains immensely difficult, even in its new form. I frequently lost members of my party after overextending them by pushing us all further and further into the maze. But the mysteries and chance encounters of <em>Wizardry</em> beckon you to do that — to explore, die, and try again. And maybe recover the corpses of the previous team of unlucky adventurers that you sent to their deaths in the maze earlier in the game.</p>
<p id="FK1Uhh">Digital Eclipse’s <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> is worth playing, particularly if you’re a fan of classic Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games and want to learn more about their inspiration. As part of Digital Eclipse’s growing library of beautifully restored historical games (<em>Atari 50</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/11/7/3612408/karateka-remake-jordan-mechner-modernize-classic-story"><em>The Making of Karateka</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24101970/llamasoft-jeff-minter-story-review"><em>Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</em></a>), it’s a new way to experience a classic game in a form that was clearly developed with reverence for the source material.</p>

<p>Summertime brings sunshine and opportunities to get outdoors for most people. For players like us, however, it’s a time to sit down in a cool room, shades drawn over the windows, and watch developers and publishers reveal upcoming games and information. To that end, when is Ubisoft Forward?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-ubisoft-forward-event">When is the Ubisoft Forward Event?</h2>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-xbox-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Ubisoft Forward takes place on June 10. You can watch the upcoming gaming event live via broadcast—likely on YouTube and Twitch—with news about upcoming games from the Ubisoft offices worldwide.</p>



<p>While we don’t have much longer to wait for Ubisoft Forward to kick off, we’re not entirely sure what the publisher plans to showcase this year beyond a handful of known projects. Here’s hoping they have a reveal or two to impress the crowd!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-who-is-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who is Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-what-will-we-see-at-ubisoft-forward-2024">What Will We See at Ubisoft Forward 2024?</h2>



<p>We know we’ll see a gameplay reveal from Assassin’s Creed Shadows at Ubisoft Forward, alongside more about Star Wars Outlaws, which launches on August 30. However, everything else remains up in the air. There’s no official confirmation about most projects—past, present, or future—but Ubisoft looks to be having a solid year with a handful of releases, and they’ll likely want to capitalize on those.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></li>



<li><strong>XDefiant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rainbow Six: Siege</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skull &amp; Bones</strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Hexe</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I hope we get the opportunity to explore upcoming content for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, definitely more about Star Wars Outlaws, and, lastly, a reveal for The Division 3. Unfortunately, I highly doubt we’ll see that last one—not so soon, following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-canceled-the-division-heartland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of The Division Heartland</a>!</p>

 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">Once Sunken Treasures ends, any pickaxes you obtain will convert to cash. While that’ll help you upgrade your landmarks quicker, it doesn’t give you additional dice or stickers. Fortunately, until it ends, you can use Captain’s Quest rewards to advance further into Sunken Treasures and vice versa. </p> <h2 id="h-how-to-score-points-in-the-monopoly-go-captain-s-quest-event" data-injectable="false">How to score points in the&nbsp;Monopoly GO&nbsp;Captain’s Quest event</h2> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="false">You’ll score points during <em>Monopoly GO</em>‘s Captain’s Quest event by landing on pickup tiles. These tiles randomly spawn around the board and give two points that scale with your current dice multiplier. If you’re lucky, you can get several that spawn close to each other and initiate a chain reaction. Otherwise, watch your dice multiplier, changing it as you approach pickup tiles to make the most out of the event.</p>
