            <p>
I am sure the words "new" and "Ace Attorney game" have functioned as a sleeper agent's activation words for some of you, and these are words that Capcom themselves have sort of put together, but let's slow down before we get carried away. As spotted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mega-man">Mega Man</a> fansite <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/2025/12/capcom-moves-to-revitalize-mega-man-ace.html?m=1">Rockman Corner</a>, Capcom have released their <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2025/annual_2025_01.pdf">integrated report for 2025</a>, which for the most part is boring, corporate nonsense. Here comes the but. But! It also appears to suggest that the developer is thinking about new ways it can further develop series like Ace Attorney, as well as Mega Man and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>.
</p>
<p>
Apologies for the business speak here, but this is what Capcom had to say: "Capcom owns a wealth of globally popular brands, such as Mega Man, Devil May Cry, and Ace Attorney. We aim to expand our user base and improve our performance through new releases, remakes, and ports of titles in these series to new hardware. By enhancing brand power and cultivating loyal fan bases, we will grow these into core IPs." Just one second, need to wash off the stench of buzz words real quick.
</p>
<p>
Right, back! Now, that obviously doesn't 100% confirm a new game for the likes of any of the mentioned titles. However, at this point, as far as I'm aware, there's literally only the Professor Layton and Ace Attorney crossover game that's left to be ported, so perhaps there's hope for both this and something new too, you rabid Phoenix x Miles shippers.
</p>
<p>
In the case of Mega Man, there hasn't been a new mainline game since 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mega-man-11">Mega Man 11</a>, leaving ample room for a reawakening. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> came out in 2019, too, so it's not surprising Capcom is looking to breathe some life back into that one, even if it got a new mobile game last year. The developer has done quite well for itself with Resident Evil, Monster Hunter (well, not so much you, Wilds), and Street Fighter in recent years, so it isn't exactly a surprise that they're interested in a bigger slice of pie. Now all we need is a Dark Void reboot, the series everybody desperately wants a comeback for. Right? Right?

                <p>For a minute there, a full-on remake of Obsidian Entertainment's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith/" data-ref-id="5000-20453">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</a> was apparently in development. However, the project appears to have been put on hold, according to a new report.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's reporting</a>, new legal documents revealed that Aspyr and Lucasfilm Games were working on a full remake of KOTOR 2. Codenamed "Juliet" in the files, the project was a modern remake of the iconic 2004 RPG and was in development alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-537792">KOTOR remake</a>, which developer Saber Interactive said is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-is-still-coming-says-developer/1100-6526585/" data-ref-id="1100-6526585">still coming</a>. However, per Game File and unlike the KOTOR remake, development on the KOTOR II remake has ceased as recently as March 2025. Lucasfilm Games VP Douglas Reilly explained in depositions about the drama surrounding KOTOR II that, had the remake come to fruition, it would've contained the cut DLC that was teased when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-kotor-2-with-restored-content-launches-for-switch-june-8/1100-6503963/" data-ref-id="1100-6503963">the game was announced for Nintendo Switch in 2022</a>.</p><p>"'Juliet' was the codename for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR II," Reilly said. [It would have featured] modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general--the general content of KOTOR II, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things. It was something we were discussing with Aspyr. ... The plan was that we would remake the content that was in the RCM as it relates to Star Wars in that Juliet project."</p><p>The DLC, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification</a> (or RCM), was originally a mod that filled in the narrative gaps while offering an alternate ending for KOTOR 2. As Aspyr officially revealed the restored content announcement, the studio confirmed that the official DLC would do the same thing: It would include new crew dialogue, an extra mission with HK-47, and a "new revamped ending." Unfortunately, when KOTOR 2 hit Nintendo Switch on June 8, 2022, the DLC never came out. Apparently, the reason why the DLC never dropped was that Disney's lawyers blocked it with what was apparently a sticking point surrounding who actually made the mod. And now, it appears a KOTOR 2 remake won't drop, either.</p>

            <guid>1376671</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>After months of meaning to get around to it, I finally pulled the plug on my Spotify subscription last week. There wasn't any one reason I wanted out, just an ever-growing collection of back-breaking straws:<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-12/spotify-boycott-daniel-ek-ai-music-military-tech-fenn-wilson/105765846?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the CEO's support of genocide</u></a> was a big one, but you can throw in everything from its<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>poor artist pay</u></a> to layoffs to, well,<a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ex-spotify-employee-exposes-wrapped-decay-2400-human-storytellers-replaced-cold-ai-logic-1760414?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the fact the whole company just seems pretty terrible</u></a>.</p><p>A major factor in delaying the decision wasn't because none of that mattered to me--it all did!--but because having used various streaming services for almost 15 years now, changing them felt like work that I just didn't have time for. I had so many playlists and liked songs and albums to move, and the last time I'd done this--when I'd left Google Play Music for Spotify,<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/rip-google-play-music-2011-2020/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>after the former rebranded to YouTube Music and became a worse service in the process</u></a>--it had been a disaster, involving a ton of messing around and a ton of lost music.</p><figure><blockquote>

</blockquote>
</figure><p>But every man has his limits, and so last week–<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/03/spotify-wrapped-ai-create-your-own-playlists?ref=aftermath.site"><u>maybe it was just seeing everyone talking about their Spotify Wrapped, which sucks</u></a>--I finally pulled the pin, remembering it was just the latest in a succession of moves in my life where I've tried, however I can, to start putting my money where my mouth is. In the last couple of years I've installed solar on my roof, I've moved both my banking and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>superannuation</u></a><u> </u>(which is roughly an Australian 401K) to more<a href="https://www.bankaust.com.au/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>responsible</u></a><a href="https://www.australianethical.com.au/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>providers</u></a> and sold two gas-powered cars to buy a single electric vehicle. If I could do all <em>that</em>, I could move a fucking music service.</p><p>The act of cancelling my Spotify subscription itself was the easy part; the only speedbump ended up being the fact that, having been on an all-encompassing family plan, my daughter (who uses it as a kind of social media platform with her friends, exchanging playlists, etc) didn't want to budge. So we got her an individual membership and cut her loose from our plans; I'm not the kind of parent who is going to force my kids to go along with an ideological decision they can't fully grasp, so she can make the call on her own time as she gets older and, hopefully, a bit wiser.</p><blockquote>I found myself not looking for the best streaming platform, just trying to find the least worst. </blockquote><p>The hard part was choosing what to replace it with. Especially since I had some pretty stringent requirements. Spotify had worked for everyone, everywhere, so its successor needed to factor in that it was going to be providing music for me, my wife and my 12 year-old son, all of whom had different use cases. I have a Pixel, my wife has an iPhone, I listen to music on my desktop PC a lot, she prefers the kitchen speaker, I listen to a lot of music that might not be in every service's library and she doesn't, and our car runs on Google's Android Automotive, which has a limited selection of native music apps.</p><p>Given that last point, our first stop was YouTube Music. As YouTube Premium subscribers--you have to watch so many videos in this line of work that if I had to sit through ads I'd have lost years of my life--I already had access to YouTube Music, and it was also installed on my car. I quickly found that in the five years since I'd stopped using it little had changed: the app sucked shit, and the music quality was even worse, so it was almost instantly struck off the list.</p><p>Next was, uh, hrm.<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I'd read through Brian Merchant's excellent guide to cancelling Spotify earlier in the week</u></a>, and had also put out a call on social media for replacement suggestions, so had more than a few options to consider, but all of them seemed deeply compromised in some way. I just wasn't feeling Deezer, Amazon Music can go to hell and Tidal, while doing some things I liked (like paying artists more, and offering welcome sound quality options) had an app design and sharing features that just didn't sell me on it either.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n/app.bsky.feed.post/3m74by6hv5s23" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifrs32ex4jnxq4bm22bmjw5pyfsxdrht6pibrkl4djujh6r7pbqpe"><p lang="en">been shopping for a spotify alternative this week and this is grim stuff. its either volatile small guys who will be dead or bought out in 18 months or trying to decide which major tech platform you hate the least</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Luke Plunkett (@lukeplunkett.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nhqvuggd6ebasluetrqfab6n/post/3m74by6hv5s23?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-03T20:23:29.531Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>It felt like every platform I was considering was either owned by the worst people on Earth, run by the worst people on Earth, looked like they weren't going to be around much longer or had huge holes in their offering that made them substantially less useful to me having just come off Spotify's ubiquity. Free of a contract and only now surveying the music streaming landscape in its entirety like this, it was bleak! This is what we've come to, this is the point these platforms and the economy driving them have led us to, a point where I found myself not looking for the best streaming platform, just trying to find the least worst.</p><p>Things seemed so bad that I considered making the next logical jump altogether, which was ditching streaming entirely. Maybe I could just start running a media server, put all my Bandcamp purchases and rips on there and go back to how I listened to music in 2007. If I was really worried about principles, I'd realise streaming as a concept is inherently fucked, that even in best-case scenarios it's all exploitative to artists, and that I needed to cut that cord completely.</p><p>But I am an imperfect man confronting a difficult situation: my whole family is now hooked on the convenience, on the recommendations and new release updates and playlist algorithms. Even if I could bring myself to make the break, there's little chance I'd be able to convince my wife and son to start screwing around with a media server and plugging a thumb drive into one of our car's USB slots.</p><p>So, streaming platforms it was.</p><p>Taking price, cross-platform compatibility, family plans, sound quality, artist pay, company ownership and user experience into account, and excluding the platforms I'd already dabbled in and struck off the list, I ended up with two services to pit against each other for my money: Apple Music and Qobuz.</p><p>Qobuz seemed great on paper! The folks there seem to genuinely care about music and artists in a way no other service (aside from maybe Tidal) do, and on average they paid artists <em>way </em>more than Spotify. But man, in AUD terms their pricing was <em>steep</em>, so much so that I took one look at their family plans and closed the tab. I realise the hypocrisy here of<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"> <u>someone who regularly begs for money on the internet saying this</u></a>, someone who fully understands you can't pay other people properly unless you yourself are paid properly, but the AUD$40 per month Qobuz were asking for was just too much when I've already got that YouTube Premium subscription (and my daughter's Spotify) on the books.</p><p>Which left me with one last option to try out: Apple Music. The cons here were enough to give me pause: my personal devices are almost all Google-based, there was no native car support (though there wasn't for Qobuz either), no podcast support within the same app and Apple, while not as genocide-friendly as Spotify, were still run by a guy who has<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/silicon-valley-ceo-trump-business-00564524?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>repeatedly embarrassed himself bending the knee</u></a>.</p><p>The pros were that Apple paid artists twice as much as Spotify, offered some lovely high-quality formats and the design of their app is lightyears ahead of the competition. So I took the plunge, installed it on a bunch of devices, kicked off a family plan and so far, so good.</p><p>The lossless audio sounds incredible on my car's sound system (even if I have to plug in my phone and use Android Auto to enjoy it). I love the desktop app, and the mobile app is beautiful. In a very Apple way everything is simple, clear and just <em>works</em>. Compared to YouTube Music's woes and Spotify's bloat, it's been a genuine pleasure opening up Apple Music and just...playing some music.</p><p>The best part though, and this would apply to anyone moving to or from any major platform these days, is that in the years since my last transition the process of transplanting your library has gotten a lot easier. I paid $5 for a one-month Soundiiz membership, hooked it up to both platforms and within 10 minutes I had copied my whole library over–albums, playlists, the works. My music collection in Apple Music now looks exactly like it did on Spotify without skipping a beat.</p><p>Actually that's not quite true; my library had been <em>improved </em>a little, with two of my favourite albums of all time now back in my collection (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/20/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-interview-leaving-spotify-free-music?ref=aftermath.site"><u>King Gizzard had pulled both <em>Infest The Rat's Nest</em> and <em>PetroDragonic Apocalypse</em> in protest over Spotify's military investments</u></a>).</p><figure></figure><p>The whole experience ended up being much more painless on a technical level than I'd been expecting, but then, it had also wound up being more depressing than I'd bargained for. It feels like my move to Apple Music isn't the permanent one I'd been hoping for; it's more convenient at the moment, but it's far from a perfect situation. I know, in my heart, that I need to go back to just buying music off artists, ditching convenience for something that actually helps the people making the music I love so much.</p><p>The problem is that, like so many other things that are easy and ruinous in our lives at the moment--Netflix, Game Pass, etc--it's just too easy. I can't give up hours-long feeds of lo-fi electronic music while I work at my desk, or the luxury of being able to skip through entire artist catalogues in my car whenever the fancy takes me. Even though I've now made a slightly more palatable decision on where to spend my money, I am still part of the problem.</p><figure><a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>How to quit Spotify</p><p>This Black Friday, here’s a guide to finding the best Spotify alternative</p><p><span>Brian Merchant</span></p></div></a></figure>

              <p>One of the main things that’s distinguished Nintendo 64 clone the M64 from rival device the Analogue 3D, beyond being sold <a href="https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895">by an international arms dealer</a>, was its playful shape and colorful, translucent shell. But now Analogue has revealed its own translucent variants. There’s competition to see not just which device can run Nintendo 64 games the best but also which one looks the coolest. And not everyone’s happy about it.</p> <p>There are some other important differences between the M64 and Analogue 3D, however. Fully revealed over Black Friday weekend, ModRetro’s M64 is $200 compared to the $250 for the base Analogue 3D (matte black or white) and it features compatible controllers that are actually shaped like the old N64 ones (Analogue’s look like their existing 8Bitdo line-up). The other important difference, of course, is that the M64 isn’t shipping yet (there’s a <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/m64-green">waitlist you can sign-up for</a>). The Analogue 3D is already out.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The body is ready!  We can finally show the final design of the M64.  Three translucent colors are in manufacturing right now, more than a dozen on the way – goes on sale online and retail soon, we are releasing upcoming colors as easily swappable low-cost body kits! <a href="https://t.co/CnbTSKf7yd">https://t.co/CnbTSKf7yd</a></p> <p>— Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1994584120739950925?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But today, Analogue revealed the “Funtastic” variant of the 3D in “highly limited quantities.” This translucent version comes in eight different colors ranging from “Watermelon” magenta to see-through gold. Pre-orders go up on <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-funtastic">December 10 at 11:00 a.m. ET,</a> and the Funtastic versions will cost $50 extra, rounding out the total price to $300. And that’s before adding on the new translucent controller variants which match the material and color of the consoles. These come separately at $45 each.</p>

 <p>Understandably, some people who’d already pre-ordered one of the existing Analogue 3D consoles in black or white are pissed off. “I just got mine, and now you drop these awesome colors?” wrote one owner. “Seriously? It feels like a slap in the face to early supporters. And yes, I’m reposting because your previous post disappeared.”</p>

 <p>Another wrote, “Why on earth didn’t you launch with this? instead, you announce it a few weeks after the 7 day return window for those who pre-ordered. what a convenient cash grab.” At least a few recent Analogue 3D purchasers say they’re going to try to get a refund anyway.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nah this is bs straight up. Delay console for nearly 2 years and pull a rug under us early adopters who waited patiently only to see you released funtastic colors nearly 2 weeks after everyone is getting their white and black units..</p> <p>— Kodaxx (@Kodaxx88) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kodaxx88/status/1998089537499881745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It is an odd move for a boutique retro gaming company that often skirts the line between fan hype and hyperbolic marketing. Analogue has a record of releasing alternative color schemes for its hardware. The company’s earlier Pockets eventually came out with all sorts of versions that channeled different aesthetic eras of the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. Those didn’t get announced immediately after the initial launch, however.</p> <p>Part of the issue might be the Analogue 3D’s repeated delays this year. It was supposed to launch much earlier than it did, with mysterious manufacturing and shipping challenges, including likely hiccups around the president’s trade war with China, gumming up the original timeline. If so, however, it’s still unclear why the announcement of the “Funtastic” variants wasn’t pushed back to compensate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2K Games is Launching a New Studio Headed by ex-The Initiative Leadership]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/2k-games-the-initiative-new-studio/</link>
            <guid>1376656</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two former lead employees from The Initiative have launched a new studio for 2K Games. Previously, both members worked on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cancelled Perfect Dark title</a> for Xbox.</p>



<p>The Initiative was an ambitious new first-party studio for Microsoft/Xbox and led by former Crystal Dynamics head, Darrell Gallagher. It brought in many notable figures from studios like Rockstar, Santa Monica Studios, and Naughty Dog. The studio’s first title was announced to be a remake/reboot of Perfect Dark. Unfortunately, earlier this year, the game was cancelled and The Initiative was shut down. Now, two former employees, including Darrell himself, are heading up a new studio for 2K Games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403902973464014848/?originTrackingId=juNbzYzc45PM4zhZ2yaPjg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a>, former studio head of The Initiative, Darrell Gallagher, announced that he’ll be joining a new studio for 2K Games. He’ll join as SVP, Studio Head of the yet-to-be-named studio. His message can be found below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>I’m excited to share that I will be joining 2K as SVP, Studio Head, where I’ll be building a new studio and leading an ambitious opportunity unlike anything I’ve taken on before</strong>,” says Gallagher. “<strong>I’ve spent my career believing in what’s possible when great people come together with a bold vision. I can’t wait to get started with the exceptional team at 2K!</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Furthermore, Brian Horton, former Creative Director at The Initiative for Perfect Dark, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403908881246318592/?originTrackingId=CgNwdSlyrogNLDJN1Ms7OQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced on LinkedIn</a> that he will join Darrell as VP Head of Creative. Prior to The Initiative, Horton served as Creative Director for Marvel’s Spider-Man and the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>. No information was shared regarding any other talent joining or what the game may be. Either way, it is a pretty big snag and may give fans a peek as to what stories The Initiative would have told if not disbanded.</p>

                <p>Pokemon cards are as hot as they've ever been, and unfortunately for a local card shop in California, it means their merchandise was the target of a recent heist. On December 2, thieves targeted LA Sports Cards in Burbank and made off with $100,000 or more in Pokemon cards and other collectibles. The trio of thieves were captured on camera in KTLA 5's video report below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C1e1em0hqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_C1e1em0hqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Store owner Kiet Nguyen noted that the thieves seemed to know just where to go to get the most valuable Pokemon cards in the store. "Liquid assets" of unopened Pokemon boxes were also taken, and will be easy to sell because of how common they are. Additionally, the thieves stole rare sports cards that featured Mickey Mantle and Ronaldo among others.</p><p>The thieves were in and out of the store in around three minutes, and the report notes that this trio may have hit other card shops in Southern California. One of the thieves exposed part of his face during an earlier heist, and that could help police eventually track him and his partners down.</p><p>KTLA notes that Nguyen indicated that the store does have insurance, and it will be upgrading its security. It's not the first time that Pokemon cards have been linked to crime. In late 2024, reports emerged that the Japanese mob was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">using Pokemon cards to launder money</a>.</p><p>Law-abiding Pokemon fans are keeping an eye on the next Switch 2 game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a>, which will be released on March 5, 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We've seen Amazon's TV series adaptation of Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson's original comic book series, The Boys, appear in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-warzone-2-0-season-4-reloaded-the-boys/">Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir operators in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a>, Homelander getting added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-gameplay-trailer-release-date/">Mortal Kombat 1 as a DLC character</a>, but the series has yet to get its own dedicated video game - until now, that is. Sony Pictures VR and Brazilian studio ARVORE have announced The Boys: Trigger Warning, a VR game coming to PS VR2 and Meta Quest 3 in 2026.</p>



<p>The reveal trailer below makes the game feel like a horror title of sorts, with Homelander as the scary monster you're running away from. Which is not entirely off the mark, considering that the show goes to great lengths to make it clear that its version of the world would be a horrifying one to live in, and that people like Homelander are, in fact, monsters.</p>



<p>You step into the shoes of a new original character that is somehow forced into becoming a Supe when a family outing goes awry, and you're exposed to one of the many skeletons buried in Vought's closet.</p>



<p>From there, you join the Boys and plot your revenge on Vought, with cast members from the show, including Laz Alonso as MM (Mother's Milk), Colby Minifie as Homelander's right-hand woman, Ashley Barrett, and P.J. Byrne as Adam Bourke.</p>



<p>Jensen Ackles will also make an appearance in the game as what is described as "<em>a twisted interpretation of Soldier Boy, created exclusively for the game</em>," in a press release. As if Soldier Boy, or any of the super-powered characters in The Boys weren't already twisted enough.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>From day one, we wanted to build an adaptation hand-in-hand with the people who defined this universe</em>," said Ricardo Justus, ARVORE founder and studio head, in a press release. "<em>Working with the show's writers and cast allowed us to bring the edge, humor, and brutality that made the series iconic, delivered with the spark of magic only ARVORE can create</em>."</p>



<p>VR players will recognize ARVORE as the studio behind the Pixel Ripped 1978, 1989, and 1995 games, as well as the studio behind the interactive short The Line and Clawball.</p>

<p>"<em>We're thrilled to work with ARVORE to bring The Boys: Trigger Warning to life in VR</em>," added Lance Sloane, senior vice president of virtual reality at Sony Pictures Entertainment<em> </em>in a press release. "<em>Having the show's creators involved in shaping the experience allows us to push the boundaries of immersive storytelling, and we're grateful to collaborate with our friends at Meta and PlayStation to deliver it to fans</em>."</p>



<p>The fact that the very first video game to be dedicated to The Boys is a VR game is an interesting choice, to say the least. Virtual reality is definitely still growing in popularity, but it's also still quite niche. This does at least explain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-boys-video-game-could-happen-but-maybe-not-how-you-expect/1100-6535645/">why Eric Kripke claimed a video game based on The Boys was happening, but that it wouldn't be a "<em>Xbox or PlayStation</em>" game</a>. It seems that no one told Kripke about the PS VR2 version, though.</p>



<p>It'll also be curious to see how many more members of the cast are featured in Trigger Warning. Homelander makes an appearance in the trailer, though with <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-teaser-voice-not-right/">Anthony Starr not participating in Mortal Kombat 1's rendition of the character,</a> it's probably a safe bet that Starr won't voice Homelander here. </p>



<p>Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Erin Moriarty, and Karen Fukuhara are also absent from the list of confirmed cast members for Trigger Warning, though for at least three of those actors, that could be because their characters don't appear in this original story set within the world of The Boys. We know from the screenshots above that Karl Urban's Billy Butcher does make an appearance, so the fact that Urban isn't mentioned as having already signed on for the game probably means someone else will be voicing Billy.</p>



<p>We'll see if ARVORE can capture what made The Boys such a popular TV show in VR form when it arrives on PS VR2 and Meta Quest 3 at some point in 2026.</p>

            <guid>1376611</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Court documents from a false advertising lawsuit filed against Lucasfilm Games and Aspyr over the failure to integrate a previously promised and popular fan mod into the Switch port of<em> Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</em> reveal something we didn’t know about: Lucasfilm was planning on making a<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake. And it might still be happening.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-gets-ps5-remake-1847646267">In 2021, Lucasfilm and Aspyr announced that a <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> remake</a> was in development. Then the RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-knights-republic-kotor-remake-ps5-canceled-1850885369">seemingly nuked from the internet in 2023, leading some to worry it was dead.</a> Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-interactive-joins-development-of-star-wars-kotor-remake">co-developer Saber Interactive</a> saying the project was alive and well <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">in 2024,</a> there has been mostly radio silence about the remake of one of the highest-reviewed <em>Star Wars</em> games ever made. And now, court docs indicate that its sequel was, and maybe still is, getting a similar remake.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney">As reported by <em>GameFile</em> on December 8</a>, court documents involved in a false advertising lawsuit against Aspyr and Lucasfilm include the mention of a “Project Juliet,” which is confirmed in a deposition with <span dir="ltr" role="presentation"> Lucasfilm Games </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">vice president Douglas Reilly to be a<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake. As pointed out by <em>GameFile</em>, the Switch port of<em> KOTOR 2</em> was codenamed “Capulet.” Here’s what Riley had to say about the project: </span></p>

 <p>“Juliet was the code name for a project where we were going to do a full remake of <em>KOTOR 2</em>&nbsp;with modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general—the general content of <em>KOTOR 2</em>, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things. It was something we were discussing with Aspyr.”</p>

 <p>When asked by a lawyer if the plan was to remake content featured in the fan-developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sith_Lords_Restored_Content_Modification"><em>KOTOR 2</em> Restored Content Mod</a>, Riley confirmed that was indeed the plan.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that’s all we got on this <em>KOTOR 2</em> remake. <em>GameFile’s</em> Stephen Totilo can’t confirm the status of the remake as of December 2025. The deposition cited above happened in March. At that time, Riley explained that the<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake was “<span dir="ltr" role="presentation">technically on the road map” but that the plan was to start with a remake of <em>KOTOR</em>, as previously announced. Riley also said that Aspyr is no longer working on either remake and instead Saber-owned Mad Head games was or is now handling development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>All mentioned parties and companies were contacted by <em>GameFile</em>, but didn’t respond or declined to comment. That means that, for now at least, we don’t really know what happened to either remake. It sounds like they are both still happening in some form, but until Disney or Lucasfilm confirms either way, fans will be left waiting to find out more about what will happen to these remakes of two of the most popular <em>Star Wars</em> games ever made.</p>

<p>It’s not just the original Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic that was getting the remake treatment. According to a new report, the game’s sequel, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords, also had a remake in development.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest edition of the GameFile newsletter</a>, Stephen Totillo dove into the game’s release on the Nintendo Switch. He writes about the fact that a planned console release for the Restored Content Mod was announced and planned, but never was released. That’s because, according to filings, Disney’s lawyers put a “blocker in place”.</p>







<p>That blocker was <strong>“a prohibition on releasing the Restored Content DLC for Switch without further clearances around who actually made the mod.”</strong> As Totillo wrote, it was an “insurmountable” roadblock that stopped it from ever coming with an official announcement on the matter happening in 2023. </p>



<p>As Totillo went further into what happened on the legal side that prevented it from releasing, he found that there was another project at developer Aspyr. Codenamed Juliet, it was a “full, modern remake” of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords. </p>



<p>This remake, it’s said, was in development as recently as March 2025. It was also set to have all of the cut content back in the game.</p>

Maybe both!</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Tomb Raider (@tombraider) <a href="https://twitter.com/tombraider/status/1998095607001681987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from tweets both by <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998093056692895923" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Awards creator Geoff Keighley</a> and the official Tomb Raider account. As Keighley puts it, "As just revealed in our The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in Thursday night for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises, Tomb Raider. This is one you won't want to miss."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what could be shown? There are a few possibilities. The first and most likely is that we're about to see the Tomb Raider game that's been in development at Crystal Dynamics for several years now. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-tomb-raider-unreal-engine-5-crystal-dynamics">First announced in 2022</a>, we have yet to actually see this game in action, though we did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-dev-reveals-lara-crofts-official-redesign">get a look at the Lara Croft redesign last year</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One could forgive Crystal Dynamics for being so quiet the last three years, though, as the studio has been through it. Shortly before the announcement, Embracer Group purchased the studio and the franchise from Square Enix. Then, it sold both off to Middle-earth Enterprises in 2024. Amazon is still publishing Tomb Raider, but Amazon has had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mmo-new-world-enters-maintenance-mode-as-amazon-cuts-14000-jobs-but-whats-happening-with-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">its own issues</a> with the struggles of its New World MMO, its Lord of the Rings MMO, and mass layoffs. Amazon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-video-game-reveals-not-too-far-away">said over a year ago</a> that the game would reveal was "not too far away," leading one to wonder what exactly was meant by that. Meanwhile, Crystal Dynamics has undergone three waves of layoffs this year, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-30-more-workers-in-third-wave-of-cuts-this-year">30 individuals last month</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">an unknown number of workers in August</a> following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">cancellation of Perfect Dark by Xbox</a>, and<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 17 people earlier in the year</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-is-latest-embracer-studio-to-suffer-layoffs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 others back in 2023.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's the game side of things. On the TV side, we know there's a live-action Tomb Raider series in the works at Amazon in partnership with Story Kitchen, starring Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. The show will, per Story Kitchen, "reinvent the franchise on a massive scale" and will interconnect “live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But again, it's been in the works for a while with no updates. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-tv-series-in-the-works-at-amazon-from-fleabag-writer">first heard of its development</a> in January of 2023, and it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-confirms-shes-working-on-amazon-series">was officially confirmed</a> later that year. There were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-show-from-fleabags-phoebe-waller-bridges-could-be-dead">reports in April of this year</a> that the TV show was "dead" in part due to Tuner's busy acting schedule and in part due to Jennifer Salke, who greenlit the show at Amazon, being "booted" from her job. There were also allegations that a script hadn't been provided yet. But then, in September, Amazon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-x-men-star-sophie-turner-confirmed-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-series">re-confirmed the Tomb Raider series was happening</a> and would start shooting in 2026, with Turner still to star.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's...a lot going on! With all that background, it seems most likely we're going to see the game, as the series hasn't begun shooting yet. However, it's possible we're due for a look at Turner as Lara Croft. Given the vagueness of Keighley and Crystal's tweets...why not both? In the meantime, at least we have the anime...I guess. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-review-netflix-hayley-atwell">didn't much care for the first season</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards will take place on Thursday, December 11, at 5pm PT/8pm ET. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-the-game-awards-2025">Here's our guide</a> on what else to expect at the show.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it’s the smell and feel of new cards fresh from a pack, or just the expectation of what could be, but I love me some colorful cardboard rectangles, commonly referred to as “trading card games”. As someone who has been playing some manner of TCG or another for close to 30 years at this point, it feels like this particular hobby has seen an explosion in popularity and options for potential deck-builders to pick from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest offering that has drawn in crowds is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-is-an-impressive-league-of-legends-trading-card-game">Riftbound</a>, designed by Riot Games and published in partnership with UVS Games (the same group behind Universus, another TCG that brings massive properties like Godzilla and Street Fighter together in a competitive card game) and based on the immensely popular League of Legends IP. With Riftbound: Origins, the game’s first set, debuting only a few short weeks ago, Riftbound looks like a pretty neat game, but just how neat exactly?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I hopped in my car and dropped into my FLGS (friendly local game store) to get a more boots-on-the-ground look at Riftbound.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">To the Rift!</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-1-1765225053055.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pulling into Games &amp; Company, located in Walled Lake, Michigan, I popped in during their recently added weekly Riftbound night. Spread across a few tables, players were fending off one another, holding down their battlefields, and making pushes to claim their opponents in an effort to score points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking over to one of the tables, the players kindly let me sit down and watch and graciously answered my basic questions about the game - I had yet to play it at this point. At a glance, I could tell both of them were TCG veterans, with one playing on a gorgeous Dragon Ball Super playmat and the other one adorned with the MagicCon logo, so I asked what they both thought of Riftbound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It quickly became apparent that both Brandon M. and Alex H. felt the big initial draw for Riftbound was the attached League of Legends IP. “I’ve played a lot of League [of Legends] so that’s definitely a draw,” Brandon explained, “I’ve always liked card games but just haven’t found that I have related to one as much as Riftbound.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-3-1765225053055.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex echoed a similar sentiment, mentioning that he is a big fan of how the resource system is handled in Riftbound, known as Runes (basically mana for the MTG players out there), and that “you only have yourself to blame if you manascrew yourself” since Runes are placed in a separate, small side-deck you draw from each turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Popping into the shop’s Discord channel, I spoke with active member Chris, who attributes not only the IP to the reception but also the quality of the game: “Riftbound seems to have been developed by a team that has been paying attention both to what these games have done correctly or incorrectly as well as how they could connect this trading card game to the universe of Runeterra fans already know and love."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There is an incredible amount of depth to this game that I have only experienced in Magic:The Gathering. This is a great thing, as I feel a lot of the trading card games that have come after haven't really captured the complexity that leads to truly outstanding plays. Riftbound feels alive and vibrant, without feeling watered down and tired. I feel like most players are aware there is so much more to come due to the depth and expanse of the Runeterra lore, but we welcome it as players and are ready to take that journey.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">But how is it selling?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-4-1765225053055.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaving the players to finish their best-of-three match, I wanted to get some perspective from the other side of the FLGS coin, the folks who run the shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking a break from stocking the shelves with board games and packs of the hottest TCGs, I asked Alyssa Dean, one of Game &amp; Company’s owners, what she makes of Riftbound so far. “What stands out to me the most about the Riftbound release is just how passionate the players are about the IP. They’re already in love with all these characters so just seeing them come to life in the game has been really rewarding for us as a store and for the players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That excitement looks to be translating into sales too, Alyssa continues, ”Sales are really high. TCGs are kind of at a high right now, so I wouldn’t say that it’s wild, but it is definitely very strong. If I could get, you know, 20 times more product than what I did, I guarantee I’d still sell out, which is a really great way for a game to start off, with this level of excitement.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-6-1765225053054.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With the hype and the store’s excitement absorbed into my veins, I cracked some packs and wanted to see if Riftbound could sink its claws into someone who never played much League and could barely tell you what “jungling” means. First and foremost, holy crap is it tough to find <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-where-to-buy">ANY sort of product right now</a>, be it single packs, champion decks, or the Proving Grounds boxed game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting some games in and cracking a couple of packs, even without much in-depth knowledge of the IP, it’s clear that Riftbound has some fun gameplay backing up the hype and some gorgeous card art too. The card games I've played, predominantly being Magic, Digimon, and some Gundam, mean my focus is always on how I dish out damage or tank the blows against me. I found Riftbound’s focus more on holding ground and shoring up your position to be a refreshing change of pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, I enjoy countering moves by my opponents and taking out their units, but I got far more of an adrenaline boost by overtaking an enemy battlefield and watching my victory points creep up as I held the line. I don’t need to know who Lee Sin is to know that this game feels good. Now I just need to track down enough packs to try my hand at making my own deck and really get into the jungle with this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riftbound looks to be riding high out of the gate with fans and game stores alike, and even as a League newbie (that’s still a word folks use, right?) its quick matches and its capture-and-hold gameplay have yanked me in like a champion out of formation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no shortage of options available for connoisseurs of colorful cardboard rectangles out there, so it remains to be seen if this up-and-comer is able to protect its lanes from the likes of Magic, One Piece, and whatever the next new TCG turns out to be. The next set, Spiritforged, is due out in February and with players rabid to get their hands on every bit of Origins they can, Riftbound looks to be a serious contender for TCG players’ time and money, but it remains to be seen for how long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Kensuke Ushio, composer for anime works like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tk1gzE8eo&amp;list=OLAK5uy_lPmRxtxp5_nE_qX-3vUHoGf2sFeGfB_9Q&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Devilman Crybaby</u></em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYURSz_GF7Y&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nq91NTOs3Pj9IdQOWyE_iVM_sPhqZVVAE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dan Da Dan</u></em></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04aZ3zbSR98&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nRZk9UF7eJVjPKrziCvEYewFRgUMcS4bE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ping Pong The Animation</u></em></a>, has earned a strong reputation for sonic excellence among anime aficionados. But when the <em>Chainsaw Man</em> composer first read <a href="https://aftermath.site/chainsaw-man-reze-arc-tatsuki-fujimoto-the-bible/"><u>Tatsuki Fujimoto’s lauded Shonen Jump series</u></a>, his reaction was a common refrain for anyone who read the series: “I fell in love with it, but at the same time I also thought, this is insane.” As the battle-tested connective tissue for for the tonal ping pong between heartbreak and action of the TV series, pressure was on for Ushio to cook up a soundtrack as musically insane enough to underscore its first theatrical film, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-review-anime-mappa-2000675933?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</u></em></a><em>. </em>It's safe to say Ushio cooked up yet another generational banger—this time of the peak emotional damage variety.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/24ib7cbOsm0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Listening to the Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc OST be like"></iframe></figure><p><em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em> might go down as one of, if not the, anime film of 2025. The film, which adapts arguably the manga’s most devastating arc, is a literal battle for one’s heart. More specifically, hero Denji is caught in his first brush with genuine love with an enigmatic and explosive manic pixie dream girl, Reze, while keeping his heart from getting ripped from his chest in a cataclysmic battle with the Bomb Devil. For <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em>, the score’s identity owes a lot to <em>Chainsaw Man</em> manga author Fujimoto’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23324559/movies-like-chainsaw-man-influences-watch-streaming/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>unbridled love of cinema</u></a>. Appropriately, its genre-blending score further enriches the first theatrical movie for the series. Just in time for the film's <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-12-07/sony-releases-chainsaw-man-reze-arc-film-on-digital-on-december-9/.231765?ref=aftermath.site"><u>home video arrival</u></a>, I spoke with Ushio to ask him how he orchestrated the remarkably moving score for <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em>.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPaoHkV0dYw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CHAINSAW MAN – THE MOVIE: REZE ARC - New Trailer | DUB (HD)"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc </em>introduces a tonal shift in <em>Chainsaw Man</em>’s story. One that’s more romantic and tragic. How did you approach scoring this film differently from the TV series? Were there sonic motifs or textures you deliberately abandoned or accentuated?</p><p><strong>Kensuke Ushio:</strong> For the movie, I wanted to use a full orchestra extensively. From the very beginning, even during the production of the TV series, we all talked about how the <em>Reze Arc</em> might become a movie. If we were going to make the <em>Reze Arc</em> into a movie, I thought it would be best to use a large orchestra in an environment capable of properly reproducing everything from soft to loud sounds, using good speakers. The overall planning for the entire <em>Chainsaw Man </em>franchise has been done to a certain extent, so for this film, I consciously decided to use a large orchestra.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Are you a fan of the <em>Chainsaw Man</em> manga yourself? If so, what aspects of it resonate with you as its anime series composer? How does it compare to other series you’ve scored in terms of how it invites musical interpretation?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> I knew about <em>Chainsaw Man</em>. That being said, in Japan, sometimes they run campaigns (on manga sites, etc.) where the first three chapters of a manga are free… So I only initially read through those. I didn’t properly read the entire story until after I got the offer as composer. After reading, I fell in love with it, but at the same time I also thought, this is insane. Like when the characters start discussing “<a href="https://youtu.be/h5HGyS373bo?list=PLRe9ARNnYSY7jDfcQFiycXWGBPhFFC7n5&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>killing Denji off</u></a>,” (a line that also comes up in the Arc), or how every girl Denji falls in love with tries to kill him, or turning the page to find tons of people dead. I thought it was such a mess. But that’s what I found so appealing, and I decided to make that kind of chaos, which isn’t found in other works, the core concept of my compositions. Ideas like this, born directly from the source material, really felt unique to this work.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote>— kensuke ushio (@agraph) <a href="https://twitter.com/agraph/status/1968968423183913310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Were you given access to early cuts or storyboards of the film to guide your scoring, or did you work from mood briefs and thematic direction alone when composing its original soundtrack?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> In the earliest stages, I composed music using materials like storyboards and what are called “setting documents” —things like, “the character has this kind of face,” “we’ll use these colors,” or “this is the final look we’re aiming for.” I also worked on the music alongside the script. Partway through, a rough cut version comes in, so I watch that and then refine things further. This time, the sound director was <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=208&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mr. [Yasushi] Nagura</u></a>, a colleague I’ve worked with on projects like <em>A Silent Voice </em>and <em>Liz and the Blue Bird</em>. He understands my character and work as a composer well, so he gave me plenty of freedom and breathing room, which, thanks to that, made me able to compose freely.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>How does your process shift when you’re composing with visual materials versus prompts? Do you find that one approach opens up more unexpected, creatively rich possibilities than the other?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> It isn’t so much a matter of artistic sensibility and process as it is a professional skill issue. Specifically, when someone says something like, “The music should start here in the footage and develop from here,” the length they are referring to is the footage’s duration—not four bars or eight bars—so it’s completely non-musical. So then, you end up having to fit music into spaces like three bars, one beat, and 0.5 seconds. When creating purely from imagination, I can work in musical units. But film scoring—matching sound to film—is a job that involves tackling these impossible demands, and that’s really the fundamental difference. Film scoring is tough in that sense, yet conversely, scales like three measures, one beat, and 0.5 seconds are timeframes I'd never conceive of myself, so in that way, it feels creative. But at the same time, I think it's an incredibly difficult process.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">たのしー <a href="https://t.co/jfWDpwPNNE?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/jfWDpwPNNE</a></p>— kensuke ushio (@agraph) <a href="https://twitter.com/agraph/status/1996479484695036376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 4, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>The anime series is known for its fragmented, industrial sound that’s equal parts jagged and visceral in short bursts. In contrast, how did the film’s format and pacing influence your compositional choices?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> That’s a tough question. This film, <em>Chainsaw Man: The Movie – Reze Arc</em>, is a 100-minute work. That means the story has to unfold at a pretty brisk pace. Now, this might stray a bit from your question's intent, but the music in the film has the function of making 5 minutes feel like 10, or 7 minutes feel like 3. So, for example, I compose each piece thinking about things like, “Let's make it feel like a slow date with Makima-san,” or “Let's make the battle feel like it ends in an instant.” The film's overall structure starts with a boy-meets-girl introduction, builds to a grand epic battle, and culminates in a poignant ending. We crafted it to feel like climbing a hill, gradually building momentum. That's a major difference from the TV series.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/popVaqPlOFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc | OST -  02 - our film"></iframe></figure><p>Also, I’m usually a dance music artist, and last year I performed live with <em>Chainsaw Man</em> tracks. The feeling of keeping audiences dancing nonstop to <em>Chainsaw Man </em>tracks in nightclubs across Europe and Japan has really influenced how I structure the music, especially in the latter half. That aspect might be particularly special this time around.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Did the longer runtime allow for more thematic development or restraint to underscore scenes?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> There are two perspectives here—a broad one and a detailed one. Broadly speaking, if a 100-minute film had a new melody every second or minute, it would become overwhelming. So we used a technique called a leitmotif, where one melody is reused in various ways; that's how we approached it. But on the other hand, the final battle scene is essentially one long battle throughout the latter half. You know how DJs who only play big hits get annoying, right? So for that part, I aimed for restraint, or rather, structured it with a mix of pace and tension.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7kh-Tj1jOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CHAINSAW MAN - THE MOVIE: REZE ARC Clip - Bomb Devil Face Off"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Is there a particular track from the <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em> score you feel most emotionally attached to? What about its structure, instrumentation, or context makes it resonate with you personally?　</p><p><strong>KU: </strong>It’s not quite the same as having sentimental attachment, but if we're talking personal taste, there's a song called “<a href="https://youtu.be/Q5qwsqnwDEQ?si=kBskLNcl2vyaqLYC&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>slow summer eve</u></a>” (Track 13). That piano tone… how to describe it? Like an old music practice room with dust dancing in the setting sun...I've loved upright pianos with that kind of tone forever, since I was a kid... I've spent all this time honing my craft just to achieve that tone and that kind of phrasing. So, I think it's wonderful that a song like that came to be in a movie loved by so many people.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWacdcatC9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="”Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” Official Teaser ／ 劇場版『チェンソーマン レゼ篇』公式ティザーPV"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>“In the Pool” stands out as the longest track on the <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em> album, and arguably one of its most emotionally charged. It carries this dreamlike quality that’s romantic and suspended in time with its strings and piano riffs—yet there’s a subtle menace that creeps in toward the end. It later reprises in “In the Sea,” echoing the emotional fallout of Reze and Denji. How did you arrive at that particular piano motif—one that feels equally romantic and haunting? Was it born from the visual rhythm of the scene from the film or manga, a thematic suggestion, or something more intuitive in your creative process?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> By the time we made the teaser trailer announcing the upcoming <em>Reze Arc</em> film at the end of 2023’s JUMP FESTA, this song and the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR7Szd_qY0c&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nszyFgNx1NresQcnH_P8qL7DoWhe0j1pg&amp;index=28&amp;pp=8AUB&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Reze</u></a>” (Track 28) had already been completed. While discussing which track to use for the teaser, we decided the song that would eventually become “in the pool” had a theme that was too deep and heavy to use effectively in a teaser, it was too profound for that purpose. So, we chose “Reze” instead, as it sounded more beautiful and light. However, both Director <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=79001&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>[Tatsuya] Yoshihara</u></a> and I absolutely loved the song that inspired “in the pool.” We kept saying until the very end that we wanted to use this one for the teaser, so we absolutely wanted to use that song in the film. Director Yoshihara and I called the song that became “in the pool” “our song” (laughs).</p><p>At that stage, there was still no script, no storyboards, no structure—nothing. The track was made intuitively, thinking about the character of Reze.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pzkm1EmgmMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc | OST -  09 - in the pool"></iframe></figure><p>Your observation about “in the pool” becoming increasingly unsettling towards the end is spot on. While “in the pool” starts with a bittersweet melody like “boy meets girl,” towards the end, it incorporates chords reminiscent of late Romantic composers, or perhaps modern Russia. It has a melancholic resonance, like longing for home, structured so that Reze's background creeps up on you. Nice catch.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> Reze herself is elusive, seductive, and ultimately lethal, but MAPPA redoubled its animation efforts to make her cuteness shine the brightest through Denji’s eyes. For her eponymous track, what word or mood were you going for to embody her as a character?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> As I mentioned, that melody was already formed at a very early stage. But it developed into the final “Reze” song roughly during the middle to latter stage of music production. I wanted to create a sense of Reze's lethality, or rather... a melancholy feeling. So, I incorporated a lot of sounds like faint, raspy noises—almost like sounds before they become sounds—using instruments like the violin. Me, the orchestrator, and the violinist worked together, using the violin to layer in sounds where the bow barely touches the strings. We recorded many layers of these sounds, things that seemed like they might vanish away. I think that really became a defining element in shaping her.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gGX5ajpPr8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="“Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” –  &quot;Jane slept in the church&quot; ／劇場版『チェンソーマン レゼ篇』「ジェーンは教会で眠った」"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Track 12, “<a href="https://youtu.be/lggJlm4QeEE?si=UOK0JDoZQOEIn7jG&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jane Slept in the Church</u></a>,” is the only spoken word piece on the album. It's stark, unaccompanied, and deeply unsettling. It mirrors a moment from both the manga and anime where Reze sings in Russian while strangling an assassin, evoking a kind of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_9KNP9I6YA&amp;pp=ygUqbm8gY291bnRyeSBmb3Igb2xkIG1hbiBzdHJhbmd1bGF0aW9uIHNjZW5l&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>No Country for Old Men</u></em></a> with how quiet, intimate, and lethal the scene is. What led you to strip away all instrumentation and let the voice stand alone? Was it about amplifying the psychological tension, honoring the manga’s eerie stillness, or something else entirely? What did that sonic choice enunciate to you about Reze’s character or the emotional architecture of the scene as its composer?<strong>　&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>KU: </strong>Abstractly speaking, that scene is where Reze comes into close-up. So, the camera and the microphone are right in front of her, incredibly close. You can even hear her own lip noise. If you're going to hear her singing with bated breath, I thought it would be better without any instruments. There's a man named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chion?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Michel Chion</u></a>, who is both a film music composer and a leading authority on film music studies. In terms of what he calls “the possible forms of film music,” that scene features “music playing within the film itself.” You can't just add accompaniment to that, can you?</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>How does scoring anime differ from your solo or band projects? Do you find it to be a collaborative extension of your voice, or does it demand a different kind of authorship in instrumentation? 　<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>KU:</strong> Creating film scores is vastly different from solo or band work—it feels like a completely different genre, a completely different profession. I'm the type who spends five or even ten years on a single solo track... but with film scores, you have to create something in just a day or two. It's like the difference between a sprint and a marathon. Also, the goal of film scoring isn't to make great music; it's to make a great film. That aspect is completely different from the obsessive focus I have in my solo work. So, film scoring isn't about expanding my own musicality.　</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yz4GGVPRA68?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="agraph - greyscale (video edit)"></iframe></figure><p>My solo work involves years and years of meticulous research into various new areas, making it closer to research and development. It feels like taking the insights gained there—specifically things like synthesizer sounds, microphone techniques, compositional methods—things I researched and developed myself—and applying them to the soundtrack. It's like broadly applying the R&amp;D from my solo work to film scores.</p><p>On the other hand, I think it's a very positive spiral when someone who is both a film composer and an artist incorporates things they've tried in film music into their own work.

I just happened to be making music when someone asked, “Why don't you try making a soundtrack?” It sounded fun, so I did it. I don't think soundtrack production will ever become the core of my music. However, I couldn't write orchestral scores on my own. But as the leader of the production team, I can create large-scale pieces like “in the pool” at that scale. Since I work in electronic music, if I'd been working solo, I never would have learned how to create such large orchestral arrangements. There's that unexpected acquisition of skills.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>When the credits roll on <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em>, your music will linger with audiences as they sit and reflect on the film before leaving the theater.

Is there a feeling, rhythm, or silence you hope stays with them long after the film ends? 　</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> Whether I'm working solo or on film scores, I basically create music without lyrics. I want to make music that transcends words. So, to be specific, there's nothing I want you to take away within the realm of words. However, I can tell that you all are feeling something, because I'm receiving so much feedback right now, and I'm really happy about that.</p>

			<p>The flight simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-gets-detailed-pc-requirements-ideal-spec-recommends-64gb-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> has been released today on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in September</a>. On the surface, it's only the umpteenth game published by Xbox Game Studios on the platform after the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-most-downloaded-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-announces-two-titles-coming-to-playstation-5-updates-and-expansions-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age of Empires</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-console-to-play-gears-of-war-on-playstation-ps5-pro-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>, and more, with the (once) brand-defining IP Halo <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also on the way next year</a>.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an XDA Developers interview</a> with Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise head Jorg Neumann, we learned that it might have been this game that started it all. Neumann had first discussed the possibility internally around two and a half years ago and initially received a no for an answer, but eventually Microsoft came around, kicking off, in Neumann's own words, the avalanche of Xbox games on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p><em>It was my idea, actually. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/microsoft-flight-simulator-leaving-jet-plane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</a>, we came out on PC first in August 2020. One year later, we shipped it on Xbox, and we found millions and millions of new fans on Xbox that had never seen the flight sim because they're just not PC gamers. A lot of them thought it was great, and a lot of them stayed. In 2020, it was already 120 GB when we launched as a download. When we were in 2023, I looked at the install numbers, and it was 300 GB. Then we had our content roadmap, and there was so much new stuff that we were doing that we would be over a terabyte. I said, "We need to do something," so we decided to make Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and had the concept of a thin client. Our client is now 8 GB, and instead of putting everyone on your hard drive and making that download huge, we put everything in the cloud.</em></p>



<p><em>That made it possible to go to other platforms, so I proposed, probably two and a half years ago, to go to PlayStation. It was probably a little bit before its time because I was told no. Then, somebody from Sony who grew up with flight simulation thought it would be a great addition to the Sony portfolio. They reached out proactively to our President, who then came back to me and said, "Hey, remember when we talked about the PlayStation thing a year ago? Sony is also interested." I think that really kicked off a whole avalanche of Xbox titles coming to PlayStation.</em></p>



<p>Neumann also adds that the studio worked hard to optimize the game for the PlayStation 5 console and the DualSense controller. Indeed, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 supports the following features on PS5:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adaptive triggers that respond to different speeds and surface types on the ground and provide sloped resistance in the air &nbsp;</li>



<li>Gyro controls to control pitch and roll while flying &nbsp;</li>



<li>Lightbar support to provide visual caution / warning cues &nbsp;</li>



<li>The ability to customize the touchpad to handle a variety of tasks
<ul>
<li>By default, users can control an aircraft’s throttle by swiping across its surface &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The built-in controller speaker plays audio from air traffic control </li>
</ul>



<p>As for his Xbox-to-PlayStation multiplatform claim, there is certainly a grain of truth there in that it might have been the first time Microsoft seriously sat down and considered the possibility of porting one of its games (in this case, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024) to the rival console. However, given the downward trajectory of Xbox console sales and Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-unrealistic-financial-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandate to the Xbox division to increase profits</a> after the expensive acquisitions of ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard, going multiplatform was really only a matter of time.</p>

            <p>
Cassette Boy is a game that looks to follow in the footsteps of perspective puzzlers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a> and Tunic, two games I bring up because of their explicit use of space to hide more, tantalizingly secret space. Out of the two, it's much closer to Fez, being a 2D world you can rotate to gain new, three dimensional perspectives. Where Fez is a platformer that switches between different, still 2D planes, Cassette Boy lets you switch between front on and more isometric views, and in its world, anything that can't be seen, doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
This means different things. Cassette Boy is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> RPG, one that emulates the look of an original Game Boy game, and RPGs typically come with dangers. Perhaps there's some kind of nasty beastie blocking your path, or spikes with no gap to cross through. Simply rotate to a new angle, and poof! They're gone. Rotate some more, and they pop right back into existence. You can see why the developer's referred to it as a "Schrödinger System."

<p>
There are battles to be had as well, with fairly simplistic but solid enough sword-based combat you've seen in any of the 2D Zeldas. I wonder how that, in particular, may come into play throughout the game, but I'm also curious if puzzles go a bit further than just making enemies or NPCs disappear so you can walk forwards, as that's mostly what the game's trailers show.
</p><p>
Still, it's a neat concept, one that I'm curious enough about to make me want to check it out. And I don't have to wait long to do that! As it's currently slated for release in just over a month's time on January 14th, 2026. Aside from the existential fear that comes from the steady passage of time, that's pretty good! You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334330/CASSETTE_BOY/">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[I Don’t Think We’d Be Talking Much About Horses If It Hadn’t Been Banned]]></title>

            <guid>1376569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When all is said and done at the end of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ two-hour runtime, Santa Ragione’s horror game feels remarkably unremarkable. The game has been caught in a shit storm of controversy after it was </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/santa-ragione-co-founder-pietro-righi-riva-on-horses-steam-and-possible-closure-of-the-studio"><span>banned from PC storefronts like Epic and Steam</span></a><span>, and the reasons for that ban are odd, considering the specific content the storefronts mention doesn’t seem to actually exist in the game. Santa Ragione says Valve refused to list </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>on its storefront due to scenes that “depict sexual conduct involving a minor,” but after playing through the game, I’m not sure what this is referring to. </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>isn’t for the faint of heart, but it’s also not…that.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is grotesque, unsubtle in its imagery, and underneath all the grit, grime, and gore, it is saying </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>. It’s just not anything really revolutionary. Its gruesome imagery paints a fairly straightforward image of the psychological damage of a forced puritanical lifestyle on the self and society, and even through its crude, PS2-style aesthetic, it gets its point across well enough. I just wonder how much we would be talking about it had it not been for Valve and Epic’s actions.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself. I haven’t even talked about the minutiae of how </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>gets there, but that’s because all those details are less interesting than that hypothetical to me. </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>stars a young man named Anselmo who is sent off by his parents to work on a rural, out-of-the-way farm in a small town.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That sounds simple enough, until he meets the horses he’ll be taking care of, who are actually humans stripped naked and forced to wear horse masks while acting as if they are a herd of equine animals. You even ride on their shoulders a few times, much to your chagrin. But the disturbing imagery is gradually revealed to be a way for </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>to explore how the farmer’s stunted sexual growth and sex-negative upbringing have caused him to develop a psychosexual need to control others’ sexual behavior, while finding ways around the mental and physical shackles he’s put on himself.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651444"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651444">© <span>Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>If nothing else, </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>gets this across pretty well, if unsubtly. The farmer comes from a backwater town in which sexual frustration is forced upon a civilization by a doctrine preaching that abstinence is close to godliness, and so his entire life has become fixated on something he wants but has been brainwashed into believing he’s not allowed to have. This man’s entire mental and sexual development has been shackled like a chastity belt, and so he has created an entire business and network supporting a farm in which he is able to force that same self-denial on any poor bastard found wandering near his land.</span></p> <p><span>A lot is being said about </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ use of graphic sexual imagery as the reason for its being banned on the most popular PC storefronts, </span><span>but even as it takes the cross between humanity’s self-imposed religious chains and its animalistic nature to their horrifying extreme, </span><span>I didn’t find it particularly gratuitous. It was exaggerated, meant to be evocative, and in some scenes, comically amplified, but that felt in line with the game’s wider aesthetic choices.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>isn’t a good game, and its technical presentation is particularly agonizing. It literally made me sick with its stuttering, choppy jank; it’s pretty ugly, and nearly everything about it looks and feels like the work of a team still getting its feet wet in Unity. Still, I’m willing to buy that the ugliness could be a deliberate aesthetic, as the ugly nature of its story is perhaps best captured in a crude, gross-out paint job. When people talk in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, they get unsettling close-ups as their lips flap, broken up by silent-film-style caption cards. Santa Ragione wants this game to feel gross, and it’s not just in the subject matter.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"The game your mom was worried about."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Santa Ragione Game Studio  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Horror game in which you tend to a farm while shit gets crazy.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>It communicates what it's trying to get across pretty well.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Actually made me motion sick it was so jittery, ugly but in an artistic way, probably.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 2</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>~2 hours</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Every shot of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ run-down farm is framed to make it look like a place lacking any real heart, soul, or love. It is a small space built solely for utility, and since it’s not a farm designed for taking care of animals, everything about it is small, cramped, hastily built, and only stores the titular horses and tools with no consideration for comfort or care. The fact that the game is just ugly to look at only helps Santa Ragione convey that feeling of emotional desolation. I can practically smell the god-awful shit-and-blood-stained farm through my computer as the sound of flies buzzing echoes through my headphones.</span></p> <p><span>My feelings on </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>largely boil down to “yeah, that was probably what they were going for, and it’s delivered in a clear, concise, and effectively crude manner.” I get what </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is saying at any given moment, but I don’t find any of it particularly powerful. It’s striking, but is it </span><i><span>that </span></i><span>memorable? Is anything in this game that much more objectionable than your average Ari Aster film?</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651445">© <span>Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>There is one moment that has received </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/horses-the-most-controversial-game-of-the-year-doesnt-live-up-to-the-hype/"><span>a fair bit of criticism</span></a><span>: a scene in which the farmer forces one horse to sexually assault another so he can watch, pounding on his chastity belt as it happens. This is certainly one of the more horrific moments in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, and most of the game’s worst moments are rooted in sexual violence of some kind. Much like everything else in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, I don’t feel like I have a grand takeaway from this moment’s inclusion beyond it communicates exactly what it’s trying to. I do disagree with the criticism that </span><i><span>Horses’ </span></i><span>use of sexual violence is just another point on a shock value scoreboard, because when the game portrays these disgusting acts of violence, I see how they flow back into its themes of sexual distortion and the psychological effects the farmer’s experiences have had on him. But a tall, dividing fence stands between comprehension and appreciation for its meditations on the matter.</span></p> <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is fine. It’s not particularly trailblazing, but it knows what it’s trying to convey, and it uses a pretty concise visual metaphor to get it across. It is gross to look at, but I only really mind that when its jittery framerate makes me queasy. I don’t believe it is as distasteful as Epic or Steam does, and I still am surprised that something that feels mostly tame and along the lines of an A24 horror film has caused such controversy. If </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>didn’t expose anything we didn’t already know about the dangers of a sheltered, puritanical lifestyle, it at least unmasked Steam and Epic as cowardly companies that can’t be bothered to actually vet the work they’re barring from entry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you ask people to give you their junk in exchange for $5 coupons, they will happily do so. And if it’s GameStop asking they’ll apparently take it even farther, trying to pawn off sex toys, pets, and literal garbage in exchange for store credit that’s valid for other garbage <a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-starnger-things-bitty-bankrupt-2000642395">like FunkoPops</a>. The meme stock retailer’s “<a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-anything-taxidermy-store-credit-2000644850">Trade Anything Day</a>” led to viral stunts and some big headaches for the people who had to work during it.</p> <p>The rules precluded customers from bringing in stuff like hazardous chemicals, medications, and certain electronics like Meta Quest headsets, but encouraged them to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582">trade in</a> bizarre paraphernalia like taxidermy animals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, some people did exactly that. GameStop shared images over the weekend of what looked like <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997443240275161108">a stuffed bobcat</a> and a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997415848886362113">half-chewed goose</a>. But those weren’t the only random artifacts pawned at the gaming retailer on December 6.</p>

 <p>Other customers reportedly turned in a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997423749318979985">Netflix disc</a> for installing the streaming service on Wii, a gift-shop replica of the <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997434600021467220">Declaration of Independence</a>, and a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997384530324599051">plastic spoon</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pgbo5g/this_was_the_best_trade_anything_item_i_got_in/">Bizarre curios</a> that GameStop rejected included <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997478744215466157">someone’s Social Security card</a> and some guy’s dog. “They said no,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR9i_07DD5K/?igsh=MTdobmNraXNzNTdyNw%3D%3D">joked</a>&nbsp;Pokémon card loot box streamer Roaring Sensei. “Exclusions include dead or alive animals,” GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997412308713402623">explained</a> in response.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">*Exclusions include dead or alive animals (Taxidermy items are valid for trade). <a href="https://t.co/OnuKfRhlqR">https://t.co/OnuKfRhlqR</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1997412308713402623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But while the video game chain was clout chasing on social, employees in stores had to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-anything-day-rules-2000645098">manage the stunt’s awkward fallout</a>. “My trade in anything day didn’t start out bad: a few odd 3D printed items, shoes, etc., etc.,” one staffer, who said they were just hired back in September, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ph4gbi/my_trade_in_anything_day_experience/">wrote</a> on the GameStop subreddit. “I then have a man come in with a LARGE bin. filled with video games. he tells me ‘the video game store down the street told me i had too many for them so I came here.”</p>

 <p>The employee continued, “I’m not even kidding he had at LEAST a hundred games. and so I’m like ok I’m scanning the games opening them checking them out to make sure they’re correct and not scratched and…I open one…and inside is an INCREDIBLY graphic adult film disc.”</p>

 <p>Another apparent staffer said someone tried to trade in a dildo. “Had someone come to the store and they full on slapped it on the table,” they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg73c9/man_brings_dildo_into_store_for_trade_anything/">wrote</a>. “There were a lot of kids in the store and so I got upset and kicked him out. Well word got to my DM and apparently my RM is blaming my whole store and DM for crashing out and letting this happen.” Was the dildo used or new? They didn’t say.</p>

   <p>One customer drew a face on a leaf. GameStop declined <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pfstsq/i_tried_to_trade_in_my_friend_bobby_but_i_got/">that trade-in</a>. Another brought in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg7lhm/i_traded_in_a_piece_of_freaking_lint_for_5/">piece of lint</a>. GameStop did <em>not</em> decline that. “Absolutely bunkers,” the person wrote. “Lol.” Food items were also fair game as long as they weren’t immediately perishable. In fact, some stores said they were encouraging players to bring in canned goods that could easily be donated to local food drives for the holiday season. That resulted in everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pfzpnn/trade_in_anything_day/">Pokémon Campbell’s soup</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pgktxy/most_expensive_vienna_sausage/">Vienna Sausages</a>. Someone even got $5 store credit for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg6yai/trade_in_anything_day_success/">Tangy BBQ McDonald’s</a> sauce.</p>

 <p>But the best trade-in of all was a thank you note <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg80vs/trade_anything_day/">written on a Kirby Post-It</a>. “To the dudes @ GameStop, I hope your day has been well,” it read. “I’m sorry that they are trying to trade in garbage. That sucks and I hope no one in this area did that. I also hope you are doing well as people outside of GameStop. Stay sane and happy holidays.”</p> <p>“This is worth so much more then $5,” one staffer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg80vs/comment/nspqxs9/">wrote</a> in response. “Thank you.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Today, </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> is four years old, and that makes me very sad. An announcement shared today from the official </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> account on X was meant to be celebratory, but I found it depressing. How can you feel optimistic about </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> in 2025?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Four years of Infinite memories, Infinite friendships, Infinite fun 🎂</p> <p>Happy birthday, Halo Infinite! 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/7gxwl6ZVhH">pic.twitter.com/7gxwl6ZVhH</a></p> <p>— Halo (@Halo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Halo/status/1998044899262746815?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> is the most recent entry in the iconic Xbox franchise, and it was predictably hyped up before launch. Its open-world campaign offered a unique take on the franchise formula and seemed poised to crack open the </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> universe, with plans for it to be the central hub of new </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>content for years after its launch. But as its release date crept closer, the sixth mainline entry in the Master Chief saga strained under the pressure. A 2020 gameplay reveal </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinites-campaign-finally-re-revealed-and-its-lo-1847927849"><span>unintentionally created a meme factory,</span></a><span> and a month later, </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> was delayed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Halo Infinite </span></i><span>finally launched in December 2021 (though the multiplayer released a few weeks earlier), and did so without split-screen co-op and Forge, the series’ map creation suite. Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) never added the additional story content we were promised—instead, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1kzbpda/the_next_master_chief_novel_halo_edge_of_dawn/"><span>it’ll be neatly tied up in a book releasing next week</span></a><span>. I held out hope that </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span> would eventually become the massive Master Chief universe we were promised, but it never did.</span></p>

 <p><span>Just last month, it was announced that the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-no-more-updates-operation-halo-studios-xbox-2000642195"><span>studio would cease development</span></a><span> on the sci-fi shooter, shortly after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, a ground-up remake of the original game’s campaign</span></a><span>, was revealed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though there are, reportedly, other </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> games in development at Halo Studios, the current state of the franchise is a massive bummer. </span><i><span>Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, due out next year, may bring </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> to PS5 for the first time, and it may look damn good, but we all know it’s just a nostalgia retread of a 25-year-old game. It won’t include multiplayer, just the first game’s campaign and a few new missions. It will offer four-person co-op for the first time ever. But aside from </span><i><span>Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, there’s no news on what to expect next from Halo Studios.</span></p>

 <p><span>So we return to </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>, the most recent game in the franchise. Sadly, </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s open-world campaign is not worth a revisit, especially without couch co-op or a continuation of Master Chief’s story (</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-31/microsoft-studio-343-industries-undergoing-reorganization-of-halo-game-franchise"><span>the story DLC was confirmed canned back in 2023</span></a><span>). </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s multiplayer has that </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> special sauce—it feels great and can be a chaotic blast, but there just aren’t that many people playing anymore. So if you’re like me and only play a handful of modes, you’ll quickly find yourself stuck in a loop: the same few maps, the same few players. You can only get sniped across one of a few Big Team Battle maps by EliteLover6969 so many times before it grows old.</span></p>

 <p><span>Plus, Xbox’s recent refusal to condemn the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><span>White House’s use of </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> imagery</span></a><span> in its spate of racist propaganda further sours the taste in my mouth.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> is the franchise that shifted my gaming world, taking me from a casual gamer playing at her cousin’s house to a young woman buying an Xbox 360 and </span><i><span>Halo 3</span></i><span> on launch day so I could continue the story on my own. I hope it can find its footing once more, but on the fourth anniversary of </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span>, I’m mourning what could have been rather than celebrating what we got.</span></p>

            <guid>1376554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Play an in-game month with most of the gameplay systems in place.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Management sim Esports Manager 2026, from developer Neurona Games and publishing platform indie.io, just released a new demo on Steam that gives an in-depth look at the systems that will be present in the final game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you could probably guess from the name, the game puts you in the role of a manager of an esports organization and challenges you to lead it to victory. The demo focuses on the three key systems that define the gameplay: talent acquisition, management of staff and players, and match simulation.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-8230edeea63e7deee47edfa8b1f742ed03bc67de-1920x1080-1764973274573.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can create your own organization from scratch or take control of a real esports organization, like EternalFire, Copenhagen Wolves, M80, and GamerLegion, and additional teams will be added when the game fully releases. And with the Transfer Module, you can scout, buy, and sell players, including real-life players like <a href="https://x.com/neLendirekt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@neLendirekt</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/BanKsEsports" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@BanKsEsports</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/PiNGCasts" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@PiNGCasts</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/bit1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@bit1</u></a>, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has ratings in several different categories. Some define their technical gaming ability, like their skill with different weapon types or how clutch they are. Others define their personality, like leadership, amicability, and loyalty. And still others define their physical attributes, like eyesight, reaction time, and endurance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll be competing with other organizations for their services, negotiating contracts and building a roster that best aligns with your current goal. Timing and market conditions will affect these negotiations, so your strategy might need to change as circumstances do. And you’ll need to balance your income, expenses, and sponsorships to keep your organization from going bankrupt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-26db38347b8fcfd4dfc17bac991af74122c430ea-1920x1080-1764973296841.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve built your team, you can use the Talk Module to communicate directly with your players and staff members to manage their growth, morale, and relationships. You set training plans to improve players’ skills, but you also need to keep an eye on their well-being and how they’re feeling. You don’t want to overwork them or wear them down. You’ll also need to monitor how your players and staff members feel about each other and resolve any conflicts that might come up. It’s all part of the nitty gritty of running an organization; it’s not always sunshine and rainbows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it wouldn’t be an esports team without the actual esports. Using the Simulation Module, you’ll take the team you’ve built into tournaments, where you can watch it perform in semi-3D simulated matches. Will all your hard work pay off in a tournament win? Or will it be clear you need to develop your team more? There’s no way to know until you actually see them in action. And with the Tactic Creator, you can design and test strategies that you can use during simulations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These systems make up the core gameplay loop of Esports Manager 2026, and about 70% of the final systems are present in the demo. The demo doesn’t limit the real-life amount of time you can play it, but it is limited to one in-game month. That’s plenty of time to go through the full process of creating your manager profile, choosing a team, building your roster, communicating with players, signing up for a tournament, and going through simulated matches.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-56e08dc15e864c548deeb239ab7187ecf86fd4b7-1920x1080-1764973253420.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While most of the core gameplay is there, the developers have also made it clear that more is on the way. In particular, match simulations will be significantly expanded and more complex, with added options for tactical control and in-game events. And, of course, everything that’s present in the demo will be further balanced and polished between now and release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the full game, the demo is meant to be replayed to test out new strategies and experience more of what it has to offer. And it should give you a pretty accurate idea of the scope of the final game. The demo is available to download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749950/Esports_Manager_2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>on Steam</u></a> now, and if you want to get the latest updates, you can follow Esports Manager 2026 on <a href="https://x.com/EManagerGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Twitter</u></a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/esportsmanager" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord</u></a>.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/esports-manager-2026-drops-new-demo-on-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Game Awards airs this Thursday, December 11, but we now know that one of the big reveals will be related to Tomb Raider. This announcement was first revealed in Fortnite (yes, Fortnite) before the franchise’s <a href="https://x.com/tombraider/status/1998102351358669148">official X account</a> shared the news to a broader audience.</p><p>The announcement consists of a piece of art (posted above) that shows a silhouette of Lara Croft atop a pedestal bearing the words "Announcement December 11”. The Tomb Raider X account then posts the following message:</p><p>As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to&nbsp;@thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises @tombraider</p><p>While the announcement doesn't explicitly promise a new game reveal, it’s been known <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/04/05/crystal-dynamics-announces-new-tomb-raider-game-will-be-powered-by-unreal-engine-5">since 2022</a> that Crystal Dynamics, which has developed every mainline Tomb Raider game since 2006’s Tomb Raider: Legend, is working on a new entry in the series. At the time, the studio announced it was being developed in Unreal Engine 5, but little else is known about the project other than it will be published by Amazon Games (even after this division suffered <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/amazon-lays-off-more-than-14000-including-significant-role-reductions-across-its-gaming">mass layoffs in October</a>). The development of the game was reportedly also unaffected by the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-lays-off-an-unknown-number-of-staff">rounds of layoffs</a> that hit Crystal Dynamics in August.&nbsp;</p><p>The last mainline Tomb Raider game was 2018’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider/in-the-shadow-of-something-greater">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>. Since then, fans have been treated to two remastered collections of the first six games in the series: Tomb Raider I-III Remastered in 2024 and Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered earlier this year. Meanwhile, Season 2 of Netflix's <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em> animated series is set to premiere on December 11 – the same day as The Game Awards. Thursday is shaping up to be a big day for Lara Croft fans.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on The Game Awards, here's the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/17/here-are-the-nominees-for-the-game-awards-2025">full list of award nominations</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/08/the-future-of-tomb-raider-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> update! Get your The Alters update! Fresh, hot and ready to download, it's got some quality of life bits, some new features and base things like a "gamer's den", distressingly, a photo mode, and a number of other things. And now, for your pleasure, I will relay unto you in detail what these things are.
</p>
<p>
So, for starters there's a new relax mode. This isn't as fancy or in depth as it sounds, it's basically just an easier difficulty mode so you can get through the story without worrying about screwing anything up. A new save system has been introduced, which allows automatic saving upon exiting the game, alongside "crucial story moments."
</p>

<p>
There's also a whole entire card game found in the gamer's den, a new base section. Really can't tell you much about this one, it just appears briefly in the trailer for the update, so you'll have to venture in to figure out the rules for yourself. For those after some more narrative, there's a new sidestory where you have to solve a Noir-themed storyline specifically set in the gamer's den.
</p><p>
The photo mode looks like pretty much every other photo mode in the world, there's lots of filters, you can put the many Jans in different goofy poses, you know what this is already. Base customisation now allows you to change the skins of the various modules, all of which look quite ugly in the trailer to be honest. Lastly, you'll find a selection of new spacesuits so you can head out and explore "in style."
</p>
<p>
What is probably worth noting is that developer 11 bit studios did use generative AI "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">in a very limited manner</a>," so they say, in The Alters, in case you put the game down for this reason but couldn't remember why.

		<p>Never been in a situation where the heartbreak from yet another Bears loss to the Packers actually felt...good? Like, I know moral victories are what losers tell themselves to feel better at night, but honestly, the Packers are a Super Bowl contender and we took them all the way down to the final seconds and came up short.

            <title><![CDATA[Metroid Prime 4 On Switch 1 Impresses Digital Foundry - "Nigh-Imperceptible Dips"]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-on-switch-1-impresses-digital-foundry-nigh-imperceptible-dips</link>
            <guid>1376509</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We already know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is a technical showcase on Switch 2, and we're sure many of you have spent the weekend exploring Viewros on the new console over the weekend. But for those of you who are still clinging on to your Switch 1 and wondering whether Samus' brand new adventure holds up on the old system, fear not.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-how-much-of-a-downgrade-is-the-switch-1-experience">Digital Foundry has taken a look</a> at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Switch 1 release</a> of Metroid Prime 4 and is pretty much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">in agreement with us</a> on the surprising quality of the release. You can read their impressions on their shiny new website, or listen to the trio talk about the game on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG2xDC1ZjOc">week's DF Direct Weekly</a> (up top).</p>
<p>Leave it to Retro Studios, hey? The game has understandably taken a hit on Switch 1, as you'd expect, but Digital Foundry says "Our resolution and frame-rate analysis tools tell a positive story for one of Switch 1's prettiest games yet." That's high praise indeed, with much of the positivity from the team coming from just <em>what</em> the developers have managed to squeeze out of the old system.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fa8b9bf578d87"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond comparison Digital Foundry" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fa8b9bf578d87/metroid-prime-4-beyond-comparison-digital-foundry.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG2xDC1ZjOc">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Prime 4 on Switch 1 is the solid 60fps performance, which Digital Foundry feels confident enough to say"we classify this as a 'locked 60fps' game on all Switch consoles." The only drops the folks note are a handful in the open-world bike sections, and they're extremely few and far between.</p>
<p>Even though image quality takes a hit — pixel count is around "504p for geometry, 576p for Samus' visor", which is lower than 2023's Metroid Prime Remastered on Switch — there's a lot more going on here. While the pixels might be lower, the level-of-detail in the environment, shadows, and particular effects are "seemingly identical" to the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>So that cut in pixel count and visual smoothness is to allow Retro to still give the full experience to players on the older consoles. You'll be missing some detail and smoothness, and you'll have to put up with worse texture filtering, an apparent lack of anti-aliasing, and fuzzy, jagged edges and textures in places. But it's an impressive experience on the Switch 1, all the same.</p>

<p>Heck, we said so ourselves last week: "if you’re not looking to upgrade anytime soon and you’re keen to jump into Samus’ latest adventure, it's well worth picking up, as there's a fantastic game to be had."</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch 2 version is <em>the</em> version to get, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/one-of-the-best-looking-games-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-dives-into-metroid-prime-4">Digital Foundry were full of praise for that release</a>. You're getting a good game regardless of where you're playing it, essentially.</p>
