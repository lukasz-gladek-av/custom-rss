		<p>We love Warhammer 40,000 here at TSA. There’s been a cavalcade of brilliant Warhammer 40K games over the past couple of years, and the Gorkamorka-based Speed Freeks definitely sits amongst them, with its multiplayer proving to be an absolute blast. In honour of Warhammer Day, developer Caged Element and publisher Wired Productions have announced the arrival of the Deffkopta, a unique airborne vehicle that completely changes up the combat dynamic, while also bringing two new battlegrounds to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks Deffkopta Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/csOxDI0YpZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Firstly, this is a free update, which is the way all things should be, and secondly, if you haven’t hopped into Speed Freeks already, it’s currently on sale on Steam with 55% off. I really enjoyed it at launch, and on its way to an 8/10 I said, “Speed Freeks is a perfect example of how smaller, more focused, multiplayer titles can find a place in the swollen games market. It’s all the better for losing its free-to-play status, and it deserves to find a committed community of players. Here’s hoping that it’ll find its way to console, as I think it’s a great fit for pick up and play action, especially for people who want to play online, without having to devote their entire life and personality to gaining access to the next tier league or justifying a battle pass purchase.”</p>
<p>“This new vehicle really changes the dynamic of the game”, said Chris Mallinson, Game Director. “And although it’s so different, it fits right in and complements the rest of the vehicles we’ve got. We’re pumped to see how players will use it, because it’s a hell of a lot of fun to even just fly around”</p>
<p>The two New Maps Battle are built for maximum mayhem. The first is Scrap In Da Yard, a Kill Konvoy map featuring vertical combat and a trench requiring expert driving skills to navigate. The second is Deff Gorge, the existing Kill Konvoy map “Da Gorge” gets a visual overhaul and expands its borders into a Deff Rally map.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-unveils-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-includes-all-dlc-150-creation-club-content-and-it%E2%80%99s-also-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2.1333210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As part of Bethesda's <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5S63EJI5hmThAU6I8jaiQj/fallout-day-broadcast-2025-news">Fallout Day celebrations</a>, a new edition of Fallout 4 was unveiled: Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition, which includes all six official expansions, over 150 Creation Club items, making it the new definitive version of Fallout 4 across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S when it arrives on November 10, 2025. This new version is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2, though we'll have to wait a little longer to see it arrive, since that version is scheduled to release sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>This new version is also part of celebrating Fallout 4's ten-year anniversary, since it originally arrived on PS4, Xbox One, and PC on November 10, 2015. The Anniversary Edition's launch will also mark the arrival of Creations in Fallout 4, as it will feature an in-game Creations menu letting you download and find even more creations along with what's already included.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players who already own Fallout 4 or who have access to it through PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass will be able to upgrade to the Anniversary Edition through two upgrade options, though Bethesda didn't share more details on those options at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>Of course, this new version will also <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc-upgrade/">include the graphical upgrades we got in April 2024</a> for modern consoles, fully replacing the Game of the Year Edition as the new all-in-one definitive version to grab.</p>



<p>In other Fallout news, a physical anniversary bundle was announced for Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 76 is heading to Ohio in a new expansion that'll arrive on December 2, right in time for Season 2 of Amazon's Fallout adaptation.</p>

<p>Also, if you've never given the Fallout franchise a try, then this is certainly a good time to do so, since to go along with these new announcements, the games are all on sale on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation for a limited time.</p>



<p>This new edition of Fallout 4 is definitely nice to see as a way of celebration of the game's legacy, but it's yet another reminder of the fact that it's been a decade and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/">there's absolutely no sign of Fallout 5</a>. It might even be close to another decade by the time the game does come out, since as far as we know, Bethesda has <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-will-be-microsoft-exclusives-ftc-says/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> in the works ahead of Fallout 5.</p>



<p>By the time it enters full production and is out on what will likely be the next generation of consoles and PC hardware, it'll be interesting to see if it can live up to the expectations that will have built up after years of waiting.</p>

              <p>2015’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637"><em>Fallout 4</em></a> turns 10 years old this year, and to celebrate this anniversary, Bethesda is bringing the open-world RPG to Nintendo Switch 2…in 2026. Meanwhile, this new version of the game, <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em>, will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in November.</p> <p>On October 23, Bethesda held its second annual Fallout Day Broadcast, a Direct-like pre-recorded event announcing new <em>Fallout</em>-themed content and games. It happens on October 23 because that’s the day the bombs dropped in the post-apocalyptic video game series. This year, the event didn’t have too much to announce. The big “news” was the reveal of <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/N00XVTawnzBBH7HNwv0hN/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced"><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em></a>, a version of the RPG that combines the base game, all the DLC, and 150+ pieces of Creation Club content into one package. This version will also support Creations, Bethesda’s cross-platform mods system that already exists in <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>.&nbsp; This version of the game is coming to all the platforms<em> Fallout 4</em> was previously launched on, plus a new one: the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

   <p>“The definitive edition of <em>Fallout 4</em>&nbsp;is coming to&nbsp;Nintendo Switch 2,” posted Bethesda in a press release. “It’s been ten years since players first stepped out of Vault 111 and into the post-nuclear world. To mark the occasion, Bethesda Game Studios is thrilled to announce <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em>. This is the ultimate celebration of a beloved classic, bringing together the complete&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em> experience on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.”</p> <p>This is the first official, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(franchise)#Games">mainline <em>Fallout</em> video game to arrive on a Nintendo platform</a>.<em> Fallout Shelter</em> and<em> Fallout Pinball</em> were previously released on Switch, but those hardly count.<em> Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 is the first time the franchise has truly made the leap to Mario’s base of operations, and it makes me wonder if some other <em>Fallout</em> games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-fallout-games-3-4-5-76-bethesda-rpg-new-vegas-611408965/2">like <em>Fallout 3</em> or <em>New Vegas</em></a>, could arrive on Nintendo’s new console in the future. Surely if<em> Fallout 4</em> can run on Switch 2, the older games can, too. For now, though, <em>Fallout</em> fans looking to play the franchise on Switch 2 will have to be happy with<em> Fallout 4</em> when it arrives on Nintendo’s system sometime in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Datamine Reveals Battle Royale is to Release on October 28th]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-datamine-reveals-battle-royale-is-to-release-on-october-28th.1333198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A datamine for Battlefield 6 has revealed that the highly anticipated Battle Royale is currently set to launch on October 28th, 2025. The strings of code which have been posted online refer to a mode codename “Granite”, which Insidier Gaming can verify is the Battle Royale gamemode.</p>



<p>First leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>, who revealed that the mode will have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 28th release date</a>, he took to X (formerly Twitter) today to reveal that code within the game files also now confirms his past reports.</p>



<p>In a follow-up tweet, he posted the strings of code revealing that Granite, the codename for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale, is currently set to go live during the Season 1 release on October 28.</p>



<p>Of course, things are indeed subject to change, but ModernWarzone’s confidence, especially over the last couple of days around the date, tells us that he’s almost certainly not wrong. While Insider Gaming isn’t currently able to independently verify the news, it’s certainly looking like a shadowdrop of the mode is on the horizon.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Free to Play</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming first exclusively reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale</a> in February 2024, which we reported at the time that it was planned to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play experience</a>. At the time of writing, Battlefield Studios has only confirmed the game mode’s existence and hasn’t said when it will release or whether it will be free-to-play.</p>



<p>That said, we likely don’t have long to wait before hearing more.</p>

The cycle of day is ruled by humans, the night one by horrid creatures. Despite its efforts, humanity is annihilated with every arrival of the Night.</p><p>A group of humans, calling themselves ‘The Stalkers,’ discovered how to use the power of darkness to their advantage and fought the Night. However, it was not enough, and with every new dawn humanity rose again knowing that, with darkness, comes extinction.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Humanity found the ‘Seal of Night,’ an artifact that allowed them to stop the cycle in an everlasting day. In exchange for a blood oath that The Stalkers were willing to pay, the sun ruled for hundreds of generations and, for the first time, hope was a beacon of light. Yet fate proved unstoppable, and they paid the ultimate price.</p><p>Now, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of the traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity. She hunts in a race against destiny, as the shadows lengthen both in the world and in her mind.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Engage in Fast-Paced Dynamic Combat</strong> – Dash through enemies while you unleash your combos, use your weapons or destroy them with your dark powers. You can switch between melee and ranged attack in quick succession: slashing enemies with your sword and then dashing away to use your ranged weapons, avoiding enemy attacks.</li><li><strong>Face Intense Challenging Bosses</strong> – Endure the ultimate challenge as you fight the ancient <a title="Genres > Horror [736 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s of the Night that have been annihilating humanity over and over in intense boss battles.

Customize the upgrades of your arsenal and use the equipment that best suits your gameplay: Critical Damage, Life Steal, Poison, Close Combat, Firepower and more. Collect Sanguine vials, Crow Feathers, Moonstones and Noctilium to increase your stats and get ready to face the Night.</li><li><strong>Discover the Dark World of Medhram</strong> – Explore Medhram in a combination of <a title="Genres > Action [3,138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>–<a title="Genres > Adventure [2,642 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and dark fantasy lore. Survive huge dungeons full of traps, enemies, puzzles and challenges. Discover all kinds of locations, from ancient cathedrals and libraries of knowledge to lost kingdoms and devastated floating cities.</li><li><strong>Complete ‘Hunts’ as a Member of the Stalkers</strong> – Accept a hunt at ‘Crow’s Nest’ and track down the dark beast, find where it hides and hunt the most powerful creatures of the Night. After every completed hunt you will get rewards that will increase your health and dark energy bar.</li><li><strong>Follow <a title="Platforms > Quest [158 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>lines for Secondary Characters</strong> – Meet new characters and open full questlines that will vary depending on your actions: deciding to help them or not, finding them at their next location, failing to achieve the mission requirements in time… Everything counts!</li><li><strong>Play to Adapted and Immersive Music</strong> – Immersive and adapted music to every moment, boss and location, with the collaboration of Hiroki Kikuta, Secret of <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a> composer.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/hunt-the-night-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch-in-q1-2026]]></content:encoded>

<p>Top Ride is unique isometric racing mode that was in Kirby Air Ride. It's less of a full game mode and more of a minigame, but Sakurai explained it's been heavily expanded on for the sequel, including the addition of all the regular Air Ride abilities and items making their way onto the track now. Each race is short and sweet, giving players a quick option for playing Kirby Air Riders.&nbsp;</p><h3>Road Trip</h3>

<p>Road Trip is a brand new mode in Kirby Air Riders. Choose your rider and set off on a cross-country/world journey as you play through a series of stages and complete challenges along the way. On the trip, you'll select your objectives by moving from the left, middle, or right lane, and then you'll need to complete things like timed races and more. Modes like Top Ride and Air Ride will appear on your Road Trip journey, too, and you can purchase new items at on-the-road shops and heal up at roadside cafes along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>The story stars Kirby, of course, but King Dedede, Starman, Waddle Dee, and many others, too. In the world of Kirby Air Riders, everyone has the ability to ride these special vehicles that fell from the sky, but when the vehicles start acting strangely, a road trip is in order.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The direct teases images of someone who appears to be the main villain of the Road Trip story (see above), but we'll have to wait for the full game to learn more. Sakurai did reveal that we'll meet characters like Magman, Elline, Tortuilding, Twister, King Golem, and Computer Virus on the Road Trip, though, and each character changes how the journey goes in unique ways.&nbsp;</p><h3>Licenses and Online Interactivity&nbsp;</h3>

<p>At the start of your Kirby Air Riders adventure, you will make a license. This allows other players to identify you and see your Class and associated Global Win Power, which determines your class placement. The higher your Global Win Power, the higher your Class, and Class determines your skill level and the other players you'll race against in online modes. Air Ride, Top Ride, and City Trial will each have different classes.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also customize your license with unique cosmetics throughout your time playing Kirby Air Riders.&nbsp;</p><p>Kirby Air Riders will also feature an online area where you can interact with other players using emotes, hang out in a lobby, watch other matches on a large screen, listen to music via an in-game jukebox music player, and more.&nbsp;</p><h3>Copy Abilities</h3>

<p>In City Trial Team Battles, you will split into two teams of six, and legendary parts collected for the Dragoon and the Hydra are shared within the team.

In this mode, you can freely drive around Skyah with no time limit. Plus, there's an underground parking lot that has every machine lined up for your use, and you can even use the pause menu to have any vehicle delivered to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Transform Star is a brand-new machine that combines a flying star with a bike star form, and with it, you can Quick Spin to shift between the two.&nbsp;</p><p>Other machines include the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Formula Star:</strong> If you can maintain momentum and avoid slowing down, it can reach the highest top speeds.</li><li><strong>Hop Star: </strong>Each time you use a Quick Spin, it jumps.</li><li><strong>Jet Star: </strong>Accelerates quickly when lifting off the ground.</li><li><strong>Wheelie's Scooter: </strong>A stylish minibike with high maneuverability.</li><li><strong>Bull Tank: </strong>A bulky tank with thick plates of armor; it charges forward without worrying about taking damage.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Like Kirby Air Ride, Riders will not talk in Kirby Air Riders, but when your machine is destroyed, it does let out a wail. Sakurai says the game's voice work comes from announcers in various selectable languages, both male and female.&nbsp;</p><h2>Stadium &nbsp;Collection</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Button Rush: </strong>Ride over buttons and battle for control of the area.</li><li><strong>High Jump: </strong>Tilt the left stick down and jump as high as you can.</li><li><strong>Big Battle: </strong>Grow huge and do your best to dominate the battle.</li><li><strong>Oval Circuit: </strong>Race around the closed circuit.</li><li><strong>Rail Panic: </strong>Navigate the grind rails to take the lead.</li><li><strong>Beam Gauntlet: </strong>Slip past the harmful lasers and reach the end.</li><li><strong>VS.

<p>Sakurai says Kirby Air Riders features an expansive Checklist filled with objectives to complete in the game's variety of modes. Each time you complete an objective on the Checklist, you'll receive rewards and flip over squares in a large puzzle that will one day reveal an image. After completing an objective, adjacent squares will reveal the objectives you need to complete to flip them over, making it easy to target tasks and complete the image.</p><p>The Checklist can be found in the game's <strong>Main Menu</strong>, which Sakurai detailed while discussing other new things like the <strong>Miles Shop</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the <strong>Miles Shop</strong>, you can spend the Miles you collect from playing Kirby Air Riders' various modes. In the shop, you can buy new vehicles, accessories, and more, but there's nothing you can buy to improve a machine's performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you progress through the game's solo and online modes, you'll earn <strong>Gummies </strong>for rivals you defeat. Each rival you place higher than yields a Gummy of the machine they used in that race, and these Gummies are added to your collection, where you can view them all and interact with them in a separate menu using a special Kirby cursor.&nbsp;</p><p>To round out the <strong>Main Menu </strong>discussion, Sakurai showcased the game's <strong>Music Player</strong>. Kirby Air Ride composer Shogo Sakai has returned to compose Kirby Air Riders, this time alongside Noriyuki Iwadare, who has worked on the Super Smash Bros. series and Kid Icarus: Uprising. You can change the likelihood of songs appearing in City Trial, and even listen to unique alternate versions of every track in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Sakurai says the Kirby Air Riders music will be coming to the Nintendo Music app one day, too.&nbsp;</p><h3>Headwear and Specials</h3>

			<p>On the surface, Fading Serenades is a game about delivering packages on a tiny island, managing your inventory, getting to know the inhabitants, and living a quiet life. Underneath that, though, is a story about a sinister world away from the island, with constant surveillance and the threat of the Fade. The island has its own secret too, lost for years after the resident scientist disappeared.</p>

<p>Fading Serenades tells the story of Callum and his robot pal Par, who’s not just a companion but a required piece of equipment that all people from the mainland are expected to carry with them at all times. However, on Clifford Island the technology from the mainland doesn’t quite work as it should, so there is some more freedom there. It is a refuge that few go to and the only inhabitants left are a few older people living out their lives farming, fishing, fixing things, and taking life at a slower pace. </p>


<p>They have some contact with the mainland, but mostly they send packages to each other. &nbsp;The story hints at a lot of big things happening in the wider world, but the ending does not quite land as it should because there is a bit of vagueness and loose threads.</p>


<p>As the courier, you are responsible for picking up and delivering packages to the island’s inhabitants, fitting them into your backpack. Packages are different shapes and sizes so it isn’t easy to carry everything at once, though you can upgrade the capacity of the backpack. Going from point A to B means clearing obstacles like climbing walls, jumping across rocks and walking along logs to cross streams. There are minigames where you either have to press the correct buttons or balance yourself, which is impacted by the weight of the items in your bag. </p>
<p>They are simple games but add a nice little distraction and a bit of risk. Fail and you’ll fall, which can damage the items you are carrying. The inhabitants also have missions for you too, which all boil down to finding things and bringing them. The thing is that the items start repeating quite quickly, and each character just has the one additional collection mission which repeats. For example, Baron asks for two logs every couple of days. Logs that can be found in the same place each time.</p>

<p>In addition to couriering, there are a couple of other things to do on the island namely finding and lighting the shrines. These shrines improve your stamina. You can also buy pamphlets that reduce the time to traverse between areas. This is important because each day has a time limit to complete jobs. Once it passes 10pm, you need to be in bed otherwise you will pass out somewhere and be taken to bed. If you get to bed in time, you’ll wake up at 6am but if you pass out on the island you’ll not wake up until 9am, reducing your time in the next day. </p>
<p>Fading Serenades is a chill game to play, even with the daily time limit, because there are no major consequences and you can complete the story in a little over four hours. It has a nice pixel aesthetic too which looks very bright and colourful. Music is also important in Fading Serenades, and the songs in each area sound good too.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Fading Serenades is a nice, chill courier game on a nice little island where life is pretty laid back. But there are hints of something more sinister that the story explores in a bit of detail, but not enough. The game can get repetitive quite quickly, but it looks and sounds good.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that Fallout 76 is <strong>finally </strong>getting a native version of the game in 2026, with a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X &amp; S version being released in a few months. This announcement came amid the news that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-getting-anniversary-edition-november/">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> <strong>and </strong>a Switch 2 version are also incoming.</p>



<p>Not much information was given away, but this is something that Fallout 76 fans have been wanting for a very long time. What’s next on the list is crossplay, but we doubt that it’ll ever come.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76-current-gen-upgrade-coming">Fallout 76 Current-Gen Upgrade Coming</h2>



<p>During the Fallout Day broadcast, Bill LaCoste, lead producer, revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Early next year, a native version of Fallout 76 will be coming to Xbox Series S and X and PlayStation 5. This update will take full advantage of their hardware capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout 76 is the most up-to-date Fallout game on the market, taking the form of an open-world MMORPG that took the rulebook tied to Fallout and threw it clean out the window in 2018. It has since become the cash cow of the series, and Bethesda Game Studios has kept the game pumped full of updates.</p>



<p>It’s easy to assume what will arrive with the current-gen upgrade of Fallout 76, of course.</p>



<p>We can envision higher base resolutions, a higher frame rate (60 FPS upgrade, most likely), cleaner textures, and faster loading times. That’s usually the run-of-the-mill stuff associated with current-gen upgrades, and Fallout 76 on <strong>consoles </strong>has long needed them.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the current-gen version of Fallout 76 being released? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Switch 2 users will have to wait until 2026 for that. However, the Switch 2 version will support cross-platform progression through Ubisoft Connect.</p><p>"We are delighted to bring Assassin's Creed Shadows to Nintendo players," game director Charles Benoit said in a statement. "Whether slipping through the shadows as Naoe or facing foes head-on as Yasuke, players will be able to roam the streets and rooftops of feudal Japan at home or anywhere their journey takes them on Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>An update released for Shadows in September added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-adds-what-we-all-wanted-a-cat-dressed-like-ezio/1100-6534658/" data-ref-id="1100-6534658">a cat dressed like Enzio</a>, one of the fan-favorite characters in the Assassin's Creed franchise.

<p>New features also get a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As we approach the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, The Pokémon Company has lifted the lid on a brand new expansion that will be arriving in the app next week.</p>
<p>The "Mega Rising' expansion bursts onto the scene one week today, on <strong>30th October</strong>, and, as the name suggests, it'll bring a Mega Evolution twist to proceedings. Mega Gyarados, Mega Blaziken and Mega Altaria take to the covers of this new set, and all users will receive one of each on launch day <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>That's to celebrate the app's one-year anniversary, for which TPC has announced new Special Missions, and reissued Special Drop and Wonder Pick events. The "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announces-new-and-updated-features-for-first-anniversary">New and Updated</a>" app features that were teased earlier this month will also arrive on 30th October, so keep an eye out for improved Wonder Picks, a new share feature, and an expanded number of tradable cards.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at some of the chase cards from the new expansion:</p>


<p>While this writer wishes the new releases would slow down a little, we can't imagine that it'll happen any time soon. The Pokémon Company today announced that the app has surpassed 150 million downloads in its first year, which is a <em>crazy</em> number when you think about it. Expect the new expansions to keep on rolling out, we guess.</p>

              <p>It certainly looks like it’s going to be a joke. When you create an extraction shooter, but then theme it around cartoon ducks and give it a spoof name based on one of the most popular examples of the genre, it’s hard not to assume <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/"><em>Escape from Duckov</em></a> is just a goof. But I’m here to tell you, nope, this is a solid and astonishingly compelling PvE looter-shooter that deserves every one of its million sales.</p> <p>I’m not a big extraction shooter guy. (These are first- or third-person games that are generally about entering a battlefield and attempting to harvest as much loot and progress as you can, then extracting yourself before either a timer runs out or you get killed.) This high risk/high reward model tends to feel too stressful to me, and never more so than when it’s all about surviving the attacks of an enemy team of real, human players. It’s like a roguelite but with other people laughing at you, and where loss not only means you don’t keep anything you found, but also anything you arrived with. However, it turns out all I needed was for it to be about ducks.</p>

  <p>Inspired by&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em> (the lead developer of the five-person Chinese team behind the game told me he’s an avid, hardcore player), but utterly dissimilar in so many important ways, <em>Escape from Duckov</em> strips the formula down to something that feels far more approachable, although just as ruthless. The game is entirely PvE, and played in single-player, but those web-footed CPU enemies aren’t even vaguely friendly. You’re going to die a <em>lot</em>. But importantly, you’re not going to mind nearly as much.</p>

 <p>The game begins with the most delightful character creator, in which you build yourself a duck avatar with a lot more variety than you might imagine that concept could offer. The wide, blank, pupil-less eyes were irresistible to me, but I could have chosen anything from buttons to metallic binocular-like protrusions. You can have regular cartoon duck legs, or the utter abomination that is human feet. And given this is an offline premium game with no mercenary in-game purchases, you can change up your look any time you want. You then arrive in your bunker, a large, mostly empty space, but for your little bedroom off the side. Down here is Jeff, your duck companion who will show you the ropes, set you quests, and guide you through the process of building out your base.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638622"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638622">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To do this, you’re going to need loot, and to get that, you’re going to have to go outside. So originally armed with nothing but a pointy stick, you need to start making tentative ventures into the green and pleasant realm above. It’s just it’s populated by furious birds (and wolves) holding powerful weapons, all determined for unexplained reasons to kill you on sight.</p>

 <p><em>Escape from Duckov</em>‘s greatest trick is just how well it’s designed around welcoming you in. Those early trips can certainly be tricky, but you’ll very quickly be armed (winged?) with a revolver, shooting down opponents (into really quite horrendously gibby goop), and scooping up all the loot from their amusing cooked-carcass remains. You’ll then do all that extraction shooter goodness, like sneaking into abandoned buildings and emptying the cupboards, daring to head a little further each time. The key point is, the game very carefully doesn’t overwhelm you at first, but subtly ramps up those earliest areas once you’re ready to cope. You’re motivated by those early quests, like finding a flat-head screwdriver to fix the local radio tower, but also by that far more powerful drive: revenge. If a group of ducks took you down last time, well, first you’ll want to return to that spot because you’ve got one chance to recover everything you died carrying, but you’ll also want to wipe the smiles off their beaks right away.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638627"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638627">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And then the loop has its webbed claws into you. Soon you’ll be adding new stations to your base, letting you craft better health items, weapons, and various other elements essential for crafting the next thing on the compelling list. And each of those stations have upgrade paths themselves. Friendly ducks you meet will end up moving in to run some stations, such as a gym or a weapon-modification store, each with their own quests to give you. Everything you add adds more, becomes another to-do list of improvements to loot for, and drives you to be ever-more brave on your expeditions.</p>

 <p>Holding you back are two elements: nighttime and the Storm. The former is fairly easily dealt with: you can either brave the far more dangerous world, or just go to bed and wait for morning. The latter happens every few hundred in-game hours, and at first just makes the outside world inaccessible for a while (it’s a good chance to get busywork done, or you can just sleep past it). But only at first, because of course this too is an opportunity for progression as you start to seek out a means to survive the purple mists.</p> <p>That’s the core of why&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> is so great, and so successful: it just keeps expanding its scope as you increase your ability to survive, and this loop is so wonderfully compulsive. Of course, this also means that the risk inherent in your run grows so much more, as you head off in your best suit of armor and carrying your finest guns, only to get walloped a few feet from a previously undiscovered extraction point. Then you have to decide, do I risk the exact same super-dangerous run again to recover it all, but this time—you know—without all the equipment you’re trying to rescue? Or do you give it up as heartbreakingly lost, shake it off, and rebuild? (The latter, by the way, is generally the smarter option. I always pick the former.)</p> <figure id="attachment_2000638626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638626"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638626">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So for as silly as it looks, and as daftly as it’s named, this isn’t a goof. This is a fantastic and superbly crafted game that continuously draws you further in like falling down a spiral. There’s a really good reason it’s already sold a million copies in its first week since launch. Extraordinarily, for a single-player game, it’s currently the fifth-most played game on Steam, ahead of even&nbsp;<em>Rust</em> and&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>, peaking at over a quarter of a million simultaneous players just yesterday. It also has an extraordinary 96-percent positive rating on Steam from nearly 15,000 reviews.</p> <p>And yes, it has me completely hooked. I’m writing this so late in my day because I didn’t want to stop playing and get on with my job. I’m going right back to it now that I’m done. And it’s hard to give a game more credit than that.</p>

<p>During the Fallout Day Showcase, Bethesda Game Studios unveiled a <strong>new trailer for Fallout 4</strong>, ten years after it hit the market in 2015. The trailer, which was kind of better than anything published before the game came out, revealed that an ANNIVERSARY EDITION is coming to the market on November 10.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition of Fallout 4 will come with all expansions, plus Creations is being added to the game, bringing a whole host of curated expansions, mods, and other upgrades and changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced-by-bethesda">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Announced by Bethesda</h2>



<p>Today’s Fallout Day bonanza included a stunning announcement: Fallout 4 is coming back with an Anniversary Edition. It has been ten years since the best-selling title dropped, and it’s still one of the most popular Fallout experiences ever made.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition comes with all DLCs and expansions released for the game in the years that followed the launch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>



<li>Far Harbor</li>



<li>Automatron</li>



<li>Nuka-World</li>



<li>Contraptions Workshop</li>



<li>Wasteland Workshop</li>



<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>
</ul>



<p>More than 150 Creations will be added to Fallout 4 via the Anniversary Edition, and Bethesda also revealed that the game will feature <strong>unreleased items</strong>, just to keep things feeling fresh. These items will be discoverable through a new menu, added in an upcoming update to Fallout 4 – you won’t need the Anniversary Edition to obtain this content.</p>

                <p>A new advertisement from Razer is making the rounds on TikTok and proving, yet again, that old-fashioned sexism in gaming is alive and well. Though meant to help promote the tech company's noise cancelling headphones, the ad instead reinforces the stereotype that women--who make up <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">48% of all gamers</a>, by the way--simply can't stop talking.</p><p>Accompanied by the caption "Don't let yapping get in the way of your winning," <a href="https://v45.tiktokcdn-us.com/089da21650d5c53cd0ece9bdffdedac2/68fd05f3/video/tos/useast8/tos-useast8-ve-0068c002-tx2/oEix9o0qfABiQjBlEpAbswEAGiRgfmoBCViIE6/?a=1233&amp;bti=ODszNWYuMDE6&amp;ch=0&amp;cr=3&amp;dr=0&amp;lr=all&amp;cd=0%7C0%7C0%7C&amp;cv=1&amp;br=1858&amp;bt=929&amp;cs=0&amp;ds=3&amp;ft=4KLxRMzm8Zmo0TugXI4jVXOeQpWrKsd.&amp;mime_type=video_mp4&amp;qs=0&amp;rc=M2c5ZjQ8OWg3Omg3aTw7ZUBpMzVyO2s5cmx5NTMzaTczNEBhMi1hXzIwXjExMzFgMzM2YSNxMmxsMmRzYGFhLS1kMTJzcw%3D%3D&amp;vvpl=1&amp;l=202510231716183F8AFA4B6A9D6205A3D7&amp;btag=e000bd000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the ad</a> (first noticed by PC Gamer) depicts a man and woman sitting on a couch together. The man, both holding a controller and wearing a headset, awkwardly shuffles as the woman emphatically speaks to him. After a few moments, he decides to activate the headset's Active Noise Cancellation feature. The woman's voice is drowned out, while the text on the video reads: "Active Noise Cancellation: On, Drama: Off." As of October 23, the advertisement is still up on TikTok.</p><p>Considering Razer's history of making <a href="https://www.razer.com/pc/gaming-headsets-and-audio/kraken-kitty-line?srsltid=AfmBOorPF5lRBMw9zdVmy9cmMGcbxDiM02bQkIhk8yRN4bujxcZAvGeP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cute accessories geared towards female audiences</a>, the advertisement comes as a bit of a shock. Though the ad might not be intentionally sexist, it plays into long-standing gender roles and is extremely dismissive towards the large population of women who also play video games. Coincidentally, a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent study</a> by the Entertainment Software Association found there is a "nearly equal gender split" among video game players.</p><p>The response to the ad has been primarily negative, with users writing comments like "welp guess I'm done with razer after 15 years," "I just put my razer headphones in the bin," and "the casual misogyny is INSANE" in response. Per PC Gamer, TikTok users are also taking to other Razer videos to express their discontent, with the top comment on an ad for the company's Razer Kuromi headset reading, "razer's sexist btw."</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Razer for comment.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has finally shown a bit more of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, though apparently by accident. Two 15-second commercials for the Switch 2 were found, both unlisted on the Nintendo of America YouTube channel, and one includes a brief glimpse of a boss fight that we haven't seen before. Those hypersensitive to spoilers should turn away.</p><p>Both unlisted videos, uploaded on October 15, are titled "Power Up Your Holidays," with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MZEWTy9xpk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first video</a> showcasing the previously seen plant-like boss Carvex. But more noteworthy is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second video</a>, which emphasizes the Switch 2 version's use of mouse controls and 120fps support, while also giving us our first look at a boss called Xelios. And this boss is spherical!</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grtEt0Cudt8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/grtEt0Cudt8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We only see it for a few seconds, but Xelios appears to be composed of several hexagonal plates that can shift around, with a green sac and pink core at its center. Presumably, you as Samus Aran will have to blast that pink center to hell whenever this sphere-like boss exposes it.</p><p>With only slivers of information to go on, there aren't too many conclusions about the story and events of Metroid Prime 4 we can make, but the existence of Xelios confirms a couple of trends.</p><p>First, there's a clear naming indication with these bosses, with the early-game enemy Aberax (as seen in the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W9xes7BZto?si=4oERcI-JJq88Ev7d&amp;t=683" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Treehouse stream</a>) and the aforementioned Carvex and Xelios. They, along with the main villain Sylux, all have the letter X in their names, not unlike the members of Organization XIII in Kingdom Hearts. Don't expect any crazy crossover, though.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0yz3tTS0xPU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, footage of the Aberax fight shows the enemy being possessed by a Metroid before it attacks Samus, gaining new abilities and green sacs and pink nuclei similar to those of Metroids. It's possible that the other bosses we've seen are also fused with Metroids. Whatever the case is, it looks like Metroid Prime 4 is heavily emphasizing the "Metroid" part of the title.</p><p>Both commercial videos are still unlisted, but they indicate that Nintendo is priming (pun intended) the game for holiday-season marketing of the Switch 2. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-coming-this-december/1100-6534699/" data-ref-id="1100-6534699">out just in time for the holidays</a> on December 4, but fans eager to digest anything Metroid-related can look forward to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-1-3-trilogy-visual-retrospective-book-preorder-metroid-prime-4-beyond-release/1100-6528042/" data-ref-id="1100-6528042">Metroid Prime 1-3 visual retrospective book</a> this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the desperate arguments for AI is that it will help people be creative without all the practice and hard work that goes into actually creating something–that, as science fiction writer Ted Chiang wrote at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/why-ai-isnt-going-to-make-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New Yorker</a> last year, “art can be all inspiration and no perspiration.” A world where whatever enters your head can be immediately externalized is already one of the best reasons for deleting all your social media accounts, but lately we’ve seen politicians use generative AI to show us the unfettered horrors of their brains, and completely remove the wall between them, their cruelty, and the rest of us.</p><p>Donald Trump is of course a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/13/ai-is-opening-a-maga-trump-split-00534925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan</a>, creating AI videos that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/trump-racist-deepfake-video-jeffries-schumer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mock Democratic leaders</a> and, after last weekend’s No Kings protests, depict him <a href="https://www.404media.co/trump-no-kings-ai-poop-jet-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumping shit</a> on protestors from a fighter jet. Vice President JD Vance called the Democrat videos “funny” and told reporters they would stop if Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries did what Republicans wanted; <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5563504-speaker-johnson-trump-no-kings-ai-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaker Mike Johnson</a> called the plane shit video “satire” and praised Trump for using “social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that.”</p><p>Lately, NYC mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo has gotten into the AI game, saying during the first of NYC’s two mayoral debates last week that one his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/22/nx-s1-5581418/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takeaways</a> from his rout in the primary was that he “did not do enough on social media” compared to his opponent and front runner <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a>. On October 1 he released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkCgSirfbjc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially AI video</a> of himself doing jobs he doesn’t actually do, like window washer and stage hand. This week, he released an utterly bizarre AI-generated smear ad against Mamdani, a riff on <em>Austin Powers’</em> Mini-Me that compares Mamdani to former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. “There’s no such thing as talent; socialism means we’re all equally dumb!” a squeaky-voiced rendering of Mamdani cheers, while fake de Blasio looks everywhere but at the viewer as if even he knows how dumb this is.</p><p>This ad is off-putting and desperate and dated, but at least its contents just feel like an off-putting and desperate and dated political ad from Cuomo, a man who is himself all of those things. The same can’t be said of another AI video reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/cuomo-zohran-mamdani-ai-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded and then deleted</a> by the official Cuomo Twitter account during last night’s debate. Shared by Zeteo reporter Prem Thakker, the over two minute video shows various AI-rendered people identifying themselves as “criminals for Zohran” and celebrating the idea that he’ll make their crimes–which include shoplifting, drunk driving, and domestic abuse–legal.&nbsp;</p><p>The video starts with an AI-generated Mamdani frollicking through NYC’s streets and eating rice with his hands, and then continues to be awful: a guy who looks a lot like Idris Elba puts on a medical mask and keffiyeh before shoplifting from a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24025691/shoplifting-scare-criminal-justice-reform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pharmacy</a>; a cliche 1970s movie pimp stands before a windowless van full of presumably sex-trafficked women. In a nod to equality, I guess, white people are also portrayed as criminals, with an old lady driving around drinking out of a paper bag before crashing her car, and a scene where a woman with a name tag that says “social worker” encourages a man it’s suggested is beating his wife to take deep breaths to “kumbaya the situation.” “Globalize the intifada,” one of Cuomo’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-takeaways" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite phrases</a> to hurl against Mamdani, makes an appearance as pro-Palestinian protestors burn an American flag. Because it’s AI, several of these offensive, NYC scaremongering stereotypes become different people through the course of the ad; the old lady, the pimp, and Idris Elba all look younger at points. But even if AI can’t even give us consistent characters to follow along on their crime sprees, the essential message comes through: New York is full of bad guys, and if Mamdani becomes mayor, those bad guys will burn the city to the ground, as seen in the last shot of the video.</p><p>This would be an appalling ad even if it featured real actors and locations, but I suppose you could argue it would have created some local jobs and thus contributed to the economy Cuomo wants his hands on. But as AI, with all the technology’s wobbles and flaws and weird lighting, it lays bare exactly <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how stupid</a> Cuomo thinks voters are–that we are so weak and terrified that we would take this message seriously no matter the grubby package it comes in. This isn’t a surprise coming from the angry, self-righteous man we’ve seen on the campaign trail, one whose supporters considered trying to freak us out with an altered image of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/nyregion/cuomo-mamdani-debate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamdani with a thicker beard</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We already know this about AI, that its boosters think we will guzzle <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/762594/fable-showrunner-edwatch-saatchi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any slop they feed us</a> simply because <em>they</em> are the ones feeding it to us. But these AI posts reveal less about the general population’s tastes and insecurities than they do the people making them. With AI providing a direct route from Trump and Cuomo’s brains to our screens, we get an unrestricted tour through their heads. They can show us exactly how angry and afraid they are, without even an actor to try to put a spin on it or a local street corner we can recognize. It’s the kind of stuff you could imagine them dumping out in a therapy session with Cuomo’s fake social worker: <em>I am scared everyone is out to get me, I would like to take a big wet crap on people who are mean to me</em>. Fake de Blasio can’t look us in the eye because AI doesn’t understand eye contact, but it also gives Cuomo’s gross fantasy a sense of shame, like some part of him knows these are not the kinds of thoughts you should shout out in public, like he knows these are not the kinds of emotions that should rule a person’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a sort of intimacy here that could almost be humanizing. The vulnerability in art made by humans can help us understand why people do the bad things they do, but stripped of craft or the self-reflection required to <em>make</em> something, the videos show them as not just vicious but also lazy, like even expressing their deepest insecurities isn’t worth their own time. AI gives us <em>too much</em> intimacy with these men. It gives them the uncut ability not just to externalize their crap in the limited words of Twitter and Truth Social, where a reader would then have to translate it into their own imagination, but in sound and color and the wavering facsimile of humans, the way they must experience their fantasies when they close their eyes and indulge them. They can show us, effortlessly, exactly what they see in their heads, without anything to get between us and their thoughts. We can live in their brains with all the vivid, inescapable impact that they want to bring to bear on the real world. </p><p>Using AI isn’t just a quick way for them to make their videos. It’s another expression of the power they have, and what they’ve turned power into: not just the freedom to shape laws or economics to their desires, but the freedom to be easily and unreservedly their worst selves at all times and make the rest of us live with it. This is in line with the whole AI industry, which is getting<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-big-tech-is-force-feeding-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> forced into our lives</a> whether we want it or not. AI has long stopped being about human welfare or whatever <a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lofty bullshit</a> its creators once claimed to believe, and more about keeping its own <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/longcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive con</a> running at all costs. Men like Trump and Cuomo, as hollow and clumsy and selfish as the things AI spits out, are right at home in it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers"><h3>Beefed Up TwitchCon Security Couldn’t Stop The Internet’s Issues From Spilling Over Into Real Life</h3></a><p>A high-profile assault and toxic IRL streamers have forced the Twitch community to reckon with deeper-seated problems</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival"><h3>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way</h3></a><p>Criterion president Peter Becker reflects on how Closet Picks evolved from a spontaneous idea into a beloved ritual among cinephiles for its 40th anniversary roadshow celebration.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots"><h3>Why Are My Bluesky Bots So Into Irish</h3></a><p>If I have to have uncomfortable social interactions, they should at least be with real people</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ai-trump-cuomo]]></content:encoded>

Darn, that is a <em>packed</em> first week of the last month of 2025, isn't it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Rumours have</a> been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-assassins-creed-shadows-on-switch-2-may-clash-with-metroid-prime-4">swirling about</a> this one for a few weeks now, but the announcement confirms a couple of rather lovely features. It'll cost <strong>USD</strong> <strong>$59.99</strong> and will be available on the eShop or as a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>First up, cross-progression is available as long as you have an Ubisoft Connect account! So if you've been playing on another console up until now and want to swap to the hybrid system for the holiday season, you won't lose your progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, here's something we didn't expect: touchscreen support. All the in-game menus will allow you to use the touchscreen when playing in handheld mode. That includes the world map, too.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX/assassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update">a blog post</a>, Ubisoft has also detailed Title Updates 10 and 11 for the game. Those updates will be available on the Switch 2 version from release, and these bring Corrupted Castles, parkour updates, new free story updates, and new environmental puzzles. Note that the Claws of Awaji expansion won't be available until early 2026.</p>
<p>For those who missed it earlier in the year, Assassin's Creed Shadows launched on other consoles on 20th March 2025. Taking the series to Feudal Japan, you play as both the shinobi Naoe or the samurai Yasuke, both of whom play very differently. Naoe feels like your more traditional series protagonist, focusing on stealthy gameplay, while Yasuke is much more direct in combat.</p>
<p>Our sister site Push Square were fans upon its original release, awarding the game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows">an 8/10</a>, concluding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Assassin's Creed Shadows is unlikely to win over those who struggled to push through Odyssey or Valhalla, this is still one of the strongest overall entries in the series — and arguably the best of the open world RPG bunch."</p>
