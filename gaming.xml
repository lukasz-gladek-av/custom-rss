            <p>Let the runes of protection blaze upon the vestments of the machine spirit; let psalm pervade circuitry and obliterate the Enemy’s designs; let fire and catechism fall upon the creeping ruin of Abominable Intelligence. Brothers! The hour of motion is at hand. Games Workshop have banned their employees from using generative AI tools to create or design Warhammer stuff, because their senior management don’t consider the technology very “exciting”. Their CEO also seems irked about software companies shoving generative AI into every new device or system update, whether it’s desired or not. The tech-priests are coming for your candy ass, ChatGPT!</p>
<p>That said, they don’t appear to be prohibiting the usage of generative AI by partners, including game developers, and they will allow senior staff “to continue to be inquisitive about the technology”, which I am tempted to read as a sop to investors driven stir-crazy by NVIDIA’s share price. Omnissiah be… somewhat enthused? Relatively undisappointed?</p>
<p>As you’d expect, Games Workshop’s stance reflects concerns about the company’s art being appropriated and used for generative AI ‘training’. I’m sure they’re also worried about a backlash from Warhammer’s massive community of miniature painters and other external creatives (recently, poster marketplace Displate <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">got it in the neck</a> over AI "red flags" in a Warhammer 40,000 artwork). Speaking during the company’s <a href="https://images.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/7lRczzQBbvA22PEmSVJN8K/2de2f722e20e1d69b9aa3ed4e1b95678/2025-26_half_year_report_v3.pdf">latest financial earnings report</a> yesterday, Games Workshop chief executive Kevin Rountree shared the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>A very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it. We do have a few senior managers that are: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not. </p>
<p>We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio - hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, all this seemingly just applies to Games Workshop itself, for the moment, but it’s sure to have ripple effects among Warhammer videogame developers such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a> studio Owlcat, who revealed back in 2024 that they were <a href="https://x.com/OwlcatGames/status/1763946679470788722?s=20">using generative AI</a> "for additional work with concepts and speeding up some internal processes". Games Workshop are historically pretty zealous about how their designs and setting are recreated by third parties.</p><p>While there are plenty of generative AI evangelists on the shop, including a few big cheeses at EA, Ubisoft and most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-director-goes-all-in-on-ai-as-south-koreas-games-industry-looks-to-compete-on-the-global-stage">Stellar Blade developers Shift-Up</a>, there is also a mounting tide of resistance to generative AI adoption. Recently, Running With Scissors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/publisher-reveals-and-immediately-cancels-new-postal-game-after-fans-accuse-it-of-using-ai-generation">cancelled a whole game</a> over suspicions of generative AI usage in a trailer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publishers Hooded Horse have banned generative AI art from their games, and Baldur’s Gate 3 developers Larian have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">partly walked back</a> their own implementations of the tech in the forthcoming Divinity.</p>

            <p>Regardless of whether you've laid hands on the plastic contours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, you’ve probably seen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Steam Deck Verified programme</a> in action: badges of honour (or of 'Unsupported' disgrace) on a game’s Steam store page, reflecting how well it runs and plays on the portable PC per Valve’s in-house testing. The programme is being expanded to include the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> too, and is set to bestow a lot more games with Steam Machine Verified status, given what a Valve designer calls "fewer restraints" in their judging criteria.</p>
<p>Lawrence Yang – who’s worked on the new Machine, the Deck, and the also-incoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> – told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve">Game Developer</a> that it’ll be easier for a game to achieve a coveted green checkmark sticker with its SteamOS mini-PC, and that Valve will "be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback" for its new verification checks as the Steam Deck’s. Even if, especially in the case of the Frame VR headset, different requisites will apply. This <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-own-any-steam-deck-verified-games-then-youve-already-got-a-guarantee-theyll-work-on-the-steam-machine">follows a Valve blog post</a> that put things in simpler terms: if a game is Steam Deck Verified, it'll be Steam Machine Verified too.</p>
<p>Rather than a lowering of standards, for the Steam Machine specifically, it’s pretty obvious that “lifting constraints” simply reflects differences in the hardware’s power and use cases versus the handheld Steam Deck. Yang didn’t specify details, but it’s easy to guess which criteria from the Deck Verified programme weren't as urgently applicable: for instance, some only score a 'Playable' badge instead of full Verified status because they include small text that’s harder to read on the 7in, 800p screen. The Steam Machine intends to hook up to TVs and desktop monitors, so that’s probably not worth including in the new device’s rulebook.</p>

<p>Considering the shared use of SteamOS, other touchstones will definitely remain, like whether a game can display the correct gamepad button glyphs (Valve would very much like you to play the Steam Machine with their revamped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>) or whether it needs occasional keyboard input. Valve will be testing for performance too, though since the Steam Machine is significantly beefier in the graphical muscles than the Deck, it’d naturally win more Playable and Verified statuses here anyway.</p><p>This is all good news for players and developers alike – the former get more at-a-glance transparency on which games in their library will work, and the latter (as Game Developer points out) a handy marketing tool. It’s a shame, then, that the Steam Deck itself has become mired in uncertainty since its reveal late last year, the ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">component shortages</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">price rises</a> raising questions around the Gabecube’s affordability and lack of a concrete release date beyond "early 2026".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new court filing, the Former Activision Blizzard CEO stated that Call of Duty’s performance fell by 60% compared to 2024 due to games like Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>New developments have started popping up in the Delaware lawsuit against Microsoft, Activision, and other board members, including Kotick. The former CEO has already claimed that this lawsuit was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kotick-says-activision-lawsuit-was-meant-to-help-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed to benefit the Embracer Group</a> at Activision’s expense. Additionally, he has spoken about Call of Duty’s performance visibly declining since his departure.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-s-performance-affected-by-battlefield-6-defeats-ftc-s-argument-about-lack-of-competition">Call of Duty’s Performance Affected by Battlefield 6, Defeats FTC’s Argument About Lack of Competition</h2>



<p><span>A report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group" target="_blank">GameFile</a></span>&nbsp;indicates that Kotick has acknowledged that Microsoft has benefited from the Activision Blizzard deal. However, he noted that the recent performance of the company has fallen “well below” their long-term targets. Kotick specifically addressed the performance of Call of Duty, mentioning that it is projected to perform over 60 percent below last year’s figures due to intense competition from titles such as Battlefield.</p>



<p>Kotick also points out that this fall effectively undermines the FTC’s argument regarding a “lack of competition in the first-person action game category” due to the acquisition. For those unaware, the FTC was attempting to block the deal, arguing that it would diminish competition in both the console and cloud markets, ultimately harming consumers by leading to higher prices and reduced innovation in the gaming industry.</p>







<p>In other news, EA has announced that the start of Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC Season 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been delayed</a>. Additionally, Activision has released&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-releases-new-black-ops-7-patch-with-weapons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patch</a>&nbsp;for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 that updates several weapons.

<p>A notable addition here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-january">which is also set to arrive on Xbox Game Pass on 20th January</a>. "Capcom's follow-up to its first-person Resi reinvention is a fantastic horror romp - for its first half, at least." reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horror">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Village review</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> is another good'un, in my humble opinion. But, don't just take my word for it. Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin was also rather taken with it on its release, awarding it four out of five stars. "Violent stakes once again meet zany shenanigans in Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the series' much-improved second RPG," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Eurogamer's Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth review</a>.</p>
<p>Should this leak prove accurate, the above games will be joining the likes of Need for Speed Unbound, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> and Core Keeper, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-january">which were added for all PS Plus members earlier this month</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> might be the online shooters of the moment, but that doesn't mean other recent hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> have gone under. In fact, NetEase's take on the property remains a strong alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> which has received tonnes of love since its late 2024 debut. Now, Deadpool is almost here, and his gameplay trailer packs a punch.</p>
<p>The 'Merc with a Mouth' was finally confirmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DY9eYEx6KQ">during last month's Game Awards</a>, after plenty of leaks and datamines. Marvel Rivals has been expanding at a much better pace than the aforementioned Blizzard-developed hero shooter ever did, typically dropping two heroes (or villains) per season into the roster, alongside new maps and modes. Traditionally, each hero has a single strict role (tank, DPS, or healer) as per the subgenre's conventions. However, Deadpool, much like in the comics and movies, writes his own rules… literally. You can check out Deadpool's trailer below.</p>

<p>Video games including Wade Wilson have acknowledged his fourth-wall-breaking abilities through dialogue and maybe a handful of zanier comic book moments. Gameplay-wise, he has always been represented as a goofy mercenary (who won't shut up) with access to lots of blades and guns. I mean, on a basic level, that's who he is. The Marvel Rivals team has taken the character's kit to the next level though.</p><p>My first impression is Wade could be a nightmare to properly balance after he arrives on 16th February. He can effortlessly swap between the Vanguard (tank), Duelist (DPS), and Strategist (healer) roles, and each kit comes with plenty of abilities that dish out incredible amounts of damage and notable buffs for his allies.</p>
<p>When NetEase first teased he'd be a flexible character, I certainly wasn't expecting him to whip out a comic book in the middle of a match and choose who he wants to be <em>inside </em>the game. That's the most Deadpool thing ever though.</p>
<p>Other highlights in the trailer include Deadpool taking selfies, his enemies being beaten up by comic book drawings on their screens, and a stylish MVP screen which also breaks the traditional boundaries of the game. I think it's safe to say this is the best adaptation of the character we've seen in a video game so far, and the fact it's all part of a fast-paced online shooter only makes it even more impressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w">Season 6 of Marvel Rivals</a> (dubbed 'Night at the Museum') also kicks off this Friday, 16th January, and on top of Deadpool's arrival, players are hoping for matchmaking improvements and more quality of life fixes and tweaks. While the hero shooter remains healthy and is carried by cross-play across all platforms, its player numbers on Steam have steadily gone down due to a bigger focus on skins and seasonal content over keeping the game tidy and welcoming.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> last year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p>

            <p>A first round of hotfixes has arrived for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, following the Minecrafty sandboxer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-out-now-and-its-devs-are-advising-those-suffering-download-issues-or-errors-to-keep-plugging-away">arrival in early access</a> form yesterday. Developers Hypixel have also offered some insight into which aspects of it they're planning to prioritise working on in the coming months.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving right into <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-13-january-2026">the note</a>s for this initial round of hotfixing, you'll naturally find a number of the "most critical" initial teething issues folks reported running into upon firing the game up for the first time. For example, you'll now get a warning if your computer's time is out of date, since this had caused some "authentication issues", with the launcher login process as a whole hopefully now less likely to serve you such errors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to setting up servers, Hypixel have added a message letting you know whether authentication is required after your server boots up and made sure you'll be automatically switched into offline mode if your online session runs into a hiccup which invalidates it. A number of crash causes have also been ironed out, including some caused by simply using buckets - that fix will require you to destroy and replace any workbenches which now aren't working as intended. Picking certain hair styles before doing your eyebrows in the character creator is another of these potential returners-to-desktop which have been dealt with.</p>
<p>Alongside delivering this round of initial fixes, as part of <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here">a longer post</a> celebrating Hytale's early access launch, Hypixel have offered a bit of insight into what you can expect them to be doing in the near future:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the first few months, we intend to deliver updates quickly and frequently, as there is still a large backlog of obvious construction sites we need to tackle before we can move into larger, more bespoke updates and patch cadences. The work on the official minigames will begin in the coming months, enabling us to create new systems and features that expand gameplay and provide wider access to 3rd-party servers.</p>
<p>As a side note, we already have prototypes of social features, such as friend lists and proximity voice chat, in development. Our roadmap isn't completely pre-planned, as we are expecting feedback within the next weeks and months from actual Hytale players, experiencing the game for the first time!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're planning on giving Hytale a go this week, we've got handy guides to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-play-multiplayer-dedicated-server-hosting">setting up a server</a> to play with your mates, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-show-coordinates">finding out where you're at</a> in the world, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">setting up for a session</a> on the Steam Deck.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new court filing from the Former Activision Blizzard CEO claims that the Delaware lawsuit was designed to benefit Embracer Group; however, Embracer has denied these allegations.  </p>



<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameFile</a>, the Delaware lawsuit was initiated by the Swedish pension fund Sjunde AP-Fonden, commonly known as AP7. This fund has accused the former CEO of accelerating the acquisition process in order to overshadow the sexual misconduct scandals that were emerging against the company in late 2021. The lawsuit against Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and various board members, including Bobby Kotick, has now been met with a response from the former CEO.</p>











<p>The former CEO of Activision Blizzard stated that “this Delaware lawsuit was apparently aimed to help pave the way for Embracer to increase its foothold in the California market at the expense of Activision.” Kotick’s response added that this situation made it more difficult for Activision to attract new talent and hindered its ability to expand through mergers and acquisitions, a strategy it has historically relied on for growth. </p>



<p>The Embracer Group has denied the claims made by the former Activision Blizzard CEO, stating that “perhaps difficult to accept for Mr. Kotick, but we did not and do not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision.” </p>







<p>In other news, Activision has released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-releases-new-black-ops-7-patch-with-weapons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patch</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 that updates several weapons.

		<p>Mutliverse has announced that it is delaying the launch of its colony builder and FPS roguelite hybrid PAX Autocratica by a month to address performance, stability, and balancing issues that have been raised. Initially, PAX Autocratica was going to launch on February 2nd into early access, but now it will launch on March 4th instead.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pax Autocratica - Official Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9bREKlyMq4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement the dev team at Multiverse said, <em>“After review by the Supreme Council, a directive has been issued regarding the deployment of Pax Autocratica. <wbr>The Early Access launch has been rescheduled to March 4, 2026. This decision was not made lightly. Recent internal evaluations and field reports have identified several areas that require further refinement before the State is ready to open Early Access operations. <wbr>These include:<wbr><wbr><wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Core balancing adjustments<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Stability and performance improvements<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Initial onboarding and tutorial refinement</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>In addition, we have received a significant number of Quality of Life requests that we intend to address Our objective remains unchanged: <wbr>to launch Early Access with a build that is stable and fully enjoyable.”</em></p>
<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>

<p>The FPS side will see you face off against these enemies of the state through small skirmishes to big battles that will involve mechs, tanks, and infantry. There will be hundreds of different of different buffs that will shape how these expeditions will play out. The studio has also previously confirmed AI has been used to generate some portraits and icons in Pax Autocratica, but is looking to remove all of them before the game is launched and replaced with the work of the game’s artists.</p>
<p>Multiverse has previously made a statement about donations to the Norwegian Refugee Council saying,<em>&nbsp;“1% of all net revenue from Pax Autocratica will be donated to support people forced too flee violence in conflict areas through the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a politically neutral humanitarian organization assisting civilians affected by war, displacement, and oppression.”</em></p>

		<p>Embark has released a new update for ARC Raiders, and while update 1.11.0 is not a big one it does come off the back of a big milestone. Embark has confirmed that since launch ARC Raiders has had 12 million players, and that everyone who has logged into the game since launch up to January 13th would be gifted a gilded pickaxe raider tool. The update itself addresses a key card exploit so players can no longer keep them after use, and balancing changes to a couple of weapons. There is also the launch of the Abyss cosmetic set.</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Trailer | ARC Raiders" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpeJjQDXNAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>ARC Raiders update 1.11.0 patch notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kettle – <wbr>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favours using 3rd party software.</li>
<li>Trigger ‘Nade – Dev note: Trigger ‘Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favour picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li>
<li><wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.<wbr></li>
<li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">ARC Raiders Review</a></h2>
<p>In our ARC Raiders review, Tuffcub said, <em>“ARC Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/</link>
            <guid>1405444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hytale</strong>, the <strong>Minecraft-like MMO</strong> that was recently revived by its original creator (who <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the rights back from Riot Games</a></strong>), is now <strong>finally out in early access</strong>. The game can be purchased <a href="https://store.hytale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the official website</a> (not <strong>Steam</strong>, although Hypixel said Hytale could launch on Valve's platform at a later date) with three options available to customers:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Standard - $24.39</strong>, includes the Voyager, Savanna, and Forest Guardian cosmetic sets (with the Forest Guardian Cape)</li>



<li><strong>Supporter - $42.69</strong>, includes all the above plus the Featherbound, Scavenger, and Arctic Scout sets, each with their capes, as well as the Knight Cape and Explorer Goggles.</li>



<li><strong>Cursebreaker - $85.39</strong>, includes all the above plus 4 additional cosmetic sets (Hope of Gaia, Void Hero, Pop Star, Voidbearer) and 2 additional exclusive capes (Royal Emmissary, New Beginning).</li>
</ul>



<p>Without the open data that would have been available via Steam, it's hard to say how the launch is going. There was a rumor that <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, the game's creator, had shared that over 2.8 million users were in the game, but that rumor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qc1q18/comment/nzi3dj9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has since been largely disproven</a>, on account of anyone being able to join servers with any name when the game launched (this issue has already been patched). Still, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011179217329795221">via his official X account</a>, Collins-Laflamme did share that the Hypixel team was seeing a 'VERY HIGH rate of new Hytale players', which temporarily caused login issues that should now be resolved. Furthermore, just two days ago, he had noted that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-saved-says-hypixel-founder-studios-dev-costs-next-two-years-funded-by-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio's next two years of work had already been funded based merely on pre-order sales</a></strong>.</p>



<p>In just eight weeks, the development team took a build that was over four years old, merged hundreds of branches, and fixed core systems (camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, audio, and rendering), while also squashing thousands of bugs. Even so, Hypixel warns that this is a true early access release: unpolished and still lacking a lot of stuff. What's in the game, anyway?</p>



<p><strong>Exploration Mode</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>An infinite, procedurally generated world with beautiful biomes, ancient structures, friendly creatures, and dangerous monsters</li>



<li>Explore, build a home, grow crops, craft items and equipment, play with friends</li>



<li>Discover the Forgotten Temple and uncover the first elements of the&nbsp;<strong>Cursebreaker story arc</strong>&nbsp;(to unfold in future updates)</li>



<li><strong>Mantling feature</strong>&nbsp;for greater freedom and control in navigating the world</li>



<li><strong>Unified progression and crafting system</strong>&nbsp;with expandable inventories, upgradable workbenches that interact with storage, and specialized crafting stations for hundreds of block and decoration types</li>



<li><strong>Ancient Gateway</strong>: Craft and place at your home to venture into temporary worlds called&nbsp;<strong>Fragments of Orbis</strong>&nbsp;(eventually offering timed adventures from low-intensity exploration to difficult combat and loot extraction)</li>



<li><strong>Memories system</strong>: Collect memories by exploring and interacting with creatures and factions, then return them to The Heart of Orbis for permanent world rewards and upgrades</li>



<li><strong>High mobility combat</strong>&nbsp;with diverse weapons featuring unique abilities</li>



<li><strong>Farming system</strong>&nbsp;with various crops and plants convertible into food and potions</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Creative Mode</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>In-game and standalone tools for building and creativity</li>



<li>Features include block rotation, previews, and connected block textures</li>



<li>Specialized entity tools for creators</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Modding Support (Day 1)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Extensive modding capabilities with asset pack management, assets editor, worldgen editors</li>



<li>Partnerships with Blockbench and CurseForge for Day 1 modding support</li>



<li>Tools for big projects and long-term content creation</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of that, Hytale already offers multiplayer support in all modes. As for what's next, the upcoming Adventure Mode will introduce rich story and narrative elements, deeper progression systems, dungeons with boss fights, and more. Hypixel will also soon start working on the official Minigames, and more social features, such as friends lists and guilds, are on the way. Lastly, the World Gen V2, featuring the complete, restored world of Orbis, is also a long-term goal.</p>



<p>Hytale will eventually launch on consoles as well, while Hypixel is still evaluating the feasibility of a mobile version. Did you jump into this nifty blocky game world yet? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>Hazelight's outspoken studio founder Josef Fares believes EA has been painted to be the villain much more than other companies, stating: "There's not a publisher in the world that hasn't fucked up now and then."</p>
<p>Fares through his studio Hazelight has partnered with EA for all three of its games: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-way-out">A Way Out</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. Now, the director has said if Hazelight didn't have a good relationship with EA, then it quite simply would not work with the publisher any more.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of great people at EA," Fares said in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>. "They know how we work. They respect it and they leave us be." He added he feels "EA is getting more shit than they deserve", remarking that "everybody's done something that's not good", namechecking Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony.</p>
<p>"But for some reason, EA has become this bad guy," the Hazelight head continued. "For us, it's a super good collaboration. I'm very open about [it]. If it was bad, I would've said that in this interview as well. But we have a great relationship."</p><p>Fares again reiterated this is not to say EA hasn't made its own share of mistakes, just like the rest of us. "All the people I am surrounded with at EA are gamers," Fares said. "They love games. It's not like I'm sitting with corporate people with suits. It's not like that."</p>
<p>Closing this train of thought, Fares stated in no uncertain terms: "And people should not worry, because Hazelight will do always what it wants."</p>
<p>But, why is it EA appears to be being 'villainised' at the moment? Well, at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal">EA shareholders approved</a> the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law"> proposed $55bn acquisition</a> of the video game giant by Saudi Arabia and private equity firms. Should the acquisition go through, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">would leave EA 93.4 percent owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, a government wealth fund used to build infrastructure, attract businesses to Saudi Arabia, and more.</p>
<p>This has left a bad taste in the mouth of many due to the country's notoriously poor human rights record, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators">resulted in public outcry and petitions from video game unions</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">human rights groups</a>. Over the weekend, EA said to its community that "the values of The Sims are unchanged", after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-creators-quit-ea-partnerships-amid-buyout-concerns">multiple high profile The Sims content creators "removed themselves" from the company's Creator Network</a>.</p>

<p>As for Hazelight, its most recent release Split Fiction was met with wide praise on its debut last year. "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">reads our five star review</a>.</p><p>In the first 48 hours of release, Split Fiction sold an impressive 1m units. By the end of its first week, the studio announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction had sold another 1m units</a>. Not simply content with these figures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">the game subsequently broke three world records</a>, becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Split Fiction film adaptation starring Sydney Sweeney was also announced to be in the works last year</a>, with Jon M Chu of Wicked fame set to direct.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Traveller’s Refrain is a game that will make you feel sleepy. I don’t mean to suggest the game is boring, far from it. Rather, this isometric Zelda-like has a meditative thoughtful vibe that brings on a state of mindful chill that could, just could, make you briefly close your eyes. For a few minutes. Just make sure you’ve got your little wrist holders on to avoid any unnecessary damage to your Switch when you nod off.</p>
<p><iframe title="Traveler's Refrain - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXhR--g3f9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Traveller is a rather mysterious fellow with a lovely, well-trimmed beard. Awaking in a dream-like forest, with memories of past traumatic events clearly haunting him, our surprisingly trendy hero must journey on a quest of discovery, learning more about himself and this world he now inhabits in the process. </p>


<p>If this all sounds a little navel-gazing for you don’t worry, developer Red Essence Games smartly follow the show-don’t-tell model, getting out of the players’ way for the most part and keeping dialogue brief. As such, you pick up on the melancholic mindful elements in brief breaks between all the action, rather than being subsumed in sadness by never-ending dialogue.</p>
<p>Exploration and puzzling are where Traveller’s Refrain excels. Puzzles are basic but satisfying, demanding you find and light all the beacons, as an early example. It’s nothing you haven’t solved before, but these puzzles are well delivered. Even better, there are some fascinatingly fresh characters to encounter, many unlike anything I’ve encountered before in an RPG. </p>


<p>Visually distinctive, meeting new NPCs is the real drive behind your journeying. It also helps that everything looks sumptuous too, the hard-drawn cartoon aesthetic is brimming with details, and full of flair, creating a distinctive game world to explore. No mean feat when your game is set in a forest, likely the most done to death setting in all of video gamedom. That and ice levels, I guess.</p>
<p>Combat is reminiscent of a calmer version of Hades. Traveller can dodge dash with the best of them, nimbly avoiding flailing stone golems, sentient giant blobs of gloop and enormous plumes of flames. Armed with numerous close combat weapons over the course of this sixteen-hour adventure, the risk-reward of Traveller’s Refrain’s combat is clear, the player must get in close to dish out damage, before rapidly escaping enemy reprisal. </p>
<p>That’s not the only weapon at Traveller’s disposal, as he can also strum out a tune or two on his guitar. Basically, his wizard book, spells are summoned by flicks of the thumb stick in different directions. The player has to remember these, rather then being constantly prompted, though you can remind yourself of the inputs in Traveller’s song book. As such, there’s a delightful sense of risk as Traveller stands still to strum his guitar in the middle of a bunch of foes in a desperate attempt to heal himself. Get it wrong and it’s game over, get those inputs right, and you have a chance.</p>

<p>It’s exciting stuff, with hordes of enemies on-screen at anyone time. Though this isn’t without its problems, as Traveller may be fast and smooth in his movements, but the frame rate on Switch 1 certainly isn’t. In handheld mode, the game is almost unplayable at times. Even when there’s no onscreen fireworks, and Traveller is simply running back and forth, the frame rate chugs along like a particularly decrepit diesel train. Docked is better, of course, but the frame rate still struggles far more often than it should. Which is a real shame, as there’s some great Zelda-akin puzzling and exploration to be had here.</p>

<figure data-uuid="75edb9732b962"><a title="Inazuma Eleven" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75edb9732b962/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>After many years of waiting, fans of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven</a> series were beginning to question if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> would ever see the light of day. Fortunately, Level-5 dug deep and was able to <em>finally</em> release the title on the Switch and Switch 2 in November last year.</p>
<p>It's already getting some updates (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/inazuma-eleven-victory-roads-second-major-free-update-kicks-off-this-month">with more to come</a>), but that's not all - with the Level-5 president and CEO Akihiro Hino mentioning how he's already started writing the scenario for a "sequel" to Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road. Yep, you read that correctly! We've even got a little detail about it.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067iujrvm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's the rundown from the latest <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/level-5-president-akihiro-hino-has-begun-writing-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sequel">Ina-Dai broadcast via Gematsu</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Akihiro Hino:</strong> “As for the sequel to Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, I have already started writing the scenario. As a ‘new Inazuma Eleven‘ that begins in the Reiwa era, I will do my best to deliver surprise and excitement to everyone once again. Please look forward to future announcements.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source also notes how "despite its recent release, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road was announced in July 2016-during the Heisei era. The Reiwa era began on May 1, 2019".</p>
<p>It's worth noting how the Level-5 CEO previously mentioned how a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-final-trailers-ending-theme-song-music-video-and-latest-details">"potential sequel" would support</a> the "Player Bank" data from this current release. Of course, this "sequel" could still be years out, and it isn't exactly uncommon for developers within the games industry to jump straight into the next title like this (or even have some sort of overlap between projects).</p>
<p>Still, we're <em>almost</em> exhausted just hearing this, as it took so long for Victory Road to arrive on the Switch - with multiple name changes and revisions along the way (with the latest one taking place in 2022), and the game also launching on the Switch 2 in the end.</p>
<p>For now, fans of the current release (<em>that's Victory Road</em>) can look forward to the second major free update, which will roll out on <strong>28th January 2026</strong>. You can find out a little more about this in our previous story here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>According to a report from IGN, Ubisoft "expects 55 jobs" to be impacted at the Swedish Studios Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm following a voluntary leave program in fall 2025 that apparently fell short of its target.</p>
<p>Massive is known for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/division_2">The Division</a> and Ubisoft Stockholm has been working on an <a href="https://stockholm.ubisoft.com/">unannounced (and new) IP</a> as well as cloud computing technology.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6EOKFq0qA_o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6EOKFq0qA_o" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60cf74nsqwpl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the lengthy statement from Ubisoft, highlighting these studio restructuring measures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ubisoft:</strong> Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructure that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm.</p>
<p>This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.</p>
<p>These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.</p>
<p>The long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged, and we will continue to serve as the global home and lead for to The Division franchise, move forward with an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup, and play a central role in the development of Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect inline with local regulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Development on The Division series is still expected to continue "as a matter of priority", and as noted, the "long-term direction" for both of these studios "remains unchanged".</p>
<p>The Malmö-based developer Massive also happens to be behind the Snowdrop engine, which powered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - a game released on Switch 2 last year.</p>

Since this is the High on Life franchise we're talking about here, the visor has the following text printed on the front: "I PRE-ORDERED HIGH ON LIFE 2."</p><p>Preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 and PS5 physical editions from GameStop include an exclusive steelbook case while supplies last. The steelbook's artwork mirrors the standard game box's cover. If you preorder online, you will need to print your order confirmation page and visit a GameStop in your area to pick it up on launch day--if it's available, that is. GameStop's freebies typically disappear fast.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5436" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] High on Life 2 + High on Life" data-collection="" title="[Various] High on Life 2 + High on Life">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GGDYYH1V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0GGDYYH1V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GGDYYH1V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">High on Life 2 (Switch 2)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GGDYYH1V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0GGDYYH1V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GGDYYH1V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases April 20</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of High on Life 2 is a Game-Key Card edition, which means you'll need to download the full game before playing for the first time. This also means it's likely to consume a decent chunk of storage space. For reference, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the first game is just over 30GB--and the sequel will likely be larger.</p><p>We'll update this story when High on Life 2's file size is confirmed. In the meantime, if you don't yet own a microSD Express, check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Express-microSDXC-Nintendo-AM/dp/B0FT99KCV8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung P9 256GB microSD Express</a> for $35 (was $55) to double your storage space for cheap.</p><p>Performance benchmarks haven't been revealed yet, but the original High on Life is quite good on Switch 2. It features higher resolutions, better and more consistent frame rates, crisper textures, better lighting, and more welcome features.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4NJDJQW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0G4NJDJQW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4NJDJQW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">High on Life 2 (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4NJDJQW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0G4NJDJQW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4NJDJQW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases April 20</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>High on Life 2 for PS5 is available to preorder at multiple major retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4NJDJQW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=High+On+Life+2+Nintendo+Switch+2+Edition+Revealed+-+Where+To+Preorder+Now&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2026-01-13+22%3A07%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2026-01-13+22%3A07%3A59&amp;fnarticle_id=6537381&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F614286%2F10014%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fproduct%252Fhigh-on-life-2-for-playstation-5-playstation-5%252FJ3K48LK9PP%26partnerpropertyid%3D1423009&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhigh-on-life-2-nintendo-switch-2-ps5-preorder-guide-physical-editions-bonuses-release-date%2F1100-6537381%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=High+On+Life+2+Nintendo+Switch+2+Edition+Revealed+-+Where+To+Preorder+Now&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2026-01-13+22%3A07%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2026-01-13+22%3A07%3A59&amp;fnarticle_id=6537381&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhigh-on-life-2-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-95094024&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhigh-on-life-2-nintendo-switch-2-ps5-preorder-guide-physical-editions-bonuses-release-date%2F1100-6537381%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=High+On+Life+2+Nintendo+Switch+2+Edition+Revealed+-+Where+To+Preorder+Now&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2026-01-13+22%3A07%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2026-01-13+22%3A07%3A59&amp;fnarticle_id=6537381&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fhigh-on-life-2---playstation-5%2F437132&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhigh-on-life-2-nintendo-switch-2-ps5-preorder-guide-physical-editions-bonuses-release-date%2F1100-6537381%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.</p><p>The initial batch of physical copies for PS5 were sold directly from Limited Run Games until October 2025.

As such, anyone who is interested in owning a physical copy of High on Life for Switch should secure a preorder from Amazon ahead of its January 23 retail launch.</p><p>High on Life's physical edition includes the base game and the High on Knife paid DLC. You can claim the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/high-on-life-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">High on Life Switch 2 Upgrade Pack</a> for free on the eShop. The upgrade targets 1080p resolution at 30fps in docked mode and improves practically all areas of the game from a visual perspective. It also adds support for Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, which is a neat perk.</p><p>If you're willing to wait, however, the first numbered Limited Run Games release for Switch 2 is High on Life. And unlike the sequel, the full game will be on the card. The downside is that preorders don't open until February 1, and LRG currently estimates a July-September shipping window.</p><p>For Switch 2 owners, however, there is a downside to the free upgrade path. As previously noted, High on Life's Switch 2 edition is 30.5GB. Meanwhile, the original Switch version is only 9.7GB. So even though the Upgrade Pack is 3MB, you'll need to download approximately 21GB of data. The Switch physical edition is effectively partial Game-Key Card for Switch 2 players.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-icons-lord-of-the-rings-balrog-book-nook-building-set-best-deal/1100-6537313/">Lego Lord Of The Rings Book Nook Gets First Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arrow-video-4k-blu-ray-movies-50-percent-off-at-amazon/1100-6537233/">Save 50% On New Limited-Edition 4K Blu-Rays At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-4k-blu-ray-sale-january-2026-3-for-33-new-movie-deal/1100-6537208/">Recently Released 4K Blu-Rays Are 3 For $33 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-magic-the-gathering-set-preorder-restock-guide/1100-6535373/">TMNT Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Preorders Steeply Discounted</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-sonic-the-hedgehog-building-sets-crossworlds-cars/1100-6536549/">Budget-Friendly Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Lego Sets Are Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-harry-potter-sorcerers-stone-25th-anniversary-series-collectors-edition/1100-6537154/">Lego Harry Potter 25th Anniversary Sets Have Arrived, Including A New Collector's Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-bb-8-astromech-droid-75452-new-release-2026/1100-6537153/">New Lego Star Wars BB-8 Droid Building Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Double Nintendo Switch 2 Console Storage For Only $33 With Samsung MicroSD Express Deal</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<figure data-uuid="d9aa83d04068b"><a title="It Takes Two" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9aa83d04068b/it-takes-two.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA, Hazelight Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Electronic Arts has been in the headlines for all sorts of reasons over the years, but Hazelight Studios founder and director Josef Fares (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2021/01/josef_fares_blasts_xbox_series_naming_convention_as_a_total_fking_mess?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">who is known for expressing his honest opinion</a>) can't help but feel the third-party video game giant is still "getting more s**t" than it deserves.</p>
<p>His team's award-winning games (including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a> and more recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>) have been backed by EA and during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/i-dont-see-ai-taking-over-split-fiction-director-josef-fares-on-the-rise-of-ai">same interview</a> with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">Christopher Dring at The Game Business</a>, Fares took a moment to defend the company - acknowledging how it's actually been a "super good collaboration" between the two parties, even if it hasn't been completely perfect at all times.</p>
<p>He goes on to state how every publisher has its moments, while calling out Nintendo and the other two major players in the console industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Josef Fares:</strong> “Let’s be honest, there’s not a publisher in the world that hasn’t f*****d up now and then. Sometimes I feel that EA is getting more s**t than they deserve. I mean, come on, Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, everybody’s done something that’s not good. But for some reason, EA has become this bad guy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite EA being labelled a "bad guy", Fares insists there are still "a lot of great people at EA" and they know how Hazelight operates and respects this. He adds how he's "surrounded" by people at EA who "love games" and it doesn't feel like he's with a bunch of corporate suits. And if the situation does ever change, Fares says he's got no worries because Hazelight will always do "what it wants".</p>
<p>If you want to read more about the Hazelight founder's thoughts, he's also shared his opinion on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/i-dont-see-ai-taking-over-split-fiction-director-josef-fares-on-the-rise-of-ai">the future of AI in games</a>. And as for his work, his studio's latest release Split Fiction was one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Switch 2's launch titles</a> last year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake Rated By ESRB]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-rated-by-esrb/</link>
            <guid>1405384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is getting close as it’s finally gotten an official rating from the ESRB.</p>



<p>The game has been rated T for Teen, keeping it in line with the rating for the original game. According to the official ESRB page the game received the rating it did for blood, partial nudity, sexual themes, and violence. </p>







<p><strong>“This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a Persian prince on a quest to break a curse,”</strong> the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/37363/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rating summary reads.</a> <strong>“From a third-person perspective, players traverse platform environments, sole puzzles, avoid traps (e.g., spike pits, wall-mounted blades and saws), and battle cursed soldiers and creatures made of sand. Players use swords and daggers to defeat enemies in melee-style combat.”</strong></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the summary it mentions that fights feature sword clashing along with cries of pain and blood splatter. There’s also a 2D side-scrolling sequence that depicts blood pools when the prince dies. </p>



<h3 id="h-when-will-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release">When Will Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake Release?</h3>



<p>Insider Gaming has reported on the plans for the release of the game. At one point, based on internal documents seen by Insider Gaming, the plan was to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release the game sometime</a> in mid-January. While those plans could always change, it does appear that Ubisoft is getting ready for some sort of announcement regarding the long-awaited remake of the 2003 classic. To add to it, it appears the game’s website has <a href="https://x.com/TheRealZephryss/status/2010732617235378684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently been seeing updates</a>, as well.</p>







<p>One thing worth mentioning is the rating mentions the game coming to the Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. There’s no mention of the PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch 2. That’s certainly going to be updated whenever Ubisoft officially announces the game’s release. </p>



<p>When do you think Ubisoft will announce something regarding the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake now that its ESRB rating is public?

<p>We'll take some patch notes now, Aspyr</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="735044a1074d8"><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/735044a1074d8/tomb-raider-definitive-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Aspyr, Crystal Dynamics</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the surprise release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch and Switch 2 last November, Aspyr said it would continue to update the Nintendo versions with patches over time to provide the "best possible experience for all players".</p>
<p>With this in mind, it seems an update has been recently released, bumping the game from Version 1.0.1 up to <strong>Version 1.0.2</strong> (thanks for the heads up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/canaryfarmer" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Life user canaryfarmer</a>). The official patch notes don't appear to be available just yet, but this hasn't stopped fans from investigating what's changed.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1q8cbzf/update_released_for_switch_2_v102/">early impressions</a> (<em>and as you might expect</em>), there are at least some tweaks and adjustments to improve the overall experience on Nintendo's platforms. Players have also apparently uncovered a few other details, claiming there are adjustments to "shadows" and "foliage", <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-has-shadow-dropped-both-on-switch-and-switch-2.15663/page-4#post-2128335">but other fan reports</a> suggest gyroscope controls and certain other control methods still aren't working with the game.</p>


<figure data-uuid="3dbe0ad375bc1"><a title="Famiboards" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3dbe0ad375bc1/famiboards.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-has-shadow-dropped-both-on-switch-and-switch-2.15663/page-4#post-2128335">Famiboards</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, when we get the official patch notes from Aspyr, we'll provide an update about what exactly has changed, but for now you can at least update your game and hopefully experience an improved version.</p>
<p>When this title shadow dropped on the Switch 2 last year, we thought the overall experience on the Switch 2 was "great" (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">awarding it 8 out of 10 stars</a>), even if it's not quite as 'Definitive' as the name suggests. Thankfully, the core gameplay experience is still a thrilling action romp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Crystal Dynamics’ 2013 reinvention of Lara Croft just might be the best entry in this decades-old franchise, and for the asking price, you’re getting a thrilling action romp that’ll keep you hooked until the credits."</p>
</blockquote>

<figure data-uuid="bcf0132bff80c"><a title="Fantasy Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bcf0132bff80c/fantasy-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>Level-5 has continued to roll out updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, and the latest one is now officially available.</p>
<p>It bumps the game up to Version 2.0.4 on the Switch, Switch 2 and multiple other platforms. This includes some fixes specific to Nintendo's hybrid platforms (which had already been fixed on other platforms). Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Level-5's support page:</p>
<h3>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Version 2.0.4 (13th Jan 2026)</h3>
<p>Feature Additions/ Adjustments</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted Remake Settings for Armor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted Version 2.0.0 armor items exchangeable at Don's Dreamy Deals to allow Remake.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in Snoozaland where controls could become unresponsive if the player touched a gatherable item at the moment the effect ended during the "Bam Headbang Dream," which is triggered by interacting with a Drowsy Mimic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Only for Switch 2 | Switch (These issues has already been fixed in the PS5® / PS4® / Xbox / Steam versions):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where items would sometimes not appear in multiplayer on Snoozaland when flying with Skelegon to an Alchemy Robot after alchemy was completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in multiplayer on Snoozaland where guest players could not move to the boss area during the mission "Trimming the Divine Beard" when the party attempted to enter it together, if the host had acquired the Woodcutter Life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in the Snoozaland tutorial where, if the time of day changed before the Tropic Toads in the first area was defeated, players were unable to proceed to the next area afterward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue in the Snoozaland tutorial where, if a field enemy's attack hit the player immediately after opening the supply box, event progression could become blocked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where crafting could sometimes start without switching Lives upon returning to Base Camp after collecting gatherable items in the "Bam Headbang Dream" triggered by touching a Drowsy Mimic in Snoozaland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where the Snoozaland unlock tutorial could be started during multiplayer through a specific sequence of actions. Ending multiplayer in that state could save progress and prevent further progression in Snoozaland.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Nintendo released a new system firmware update for the Switch 2 yesterday and it's resolved some compatibility issues.</p>
<p>There's been an issue with the 2021 releases <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl">Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a></strong>, with both Switch titles reportedly crashing from time to time on the new hybrid system. Fortunately, Nintendo appears to have finally resolved these problems after the rollout of the 21.2.0 system firmware.</p>
<p>This is now officially reflected on Nintendo's <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">software compatibility search page</a>:</p><div><figure data-videoid="UhXw8bSC6A0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytUhXw8bSC6A0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38ea9bgoqpzm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 01/13/2026</strong> - "Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One other game fixed is the "RTS, tower defense, and match-3" title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cats_on_duty">Cats on Duty</a> (<em>yes, you read that correctly</em>), which is <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/01006b401d426000">now fully supported</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also identified an issue with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirbys_return_to_dream_land_deluxe">Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe</a> on the Switch 2 tied to audio issues in certain areas of the game, so we'll hopefully see a fix for this soon. Once again, you can find out more about the compatibility of Switch titles on the Switch 2 via Nintendo's software compatibility search page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">At one point, it had over 420k viewers.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a banner launch day for Hytale, the new sandbox game from the creators of popular Minecraft server Hypixel. In addition to a surge of players and a lot of positive buzz, it's shot up to become, briefly, the most popular game on Twitch, with over 420k viewers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/hytale-surges-to-the-most-watched-game-on-twitch-attracting-over-420-000-viewers-with-its-long-awaited-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">observed first by PC Gamer</a>, who earlier today clocked that it was the most-watched game on Twitch and the second-most-watched category, only behind Just Chatting by about 43k views. At the time this piece was written, Hytale had dropped down to around 260k viewers, but is still the most-watched video game and the third-most-watched category. It's now behind both Just Chatting and football (soccer, for the Americans) league Kings League. And it seems possible that it will surge further in the coming days.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a heck of a comeback story for a game that, half a year ago, was thought to be canceled entirely. Hytale, made by the developers of wildly popular Minecraft server Hypixel, was first announced in 2018 with an incredibly popular trailer, and garnered plenty of buzz at the time. Riot Games took notice, invested, and in 2020 acquired it entirely. However, Hytale was delayed several times as its scope grew, and just this past year was canceled entirely by Riot. Then, in November, co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced he had acquired the IP rights back from Riot, and in an incredibly fast turnaround, he and the team got the game ready for an early access release today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to its popularity on Twitch, Hytale has already made enough money to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-isnt-even-out-yet-and-its-already-made-enough-money-to-cover-the-next-2-years-of-development-costs">cover two more years of development</a>, and its <a href="https://hytale.curseforge.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modding scene is already bustling day one</a>. Someone's even got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-isnt-even-out-yet-and-its-already-made-enough-money-to-cover-the-next-2-years-of-development-costs">Doom running in it</a>. Though we're still waiting for confirmation from Hypixel as to how many players are checking it out today, Collins-Laflamme made a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-dev-expects-over-1-million-players-to-turn-up-for-early-access-release-date-asks-fans-to-download-the-launcher-now">bold prediction of one million players on day one</a>. We'll hopefully soon see if that's come true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>While absolutely another instance of gruesome bloodletting for the video game industry, 2025 at least <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/games-industry-layoff-figures-were-down-slightly-in-2025-but-it-was-still-horrendous-year-in-review?ref=aftermath.site"><u>had fewer layoffs than the prior year</u></a>. 2026, on the other hand, is off to a terrible start.</p><p>Today three major companies announced layoffs in some capacity, beginning with Meta, which shut down Sanzaru, Armature, and Twisted Pixel – all VR studios. The first worked on <em>Asgard's Wrath 2</em>, an award-winning game, while the latter is fresh off releasing <em>Deadpool VR</em> in November. The studios are victims of Mark Zuckerberg’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3m775t5ndvc2r?ref=aftermath.site"><u>predictably disastrous overinvestment</u></a> in VR and the metaverse, with roughly 10% to 15% of Reality Labs' 15,000 employees also set to be laid off, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to The New York Times</u></a>.</p><p>“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kotaku</u></a>. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”</p><p>Ubisoft also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/its-january-13-and-ubisoft-just-announced-its-second-round-of-layoffs-for-2026-at-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announced more layoffs</u></a> today – its <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><u>second round</u></a> in as many weeks, a time period that constitutes the entire year. Following a “voluntary transition program” at <em>Division</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and <em>Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora</em> studio Massive Entertainment, the company decided to finish the job with an old-fashioned slash-and-burn treatment, eliminating approximately 55 roles at the Malmö, Sweden-based Massive, as well as Ubisoft Stockholm.&nbsp;</p><p>"This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time,” a company rep <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted?ref=aftermath.site"><u>told IGN</u></a>, noting that <em>The Division</em> will be the studios’ primary focus going forward. “These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.”</p><p>Lastly, former Xbox hype man Larry “Major Nelson” Hyrb, an industry veteran, announced that he’s been laid off from Unity after joining the <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254?ref=aftermath.site"><u>cut-happy</u></a> <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails?ref=aftermath.site"><u>company</u></a> in 2024.</p><p>"Like many in the gaming space recently, I've been laid off from Unity," he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c4hu4bppjn6wilmucfikwite/post/3mccuyabbv22d?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said on Bluesky</u></a>. "I am proud of the goals my team and I accomplished in just 18 months, and I am grateful for the creators and teams I had the chance to support. Now, I am excited to explore the next chapter."</p><p>It is unclear if Hyrb's dismissal is part of a larger wave of layoffs at Unity.</p><p>This marks a rough beginning to the year for game workers, especially following yesterday’s news that Rockstar workers who alleged they were fired unjustly amid a unionization push <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2ODI0NzI2MywiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODUyMDYzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFJPOVVLSVVQU1owMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.27VI473B4UvIhmPh6eOoW2Crg7Pem9jtOtoGNX34Bco&amp;leadSource=uverify+wall&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>won’t have their pay restored</u></a> during mandatory legal proceedings. However, small silver lining: IWGB, the union representing the workers in the upcoming tribunal, still believes that it will win out in the end.</p><p>“Despite being refused interim relief today, we've come out of last week's hearing more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar's calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gameworkers.co.uk/post/3mccnz6vhuk2b?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement published today</u></a>. “Over the course of the two-day hearing, Rockstar consistently failed to back up claims made in the press or to refute that they acted unfairly, maliciously, and in breach of their own procedures. … This hearing could have alleviated the hardships faced by those in financial precarity or forced to leave the country as a result of Rockstar's actions but we remain undeterred in our efforts to hold them to account.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-recruitment-job-applications-ai-layoffs/"><div><p>Trying To Get A Job In Video Games Right Now Is Like Crawling Through Hell - Aftermath</p><p>The application process has become a dehumanising, demoralising grind</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

On Tuesday, developers from the three aforementioned studios <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> and other social media websites, indicating that they had lost their jobs. </p><p><a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-closes-twisted-pixel-armature-sanzaru-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a> confirmed that the entirety of Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studios were impacted as part of this round of Meta layoffs. In a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/meta-layoffs-vr-game-studios-twisted-pixel-sanzaru-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Meta's Tracy Clayton says these cuts were made so the company could focus on Wearables like its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. </p><p>It's a significant gutting that massively reduces Meta's AAA first-party development capabilities for its Quest headsets. All three studios shut down today are also quite well known, and had storied histories prior their their acquisitions by Meta.</p><p>Twisted Pixel Games initially gained fame thanks to Xbox Live Arcade titles like 'Splosion Man and Comic Jumper: The Adventures of Captain Smiley. It had worked on VR games for the past decade, just releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-deadpool-brings-the-merc-with-a-mouth-to-virtual-reality/1100-6532179/" data-ref-id="1100-6532179">Marvel's Deadpool VR</a> in November 2025.</p><p>Sanzaru Games was the studio behind Asgard's Wrath 2, which was a free pack-in title for the Meta Quest 3. Before that, it worked on the original Asgard's Wrath in VR and some Sony 3D platformer spin-offs like Secret Agent Clank and Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time.</p><p>Finally, Armature Studio was founded by former Retro Studios developers and is best known for the Xbox One console exclusive ReCore. Its most recent game was an impressive VR port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-vr-review-a-selection-of-good-things-stranger/1900-6417767/" data-ref-id="1900-6417767">Resident Evil 4</a> in 2021.</p><p>As it stands, Beat Saber developer Beat Games and Batman: Arkham Shadow developer Camouflaj are still in operation, so Meta's first-party development capabilities aren't completely gone. Still, it's a heavy blow to VR game development as Meta is the most prominent player in the virtual reality space. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Union Files Legal Complaint Over Ubisoft Halifax Studio Closure]]></title>

            <guid>1405285</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CWA Canada, the union representing 61 of the 71 employees who lost their jobs last week when Ubisoft Halifax was shut down, have officially filed a legal complaint.</p>



<p>The complaint accuses Ubisoft of “shutting down its Halifax studio to keep out the union”.</p>







<p><strong>“It’s against the law to stop workers from joining a union in Canada, but the slap on the wrist employers often get is not enough to stop this,” </strong>CWA Canada President Carmel Smyth said in a release. <strong>“The penalty should reflect the reality of intentional corporate bullying.”</strong></p>



<p>Ubisoft has denied that the closure was related to its employees joining the Union. They <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim that the closure</a> had been in the plans <strong>“well before”</strong> the staff unionized. The France-based company said that the decision came as part of the company’s 24-month process to <strong>“streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-cwa-is-looking-for-from-the-board">What The CWA Is Looking For From The Board</h2>



<p>The CWA says that after the layoffs were announced, the union’s lawyers contacted Ubisoft to demand records and information related to the claim that the decision was done entirely out of <strong>“financial necessity”</strong>.</p>







<p>The union is requesting that the labor law be updated to give labor boards, like the Nova Scotia Labor Board, the ability to force employers to reopen for a year. They also request that employers either help find other work for impacted staff or pay laid-off workers three years’ salary. </p>



<p><strong>“Ubisoft took $12 million in taxpayer money from the government of Nova Scotia to nurture a generation of talent, and to build a tech industry,”</strong> Smyth said. <strong>“Now it’s walking away without so much as an apology.”</strong></p>

		<p>Former Xbox spokesperson, Larry Hryb, more commonly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/major-nelson/">Major Nelson</a>, has announced that he has been laid off and lost his job Unity.</p>
<p>“As many of you have been with me during my career in gaming, I’d like to share personal news. Like many in the gaming space recently, I’ve been laid off from Unity,” he wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hryb.me">BlueSky.</a> “After leaving Microsoft, I joined the Unity team in 2024. I am proud of the goals my team and I accomplished in just 18 months, and I am grateful for the creators and teams I had the chance to support. Now, I am excited to explore the next chapter.”</p>


<p>“I’ve had invigorating conversations over the past weeks with companies in tech and non-tech spaces to discuss partnerships. I love what I do but I also believe change is necessary. I’ll let you know where I go from here.”</p>
<p>He is part of the latest in a&nbsp; long line of redundancies at game engine developer Unity, with over 25% of the staff being laid off at a cost of over $205 million.</p>
<p>The company suffered a huge backlash in 2023 when it instituted a “runtime fee” that, if &nbsp;a game reached specific revenue and lifetime installation thresholds, the publishers would pay a fee for every installation.&nbsp; Previously, developers only had to pay a license fee for the engine. When it became clear that the fee would apply to older games that were updated there was another backlash, but in response, Unity only changed some of the terms of the new payment plan.</p>

<p>The furore continued until Unity finally backed down, announcing they would be discontinuing the runtime fee model – but would be increasing the pricing of the original license instead.</p>
<p>Unity is used by many mobile developers, and the vast majority of VR games are created using the engine.</p>
<p>We wish Larry all the best for the future.</p>
