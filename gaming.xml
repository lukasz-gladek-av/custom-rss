            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5&nbsp;</em>director Hideaki Itsuno has signed up with the newly-formed Japanese contingent of the Tencent-owned LightSpeed Studios, where he'll be creating "original AAA action game titles".</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/news/Japan-Game-Development-Studio.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on the Lightspeed website</a>, Itsuno will head up the appropriately-named LightSpeed Japan Studio, which marks "a major step in LightSpeed Studios' global expansion".</p>

<p>Itsuno describes his appointment as "an exciting new chapter for me", promising to create "aesthetic and innovative experiences for the global player community" and exhorting talented developers from around the world to "join [his team's] vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-hideaki-itsuno.jpg?itok=aN4GiMW0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-hideaki-itsuno.jpg?itok=yKdR8YhI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideaki Itsuno is perhaps best-known for his work on&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma</em>&nbsp;and its sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned announcement post, LightSpeed Japan Studio will consist of two locations in Tokyo and Osaka, and it "offers a flexible and inclusive work environment".</p>

<p>If you're wondering where you've heard LightSpeed's name before, it's the co-developer of mobile smash hit&nbsp;<em>PUBG Mobile</em>&nbsp;(alongside Krafton, which is apparently also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">currently working on a mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>).</p>

<p>Despite LightSpeed's best-known game being a mobile title, the fact Itsuno and Japan Studio will be working on "AAA action game titles" suggests that he'll be primarily working within the PC and console spaces.</p>

<p>Of course, we're still very early on in Itsuno's appointment and the lifespan of Japan Studio, so we'll have to wait and see exactly what he and his team cook up in future.</p>

<p>Others include original&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios" rel="nofollow"><em>Yakuza</em>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>creator Toshihiro Nagoshi</a>, BioWare veteran <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mac-walters-worlds-untold-netease" rel="nofollow">Mac Walters</a>, and Itsuno's fellow former <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/producer-hiroyuki-kobayashi-hast-left-capcom-and-joined-netease-games" rel="nofollow">Capcom alumnus Hiroyuki Kobayashi</a>, as well as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>producer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netease-launches-new-studio-pincool-led-by-former-dragon-quest-producer-will-work-on" rel="nofollow">Ryutaro Ichimura</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">ex-Ubisoft staffer Sean Crooks</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blast-r6-major-montreal-viewership-suffers-early-on/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The BLAST R6 Major Montreal tournament is unfolding as we speak, and this weekend, it’ll wrap as the action moves away from ‘Phase Two’ into ‘Phase Three’. Presently, the sixteen teams that made it into the Swiss System portion of the $750,000 tournament are battling away, but in just a few days, the victor will be crowned.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the tournament isn’t having as strong an impact as the last BLAST R6 Major, which took place in Manchester, England. Per a report published by Esports Charts, Montreal’s opening days pulled in 36% fewer viewers than the May Major, and things are yet to improve.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-weaker-traction">Weaker Traction</h2>



<p>Despite the tournament being days away from ending, the viewer count hasn’t risen all that sharply. On the first day of the tournament, per Esports Charts, the Montreal Major’s viewership peaked at 55,000 users. By today, that number has managed to climb to 78,000, but the Manchester Major’s peak hit 162,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It was the most popular BLAST R6 Major ever – but it was admittedly helped by an intense grand final between Team BDS, the tournament’s favourite to win, and beastcoast, an underdog side on a tenacious streak.</p>



<p>In the report published <a href="https://escharts.com/news/r6-montreal-major-day-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Esports Charts</a>, it was mentioned that fewer co-casters were covering the action at Montreal, which might go some way towards explaining the lower viewership, but we’re talking a single-digit difference. There’s still a solid spread of teams present at the event, from FaZe Clan to Team Liquid, so the fans <strong>should </strong>be eagerly tuning into the action.</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how things pick up going into the weekend. The grand final for the BLAST R6 Major Montreal is set to take place this Sunday, and it’ll hopefully be the biggest and most popular match of the event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-a-god-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A God Pack is a set of opened cards that almost have to be seen to be believed in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Every man and his Growlithe are desperate to secure this most sacred of packs, and if you’re a regular Pokémon&nbsp;Pocket player with no idea what I’m talking about, here’s some quick background on a God Pack.</p>



<p>The Genetic Apex set kicked off Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket at launch. The collection features an array of super-special pulls, and the contents of each Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack boil down to pure luck and RNG—there are no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-bent-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bent Pack Tricks</a> or secret <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Pick exploits</a> here.</p>



<p>This being said, if luck is on your side, there’s a slim chance you can pull a God Pack—and immortalize yourself in the annals of Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket history.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-pack-explained-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">God Pack explained in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We can all dream. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A God Pack is when every card in a Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack is either a Holographic, EX, Full Art, or Gold Crown</strong> <strong>card</strong>.</p>



<p>Ordinarily, you’re hoping for at least one of the above in each pack: Or two at a push! As of writing, the closest I’ve come to a God Pack is two occasions where I’ve had two different Full Art cards in the same pack.</p>



<p>Now, there’s a chance you dear reader haven’t even had two in a pack (don’t envy me, I’ve had plenty of stinkers too), but this is nothing compared to some of the obscene Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pulls out there. Trickery and clever photo and video editing are part and parcel of the modern age, so not all “God Packs” are to be believed. However, a quick search of “God Pack” on either X or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/hot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TCG Pocket subreddit</a> is guaranteed to leave your jaw on the floor.</p>



<p>I’ve seen multiple packs featuring <strong>five Full Arts</strong>, and it’s absurd. The lowest pull percentage for a Full Art is <strong>5.263%</strong>—according to Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Offering Rates—and it boggles the mind how it’s possible to get two, let alone <em>five</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-god-pack-in-pokemon-nbsp-tcg-pocket">How to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>You must get extremely lucky to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket as it’s a completely luck-based process.</strong></p>



<p>There are no special items to use, no one-time-use percentage boosters, and no superstitions in the world that can boost your odds of getting a God Pack. Like any gacha-based system, Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s packs harness the concept of chance, inevitably leading to a ton of duplicates and disappointments once you begin to fill your compendium of creatures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/meet-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pacifist-whos-already-hit-prestige-without-killing-anyone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is a game all about shooting guns and killing other players. At least, that’s how it’s meant to be played. Not for one determined pacifist, however, who has managed to Prestige without killing a single player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redditor Pilgore revealed his in-game stats after reaching Prestige 1, confirming a remarkable 0.00 K/D after 111 games, or 19 hours and 26 minutes of Multiplayer. That means he managed to gain enough experience to level up past 55 and trigger Prestige despite having zero kills. Perhaps even more remarkable, Pilgore achieved the feat with a 1.92 win ratio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How did Pilgore manage it? Why do this in the first place? And where does he go from here? IGN interviewed Pilgore, real name John, to find out, and obtained permission to publish one of his matches on the Nuketown map to show off his impressive pacifist tactics. Check it out in the video below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Pilgore employs a combination of playing the objective (I know, rare for Call of Duty!), and using the Spy Cam Tactical equipment and Scrambler Field Upgrade to gain score during the match, then calls in the UAV, CUAV, and HARP scorestreaks as they become available. Pilgore also shoots down any enemy scorestreaks as soon as they come in. Pilgore does not shoot at enemy players at any point; rather, he plays Call of Duty like the most useful support class you could ever want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you'd expect, Pilgore has many more victories in objective-based modes such as Hardpoint and Domination than K/D-focused modes such as Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed. And if you’re interested in Pilgore1’s Perks, he uses Flak Jacket, Gearhead, and Dispatcher to trigger Strategist, with the Tactical Expert wildcard granting an extra Tactical. "Four Spy Cams can genuinely get you UAV/CUAV on its own," he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why bother playing Call of Duty as a pacifist? It turns out Pilgore has done this before with previous Call of Duty games, joking with a friend that he could Prestige before him even if he got zero kills on Black Ops Cold War. “I enjoyed playing that way so I just kept on going,” Pilgore said. He managed to hit Prestige 15 on Cold War, 10 on Vanguard and Modern Warfare 2, and 15 on last year’s Modern Warfare 3 playing this way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s one hell of an achievement and shows incredible focus and discipline, but one thing that bothers me about all this is how Pilgore was able to avoid killing an enemy player just once, even accidentally. I play a lot of Call of Duty and I’ve often killed enemy players by mistake, simply by either pressing the wrong button at the wrong time, or having a rocket intended for a scorestreak blow up an enemy player who just happened to get in my way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was definitely risky at the start (previous games) and I got lucky a few times,” Pilgore explained. “I'd throw a Decoy grenade and it would sometimes hit somebody, luckily, it never got me a kill (yet). I've gotten much better at being careful after doing this for 51 Prestiges now. There's almost no worry of it happening this game as the Spy Cam has replaced Decoys for me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilgore added that he’s been lucky enough not to have an enemy player jump in his crosshairs while he’s shooting down scorestreaks. And it’s worth noting that the player who calls in a scorestreak gets the kills if it crashes down on other players, so there's no danger of an accidental kill there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/ss-ac03caa8430a111c836669ad53651613069a0c67-1920x1080-1731411855835.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pilgore spends a lot of time shooting scorestreaks out of the sky. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I also assumed that it would take an excruciatingly long time to gain enough XP to Prestige while playing as a pacifist, but Pilgore insisted his method is “actually a pretty decent way to get score/XP.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I consistently get at least 7,000 score a match,” he went on. “My tactics haven't really changed over the years. Experimented with different loadouts but the main gameplay has been the same. Earning XP doing this is much better than you'd think.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Keep going until I get a kill or get bored. I have a buttload of patience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The inevitable next question is what’s next for Pilgore? Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his history playing Call of Duty as a pacifist, there’s no turning back now. “Keep going until I get a kill or get bored,” he vowed. “I have a buttload of patience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode?

			<p>The controversial GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, which includes the first three 3D entries in the series, was patched today on PC and consoles to bring over a highly requested change and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The patch</a>, which is now live on all PC storefronts, Xbox, and PlayStation, introduces the Classic Lighting Mode introduced in the mobile version of the collection last year. This mode restores the look and feel of the sky of the original games. To better highlight the differences between the vanilla lighting and the Classic Lighting Mode, Rockstar Games shared some comparison screenshots taken from the PC versions of all three games at maxed-out settings. You can check them out below.</p>

<p>Having not been updated in a long time, it seemed like Rockstar Games was done with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition patches, but thankfully, that was not the case, as the new Lighting Mode is a considerable improvement over the vanilla lighting. Some lingering issues still remain, but there's no doubt the remasters are in a much better state now than they were at release. You can learn more about these issues by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">launch review.</a></p>
<p>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/aukey-magfusion-gamefrost-cooling-wireless-charger-for-mobile-gamers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><b>November 12, 2024</b> - Leading charger brand <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/aukey-magfusion-gamefrost-wireless-charger-review" target="_blank">AUKEY</a> today announces the availability of its <a href="https://www.aukey.com/discount/GAMEFROST10?redirect=%2Fproducts%2Flc-g10-magfusion-gamefrost-magnetic-wireless-charger-with-active-cooling-system" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">MagFusion GameFrost Magnetic Active Cooling Wireless Charger</a> in the United States. The Qi2-certified charger features AUKEY’s proprietary Omnia-Frez active cooling technology, delivering fast 15W wireless charging for iPhone 12 and later models running on iOS 17.2 and above while maintaining low temperatures even during intense gaming sessions. In short, the MagFusion GameFrost is a must-have for mobile gamers seeking the ultimate gaming experience.</p>
<p>The MagFusion GameFrost, part of AUKEY's MagFusion Pro Qi2 wireless charger series, was showcased at IFA Berlin 2024, garnering considerable attention. The series differentiates itself from traditional wireless chargers through its advanced Omnia-Frez cooling system, featuring a Thermoelectric Cooling (TEC) chip at its core, which provides exceptional cooling capabilities. The system also features a high-velocity fan, silicone thermal pad, and alloy cooling fins to enhance heat dissipation.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The system can reduce charging temperatures by up to 20°C (68°F), providing a safer, more stable charging environment. This innovative feature is particularly beneficial during extended smartphone use, especially mobile gaming. By lowering the temperature, the device not only prevents overheating but also avoids performance drops and lag caused by high temperatures. As a result, gamers can enjoy a smooth, uninterrupted experience with a cool, comfortable feel. Additionally, the charger’s IML temperature display allows users to monitor temperature changes at a glance in real-time.</p>
<p>According to data from AUKEY Lab, the MagFusion GameFrost can charge an iPhone 16 Pro to 50% in an impressive 35 minutes. This efficiency not only minimizes downtime for users but also supports battery health by maintaining cooler charging temperatures, which helps to reduce battery wear over time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In addition to the Omnia-Frez cooling system, the MagFusion GameFrost innovatively offers a personalized experience that sets it apart from traditional wireless chargers, reflecting AUKEY's user-centric design philosophy. The device features dedicated buttons for wireless charging, cooling, and lighting control. When the battery is sufficiently charged, users can disable wireless charging and use the device solely as a cooling solution. Users can also switch between three cooling modes for optimal thermal management, and two LED lighting modes for a personalized atmosphere, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
<p>Lastly, the MagFusion GameFrost is intuitive and easy to use. Users can simply snap their phone onto the charger’s strong magnetic holder to activate wireless charging and cooling with immediate effect. The charging pad’s smooth glass surface ensures a perfect scratch-free fit with the iPhone, while the back panel's curves and angles accommodate various hand shapes and grips.</p>
<p>MagFusion GameFrost retails at <strong>$42.99</strong> and is available for sale on <a href="https://www.aukey.com/discount/GAMEFROST10?redirect=%2Fproducts%2Flc-g10-magfusion-gamefrost-magnetic-wireless-charger-with-active-cooling-system" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">AUKEY’s official website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-stellar-blade-outfits-nier-automata/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On November 20, Stellar Blade will receive its first major expansion in the form of a Nier Automata crossover. This will bring new characters and missions to the game, and it’ll come hand-in-hand with photomode and several new outfits. In this snapshot guide, we’re walking through all the new Stellar Blade outfits being added alongside the Nier Automata DLC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eve-s-new-outfits-in-stellar-blade">Eve’s New Outfits in Stellar Blade</h2>



<p>To usher in Stellar Blade’s first major expansion, Eve will get four new outfits:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>FourSeconds Black</strong></li>



<li><strong>FourSeconds Everyday Wear</strong></li>



<li><strong>War Dress</strong></li>



<li><strong>Neurolink Skin</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s in addition to the four outfits introduced with the Nier Automata crossover: 2B, A2, YoRHa, and 2B Black. Eve will also pick up a stylish new accessory – the Symbol of Legacy. When you use this item, it’ll change how Tachy Mode appears in the game. </p>



<p>Here’s a glance at the new Stellar Blade outfits coming with the Nier Automata DLC:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It hasn’t yet been revealed how to unlock the Nier Automata outfits in Stellar Blade, but that will inevitably be confirmed when the DLC is released on November 20. Most likely, users will be able to purchase the new skins from ‘Emil’s Shop’, a fresh trader interface introduced with the Nier Automata DLC. </p>



<p>The most exciting element of the update is the arrival of photomode, which fans have been eagerly waiting for since the game was released in April. The team at Shift Up has also added further lip-synching support for additional languages, better options for customisation (such as Eve’s hair), and various quality-of-life improvements.</p>

			<p>Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-series-creator-reportedly-going-to-netease-while-tencent-is-rumored-to-be-acquiring-a-japanese-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> SEGA three years ago to join NetEase, where he <a href="https://wccftech.com/nagoshi-studio-unveiled-by-netease-focused-on-global-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> his own Tokyo-based studio to make global console games.</p>
<p>The game designer was featured in a lengthy interview with Japanese magazine Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> yesterday. Nagoshi talked about various topics, but the most interesting tidbit is arguably that he believes the era where game size is the selling point will soon pass.</p>
<p><em>What I'm making now is an action adventure. After the experimental phase and the phase where the experiments are exhausted, we will move on to the phase of mass-producing assets, but I think it would be good if you thought of it as being on the eve of the mass-production phase. In that sense, it's going well, but in many ways, it's a bit large in scale. In addition, at first glance, the game system is complicated. But I don't want to make it a troublesome game... Well, it's difficult to talk about what I can't say at this point.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, I want to make it a game that is satisfying to play, but I don't want it to be a hassle. Even though there aren't many completely new games out there, there are so many titles out there that you can't play them all, including overseas. Looking at the situation, I think the volume of console games in the lives of average game fans may be a bit excessive. There are still many titles out there, but I feel that the era of games where volume is the selling point is about to pass.</em></p>
<p>The interesting thing is that he admits his next game is also going to be large in scale, which isn't surprising given that his last game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, required 45.5 hours just for the main quest, while a completionist playthrough can take an average of 103 hours, according to How Long To Beat.</p>
<p>Anyway, Nagoshi said his team is currently assessing the proper size for this game, though the map they've created is already large - maybe too much.</p>
<p><em>One characteristic that is particularly relevant in overseas markets is that a certain amount of volume is necessary, and although there is a sense that "it has to be at least this much," I think that this is also a kind of fixed idea. So we continue to discuss, "What is the appropriate volume at the time of releasing the game?" I'm currently thinking hard about how to predict or measure that volume and how to arrange the game's density to suit the appropriate volume and size.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We will soon have to enter the mass production phase of assets, so it will soon be time to decide on the final volume estimate, but we are currently thinking about whether this is really good enough. Of course, we have a map, but the one at the current stage is too large. I started by studying existing games and creating a fairly large map. I had already created roads and highways. Now, I'm shrinking it little by little and looking for a good balance for the game.</em></p>
<p>The Yakuza creator also revealed that the team size is around 80. He'd like to share more about the project in the near future, too. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch is among the best ones to date, introducing new options that provide a deeper insight into the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler alongside great visual and performance improvements.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry analyzed the game's PS5 Pro patch, highlighting the new features that it introduces and how it takes advantage of the console's power and features. The patch replaces the standard Performance Mode with a PS5 Pro Enhanced mode that uncaps the framerate so that those with a 120Hz screen with VRR can enjoy a high framerate experience that consistently runs at above 60 FPS, hitting the 100 FPS range rather often.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature of the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch, however, is the new Scaling options, which include PSSR anti-aliasing and the TAA option the game has featured since launch. These options, which can be switched on the fly, provide a great insight into the performance cost of the PSSR upscaler, which does a great job enhancing the image quality and the perception of distant detail using the same 1440p base resolution as TAA but does impact performance. In one of the game's most CPU-intensive scenarios, using PSSR over TAA made the game run at 10 frames per second less or more. As such, this essentially confirms the PSSR cost on performance of 2ms every frame that was revealed in the internal documents leaked a few months ago.</p>
<p>Rounding out the improvements the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch brings in its new enhanced mode is the presence of all the image quality features seen in the base game's Quality Mode, including the light ray tracing for the scene-aligned cube maps, which is still not available in the PC version of the game. All of these features make the patch one of the best released to date, enhancing the experience considerably in both image quality and performance over the base model.</p>

<p>Hideaki Itsuno, the name behind the Devil May Cry and Dragon’s Dogma franchises, has a new home. The director has taken up a leadership position at <strong>LightSpeed Studios Japan</strong>, a subsidiary of the giant Tencent.</p>



<p>Itsuno will use all his expertise to develop new AAA action games. Hideaki spoke about his new challenge in a <a href="https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/news/Japan-Game-Development-Studio.html">statement to the press</a>.</p>



<p>“<em>Joining LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS is an exciting new chapter for me.</em> <em>With LightSpeed’s strong development capabilities and global network, I’m looking forward to creating original AAA action games together with the amazing team and building innovative and beautiful experiences for the global community of gamers.</em> <em>We welcome all talented and passionate game developers from around the world to join our vision</em>.”</p>



<p>Based in Osaka and Tokyo, the studio’s idea is to build experiences that reach global audiences. Jerry Chen, president of LightSpeed Studios, had this to say:</p>



<p>“<em>The creation of LightSpeed Japan Studio is a significant step in the expansion of LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS and demonstrates our commitment to bringing the best possible games to our players.</em>”</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the initiative isn’t messing around, signing one of Japan’s leading game developers. Obviously, we don’t have any more details about Hideaki Itsuno’s next adventure. Knowing the director’s style, we can at least hope for addictive combat.</p>

            <p>
In The Valley of the Gods, the promising but now permanently "on hold" adventure from the team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>, had some eye-popping water technology. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew Wilde, who worked on Firewatch at Campo Santo before the team was absorbed into Valve six years ago, has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social/post/3lakopz32k22x">shared</a> a fresh look at In The Valley of the Gods on social media, showing what could have been. 
</p>
<p>
"I do often tend to work on liquidy things," Wilde wrote. "This was the water test we did at Campo Santo pre Valve move." 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Matthew Wilde, the Valve developer behind the water shader for Counter-Strike 2, has shared a rare gameplay footage. It shows the water technology that was tested for In The Valley of Gods before Valve acquired the company Campo Santo. Team shelved the game not so long after… <a href="https://t.co/wIs6Im8KYx">pic.twitter.com/wIs6Im8KYx</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1855941378301141312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
There is, sadly, absolutely no suggestion we'll see In the Valley of the Gods anytime soon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-review">Firewatch was excellent</a>, and Campo Santo's follow-up - which would have followed a budding filmmaker as she explored 1920s Egypt in search of archeological secrets - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-developer-reveals-next-game-in-the-valley-of-the-gods">looked hugely promising</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But, in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-acquires-firewatch-developer-campo-santo">Valve and the potential to work on Half-Life: Alyx came calling</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-devs-egyptian-adventure-in-the-valley-of-gods-officially-on-hold-at-valve">In The Valley of the Gods was later confirmed to have been shelved indefinitely</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Wilde's reference to working on "liquidy things" is a reference to some of his other work since, such as the impressive water shader technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> that lets you slosh around bottles of beer, as well as the water technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Spent a good chunk of lock-down doing this important work. Boozy liquid shader, now available in the latest update for Half-Life: Alyx <a href="https://t.co/Iw9h98pmEg">pic.twitter.com/Iw9h98pmEg</a></p>— Matthew Wilde (@skilful) <a href="https://twitter.com/skilful/status/1265875309980643329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote></div>

What's next for Wilde and his former Campo Santo colleagues? Well, there's rumblings that there's more from Valve's most famous series on the horizon. Is it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">finally time for Half-Life 3</a>?

<p>Perks are a staple of Call of Duty games, and they’re extremely important for a successful loadout in Warzone.

<h2 id="h-how-do-perks-and-wildcards-work-in-warzone">How do Perks and Wildcards work in Warzone?</h2>



<p>Warzone has a “Pick 3 System,” which means you can <strong>pick one Perk from each category</strong> (blue, red, and yellow.) You can then pick <strong>one Wildcard</strong> to compliment your loadout. These Perks will drop on the floor so that they can be looted again upon death.</p>



<p>Players will need to choose one Perk for each slot to make a combination of 3. Most of the Perks can be unlocked through leveling up, while the new ones added in Season 1 (Veteran and Reflexes) are unlocked via Season 1 event rewards. There’s no Combat Specialty. Wildcards are also earned through leveling.</p>



<p>There are also lootable Perks in Warzone that players can find to further fortify their loadout. These include four options from the Pick 3 System and two that are exclusive to loot – Shrouded and Irradiated. Lootable Perks will vanish upon death.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-get-specialist-perk-package-in-warzone">Can you get Specialist Perk Package in Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes</strong>, Specialist Perk Package is back in Warzone x Black Ops 6, and it can be found as a <strong>rare loot drop or via the Care Package Killstreak</strong>. It will give the player all 18 Perks plus the two bootable Perks for a total of 20. Upon death, the Specialist Perk Package will drop and can be looted by anyone.</p>

It stars Rashida and Zora, a pair of documentary filmmakers who accidentally made it big with a hit movie but have since seen their careers go off a cliff.

We probably won't flag up when every single game's soundtrack comes to Nintendo Music, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> is a bit of a favourite round these parts. 
</p>
<p>
So yes, 30 music tracks from Nintendo's seminal Wii launch title are now part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">Nintendo Music</a>, the company's new soundtrack app which launched last month, as a fresh perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. 
</p>
<p>
More than 82 million people owned a copy of Wii Sports and millions more - friends, siblings, grandparents - played its simple but brilliant motion-controlled takes on tennis, golf and bowling. Also baseball and boxing, but they weren't as good.

These tunes are ingrained in my memory from countless evening sessions playing nine holes of Wii Golf at uni or short matches of Wii Tennis on breaks in the staff room at my student job. There's something about Wii Sports which still stands unmatched - I still dig out the original Wii Sports to play in multiplayer sessions today.

Here's the full list of Wii Sports tracks now included in Nintendo Music. Altogether, these only amount to 18 minutes of music, but many of these classics can be extended to versions lasting up to 60 minutes each for your continued audio pleasure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-rtx-4080/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Running games powered by the Unreal Engine 5.4 smoothly continues to be a challenge even for current high-end GPUs, as an RTX 4080 GPU has trouble running an undemanding fan-made game powered by the engine at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, <a href="https://projectborealis.com/prologue-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3</a>, a fan-made project powered by the latest public version of the engine, cannot run at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS Ultra Quality preset even in scenarios where there isn't a lot happening on screen. With other DLSS settings and Frame Generation, performance is considerably better, but this is only making it more clear that a native 4K, 60 FPS experience is not possible on the vast majority of current gaming hardware, although better optimization, which shouldn't be expected for what is essentially a demo of a fan-made project like this, could have improved the situation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3 on Unreal Engine 5.4 | RTX 4080 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 FG" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bs2XrBrpbBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One more thing the video above makes abundantly clear regarding Unreal Engine 5.4 is that, despite performance improvements over past versions, the engine still leaves plenty to be desired in regard to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-performance-improvement-frame-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame time stability</a>, as the stutters are pretty evident at all resolutions. This has been a persistent issue in games powered by Epic's engine for a long while, and there still doesn't seem to be a solution to the problem in sight, although things may improve in the future thanks to the effort of developers well-known for their technical expertise, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-issues-improvements/">CD Projekt Red.</a></p>
<p>More information on Unreal Engine 5.4 can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <p>The developers of hero shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> must have dropped a box full of old photographs while clearing the attic, spilling old snapshots of Route 66 onto the floor and getting snared in a nostalgic daze. The game is launching a "Classic" mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.</p>

<p>Blizzard explained the ins and outs of Classic mode in <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/">a rose-tinty post</a>. They also explain that this won't be the only time the mode appears (Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, likes to run limited-time events often). Each time the classic event shows up it will replicate the "heroes and balance from popular moments in the game’s history."</p>
<p>This time that means you can have a team composition of six Torbjorns, the turret-thwacking Swede. Or field a team made entirely of very annoying Genjis, the ninja who I hate. But be warned, this lack of hero limits only lasts the first few days, say Blizzard. "After that, we will enable single hero limits for the remainder of this first Overwatch: Classic event." </p><p>Some things won't be changing, though. The maps that cycle through this mode will be the maps you recognise (Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and so on) but their design will remain as they appear in Overwatch 2. "This includes major reworks for Dorado, Numbani, Route 66, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar," say the devs.</p>
<p>The mode will run for the next three weeks, until December 2nd. And it's not related, we're told, to the chin-scratching at the studio regarding another possible 6v6 mode in Overwatch 2. That's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-2-may-get-6v6-again-as-blizzard-try-to-bring-back-the-chaotic-over-the-top-variety-of-the-first-game">something separate the studio is thinking about</a>. </p>
<p>Blizzard aren't the first to encourage players to become misty-eyed about a shooter they used to play. Last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> brought back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-season-og-brought-back-its-original-map-last-week-and-a-record-breaking-44m-players-came-with-it">its old map</a>, resulting in record player numbers and likely catching the dollar-sign eyes of every executive in charge of a live service game. But harking back to some "golden age" of your favourite online blastabout is a questionable way to engage with nostalgia, as James learned when he had a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> after they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">launched a similar classic mode</a>. As a a kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> holiday it was enjoyable, he said, "but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always <em>that</em> good."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft's shutdown of The Crew has sparked a legal challenge from two fans who have this month filed to begin a class action lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
Online racer The Crew became unplayable and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">removed from owner's accounts</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">Ubisoft pulled the plug on its servers</a> back in March. The game was 10 years old and had been replaced by a successor, but Ubisoft's decision still sparked wider concern among video game fans increasingly concerned about preservation and consumer rights.
</p>
<p>
"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed," the plaintiff's lawyers wrote in the new lawsuit, as first reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action">Polygon</a>.

<p>
"Turns out the pinball manufacturer decided to come into your home, gut the insides of the pinball machine, and remove your ability to play the game that you bought and thought you owned."
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit alleges that its plaintiffs - and likely many others - were unaware that legally they owned only a license to the software, even if they owned a physical copy, and would not have purchased the game if they had been aware of its eventual complete shutdown.
</p>
<p>
Its plaintiffs are now seeking approval for a wider class action lawsuit which could pay out for owners of the game.
</p>
<p>
"We announced on December 14, 2023 that after almost a decade of support, we would be decommissioning The Crew 1 on 31st March 2024," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer earlier this year. (The company has declined to comment on this new legal action.) 
</p>
<p>
"While we understand this may be disappointing for players, it was necessary due to server infrastructure and licensing constraints."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's decision helped spark the Stop Killing Games campaign, which aims to end the practice of publishers "destroying" video games after their sale to customers. 
</p>
<p>
379,280 people have since signed a petition to the EU that calls for measures to ensure games remain playable get legal backing - specifically, that games remain in a working state with an offline mode when publisher support does wind down.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">Ubisoft subsequently committed to providing offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>, which will be playable if (more likely, when) those games also get their servers switched off. 
</p>
<p>
While there's no suggestion game publishers will be required to keep online servers active forever, there does seem to be a greater acknowledgement that consumers lack awareness of what they are acquiring when buying a game. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-warns-customers-theyre-only-buying-a-license-when-paying-for-a-game">Steam now warns customers they're only buying a license when paying for a game</a>, for example, as fresh California legislation requires storefronts to make it clear customers are only buying a license for digital content rather than outright owning it.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">Eurogamer spoke to a group of The Crew fans taking matters into their own hands</a> by attempting to use mods to bring the game back online using private servers.
