            <p>Players have blasted NetEase for a perceived lack of moderation across Marvel Rival lobbies.</p>
<p>"Forget about loser queue, I want to get out of racist queue," wrote redditor Murkwan on the official Marvel Rivals subreddit. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/forget_about_loser_queue_i_want_to_get_out_of//">post</a> has since been locked and deleted, but not before securing 1400 likes and almost 500 comments, the majority of which agreed with the OP.</p>

<figcaption>Marvel Rivals launched last December - here's its launch trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b0veB7q9P4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whilst many players seem to get grief merely for playing certain characters (primarily Jeff the Landshark), others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk7gf9/">say</a> they regularly hear racist and sexist slurs, but "haven't gotten a ban notification for weeks" even when they report offending players (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-racism-no-username-moderation-called-out/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"The problem is that this takes a toll on you," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgj7stz/">explained one player</a>, responding to a suggestion that players should "mute, report, block" and move on.</p>
<p>"As a woman, I don't use mic unless with my friends. If I speak with random teammates I'll always get some insult or disgusting comment. I just ignore, report and block, but it's not nice at all. It's not like 'haha what a loser'. First time maybe. The third game you hear something like that you just want to stop playing even if you love the game.</p>
<p>"So in cases of racism, it's the same," they added. "Yeah, ignore those losers, but reading or hearing insults over and over again makes you really want to not play anymore."</p>
<p>"I'm sick of people telling women what they need to do to counter the harassment they're experiencing like that's their job," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk4gxa/">added</a> another respondent. "That's just the digital version of telling women not to dress some specific way or they're 'asking for it'."</p>
<p>Black players also contributed to the thread, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjh1br/">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjornc/">admitting</a> "comms stay off with randoms" completely, even in ranked play.</p>
<p>Other players have taken to X/Twitter, with this commenter writing: "Seriously?? MarvelRivals, wheres the moderation??" asked one player, including a <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878646544142086654">screenshot</a> of a grossly antisemetic username. "Big fan of the game but seeing this mid game is gross."</p>
<p>"Its even worse [because] I can't leave the match without being penalised and having my own gameplay experience suffer, so I just have to play with this person," they <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878647306997952674">added</a>.</p>
<p>"When you think about it, it's even weirder when it's in a Marvel game," said u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgkeiwq/">fistfightcrash</a>.</p>
<p>"Stan Lee was pretty clear that what the X-men was originally about was the civil rights movement. This is a Stan Lee quote from the 60s:</p>
<p>'Let's lay it right on the line. Bigotry and racism are among the deadliest social ills plaguing the world today. It's totally irrational, patently insane to condemn an entire race.'</p>
<p>"If you're racist, how could you possibly think this is your space?" they concluded. "Unless you're real old, Marvel was probably vocally anti-racist before you were born."</p>
<p>We've reached out to NetEase for comment.</p>
<p>Last month, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After playing a few hours of Sandfall Interactive’s dark fantasy RPG, I can say that <em>Expedition 33 </em>grasps the melodrama of modern <em>Final Fantasy</em> and marries it with the tactical turn-based combat fans of that series have been craving a return to for decades. On top of this, the game also has a <em>Paper Mario</em>-like timing mechanic to make that combat about more than just picking which attacks and items you use during a turn. Sandfall Interactive is cooking with some excellent ingredients, and the small taste I’ve gotten has me eager to try the full meal. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-preview-turn-based-1851767119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-preview-turn-based-1851767119">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="61efc76c19ac41e8c7ec2de22c65183d" data-recommend-id="image://61efc76c19ac41e8c7ec2de22c65183d" data-format="png" data-width="1219" data-height="685" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Suikoden 1 and 2 protagonists stand at attention.

<p>That's not all, either - Update 3 also brings the "highly-requested" return of the Western theme.</p>
<p>As for Update 4? Frontier's still being coy, but so far it's revealed players will able to build their own restaurants in which you'll have to "satisfy multiple guest needs and tolerances", Frontier Workshop extra features such as a Featured Creators list, alerts, and a What's Hot list, plus career maps in Sandbox mode in Act 2.</p> <div>

<p>We can also expect stock coasters (part 3), an as-yet-unannounced additional ride, plus "franchise mode improvements" and "ongoing stability and performance enhancements". Expect more details as we get closer to April.</p>
<p>The theme park sim sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2s-first-paid-dlc-releases-today-alongside-major-update">received its first major free update back in December</a>, alongside its first paid DLC, whilst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-outlined-bringing-more-rides-and-continued-performance-improvements">February introduced new features like custom video billboards, custom speakers, synchronised coasters, and interchangeable coaster cars</a>.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," Matt wrote in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>, awarding it 2 out of 5 stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/625881/suikoden-remasters-classic-rpgs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Suikoden</em> is a game that I’ve been meaning to play for years. A highly regarded roleplaying game from the original PlayStation era, it’s renowned for its sprawling storyline and huge cast of playable characters. That also makes it pretty intimidating, and I’ve had a copy sitting on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">my PS Vita</a> just waiting for when I might have the free time to finally dig in. After all that waiting, I’m now playing a new remastered collection that includes the first two games in the series instead. And it made me realize that, for the past several months, my personal gaming time has been dominated by classic, turn-based RPGs — an experience that has really made clear the genre’s realm of possibilities.</p><p>It started with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">excellent new version of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em></a>, which launched last November. That game was the equivalent of video game comfort food: an exceedingly straightforward fantasy adventure that has been spruced up with gorgeous visuals, a lush orchestral soundtrack, and some very welcome quality of life tweaks. Soon after that, Mistwalker released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24312363/fantasian-xbox-ps5-switch-pc-launch-hironobu-sakaguchi">an updated version of <em>Fantasian</em></a>. It’s technically not an old game — it originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad">debuted on Apple Arcade</a> in 2021 — but it has the soul of one, with <em>Final Fantasy</em> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi using it as a way to explore new ideas in presentation and combat. Then, to top it all off, the “pixel remaster” version of the very first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295537/final-fantasy-4-apple-arcade"><em>Final Fantasy</em> hit Apple Arcade</a> in January.</p><p>These were all games I had played before, but digging through them again in quick succession made me appreciate their strengths. <em>DQ3</em> and <em>FF</em> embody a true sense of adventure. Both have straightforward stories that are easy to follow (or ignore, if you don’t care about that sort of thing) but locations and systems that make venturing into towns, dungeons, and the wider world exciting. <em>DQ3</em> made that type of experience incredibly approachable, with its beautiful new presentation and streamlined gameplay, while I’ve discovered that <em>FF</em> is quite possibly the ideal mobile game: something deep enough to keep me engaged but also an experience where it still feels like you’re making progress when you only have a short window to play.</p><p><em>Fantasian</em>, meanwhile, is like a modern reinterpretation of what a classic turn-based RPG could be. In a lot of ways, it’s classic <em>FF</em>, from the amnesiac protagonist to the the world that’s a mix between fantasy and sci-fi. But it also has some clever twists on the formula, like battles that let you aim attacks and a tool for delaying random battles for when you just want to explore. This is all on top of the headline-grabbing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi">visuals made of real-world dioramas</a>. And while I’m only a few hours into playing <em>Suikoden</em> for the first time, I’ve already been struck by the ambition of its storytelling, which manages to cram a lot of political intrigue into the confines of a traditional RPG structure.</p><p>That’s all to say that even at a time when there’s plenty of impressive, big, and modern RPGs like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/611255/avowed-review-xbox-pc"><em>Avowed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24307786/dragon-age-the-veilguard-full-review"><em>Dragon Age</em></a>, there’s still something distinct and interesting about the classic turn-based formula, and it’s exciting to see all the ways that various studios have utilized it over the years. That’s true whether you’re replaying a new version of something old or, like me, trying out <em>Suikoden</em> for the very first time. Even better: there’s still more to come. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension">Sakaguchi told me</a> earlier this year, when it comes to his studio’s next game, their “goal is to create something old but new at the same time.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Buckle up, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s Bleasdale House has had a terrifyingly good makeover.</p>
<p>The farmhouse - one of the first maps to launch with the hit horror in 2020 - gets a whole new look with 10th March's update. With 21 rooms spread across two floors and an attic space, developer Kinetic games said, "Bleasdale is an ideal location for budding ghost hunters to settle in for a potentially horrifying evening".</p>

<p>Following "major alterations", the house now boasts an all-new layout, brand new areas - including a new tea room and trophy room - and a new visual design, although the fan-favourite touches, such as the fireplace, piano, and loop-friendly dining table remain.</p>
<p>"The new dining room will be larger than before, and plays host to a large dining table in the centre, with lots of fragile new items for ghosts to play with," Kinetic teased. "The living room will feature a large fireplace, a grand piano, and some plush red leather sofas, perfect to hide the bloodstains for a cozy night in.</p>
<p>"Players will also be able to explore the new tea room and trophy room, each filled with a variety of intriguing collectors items - that is, if you find pet plate collections and ominous relics intriguing."</p>
<p>Perhaps most intriguingly of all, however, is Bleasdale's all-new garden, which now counts as a ghost room… which is bad news for babies like me, who play the entire game cowering in that doorway.</p>

            <p>Parents have filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games for allegedly creating "the illusion of scarcity" and "FOMO" with its store items.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">Polygon</a>, two parents have filed <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">a claim with a San Francisco court</a> on behalf of their children, citing "deceptive practices employed on a massive scale in one of the world’s most popular video games [Fortnite]".</p>

<p>"Some items, such as the ultra-rare Renegade Raider outfit, were offered briefly and have not been offered in more than six years," lawyers wrote. "Others disappear only to reappear weeks later. These offerings and their schedules are subjects of intense interest to Fortnite players."</p>
<p>Taking issue with how the Fortnite Store rotates items on its digital storefront, the complaint reads:</p>
<p>"But, when their countdown timers expired, Fortnite’s Item Shop products did not disappear or return to full price. They remained available for purchase, often at the same purportedly discounted rate, for many days or even weeks at a time. This was an unlawful scheme.</p>
<p>"Fake sales with made-up expiration times are deceptive and illegal under state statutes proscribing unfair and deceptive trade practices, which prohibit misleading advertisements concerning the reasons for or existence of price reductions and representing that items have characteristics or qualities they do not have. Numerous courts have found that fake countdown timers like Epic’s run afoul of these and similar prohibitions."</p>
<p>This is likely referring to a similar lawsuit in the Netherlands. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-to-appeal-11m-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-at-children">Epic Games is currently appealing a €1.1m (£968k) fine levied by the Dutch consumer regulator</a>, which similarly accused the company of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children". At the time of writing, that decision is still pending.</p>
<p>In a statement to press, Epic Games said: "This complaint contains factual errors and does not reflect how Fortnite operates. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-and-upcoming-fortnite-shop-and-locker-changes">Last year we removed the countdown timer in the Item Shop</a> and we offer protections against unwanted purchases. This includes a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/updates-to-fortnite-purchase-cancellation-and-social-settings">hold-to-purchase mechanic</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">instant purchase cancellations</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">self service returns for shop purchases</a> and an explicit yes/no choice to save payment information.</p>
<p>"When a player creates an Epic account and indicates they are under 13, they are unable to make real money purchases until a parent provides consent. Once they do, we offer industry leading parental controls including PIN protecting purchases. We will fight these claims."</p>
<p>Earlier this week we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-suing-prolific-thief-who-stole-and-sold-player-accounts-on-an-industrial-scale">Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts</a>, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/622113/mainframes-review-steam-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>MainFrames</em> is a perfect example of a game with a clever idea that doesn’t overstay its welcome.</p><p>In the new indie platformer, you play as an adorable floppy disk that traverses computer desktops. The aesthetic is ridiculously charming: the many characters sprinkled throughout the game are<em> so dang cute</em>, and the levels are filled with application windows and desktop icons that serve as bouncing pads or gears to change things in the levels. Everything is overlaid on pixelated landscape computer backgrounds that differ between worlds. And it’s all backed by a catchy chiptune soundtrack that really sells the vibe.</p><p>It’s a great premise, and <em>MainFrames</em> takes the idea one step further by regularly letting you manipulate computer windows by clicking or dragging them like you would with an actual mouse. So, for example, if you can’t reach a far-off ledge, you might be able to hop onto a computer window with a platform and drag that window over to the ledge so you can reach it. You’ll also “select” certain windows to activate functions like flipping gravity.</p><p>Over the course of the game, you’ll take on progressively more difficult platforming puzzles that require precisely timed jumps and manipulating windows in various ways. There are lots of different approaches for exploring each level, and it’s worth combing through them to see as much as you can. One of my favorite sections had me retrieving tissues for a clock with a cold. A few times, I ran into a coffee cup making coffee at a coffee machine. Once, I even stumbled on a photo memorializing somebody’s dog.</p><p>Some of the platforming puzzles are quite difficult. But when you fail a jump or run into an obstacle, you respawn right away, so it’s easy to throw yourself at a challenge as many times as you need to beat it. I was able to skip through some rooms by being smart about where I was jumping, and while I felt pretty proud of myself, I have a hunch the game’s developers intentionally designed some of those shortcuts. You can also turn on accessibility features like invincibility or infinite jumps to breeze through anything you just can’t get past, and I’m not ashamed to admit that I did so for a handful of areas near the end of the game. </p><p>While playing <em>MainFrames</em>, I kept drawing comparisons to <em>Celeste</em>. Both are smart platformers with great vibes that can get pretty tough, but because reloads are so quick, repeated failures don’t sting too badly. And both games feel like they play out their ideas exactly as far as they need to. I rolled credits on <em>MainFrames</em> in a little under four hours, and the experience felt just right.</p><p><sub>MainFrames<em> is now available on Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I didn’t realize just how significant until I failed to prevent a catastrophe in the game’s second area, and you know what? I’m glad I made this huge mistake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/localthunk-the-balatro-timeline-solo-dev/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, the solo developer behind Balatro, one of 2024’s most highly awarded games, opened up about his journey in a blog post. In an article dubbed ‘The Balatro Timeline’, LocalThunk took a deep dive into the end-to-end history of what it took to make Balatro, which was released in February 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception.</p>



<p>LocalThunk explained about the very origins of Balatro – which was first named ‘Joker Poker’ – in this timeline walkthrough. He also gives readers a transparent insight into the toll that creating the game had on his mental and physical health, which is something many gamers never realise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-my-sleep-and-my-heart-are-getting-worse">‘My Sleep and my Heart are Getting Worse’</h2>



<p>In The Balatro Timeline, LocalThunk tracks back through three years of development history, going back to December 2021, when the first concept of what would become known as Balatro surfaced. It was being pieced together alongside a full-time IT job, and back then, LocalThunk couldn’t ever imagine it becoming as successful as it has.</p>



<p>The full account of this stunning development journey is a wonder to read, and it paints a clear picture of just how impactful these things can be on developers – especially solo developers.</p>



<p>LocalThunk explained that his mental and physical health were put to the test during the creation of Balatro, with the situation becoming much worse as the launch got closer and the attention around Balatro started ramping up <strong>fast</strong>.</p>



<p>For instance, it was noted that in August 2023, just six months before the launch of Balatro:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is when my sleep and heart started having issues. </p>



<p>I really struggled with my physical and mental health from this time onward all the way up to launch. This was entirely because of the stress around dealing with the public, players, and the pressure to get everything done before February 2024.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By October 2023, things were getting much worse for LocalThunk:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My sleep and my heart are getting worse. Every few nights I need to sleep sitting upright on the couch because sleeping while lying down kept getting interrupted by my heart. </p>



<p>I stupidly thought that I couldn’t handle going to the doctor while dealing with all the dev and business stuff swirling around at the time. I felt totally overwhelmed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everything from signing with a publisher to hiring lawyers to hammer out contracts is detailed <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/balatro-timeline-3aarh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in The Balatro Timeline</a>. It’s an account of the highs and lows of solo development, but fortunately, it ends on a jubilant note.</p>



<p>LocalThunk revealed that he made $600,000 in just a couple of hours on Steam alone, and on launch day, he sat down to celebrate with a bottle of champagne and some burgers.</p>



<p>Nice.</p>

<p>When you think about it, the keyboard is the most complex video game controller in common use today, with over 100 distinct inputs arranged in a vast grid. Yet even the most complex keyboard-controlled games today tend to only use a relative handful of all those available keys for actual gameplay purposes.</p>
<p>The biggest exception to this rule is a <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/genre:typing/">typing game</a>, which by definition asks players to send their fingers flying across every single letter on the keyboard (and then some) in quick succession. By default, though, typing games tend to take the form of extremely basic typing tutorials, where the gameplay amounts to little more than typing out words and sentences by rote as they appear on screen, maybe with a few cute accompanying animations.</p>

<p><em>Blood Typers</em> adds some much-needed complexity to that basic type-the-word-you-see concept, layering its typing tests on top of a full-fledged survival horror game reminiscent of the original PlayStation era. The result is an amazingly tense and compelling action adventure that also serves as a great way to hone your touch-typing skills.</p>
<h2>See it, type it, do it</h2>
<p>For some, <em>Blood Typers</em> may bring up first-glance memories of <em>Typing of the Dead</em>, Sega's campy, typing-controlled take on the <em>House of the Dead</em> light gun game series. But <em>Blood Typers</em> goes well beyond <em>Typing of the Dead</em>'s on-rails shooting, offering an experience that's more like a typing-controlled version of <em>Resident Evil</em>.</p>
<p>Practically every action in <em>Blood Typers</em> requires typing a word that you see on-screen. That includes basic locomotion, which is accomplished by typing any of a number of short words scattered at key points in your surroundings in order to automatically walk to that point. It's a bit awkward at first, but quickly becomes second nature as you memorize the names of various checkpoints and adjust to using the shift keys to turn that camera as you move.</p>

<p>When any number of undead enemies appear, a quick tap of the tab key switches you to combat mode, which asks you to type longer words that appear above those enemies to use your weapons. More difficult enemies require multiple words to take down, including some with armor that means typing a single word repeatedly before you can move on.</p>
<p>While you start each scenario in <em>Blood Typers</em> with a handy melee weapon, you'll end up juggling a wide variety of projectile firearms that feel uniquely tuned to the typing gameplay. The powerful shotgun, for instance, can take out larger enemies with just a single word, while the rapid-fire SMG lets you type only the first few letters of each word, allowing for a sort of rapid fire feel. The flamethrower, on the other hand, can set whole groups of nearby enemies aflame, which makes each subsequent attack word that much shorter and faster.</p>

			<p>MercurySteam's upcoming action/adventure game has received several new gameplay videos from a few outlets who were able to play it in advance of its release. It certainly looks like there's some inspiration from Sony Santa Monica's God of War Norse mythology reboot.</p>
<p>Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling</a> in late February, this game has received a barrage of news ahead of its May 22 launch. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about the game's focus on forging and wielding melee weapons rather than using flashy magic spells. Likewise, they wanted to put the player's skill first rather than rely on RPG-like stats. However, the weapon's stats will matter, depending on the materials you used while crafting it. There are many different combinations to experiment with.</p>
<p>Later, the Spanish team known for the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow trilogy <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full PC system requirements for Blades of Fire:</p>

<p>In this game, players will step into the role of Aran de Lira, firstborn of the King's Ward and the only one capable of crafting weapons to challenge the evil Queen Nerea, who has cast a spell that turns all other steel weapons into stone. Forging is a big part of the game, allowing players to choose from seven weapon families and more than thirty unique Forge scrolls. In combat, they'll be able to target specific body parts, and wielding the right weapon against the enemy's armor will be critical. There are over fifty enemy types in total, each with different attack styles, weapons, and armors.</p>
<p>Blades of Fire will be released soon for PC (as an Epic Games Store exclusive), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

		<p>Tripwire Interactive left it until pretty much the last minute, but has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> has been delayed until later in 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/killing-floor-3-launches-on-25th-march-25-with-closed-beta-in-february/">Previously expected for launch on 25th March</a>, Killing Floor 3’s delay does not have a new release date. While still expected to arrive in 2025, anyone who pre-ordered the game will automatically receive refunds on Epic, Xbox and PS5, while US-based PS5 pre-orders will be prompted to choose and Steam pre-orders are free to cancel manually. <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-general-faq.2340844/">See here for more details</a>.</p>


<p>“After taking the time to gather and discuss feedback from our recent closed beta, we’ve realized that we missed the mark,” the team explained on a certain social media cesspool. “Our goal isn’t just to make Killing Floor 3 an ambitious step forward for the franchise, but also to maintain the core experience that you’ve come to know and love.</p>
<p>“With the full support of our parent company Embracer Group, we’re working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel. While it’s too early to say which fixes will be implemented by launch, we can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release.</p>
<p>“We look forward to another opportunity to show you a more polished version of Killing Floor 3, and when we’re ready to share more details, you will be the first to know. Until then, we thank you for your continued patience and overwhelming support.”</p>


<p>Killing Floor 3 takes the already dark war against the Zeds and jumps forward 70 years from Killing Floor 2, with a new army of Zeds on the march from megacorp Horzine. You’re part of a group known as Nightfall which is trying to fight back.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s all just a narrative wrapper for the 6-player co-op in which you face off against waves of incoming Zeds. There’s six Specialist character classes, each with complimentary abilities and roles, and an array of weapons that you’ll be able to upgrade and adapt, both through the overarching player progression and by buying equipment between waves. The M.E.A.T. System returns as well, ramped up to give even more guts and gore, which is sure to make wielding a katana rather visceral.</p>

<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">hands on with the recent Killing Floor 3 beta test</a>, saying “Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Just as we all expected, the recent behind-closed-doors playtests for Battlefield 6 (not a confirmed title) have resulted in countless leaks hitting social and streaming platforms worldwide. The first tests took place this week, and participants were quick to screengrab as much as possible and leak it all over the internet.</p>



<p>What has emerged is something quite tantalising. It looks as though the Battlefield 6 leaks are uncovering a Battlefield 4 – or dare I say it, <strong>Battlefield 3</strong> – vibe, and I am truly here for every ounce of it. This could be the return of peak.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-back-again">Battlefield Back Again</h2>



<p>Battlefield has struggled in recent years; that much is obvious. The series has undergone a tumultuous time that began after Battlefield 1 hit the market and became one of the best-selling games in the franchise. It was all kind of downhill from there.</p>



<p>In 2021, Electronic Arts released Battlefield 2042, the worst game in the series by far, which flopped <strong>hard</strong> at launch.</p>



<p>Recently, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">Battlefield Labs</a> playtest sessions have given way to stacks of leaks for Battlefield 6. That was fairly predictable, and some have theorised that it was engineered by Electronic Arts as a way to earn free publicity.</p>



<p>In the Battlefield 6 leaks, we’re seeing a present-day theatre of war populated by traditional soldiers, vehicles, and locales. It’s a back-to-basics shooter with recognisable weapons and a clean UI that’s entirely representative of the heyday of the Battlefield franchise. We can see classic destructive elements, snippets of the class system, and the no-holds-barred action sequences unfold. </p>



<p>In 2011, the team released Battlefield 3, and in 2013, Battlefield 4 came out. For many, those two titles represent the peak of the franchise – and I count myself among that crowd.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-is-streaming-battlefield-labs-for-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield leaks</a> we’re seeing are from a pre-alpha build of the game, and everything is subject to change. That’s why they’re testing things now and standing up a community-led feedback pipeline.</p>



<p>It has been far too long since a Battlefield game dominated the market, but Battlefield 6 could hit the spot for gamers eager for a broader, more ambitious first-person shooter title. If it’s anything like Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, including a campaign and a couple of side options and added modes, it could be a smash hit.</p>
