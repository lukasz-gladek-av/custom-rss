<p>They're a rather nice contrast to the Switch 2's black colour scheme, and softer than the current default of blue and red.</p>

<p>New balls, please</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has served up a five-minute <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> overview trailer, giving us our best look yet at the upcoming sports title.</p>
<p>The big focus right from the jump is the titular Fever Rackets, which grant special power-ups to your shots or movement. The trailer gives us another look at the Flame Shot and Ice Racket, but there's also the enemy-summoning Pokey Racket, the helping hand Shadow Racket, and the speedy Golden Dash Racket. Some of these can even deal damage to your opponent, because the one thing that tennis is really missing is <em>pain</em>.</p>
<p>But these Fever effects aren't the be-all and end-all. As explained in the new overview, if you can send the Fever ball back before it bounces, the effect will be sent back with it — gosh, <em>the tension</em>!</p>
<p>Those after something a little more standard can play in 'Classic Rules', removing the Fever Rackets and putting more focus on the new Slide and Leap shots.</p>
<p>We get a closer look at more of those teased 38 playable characters, too, with Goomba, Nabbit and Baby Waluigi getting some time in the spotlight, and those with a keen eye will also spot the likes of Dry Bones, Bowser Jr. and more.</p>
<p>As for game modes, there's Tournament, the challenge-based Trial Towers, and the Baby 'Adventure' mode that we saw in the initial reveal.</p>
<p>And yes, GameShare is also enabled in this one, so you can play with friends online even if they don't own a copy of the game.</p>

Again, the game will be free at the point of entry, so it won't cost you anything other than time to try it out.</p><p>Krafton says that <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>'s Early Access version "may include limited content", but that the project will "evolve through ongoing balance updates, improvements, and live development", which is pretty much the dictionary definition of an Early Access game, I think.</p><figure role="group">

<p>More details about <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>'s Early Access release, as well as a "full FAQ", will be made available via the game's official Discord server at some point in the near future, so look out for that if you want to know more.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>PUBG: Blindspot </em>is, Krafton describes the game as "a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter built on clever positioning, tight teamwork, and shared vision".</p><p>Each game will see one team trying to gain entry to a building in order to access its Crypt, while the other team tries to defend the building from the first team's incursion. Krafton and ARC Team are promising unique classes, as well as iconic weapons from <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> for you to try out.</p><p>&nbsp;You can check out a trailer for <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>, which should give you a sense of what kind of gameplay you can expect from the project, right here.</p>

            <p>Right, so, Starcraft. A new shooter in the series is reportedly set to be revealed this year, possibly as the big headline act of Blizzcon in September.</p>
<p>The existence of such a secret shootery thing in the works at Blizzard was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">first reported</a> by Jason Schreier last year, being one of the revelations to come out of his book on the publisher, titled Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well, now a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Windows Central</a> claims that said Starcraft shooter is "most likely" going to headline Blizzcon 2026, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> expansions expected to take the snowy stage alongside it.</p>
<p>That's it in terms of details for this latest report, but Schreier's reporting from last year did reveal that - at least as of the time of his book's publication - long-time FarCry producer Dan Hay is heading up the project. Asked about like likelihood of this Starcraft shooter making it out into the wild by IGN around the same time, Schreier said the following:</p>
<blockquote>If it’s not canceled. This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good. Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.</blockquote>
<p>He added that it "felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include, because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> shooters, they just can't say goodbye to them." Indeed, as this'd be the third time acting as the charm for such a game. Nihilistic Software’s  StarCraft GhostGhost was announced in 2002, put on hold in 2006, and later canned. Then, a shooter named codenamed Project Ares was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-cancelled-starcraft-fps">reported to have been cancelled</a> in 2019, with Blizzard's focus pulled towards Diablo 4 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>.</p><p>As a young whippersnapper who's never Starilly Crafted, I've got no strong feelings about any of this, but I do hope <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-starcraft-game-is-on-the-way-from-the-publishers-of-dave-the-diver-and-the-finals-according-to-reports">Edwin can be spared</a> having to write more lines like "It's been so long since the last Starcraft that all I can remember is that Zergs build on creep, the Protoss Void Ray is a glorified Xmas bauble, and Jim Curry went to space."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  The Spring Drop will bring in a host of new baby animals, and eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
                </p><div>
              
              <p>The next major update to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> is going to make all the baby animals over 2,740 percent cuter. I checked the figures using measurements, and by watching the new trailer for the Spring Drop four times over.</p> <p>It seems that until now,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> has generated its baby animals by scaling down the body size of their adult forms, but keeping the heads the same. And that’s good. That’s worked. But there was room for improvement. In the next update, due in the spring, all the game’s younger animals will receive bespoke designs, complete with all-new animations, sound effects, and the cutest iddle widdle eyes you’ve ever seen.</p>

  <p>Seriously, how are we supposed to even cope with those fuzzy lil’ guys? Those bunnies! The new wolf pups! The way the bunnies tip their heads and twitch their ears?!</p>

 <p>This is also a splendid piece of game promotion, for a game that requires less advertising than oxygen. Mojang’s Agnes Larsson is infectiously and apporiately excited about the new pups, and it compelling portrays&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> as a game that’s interesting far beyond that of the PvP-focused YouTube denizens of LifeSteal or what have you.</p>

 <p>I tested the video to its absolute limits, by this morning showing it to my 11-year-old son who is hellbent on a new, tougher exterior, and he melted before it. There were attempts at somewhat patronizing, “Yeah, that’s sweet,” remarks to placate me until he was caught off guard and let out, “KITTENS!” After that, he was n. Some cool credibility was recovered on the reveal that name tags are soon to be craftable, as he let out a YouTuber’s “Yesssssssss,” and carefully noted the ingredients for the task. After that, his Switch lured him away from the video, as he and fellow classmates rushed to work on a new world on their shared Realm before each player was popped out of existence as they were dragged from screen to school. I happily continued watching yet again, until Larsson was once more scratching a real pig’s belly with a rake.</p>

 <p>I’m a little bit worried about how I’m going to cope <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">on returning to Donut SMP</a> to a world that is yet to contain those cuboid little chicks, or baby highland cattle that I need to hug until they pop.</p> <p>All of the above is currently available in Snapshot, Beta and Preview versions of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, although there’s no date for when it will all properly arrive.</p>

            <guid>1400374</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ready to pick up a new pair of earbuds? There are tons to choose from, but you can always count on Apple to have some of the best on the market. Apple’s AirPods (fourth gen) are true wireless earbuds designed to provide users with seamless, fast and convenient listening experiences. And if you’re thinking it’s time right now to get some earbuds to level up your music, you should absolutely take advantage of this deal.</p>
<p>If you want a pair of your own right now, you’re in luck. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">You can get fourth-generation Apple AirPods on Amazon.com for under $100, which represents a savings of $29 compared to their retail price of $129</a>. That’s about 22% off, which is well worth locking in your purchase for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A pair of one of Apple’s best sets of earbuds</h2>
<p>These AirPods are all about seamless integration, and they do that perfectly. As soon as you pair the AirPods with your iPhone, the AirPods will also automatically appear on your iPad, Mac, and any additional Apple products that utilize the same Apple ID. To start listening to music, podcasts, etc., simply open the AirPod case and put the AirPods in your ears.</p>
<p>In terms of sound quality, the fourth-generation Apple AirPods sound great. They deliver balanced audio with clear vocals, punchy enough bass, and relaxed tuning that allows for extended listening periods without fatiguing your ears. And they’re super comfortable, too. Each stem is relatively thin and lightweight, so you don’t get tired of wearing them.</p>
<p>Plus, the included charging case fits into a pocket or bag so you can carry the AirPods with you at all times and recharge them when needed. Simply flip the lid of the charging case and you can determine if there is sufficient battery left to continue listening or if it is time to charge the AirPods again.</p>



<p>As far as battery life, the fourth-generation Apple AirPods are capable of delivering hours of continuous listening per charge, allowing users to listen to content for extended periods of time. After the battery runs low, the AirPods can be placed back into the charging case for additional power to extend the amount of time available for listening. Users can also recharge the charging case via a cable, eliminating the need to store separate chargers for individual components.</p>
<p>These Apple AirPods build upon the ease-of-use features that were introduced in earlier generations of AirPods and offer you a budget-friendly option to upgrade or acquire a set that improve on Apple’s previous release in just about every way. If you’re interested in grabbing the new AirPods right now, be sure you lock in this deal while it’s still available.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s seasonal content moves on with Season 2. If you’re after the Black Ops 7 Season 2 start date and times, this hub has everything you need to know about the next season and new additions.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-starts-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is one of the least commercially successful CoD titles in years; you’re all still playing it anyway.

<figure><figcaption>Stick ’em up. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7 Season 2’s expected release date is currently February 5.</strong></p>



<p>Seasonal live-service models have a certain level of consistency when it comes to start dates and times. As one season ends (usually signified by that season’s Battle Pass end date and time), the next begins. Using Season 1 Reloaded’s data, it’s a fairly logical assumption that Season 2 begins on February 5.</p>



<p>If this changes, IG will update you.</p>







<h2 id="h-expected-black-ops-7-season-2-start-times">Expected Black Ops 7 Season 2 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>As pretty much all Call of Duty seasons start at 9 AM PT, you can look forward to Black Ops 7 Season 2 starting at 9 AM PT first, with other regions facing a slightly different time relative to time zones.</strong></p>



<p>No extra words needed for this one, just check out the table below to see when Season 2 should get underway where you live.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Season 2 Start Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 PM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 PM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—January 9</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-new-black-ops-7-season-2-content-ranked-amp-new-maps">All New Black Ops 7 Season 2 Content: Ranked &amp; New Maps</h2>



<p><strong>Early indications are that BLOPS 7 Season will add Ranked Play for the first time in this iteration, along with new and classic maps, and the usual slew of guns and game modes.</strong></p>



<p>At this early juncture, it’s safe to assume the usual carousel of seasonal content is coming. The armory needs restocking with new toys, game modes are needed to inject new life into the core gameplay, and it wouldn’t be a new season without the new Battle Pass and cosmetics, would it?</p>



<p>But two main additions will likely dominate the headlines: Ranked and Maps.</p>



<h3 id="h-maps">Maps</h3>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-7-season-2-maps-have-already-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Black Ops 7 Season 2 Maps leaked</a> well ahead of time. They include <strong>Plaza</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Slums</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Yemen</strong>. There’s always going to be remasters, as it’s easy for the devs, and it helps boost the content count for a new season. On the other hand, no one’s going to reject the chance to play on different maps, especially classics.</p>



<p>There are likely going to be more announced.</p>



<h3 id="h-ranked-mode">Ranked Mode</h3>



<p>You’ve been asking for it, and Treyarch is finally delivering. Ranked Play is coming to BLOPS 7, and it starts with Season 2. Furthermore, it doesn’t appear to be a midseason drop either: Insider Gaming has more on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Mode release date</a>.</p>



<p>This signals a new grind for the more experienced and hardcore users among you.</p>

<p>A new report about The Witcher 3’s upcoming rumoured DLC says it could take players to a brand-new region. </p>



<p>Talks about a new The Witcher 3 DLC have been circulating on the internet for quite some time now. Lastly, we learned that the rumoured expansion is scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in May 2026</a>. Now, it seems some additional details about this expansion have surfaced online, suggesting exploration of Zerrikania. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-3-s-rumoured-dlc-could-be-centered-around-the-zerrikania-region">The Witcher 3’s Rumoured DLC Could Be Centered Around the Zerrikania Region</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?fbclid=IwY2xjawPKJn1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Poland</a> reveals that they have been aware of The Witcher 3’s rumoured DLC for some time; however, they decided not to disclose any information until now. According to what they had learned then, it seems that The Witcher 3’s DLC will take players to a brand-new desert region, where they will encounter exotic fauna and culture, a lot like “Dune-Style” Witcher. What’s more, there are a lot of hints in the games and the books about this region. </p>



<p>The Manticore School is situated in the Zerrikanian desert, which Geralt discovered in The Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine DLC. Additionally, many characters have referenced the school or the desert in the series. There’s also speculation that this is where Ciri could take her Trial of the Grasses and become a Witcher before the arrival of The Witcher 4. </p>



<p>However, information about this new region for The Witcher 3’s DLC surfaced years ago; players should definitely treat it with caution.</p>







<p>In other news, CD Projekt RED has confirmed that The Witcher 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not release in 2026 and the new trilogy will stick to the 6-year plan</a>. Additionally, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-sword-replica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica</a> of The Witcher’s Aerondight Silver Sword.

Artwork by Bogna Gawrońska and Marek Madej.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While IGN Poland cautions that this information dates back several years, it also goes on to list a string of reasons why Zerrikania makes a lot of sense for the expansion, due to various hints at a Zerrikanian Manticore School in previous expansion Blood and Wine, and references to the region made by other characters. The same school is also a part of The Witcher's tabletop RPG — as seen in the artwork above.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> report has given a more black-and-white reason why this expansion is likely real and expected to launch in 2026: because there's currently a gap in CD Projekt's employee incentive program target indicative of the company launching something expected to earn significant money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Eurogamer notes, CD Projekt doesn't really have anything else expected to fit the bill, with The Witcher 4 not set for launch until 2027 at the earliest, and Cyberpunk 2 after that. Work on a new IP is also ongoing, but even further off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a possibility still that this could relate to some other, smaller Witcher spinoff, but with all the smoke around a Witcher 3 expansion now rising, everything looks to be pointing in the same direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As "full production" on The Witcher 4 continues, CD Projekt has cautioned fans not to expect its launch in 2026, as the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-still-plans-to-launch-all-3-games-in-the-new-ciri-fronted-the-witcher-trilogy-within-a-6-year-period">plans an ambitious six-year roadmap in which it will also launch The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6</a>. Before all of that, there's a window this year for even more Witcher, and a fresh slice of content that could potentially help bridge the gap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new DLC feels like a smart idea to reawaken lapsed interest ahead of the series' next chapter, via extra content sold to The Witcher 3's existing audience of more than 60 million players. This content could be used as a reason to sell the game anew, to bring fresh fans to the decade-old role-player, and potentially set up plot points to be expanded upon in the franchise's eventual sequels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The expectation is that Reunion will be made official in the imminent future, and launch not long after.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Life is Strange: Reunion is particularly notable as it appears to revive (or return) the character of Chloe, the original game's blue-haired best friend (or love interest) that you could sacrifice (or save) depending on your choices. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck Nine's most recent Life is Strange game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Double Exposure</a>, received a negative reaction from many core fans of the series for returning to the story of original main character Max Caulfield in a reality in which Chloe survived the events of the franchise's first game but did not appear in person. Fans of the pair's romantic relationship option were particularly upset, as Double Exposure explained that the two characters were now broken up, seemingly permanently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purported leaks from within Deck Nine Games amid this backlash painted a picture of a troubled development, but also mentioned a further game being in the works that did feature Chloe. Reunion certainly seems to be this project — and it will be interesting to see whether its final version feels like it has been shaped by feedback to Double Exposure.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life Is Strange: Double Exposure Reveal Trailer Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time," reads a description of the game published by PEGI. "Losing her is Max's greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max's help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other plot details include a character hallucinating on mushrooms, and a scene where a building is on fire with people trapped inside. The game will reportedly begin with a recap of previous Life is Strange entries, in which it sounds like we'll see Chloe during the events of the first game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A digital deluxe version of the game will also be offered, containing additional outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Life is Strange: Reunion is yet to be officially announced by publisher Square Enix, but it likely won't be long now. We've contacted the company for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Last January, our reviewer Brendan "Shitty Shitty Wham Bam" Caldwell <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">called</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> "a sordid sim of piss and pistons that won't hold your disgusting little hand", proceeding to warn that it "will either scare you off with its complexity or induce Stockholm syndrome with its mesmerisingly neglectful approach". Out now in early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-winter-car">My Winter Car</a> is all of that plus the "terrible coldness and darkness of Finnish winter", in the words of developers Amistech Games.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The devs add that "it is hard to keep a track even of the time of the day. World around seems to go forward, but player is spiraling even deeper in the pit he was establishing already in the original game." Awesome! In context, the presence of a generative AI disclosure on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4164420/My_Winter_Car/">the Steam page</a> feels entirely appropriate, like luxuriously urinating all over a deep-frozen turd sandwich.
</p>
<p>
The premise seemingly remains that you are trying to fix up a horrible car without dying of immolation, dehydration, lightning strike, and falling off your moped, amongst other foul ends. Now, you also have to worry about pervasive ice and snow. The "cinematic" teaser video below is insultingly opaque, showing only a man in a bobble hat having a smoke next to a covered trailer, in vague echo of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3d8sjh/what_is_the_story_behind_iwata_and_the_bananas/">contemplating a banana</a>, except that My Winter Car is unlikely to be rich in either potassium or wholesome, Nintendo-ish fun. Regarding the developer's comment about losing track of time above, it's worth noting that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utsjoki">parts of Finland</a> in winter where the sun doesn't rise for months.

<p>
There was a pinch of genAI stuff in the original My Summer Car, too. It appears to be more prevalent this time. "Some base textures have been AI generated during the development," the devs note in their disclosure. "Some of the imagery and speech audio in the in-game TV programs are AI generated. Some in-game radio music is AI generated."</p><p>Honestly, the use of AI generation for a game like My Winter Car is a frightfully unreadable escalation of the debate around generative AI. Much as I despise the bigger mass market implementations of the tech for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">corrosive and reductive effect on art and culture</a>, that very infamy makes genAI a good fit for a game that, as Brendy wrote, appears borne of putrid misanthropy and "snickering schadenfreude". I have a terrible feeling that a My Generated Car game would do well, however unlikely to appear on any NVIDIA showcases.

This game is an invitation. Antarctica has always fascinated me, and imagining its far future opened creative doors we just never expected. Now it belongs to the players—I hope they discover stories that feel personal, fragile, and unforgettable.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via PARCO GAMES:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In 2900, the world has finally run out of second chances. Antarctica – once the planet’s final untouched frontier – cradles a ravaged Earth, beset by viruses, food shortages, extreme weather, and ceaseless conflicts. But, in the midst of this desolation, a mysterious signal sparks from the South Pole. A beacon of hope, perhaps? Or something far more sinister?</p><p><em>Nova Antarctica</em> tells the story of a lone child drawn south by said signal, searching both for its source and for meaning, for connection in a place where the Earth itself seems to remember everything we’ve done to it.

This is the Antarctica of the far future; reshaped by climate collapse, reclaimed by strange new ecosystems, haunted by memory, and alive with echoes from beneath the ice.

In case you've understadably started wondering if this is the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> which prompted my last bit of newsing about a PUBG spin-off, it isn't.

<p>Blindspot's the one which got a Steam demo last year, shedding its Project Arc moniker around that time. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-pubg-developers-new-pvp-shooter-looks-like-top-down-rainbow-six-siege-with-a-bit-of-hotline-miami">Ed Thorn</a> (RPS in peace) likened it to a "top-down Rainbow Six Siege with a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a>" based on the initial trailer. The latest look at it, which I've embedded above, shows of more of the shootouts in confined rooms and coridoors which fuelled that view.</p>
<p>This time, there's a throbbing grime beat pulsating as the battlers get up to tactical hijinks in the name of cutting off each others' sightlines. Think a less lonely Escape from Duckov, but made by people who always buy the entire aisle of heavy-duty tape and wooden planks whenever they visit a hardware store.</p><p>Armed with that sort of gubbins, the mission of you and your team of up to five fellow Plunkbatters is to hack into each building's hidden Crypt by installing a decrypter. One side are tasked with going the offensive to reach the crypt and hack it, with the other are tasked with holding ground and defending it while they do the same.</p>
<p>The team behind Blindspot say the early access version - which is set to be free-to-play - will focus on nailing the core experience, with a 5v5 online PvP match base getting regular system refinements, class/weapon balance passes, and new additions. They've not put forth any figures in terms of how long early access'll last, instead saying that'll "depend on development progress and player feedback". As such, the full launch'll happen whenever they feel the thing's ready for it.</p>
<p>While Blindspot'll be free to try out of the gates next month, Krafton do make clear that "after the official release, we plan to offer bundles at various price points, as well as a variety of in-game items".</p>
<p>If you fancy giving it a go, top-down Plunkbat's wishlistable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the years preceding the release of the sequel trilogy, a quite infamous and entertaining Star Wars fan theory began circulating online. The idea was simple: Jar Jar is Evil. The delightfully wacky Gungan was never meant to be comic relief, but rather the true villain of the prequel trilogy. According to the theory, George Lucas had originally planned to reveal Jar Jar as the saga’s ultimate puppet master, only to abandon the twist after audiences reacted poorly to the character following <em>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em>. Some fans treated the theory as a genuine missed opportunity, others as a long-running joke—but nearly everyone agreed it was fun to imagine an alternate Star Wars timeline where “Darth Jar Jar” was real.</p>
<p>That alternate timeline now appears to be alive and well—at least in brick form. LEGO has wholeheartedly embraced this playful “what if” scenario with its LEGO Star Wars The Dark Falcon set.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/"> As we kick off the new year, Amazon is offering the set at a 17% discount, dropping the price from its usual $180 down to $148,</a> a $32 savings on one of the more unusual and conversation-starting Star Wars builds in recent memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Dark Falcon exists in a twisted mirror version of the Star Wars universe, where heroes and villains have swapped moral alignments. The iconic Millennium Falcon design is reimagined in sleek jet black with striking red accents, immediately evoking Sith aesthetics rather than Rebel scrappiness. That theme extends to the minifigures as well, each offering a role reversal that ranges from clever to downright absurd.</p>

<h2>Your Favorite Star Wars Characters, But Wrong</h2>
<p>Front and center is the figure fans have joked about for years: Darth Jar Jar. The Naboo native finally gets his moment as a full-fledged Sith, complete with a menacing double-bladed red lightsaber reminiscent of Darth Maul’s. Rey joins him on the dark side, also wielding a double-bladed red saber—though this one runs parallel, like a tuning fork. C-3PO reappears as a bounty hunter, keeping much of his familiar silhouette but taking on a far tougher persona and red-glowing eyes.</p>
<p>On the flip side, classic villains get heroic makeovers. Darth Vader becomes Jedi Vader, dressed in a clean white outfit and wielding a blue lightsaber like he did in his Anakin Skywalker days. Then there’s the most unsettling transformation of all: Luke Skywalker. No longer the noble Jedi, but also not a villain the way you’d expect with this pattern going. Instead, Luke has embraced a bizarre, laid-back beach lifestyle. LEGO’s design makes him look less like a galactic hero and more like The Dude from The Big Lebowski, blue milk in hand and vibes fully off.</p>



<p>Beyond the minifigures, The Dark Falcon is packed with interactive features. The 1,579-piece set measures over 5 inches tall, 7 inches long, and 12.5 inches wide. Flip-up panels reveal a detailed interior, while spring-loaded shooters let you fire off lasers. There’s a removable throne for Darth Jar Jar, a jail cell for Beach Luke, and an opening cockpit that seats two minifigures.</p>
<p>This strange reimagining isn’t tied to traditional Star Wars canon, but instead to LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy, a four-episode animated series that debuted on Disney+ in 2024. Whether you’re a longtime fan of the Darth Jar Jar theory or simply enjoy seeing Star Wars turned upside down, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">The Dark Falcon LEGO set is a standout collector’s piece—especially at $32 off for a limited time.</a></p>

            <p>The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> have traded more blows following a preliminary tribunal hearing this week. There, the IWGB asked a judge to grant the fired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> developers interim relief.</p>
<p>Interim relief is a method of financial support for people awaiting a full hearing. If the motion is granted, the fired GTA 6 workers will go back on Rockstar's payroll, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims">IGN reports</a> - presumably until an overall outcome is reached.</p>
<p>The IWGB said in a statement issued to IGN that, "We hope this week's tribunal will grant urgently needed relief to the workers whose lives were turned upside down by Rockstar's brutal union-busting, leaving them and their families without incomes, without secure futures, and in some cases without even the right to remain in the country they have made their home.</p>

<p>"However, no matter the outcome of this interim hearing, we remain confident in the strength of the case we have brought against Rockstar Games. We reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 of our members, and we look forward now to the day we face them in court for a full and substantive tribunal hearing."</p><p>Rockstar suddenly fired 34 staff in November last year (31 of them in the UK, hence being covered by the IWGB) who happened to be unionising. Rockstar, however, said this was not why they were fired, pointing to alleged gross misconduct instead. Rockstar said the fired staff shared confidential information with people outside of the company on Discord.</p>
<p>The dismissals went viral and sparked protests outside of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a>'s studio in Edinburgh, Scotland, and even reached parliament in the UK, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">prime minister Keir Starmer calling the sudden firings "deeply concerning"</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage"</em></blockquote>
<p>"This case is not just about the suffering of the 31 people who lost their livelihoods in the blink of an eye," the IWGB added. "This is about the arrogance of a company like Rockstar thinking that its size and profitability grant it an unlimited licence to abuse its workers, and to do so with impunity."</p>
<p>Rockstar denied all claims in a counter-issued statement. "We have consistently made clear that we took necessary action against a group of individuals across the UK and Canada who discussed highly confidential information," Rockstar told IGN, "including relating to game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an insecure and public social channel. This was a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies.</p><p>"We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does. Global interest in our games is unparalleled. Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage - as we have seen in the past - and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team.</p>
<p>"This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorised releases of information - and we always will."</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/08/orks-get-the-perfect-cinematic-trailer-for-dawn-of-war-4/</link>
            <guid>1400284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a> has been released, introducing the Orks to the game in pretty much perfect fashion. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 – Official Ork Faction Trailer | IGN First" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pF5eVltokAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the Gork or Mork-ified space hulk that the Orks are cruising through space on has been kitted out with a big red button so that they can, to quote the Warboss that punches it, “crash faster” into the planet while in hot pursuit &nbsp;of the Blood Ravens Space Marines that they’re chasing after.</p>
<p>It’s the culmination of a wonderfully rendered cinematic trailer that sees the Orks attack an Imperial ship and board it to go toe-to-toe with the Space Marines, who are eventually forced to abandon ship of drop pods and Thunderhawks.</p>

<p>Of course, you probably want to see the actual game in action at this point, and King Art Games have done that too in the last few weeks with the ‘Sons of Caliban’ gameplay trailer released in December.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV - &quot;Sons of Caliban&quot; Dark Angels Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KGC_MKhAGzg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This shows off the Dark Angels chapter in action, not long after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-story-trailer-reveals-a-dark-angels-team-up/">their own cinematic trailer reveal</a>. As formidable as a Space Marine Chapter is, the Blood Ravens are in dire need of help through Dawn of War 4, and the Dark Angels themselves are turning up to assist.&nbsp;You’ll get to play as both chapters, with Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael leading the Dark Angels into the fray. King Art have also teased that Dark Angels Primarch Lion El’Jonson could be playable at some point in the campaign, which would be a landmark moment for 40K in general, not just video games!</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV has been entrusted to Iron Harvest developer King Art Games and publisher Deep Silver. It’s a new leaf for the franchise, which was created by Relic Entertainment way back in 2004 and defined a new style of real time strategy with less focus on resource gathering and base building, and more on controlling the map and battlefield. Dawn of War enjoyed a good few expansions before Dawn of War 2 explored a more tactical approach in 2009, and Dawn of War 3 sought to blend them all together.</p>
<p>The interest in having King Art work on Dawn of War IV was organised by Games Workshop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawn-of-war-4-devs-on-taking-over-from-relic-the-health-of-real-time-strategy-and-reviving-a-legend-of-the-genre">some time before Iron Harvest’s release in 2020.</a> It’s not known if GW initially wanted to stick with Relic, but that time frame would have been around the time that Relic was focussed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/25/age-of-empires-4-review/">Age of Empires IV</a> and later <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>. Relic has since gone through the tumult of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">layoffs while under Sega’s ownership in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">independence with an investor buyout in 2024</a>. They had plenty of things going on, in other words, but King Art had proven themselves with their steampunk RTS and could be great new stewards for this series. We look forward to seeing more in the run up to its 2026 release.</p>

<p>Speaking during the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY?si=zn4dBqixRVCBcuh4t0NBYg%0A&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=97d1ebf012ea4933"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">latest episode of the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Button Mash</em> podcast</strong></a>, the known journalist commented on the current state of the game, saying: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"The last I've heard, it was still not content complete. They're still finishing things up, finalizing levels, missions, seeing what's going to make it into the game. They're still making stuff and will hopefully be done with that soon</em></strong>."</p>



<p>Commenting on the current <strong>November 19 release date</strong> for <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong>, Schreier said: <strong><em>"It’s really hard to say right now, and I don’t think anyone at Rockstar can tell you with 100% certainty that they will make it out in November."</em></strong> However, it is too early to panic as Schreier thinks <em><strong>"this [November 2026 release] feels a little bit more real than Fall 2025 did."</strong> </em></p>



<p>Still, even if the game were to receive another delay, it could be a small one of a few months as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Take-Two</strong> would still want to hit its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">financial targets</strong> for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fiscal year ending on March 31, 2027</strong>, giving <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Rockstar Games</strong> a little more time to release the game.</p>



<p>As expected, a part of the <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong> community entered <strong>"Panic Mode"</strong> upon learning that the game might not be content-complete yet, anticipating an almost certain delay. However, <strong>Jason Schreier</strong> himself posted a pointed clarification based on the pattern for previous games: <strong><em>"Yes, directly after saying that with Red Dead 2 they delayed it twice and I wouldn't be shocked if that's the same pattern, and directly before saying that while with game development you can never be 100% certain, this feels more solid than previous dates did."</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-sort-of-content-then-is-already-in-grand-theft-auto-vi"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">What Sort of</strong><strong> </strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Content, Then, Is Already In Grand Theft Auto VI?</strong></h2>



<p>While knowing that <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong> is not yet content complete doesn't tell us a whole lot, knowing what's already been implemented in the game would definitely make fans even more excited.</p>



<p>As of now, very little is currently known about the game, as the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">two trailers</a></strong> released to date have not shown a lot in terms of gameplay. However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q72olz/gta6_gamerolls_leak_basically_confirmed/"><strong>the recent firing of Rockstar Games employees</strong></a> due to their supposed leaking of information regarding the game has essentially confirmed an older list of leaked information shared by <a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_"><strong><em>GameRoll</em></strong>.</a></p>



<p><strong>Among the leaked features that will supposedly be in Grand Theft Auto VI are:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>A six-star wanted system</strong>,</li>



<li><strong>A relationship bar</strong> that works like the <strong>honor system</strong> in <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong></li>



<li><strong>Weight mechanics</strong></li>



<li><strong>Underwater exploration</strong></li>



<li><strong>Greeting and antagonizing NPCs</strong></li>



<li><strong>A Dual Protagonist system</strong> that allows players to control both <strong>Jason and Lucia</strong> at the same time</li>



<li><strong>A Dead-Eye-like ability for Jason</strong> that slows down time to reveal enemy's weak spots (which devs reportedly don't feel too keen on at the time of the leak)</li>



<li><strong>NPCs reacting to characters holding weapons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gore and dismemberment systems</strong> based on <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2's</em></strong> systems</li>



<li><strong>Limited weapon system</strong></li>

            <p>The world could certainly do with another game about slapping up Swastika-wearers right now. Thankfully, having finished off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, Machine Games are reportedly working on the previously teased Wolfenstein 3.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's according to reports from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Windows Central</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">Kotaku</a>. The former also claim the studio have a mysterious multiplayer game in the mould of Rainbow Six Siege on their plate.</p>
<p>Wolfenstein 3 being a thing Machine have moved on to post-Indy isn't all that surprising. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-devs-machinegames-tease-another-wolfenstein-game-we-have-a-story-to-tell">last year</a>, a documentary about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</a>, saw studio head Jerk Gustafsson mention having plans for a third entry which rounds out B.J. Blazkowicz's Nazi-blasting tale.</p>
<p>"That journey for B.J., even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [B.J.], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one," he said. "I think that's important to say, because - at least I hope - we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p>How a game developed by a studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">owned by Microsoft</a> and tasked with satirising Fascism as real-world far-right regimes continue to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/08/ukraine-war-briefing-allies-no-cast-iron-security-guarantees-yet">wage expansionist wars</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry">kidnap the leaders of nations</a> that happen to have oil in order to swiftly establish control, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/02/the-us-complicit-genocide-israel-gaza">support genocides</a> will fare is something that'll be intriguing to see. That said, not shying away from such challenges is the duty of any good satirist.</p>
<p>The same challenge'll be faced by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolfenstein-series-in-development-at-amazon-with-fallout-show-team-attached">Wolfenstein TV Series</a> that's currently in the works at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/05/way-past-its-prime-how-did-amazon-get-so-rubbish">Amazon</a>, which this next Wolfenstein will probably go hand-in-hand with in the name of corporate synergy. That's assuming the folks behind the adaptation are interested in taking it on.</p>

            <p>Netease has finally released a gameplay trailer for its pirate Adventure RPG Sea of Remnants, which showcases a variety of features including ship combat, open area exploration, drinking competitions, and Mahjong.</p>
<p>The trailer, published on the official Sea of Remnants YouTube account, has reached over 1.3m views in less than 12 hours. Just under six minutes in length, it highlights what players will actually be able to do in the wood-carved puppet world entirely with early in-game footage.</p>
<p>According to the game's Steam page, it'll feature a dynamic weather system based, over 300 companions, and a mix of sea combat and turn-based party fighting. It's also free-to-play, with a 2026 release window.</p>

<p>Sea of Remnants is being developed by Joker Studio, which previously worked on an asymmetrical horror game also featuring a distinct gothic art style with doll characters. That game, also free, featured crossovers with a variety of popular franchises like Dangenrompa, Persona, and even KFC.</p><p>Sea of Remnants <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">was first revealed to the world at a Sony State of Play last June</a>. For those who like the look of this interesting new venture into open waters, a testing period is kicking off this month <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/">that you can sign up for on the game's official Steam store page</a>.</p>
<p>Sea of Remnants is of course just one Netease game set to come out in the near future. While Sea of Remnants appears to be tackling the free-to-play market, the Chinese gaming giant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blood-message-reveal-trailer-netease">is also tackling the AAA single player space with the upcoming Blood Message</a>. Though, in that game's case, no release date has been revealed.</p>

            <guid>1400260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Having rattled off a multitude of our most wanted video game releases of 2026, let’s keep the train rolling. As we enter our top 20, we see the return of some familiar faces as well as some exciting new IP fresh out of Japan. Why don’t we kick off with our first Capcom game on the list?</p>
<h2>20 – Pragmata</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 24th April 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally thought to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pragmata">Pragmata</a> is a new sci-fi action adventure from the Monster Hunter and Street Fighter publisher. You play as Hugh and Diana, an astronaut and his android companion looking to uncover the mysteries of a lunar research station that has been overrun by hostile artificial intelligence. The protagonists have a symbiotic relationship that weaves its way into Pragmata’s combat, navigation, and puzzle-solving gameplay with Hugh doing the heavy lifting as Diana employs her hacking abilities right in the middle of battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pragmata World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6YCL6UW1lI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>To explain what that’s all about, we went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a> last year, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy.”</p>

<p>There’s a demo currently available on PC, which will hopefully make its way to consoles ahead of its launch this Spring.</p>
<h2>19 – Romeo Is A Dead Man</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 11th February 2026</em></p>
<p>The latest game to come from the wonderfully wacky mind of Suda51 and the Grasshopper Manufacture studio, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> knows its audience. Seriously, just go and watch the announcement trailer. For those who love the ultra-violent, super-stylish No More Heroes series, this feels like somewhat of an evolution, dialling the strangeness factor up to 11 as players assume the role of Romeo Stargazer, a reanimated space-time FBI agent tasked with hunting fugitives across the cosmos. The game already looks to have a memorably twisted cast of fun characters – let’s just hope that, amidst the on screen carnage, there’s a decent action game in there too.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Story Introduction Trailer / 『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』ストーリー紹介編トレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EryjLSG0x_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>18 – The Duskbloods</h2>
<p><em>Nintendo Switch – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>For the umpteenth time, no, this isn’t <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bloodborne">Bloodborne 2</a>. Nintendo and FromSoftware certainly had us going there for a minute during their announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> Direct showcase. The gothic, Yharnam-like setting and haunting atmosphere seemed to suggest that Nintendo had somehow swept Bloodborne out of Sony’s clutches, but this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Duskbloods – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a FromSoftware joint, The Duskbloods will naturally inherit some of that Bloodborne DNA, though there are some key distinctions. Firstly, there are vampires. Secondly, it’s a primarily multiplayer game, featuring online PvPvE. Following the success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, it will be interesting to watch FromSoftware continue to pursue its live service gaming ambitions alongside its more traditional brand of action RPG.</p>
<h2>17 – Fable</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>Oh, to have the patience of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> superfan. It’s been 15 long years since the last main entry in this once-beloved Xbox series and while Fable wasn’t perfect (missing many of the lofty features promised by zany franchiser frontman, Peter Molyneux) it felt like a mainstay in the RPG. Until it completely vanished, of course, leaving behind a trail of half-baked spin-offs and the wisp of dream that one day we might see a Fable 4. The wait is finally almost over, hopefully, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/fable-delayed-2026-new-gameplay-clips/">a sequel or reboot scheduled to launch sometime this year.</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fable - Release Window Trailer | Xbox Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6sREGbfzRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides some pre-alpha footage we’ve seen very little of the game in action, though it looks to retain that familiar high fantasy vibe with plenty of witty humour and monster-slaying as players return to Albion.</p>
<h2>16 – Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/10/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review/">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> will be celebrating its eighth anniversary later this year. It’s also hard to imagine that 2026 will see yet another reincarnation of gaming’s favourite gunslinging archaeologist, first appearing in a remake of Lara Croft’s original adventure.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-reimagines-laras-original-adventure/">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a> will offer a complete modernisation of the first game, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 and starring new lead actress, Alix Wilton Regan, who will also take lead in next year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis/">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[StarRupture Stabilizer Blueprint Location, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starrupture-stabilizer-blueprint-location/</link>
            <guid>1400257</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>StarRupture has plenty of secrets hidden away on the map, and finding the Stabilizer Blueprint is a key part of progression, though it’s hard to pinpoint the exact location if you don’t know where to look.</p>



<p>Creepy Jar has plenty planned during early access of StarRupture, as shown by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starrupture-early-access-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed roadmap</a>, and there’s lots to enjoy before the eventual 1.0 release further in the future.</p>



<p>If you’ve reached a sticking point in StarRupture and don’t know where to find the Stabilizer Blueprint, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-stabilizer-blueprint-in-starrupture">Where to Find The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Here’s the spot. Image via Creepy Jar</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture is hidden away in a specific location a long way from the game’s starting point, so travelling to the location requires preparation.</strong></p>



<p>The exact spot, shown in the image above, is northeast of the starting point in the game. If you have a map and have already travelled near the location, it will be shown as a dark blue area on the map.</p>



<p>Before starting your travel, stock up on food, water, and weapons, as the trip can be perilous and weapons are required to defeat the arachnids that are waiting at the location.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-stabilizer-blueprint-in-starrupture">How to Get The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture</h2>



<p><strong>Visiting the location where the Stabilizer Blueprint is found is merely the starting point to earn the reward, as there are a few steps to tick off before you can add it to your collection.</strong></p>



<p>The location is covered by a blue cloud, which needs to be cleared by destroying the blue spores scattered around the buildings, and you’ll also need to fend off the alien species that call the area home, which is why bringing a weapon was crucial.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of the steps to take to claim the Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture.</p>



<ol>
<li>Destroy the blue spores around the location, found attached to buildings, and eliminate hostile aliens.</li>



<li>Loot all the buildings to collect valuable resources.</li>



<li>Head to the broken stairs and clear out more of the blue spores.</li>



<li>Follow the path of broken platforms and stairs around the tallest area in the location, clearing out the blue spores as you encounter them.</li>



<li>At the top, clear out the final blue spores and loot everything you can.</li>



<li>The Stabilizer Blueprint is waiting in a nearby Storage Box.</li>
</ol>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Ranked Release Date]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-release-date/</link>
            <guid>1400254</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Forget SBMM, the grittier competitors in the CoD community want Ranked and nothing but Ranked. The competitive mode is the usual hunting ground for more serious Call of Duty players, making a Black Ops 7 Ranked Play game mode a necessity—and release date info is known.</p>



<p>A casual game of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-discount-by-50-percent-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is great (with or without SBMM), but Ranked is where the strong and the weak are separated. Ranked Play is a whole different bullet-filled beast. You can literally taste the sweat of try-hards and the feeling of isolation as players lose access to the meta gear they’d normally dominate a non-Ranked game with.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve been looking forward to BLOPS 7 Ranked since day one or feel you’re ready to make the step up, this guide has everything you need to know about Ranked Play.</p>







<h2 id="h-ranked-play-release-date-for-black-ops-7-explained">Ranked Play Release Date For Black Ops 7, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s going to get sweaty. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ranked Play is dropping with Black Ops 7 Season 2’s start date, and this is expected to be February 5.</strong></p>



<p>Using <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-starts-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded</a> and basic data from previous seasons (and the Battle Pass), it’s almost certain that Season 2 is kicking off on February 5. There are rumors that Season 2 could be just as big as Season 1 in terms of content, but it could even eclipse the game’s debut season!</p>



<p>Maps are great, new guns can change the meta, and you’ll never say no to a fresh game mode. However, the hardcore fanbase just wants Ranked Play, and Season 2 should be delivering it to your doorstep on launch day.</p>



<p>We’ll update you if there are any changes to this timeframe.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-ranked-mode-in-black-ops-7-from-launch">Why Isn’t Ranked Mode In Black Ops 7 From Launch?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The body and mind are ready. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 didn’t launch with Ranked as it’s presumably a bid from Treyarch to get players used to the game first before launching a fully fledged Ranked Mode.</strong></p>



<p>Pros and elite-level CoD players can jump into Ranked and not struggle, for the most part. But if you give casuals the chance to hop straight into Ranked, it could be a humbling and even sour experience for those wanting to enjoy Call of Duty. It could put people off altogether.</p>



<p>This is why every Call of Duty title doesn’t get Ranked until a few weeks into launch. It also allows the meta to settle—so people aren’t abusing broken guns in Ranked—and gives Treyarch time to adjust accordingly, instead of on the fly.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 Season 2 should finally bring Ranked Play. It’s time to find your ideal loadout, team up with trusted partners, and prepare for the joy and agony of promotion and relegation in Ranked leagues.</p>

            <guid>1400251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>The rumor smoke surrounding <strong>the third The Witcher 3 DLC</strong> gets even larger today, as two prominent Polish websites confirm <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous report from the analyst firm <strong>Noble Securities</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <strong>IGN Poland</strong> <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?fbclid=IwY2xjawPKJn1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote an article about this</a>, revealing that they have known about the potential new expansion for 'a very long time'. They didn't report anything until now because, albeit credible, the information only came to them from a singular source. </p>



<p>Anyway, they have now revealed that, at least back then, they heard <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> was looking into expanding the game toward a brand new region: the desert of <strong>Zerrikania</strong>. This would provide a much-needed contrast with the existing regions of <strong>Velen</strong>, located in northern <strong>Temeria</strong> and featured in the base game, and <strong>Toussaint</strong>, the small autonomous duchy added with the second The Witcher 3 DLC, <strong>Blood and Wine</strong>. However, IGN Poland concedes that things may have changed since they first got a hold of the rumor, and as such, the addition of <strong>Kovir and Poviss</strong> is also possible, especially as it would set the stage for the upcoming <strong>The Witcher IV</strong> game, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't launch until at least <strong>2027</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Today, the Polish website <strong>PPE</strong> also <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/395072/trzeci-dodatek-do-wiedzmina-3-rozegra-sie-w-zerrikanii-ujawniono-mase-konkretnych-szczegolow.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared another confirmation that a new DLC is indeed on the way</a>:</p>



<p><em>We, at PPE, can also confirm these revelations – we heard about the new Wild Hunt project from our sources a year ago. We were clearly told in the first half of 2025 that The Witcher 3 would receive new, major content "that we will love."</em></p>



<p>As the saying goes, where there's too much smoke, there's also likely to be fire. Before these reports, nobody expected the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-celebrates-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ten-year-old masterpiece</a> to receive new content so late, given that CD Projekt RED was very busy working on the new installment. They must have partnered with another developer to offload most of the work, as according to the studio's latest report, only 22 employees were working on 'other', unspecified projects, while everyone else was doing something other than a new The Witcher 3 DLC.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G6sZHd-XwAAhDiX-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>One potential partner is <strong>Fool's Theory</strong>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already working with CD Projekt RED</a> on the <strong>remake of the first The Witcher</strong>, though this is just speculation. Anyway, if there really is a third The Witcher 3 DLC coming this year, an official announcement may not be so far away. Until then, stay tuned to hear the latest rumors and leaks.</p>

            <p>A preliminary employment tribunal hearing has seen the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) request that a judge grant interim relief to the 31 UK-based GTA 6 developers fired by Rockstar, reportedly following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">discussion of changes to Rockstar's company Slack policies</a> by staff on Discord. The union, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company over the dismissals last year, continue to assert that they were a form of union busting. Rockstar, meanwhile, have released a fresh statement claiming that the root of this is simply stopping info about GTA 6 from leaking.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If this interim relief requested by the IWGB as they represented the fired devs during the preliminary hearing at Scotland's Glasgow Tribunals Centre on January 5th is granted, the workers would receive support designed to prevent them running into financial problems while both sides wait for the date of a full hearing to be set. In this case, if the relief's granted, the staff will be put back on Rockstar’s payroll and have any necessary work visas reinstated during the time it takes the full hearing date to be penned in.</p>
<p>As outlined on <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/interim-relief">the website</a> of the UK's Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), deciding whether to grant interim relief involves an employment tribunal looking into the facts of what the fired employee claims and making a judgement as to whether they're likely to win at the full hearing. "Likely to win means having a 'pretty good chance', not just 'more likely than not'. Interim relief applications are usually about complex issues, so meeting the 'pretty good chance' threshold can be difficult," ACAS write.</p>
<p>The preliminary hearing's also see both the IWGB and Rockstar share their versions of the story again in statements to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims">IGN</a>. "No matter the outcome of this interim hearing, we remain confident in the strength of the case we have brought against Rockstar Games," the IWGB said, once again accusing Rockstar of union busting. "We reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 of our members, and we look forward now to the day we face them in court for a full and substantive tribunal hearing."</p><p>Rockstar, meanwhile, once again denied the union's union busting accusations, asserting that this has all been about preventing GTA 6 leaks. In this case, the company specified to IGN that it believes that info about GTA 6's features, comments about how its development is progressing, and timelines to its launch were at risk of going public and potentially affecting Take-Two's share price.</p>
<p>"We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does. Global interest in our games is unparalleled," Rockstar said. "Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will."</p>
<p>Amid that slightly flex-heavy chatter, the studio also denied firing any staff who "posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies" and said they don't keep a "blacklist" of union members.</p><p>

We'll see whether the fired devs request for interim relief's granted, as this story which has attracted attention from UK politicians - including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">Prime Minister Keir Starmer</a> - rumbles on.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> may not yet be “content complete”, according to anonymous sources cited by Bloomberg’s scooper-dooper journoman Jason Schreier, and he would not be “super shocked” if the new Miami-set <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> were delayed again, though he thinks the current 19th November 2026 release date is relatively solid.</p><!--more-->
<p>Before we Press X to Jason, it's time for an exciting recap montage of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> release setbacks. Back in May 2024, Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-of-grand-theft-auto-6-likes-aka-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-coming-next-fall">narrowed</a> an initial GTA 6 2025 launch window to fall 2025, with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">commenting</a> in November that “we are highly confident in that timing”, despite mounting rumours that the new GTA would slip back.</p>
<p>Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">reiterated that confidence</a> in February 2025. Three months later, Take-Two and Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">delayed GTA 6</a> to May 26th 2026. Then in November 2025, the publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">shoved it back to November this year</a>.</p>
<p>None of this is massively surprising – videogames are messy productions and GTA games are both vast in scope and burdened by radioactive levels of expectation. Still, pour one out for the other developers who’ve been dancing back and forth with their own release dates, in a bid to avoid getting sat on by Rockstar’s glossy crime bonanza.</p><p>Schreier thinks GTA 6 might run into another delay, based on his most recent conversations with sources (he didn't give an exact timeframe). “I mean, this is how Rockstar works, or at least has worked in recent decades, I suppose in the last decade with Red Dead 2,” he observed in an interview with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY?si=JIwZIRXoTgWdYv4d1D14OA&amp;pi=EqnPagS3R0iu_&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=aabde7b92a5d4dbe&amp;flow_ctx=9ae1964a-027a-44b9-b7f0-fa9bc4e75989%3A1767884945#login">The Ringer-Verse Button Mash podcast</a>. “If you look at the history there, they announced it for fall 2017, then it slipped the spring 2018 and then it slipped again to fall 2018 and there it landed October of that year.”</p>
<p>“So I wouldn't be super shocked if that is what happens again this time around,” Schreier continued. “This is a big and complicated game and the last I heard it was still not content complete. That is to say that people were still finishing things up, still finalising levels and missions, and seeing what's going to make it into the game. Typically the way that game development works, you have your feature complete, your content complete, your bug-testing phases.</p>
<p>“And there's a lot of boundaries blurred along the way, in all of those different stages, but they are still still making stuff. And we'll hopefully be done with that soon and just have a whole bunch of time for fixing bugs. But even during those phases, there's always someone who wants to sneak in some last minute stuff. So it's really hard to say.”</p>
<p>Schreier added that “I don’t think anyone in Rockstar could tell you with 100% certainty that they will make it out in November, but I think this feels a little bit more real than fall 2025 did.
That was never real and even more real than May [2026] did.”</p><p>In discussion of GTA 6’s release delays, Zelnick has repeatedly lauded Rockstar for chasing “perfection”. It’s a bit of a double-edged compliment, needless to say. Perfection may be undefinable, but any perceptible imperfections here are going to have steep financial consequences.</p>
<p>“With a game like this, the stakes are so high, they really can't settle for anything less than perfection with this release, because there's so much riding on it,” Schreier continued on the podcast. “The stock of Take Two lives or dies on this game - every time this game slips, their shares drop 10%, I should say. So yeah, it's not something that they will release in any sort of compromised state. So even if it comes to like October and they're like, you know, the game is not 100% ready, I suspect they would rather slip than release it.”</p>
<p>Schreier added that by picking a November date, Rockstar and Take Two have given themselves a little breathing room to get the game out before Take-Two’s fiscal 2027 earnings report in March 2027. “Obviously they would want to be out for the holiday season and Black Friday and all the beautiful Christmas sales that they always do. But I think they have a little bit of buffer to next March if they still want to release the game within the fiscal year.”</p>
<p>All of this risks being academic to us Rock Paper Shotgunners, because GTA 6 has still yet to be formally confirmed for PC. Schreier had little to say about possible PC dates, but did observe that GTA 6 is a particularly big game for PlayStation, with sales on Xbox “almost a non-factor” by comparison. “In some ways it's kind of like a PlayStation exclusive, in that most of the sales will be on PlayStation and it will sell a lot of PlayStation 5s alongside it. So I suspect that Sony is planning its entire calendar around GTA and will not release anything within the blast zone.” This is useful intel, inasmuch as we can deduce Rockstar’s thinking from Sony’s movements.</p><p>Even as other developers, publishers and players gear up for this November’s GTAppening, Rockstar North face a legal challenge in the UK from former GTA 6 developers, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">say they were ousted for forming a union</a>. Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">contend that the fired developers were leaking confidential information</a> on a Discord forum. In a rare display of having an opinion publicly, UK prime minister Keir Starmer has called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">"a deeply concerning case"</a> that deserves further government investigation.</p>
