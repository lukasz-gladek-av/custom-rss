<p>Nintendo has finally acknowledged the slew of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks that have been hitting the internet.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s acknowledgment came following this week’s CES event in Las Vegas, where accessory manufacturer Genki revealed Nintendo’s Switch 2 models. Genki has revealed since the leaks that the images were created based on leaked information and not on seeing Switch 2.</p>



<p>However, the leaks have seemingly struck a nerve with Nintendo, who have acknowledged them in a rare occurrence. Speaking with Japanese website <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sankei</a>, Nintendo said that “these images and videos are not official.”</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, however, has quickly become one of the biggest open secrets in the entire industry, with almost everything to do with the console, including accessories, logos, specifications, and more leaking online.</p>



<p>As for when Nintendo will reveal the Nintendo Switch 2, it remains to be seen, but the sheer amount of leaks surrounding the console should indicate that it will be sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Regardless of its reveal and impending release, Nintendo will be hoping that the Switch’s successor is as successful as the original, which has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a> at the time of writing.</p>



<p>In comparison to other Nintendo consoles, the Wii U has sold 13.56 million units, the Wii has sold 101.63 million units, the DS with 154.02 million, the Game Boy Advance has sold 81.51 million units, the Game Boy has sold 118.69 million units, the GameCube sold 21.74 million units, Nintendo 64 sold 32.93 million units, the SNES sold 49.10 million units and the NES sold 61.91 million units.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/songs-of-silence-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Stunning. Few other words immediately describe Songs of Silence. Chimera Entertainment have, before anything else, fashioned a piece of gaming art that looks utterly incredible. This 4X strategic auto-battler does plenty of things differently from its genre peers, but its art nouveau-inspired visuals zing from the screen with the clarity of a fresh lemon. To say it’s refreshing would be an understatement.</p>
<p><iframe title="Songs of Silence - Story Trailer | OUT NOW! | Art Nouveau-inspired Fantasy Strategy Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5TFGFsCR60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Songs of Silence initially offers a series of Campaign missions that explore the conflict between Primordials and Celestials, with humanity caught between the two. These two forces pulled the world apart, leaving one of light and one of darkness, and while this initially led to a period of peace and enlightenment, it soon dissolved into bitter war. Humanity thought itself blessed by the Celestials, but now, under the incoming pestilence of Silence, the remaining humans struggle to survive.</p>


<p>You take on the role of Lorelai, the newly crowned queen of Ehrengard. Her kingdom has already fallen to Silence, and she traipses across the land with her remaining subjects in search of a new home. It’s not easily won though, and instead all she finds is more conflict and in-fighting between the nobles of the neighbouring kingdoms, before she then suffers a bitter betrayal.</p>
<p>It sets the scene for an intriguing fantasy tale, and one that doesn’t simply go for a gung-ho, binary vision of good and evil. It instead gives you a measured, often brutal depiction of war, and those who are worst affected by it. It’s then dressed up with excellent voice work and some of the most impressive character art you’ve ever seen in gaming, making it a genuine pleasure to take in.</p>


<p>Things start out in familiar fashion for the turn-based 4X genre. You move across the over-world map with a limited movement range, and you can enter into combat with any enemies within that. Once combat begins though, you soon discover that Songs of Silence is doing things differently. Battles are fundamentally skirmishes, with your army limited to a set number of units, though these can be buffed up by militia and other reserve units if you’re garrisoned in a location.</p>
<p>You choose your army’s starting positioning, but once you enter combat you don’t have direct control over the majority of your units, each one automatically attacking the nearest enemy in the vein of an auto-battler. What you do have is your deck of actions, with each of your army’s commanders having their own selection of cards to choose from. Each card provides a special ability or attack to help you on the way to victory. Initially, that’s a charge command, sending your mounted units plunging into the enemy ranks, while later cards see you calling winged creatures from the sky down upon them, or causing units to explode upon death.</p>

<p>While your units remain at the same level – it’s a shame not to be able to level up those who’ve been with you through many battles – each commander gains XP and levels up, growing your army and giving you a selection of new cards or the chance to upgrade an existing one. It means that your commander steadily grows in your chosen direction, letting you customise and tailor the abilities and attacks you prefer.</p>
<p>At first, it feels as though battles are short and easily won, but you soon discover that it’s crucial to choose the correct units, and that you’re not woefully underprepared, as Songs of Silence will merrily knock you on your beautifully drawn ass time and time again. You can exchange units between your commanders, and at times you need to make a last-ditch attempt at success by pooling your remaining units together for one final battle.</p>
<p>Songs of Silence makes battles feel hard-won, even though you don’t have full control of your army. You’ll still be there, nervously glancing at your ability cooldowns while trying to protect or resurrect a crucial unit in time. It feels rewarding and focussed, and I love that it’s doing things differently. It’s a real success.</p>
<p>Where Songs of Silence occasionally falls down is the way you select and interact with your units, and on console I was forever selecting the wrong thing, or accidentally moving a unit when I meant to choose another one. I had to tell myself which button to press consciously, and it creates a disconnect between you and the game. It could, of course, just be a personal fumble, but there’s something just that little bit off to the way it fits together here. I’d occasionally move a unit into the safety of a city, only to accidentally move them out again, using up the last of my movement, and stranding them in front of some incoming enemy units. Fortunately, it never ruined my chances, but it is an unnecessary frustration.</p>

<p>The Campaign can also fall into the trap of relying on pure power, and the way you acquire that is through repeated grinding and capturing enough locations to ensure you’ve got a steady stream of resources. It’s little different from how other strategy games function, but sometimes it feels more drawn out than it should be.</p>
<p>This is where Skirmishes come in. These battles allow you to generate random maps and go up against up to five AI-controlled enemies with a series of Fates that alter the gameplay in some way. At first, there won’t be a great deal here, but as you complete Campaign missions you unlock new characters, and additional Fates to switch things up. It’s a never-ending supply of action, and the underlying mechanics shine through when divorced from any narrative drive. Multiplayer against human opponents is identical, though I should note that there aren’t a whole lot of people playing online these days. You can offset that by joining the game’s Discord and finding like-minded players, which is what Songs of Silence points you to do. It’s well worth the extra effort.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a wonderful additional layer alongside the artistic visual flair, which is little surprise when it comes from Hitoshi Sakimoto, composer of Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy 12 and one of my personal favourites, Valkyria Chronicles. It brings drama and emotion to every encounter, with sweeping orchestral moments ensuring that you’re uplifted at just the right time, before plunging into the darkness and danger that lurks at various points.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-could-support-some-sort-of-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-may-be-scaled-down-from-xbox-series-s-versions.1078884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could support more than regular NVIDIA DLSS, as a recently filed patent outlines some brand-new tech that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">Digital Foundry</a> went through the 39 pages of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">patent</a> filed on December 31st, 2024, highlighting some interesting findings that go beyond the description of a standard NVIDIA DLSS-style upscaling. One of the most interesting findings is the confirmation that the upscaling method described in the patent, which is usually expensive in terms of compute power and bandwidth, is specifically targeted to be executed within the 120th or 160th of a second on a low-power chip, so it's most definitely not the usual DLSS seen in the PC desktop space.</p>
<p>Another equally interesting finding discovered in the Nintendo Switch 2 AI-upscaling patent is the description of something that could be labeled as dynamic AI-upscaling. According to this description, the model based upon real-time data coming from the game engine can be switched out in real-time or prepared ahead of time programmatically to use lower quality upscaling<br>
to fit within a certain frame time budget. Essentially, if the game is sending out an image that exceeds 16.6 milliseconds or 33.3 milliseconds, the device will use a lower-quality upscaling model to output the final 1080p image. This is obviously new tech that was never seen before in action and that may have been developed specifically for the Nintendo Switch 2, as something like this may not be needed in the PC desktop space unless for very low-power laptops, for example.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 patent is very broad, and describes all sorts of applications for AI-powered upscaling, such as neural decompression that could be used to bring file sizes down, and even cloud upscaling, going over various possibilities such as upscaling being done on the cloud and then sent via a stream to a local device, the upscaling getting done on the local device and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo's Switch 2 Upscaling Patent Explained: More Than Just DLSS?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4R1p1LjHME8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While AI-powered upscaling can do wonders, as shown over the past few years by NVIDIA DLSS, developers still need to get their games running decently on the Nintendo Switch 2, which could be a challenge considering the system won't be as powerful as any of the other current generation systems. According to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-and-speculation-ot-cmon-nintendo-announce-this-thing-already-up-dev-unit-leaked-partly-see-threadmarks.1077882/page-23#post-134076051">rumors</a> circulating online, there is a "movement" to try and get scaled-down Xbox Series S versions of games on the system, although it is not yet known if this has been successful so far, and with leaks having focused only on the hardware side of things, we will likely have to wait for the official reveal to see how multiplatform games will run on the system.</p>
<p>Speaking about leaks, Nintendo has finally acknowledged them in some way.&nbsp;<span>In a statement issued to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, the company said that the images and videos making the rounds are "not official."</span>&nbsp;What's interesting to note is that the company didn't say they are not accurate, so there's a solid chance we already got the first look at the system via all these leaks that have come in daily.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but at this point, it should only be a matter of days until we finally see what the Japanese company has in store for the future.</p>

            <p>As a few of you might know, each Sunday at 4pm GMT I run <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/booked-for-the-week">Booked For The Week</a> - a regular chat with a selection of cool industry folks about what they're reading, what they're hoping to read next, and what books they recommend. The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-nightingale-absolver-and-total-war-warhammer-writer-dan-griliopoulos"> was Dan Griliopoulos</a>, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-deus-ex-looking-glass-studios-and-othersides-warren-spector">was Warren Spector back in November</a>, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Hey, so if you recall I reserved the right to change my mind about anything on my “what I’m going to read next” list for your Bookshelf column," Spector emailed me last night. "Well I changed my mind completely and thought it might be fun and interesting to do an update. Feel free to ignore this, but here’s what I was thinking."</p>
<p>Obviously, I'm not going to ignore Warren Spector. I figured an update to the original post would just get buried, so here it is in full. "Is this just promotion for your bloody column, Nic?", you may ask. Au contraire, my little faithless banana bread tin. Is it promotion for <em>literature itself</em>. Cheers again to Warren.</p>
<blockquote><p>So in my recent entry in this website’s Bookshelves column I listed a bunch of books I was considering reading next. I did the logical thing and listed the books that were next to my reading chair or at the top of my Kindle library, but I reserved the right to change my mind. Good thing I did because, boy, did I change my mind!</p>
<p>I've done some interesting reading recently that I wanted to share. None of which had <em>anything</em> to do with the books I thought I was going to read. I’m not talking about <em>a</em> book, but several unrelated books that turned <em>out</em> to be related and are richer when read together than when read separately. All are exceptionally well-written. I strongly recommend each of them, but especially if you read all of them back-to-back. That’s a genuinely special experience. Or was for me anyway.</p>
<p>First, New York In The Fifties by Dan Wakefield. It's a history of the intellectual and creative history of the city from the late-Forties through the early-Sixties, mostly around Columbia University and Greenwich Village (West and East). The author was like the Zelig character in Woody Allen's movie. He knew the Columbia intellectuals, the Esquire and New Yorker writers, the Village Voice founders, the Beats, a ton of musicians, people caught up in the blacklist, C. Wright Mills, Norman Mailer, Jack Kerouac, Thomas Pynchon, Bob Dylan and more.</p>
<p>But then there's book number 2 -- Three Shades Of Blue by James Kaplan. It's the story of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Bill Evans (with lots about Charlie Parker, too) during the SAME PERIOD in the Village and mid-town (the jazz center of NYC). You get a completely different perspective on those years. It's fascinating. The author talks about specific songs and albums, all of which are streamable. I listened to the music he was talking about as I was reading, which enriched the experience greatly.</p>
<p>And THEN there's Positively 4th Street by David Hajdu, the story of the folk scene IN THE SAME PERIOD, also in the Village. It's mostly about Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Richard and Mimi Farina. Again, a different perspective on the period.</p>
<p>Next, I'm going to read a book called The Slip by Prudence Peiffer, about the art scene in the same place, same time. I anticipate that being fascinating for its perspective, too.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting things I learned is that ALL of these people hung out at a bar called The White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village -- ALL OF 'EM. Oh, to have been a fly on the wall!</p>
<p>Even if you're not interested in the time, place, or (seriously) the subject matter, the ways in which the books dovetail with one another makes for a fascinating reading journey. And you might just find yourself becoming interested in things you weren't interested in before.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am very happy to work at this website for many reasons, but high among them is game developers emailing me out of the blue at 8pm to passionately talk about the books they've read so I can share it to an audience of people that I'm 96% sure will mostly definitely give a shit. It makes me want to stay curious and excited and I hope you feel the same. Thank you again to Warren, and thank you to everyone who continues to read and comment on the column every week. As much as I'm always excited to speak to a new guest, some of my favourite times have been when I haven't been able to find anyone, but you've all still kept the conversation going with some great recommendations and thoughts. It feels like a very special and rare thing for a PC Gaming site and I plan to keep it going as long as possible.</p>
<p>Also, if you're a developer with a book habit please get in contact. I need new guests for the slate and I'm very lazy.</p>

            <p>"Oh, and one last thing..." teased the narration for yesterday's <a href="https://youtu.be/viAEO_cMqfU">Like A Dragon Direct</a> showcase on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</a>, before announcing that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will be getting New Game+ mode as part of a free post-launch update. It then cut to Majima and his crew making celebratory noises on deck. This follows last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Infinite Wealth</a> catching some backlash for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-seemingly-locks-new-game-behind-expensive-special-editions">decision to lock the mode</a> behind a £15/€15/$15 edition upgrade.</p>
<p>Unrelated, but I've decided to stop putting angry spiders through your letterbox every morning. I know, I know. Come on now. Hero is such a strong word.</p>

<p>The very talented scallywags at RGG also showed off some more of Majima's escapades, including his 'Mad Dog' and 'Sea Dog' fighting styles, making every pirate pun imaginable in the process. I mean, you'd have to. They'll of course be ship customisation and crew gathering, and I especially like the look of 'Madlantis' - a seedy den of swashbucklers stuffed with minigames. Naturally, a lot of the other environments will be familiar to anyone who explored Infinite Wealth's Hawaii. I know I'm not alone in admiring RGG's approach to asset and location reuse, freeing them up to focus on quirkier additions, and also letting you get familiar with their virtual cities over the course of several games.</p><p>I was not personally affected by the decision to charge for New Game+ last time around, because the last thing I felt like doing about finishing another 70 hours of Infinite Wealth was immediately playing another 70. Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Gaiden</a> entry, so it'll run shorter than the full-fat games - supposedly around 15 hours or so. I still thought it was a stinky choice, mind. Aside from new difficulty levels that effectively just made numbers go up, it was unambitious and uninteresting as far as NG+ modes go - 'unambitious' and 'uninteresting' being two words I usually wouldn't associate with the series at all. This one's out on the 21st of February.</p></div>

            <p>You will very soon be able to register to take part in the network test for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s upcoming co-op spin-off, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>.</p>
<p>Those who are keen to participate in the test can register from this afternoon at 2pm UK time.</p>
<p>The test itself is scheduled for 14th to 17th February, and will run in three hour blocks. On the 14th (so, Valentine's Day, and really, what is more romantic than Elden Ring?), the session will run between 11am and 2pm UK time. On the 15th, there will be two sessions. The first will run from 3am until 6am, the second will run between 7pm and 10pm. The session on the 16th will run between 11am and 2pm once again, and the final session on 17th will run from 3am until 6am.</p>

<p>Nightreign's test will be available across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, although the developer notes the full game will also be available to those on PC via Steam, as well as Xbox One and PS4 consoles.</p>
<p>"The network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch," reads the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test">information page for Nightreign's network test</a> (where I also presume a link for registration will also be made available). </p>
<p>"Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests."</p>

<p>Alongside a definition of what it deems to be harassment, the company said it reserves the right to cease providing support services or products, and to protect employees through legal action or criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>The policy does not specify examples of this harassment, though it's clearly been put in place as the result of such behaviour.</p>
<p>In particular, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> fandom is notorious for divided opinions on Aerith and Tifa and their relationships with Cloud.</p>
<p>"I say this with love: FF7 shippers need to touch noses," said Aerith voice actor Briana White back in December. "We're all the same family in loving these characters so relax."</p>

<p>Last January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-shippers-ruin-great-story-development-with-overt-sexualisation-says-cloud-voice-artist">Cloud voice actor Cody Christian</a> said shippers "ruin great story development" with overt sexualisation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> producer and director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has addressed abuse against the game's developers on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Back in January 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-naoki-yoshida-addresses-verbal-abuse-from-players">Yoshida addressed abuse aimed at developers</a>. "I mean, I can take it, even though it doesn't make it less bad, but staff members will feel really down after getting those words when they gave their absolute best into trying to create something where everyone can enjoy, and this may end up making them no longer create things that are fun from there on," he said.</p>
<p>Then last year, following the release of latest expansion Dawntrail, he commented on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/transphobic-abuse-sent-to-final-fantasy-14s-wuk-lamat-voice-actor-breaks-my-heart-says-naoki-yoshida">transphobic abuse sent to Wuk Lamat voice actor Sena Bryer</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid one of our staff members received very negative comments and it almost felt like a personal attack, which breaks my heart, because she worked really hard and these criticisms were not constructive at all," said Yoshida. "It doesn't do anything except make the staff lose motivation, and in the end that could potentially damage the quality of our game and take away from what makes this game so interesting. So if there are any sort of criticisms, bring it to me, because I'm the one approving this material. I wanted to reiterate that, please refrain from personal attacks against our staff."</p>
<p>While Square Enix should be commended for protecting its staff, it's sad that fan behaviour makes such a policy necessary.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donnie-yen-confirms-the-sleeping-dogs-movie-is-dead.1078845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Donnie Yen has taken to an interview with Polygon to confirm that the Sleeping Dogs movie that was announced in 2017 is officially dead in the water. Sleeping Dogs was released in 2012 as a spiritual successor to the True Crime games, and it allowed players to explore an open-world rendition of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>The game was universally praised and highly enjoyable, scoring great reviews before being ultimately overshadowed by GTA 5 just one year later. In the recent interview, Donnie Yen, who was set to star as protagonist Wei Shen, confirmed that it’s ‘an unfortunate thing’ that the project has failed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sleeping-dogs-lie">Sleeping Dogs Lie</h2>



<p>In the interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Donnie Yen explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights.</p>



<p>I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately… I don’t know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>



<p>Well, on to better things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since being ‘announced’ in 2017, almost nothing was mentioned about the live-action adaptation of Sleeping Dogs. It comes as a surprise that it was canned, and it’s likely someone, somewhere is kicking themselves. Right now, live-action representations of video games are going like gangbusters, soaring up the charts and winning awards worldwide.</p>



<p>The likes of Fallout and The Last of Us are testaments to that fact.</p>



<p>When the news dropped that Donnie Yen would be serving as the frontman in Sleeping Dogs, fans everywhere were slightly confused. After all, Wei Shen was originally played by Will Yun Lee, who served as the voice, face, and motion capture artist for the character – and Lee is also a renowned actor.</p>



<p>Regardless of those creative decisions, the Sleeping Dogs movie will never see the light of day.</p>

Exacerbating the backlash is that Sony has doubled down on this policy even for single-player games, such as God of War Ragnarök, Until Dawn, and now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier in 2024. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries"><u>Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC now suffer from this problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it announced the PSN requirement for Helldivers 2, Sony said it had to do with player security. “Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games,” Sony said in a statement issued at the time. “This is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behavior. It also allows those players that have been banned the right to appeal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps bracing itself for a backlash it knew was to come, Sony added: “We understand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step will help us to continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a part of. “Many thanks for your continued support of Helldivers 2!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered likely faces a similar backlash on launch that Sony’s other PC games have seen, despite the Steam warning months in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-naval-combat-looks-even-better-than-skull-and-bones/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAEO_cMqfU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio Direct</a>, the Japanese developer shared a lot of new info on their next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-new-trailer-shows-more-of-goro-majimas-new-pirate-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, which is slated to launch next month. The 13-minute video demonstrated ground combat, but its highlight was certainly naval combat, which fans have commented looks even better than Ubisoft's naval-only title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skull and Bones</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you agree or not, naval combat in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii certainly sounds quite deep. To begin with, players will get to fully customize the Goromaru pirate ship, including hull, armor, sails, and figurehead. The game also lets them hire their crew among a roster of over a hundred sailors, who have their own attributes and can subsequently be improved by deepening the crew's bonds through song, drink, adventure, and victory. They will then have to be optimally assigned to attack or defense operations.</p>
<p>Of course, a key component of naval combat is installing, upgrading, and firing cannons. This is where the IP's outlandish nature shines, offering options for energy cannons, laser cannons, and even 'shark cannons'. Of course, boarding is also available in the game, allowing the crews to come to blows in frenetic melee combat. Before the end of the video, the developers also confirmed that the New Game Plus mode will be added to the game for free after launch.</p>

<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin-off set after the events narrated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. Series mainstay Goro Majima is the lead character. At the start of the story, he washes on Rich Island with no recollection of his previous life.</p>
<p>The game is scheduled to be released on February 21 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>One or two lumps of annoyance in your morning coffee? Okay, here's one. You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/">Video Games Chronicle</a><a></a>, and sure enough, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">Steam page</a> for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The requirement for a PSN account to play certain games on PC became controversial after Sony tried to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">push the requirement</a> on players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, who were so miffed they review-bombed the game on Steam. In that case, the decision <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">was overturned</a>. </p>
<p>Since then, Sony has applied the mandatory account linking in an irregular way. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost Of Tsushima</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushimas-psn-login-requirement-will-stop-you-playing-multiplayer-on-steam-deck">didn't require it</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God Of War Ragnarock</a> did. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> didn't make it mandatory, but tried to sweeten the deal by giving players bonus cosmetics for linking their Steam and PSN accounts. Now it looks like Sony are confident <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II Remastered</a> is big enough to cause only annoyed tuts when it comes to this requirement. </p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons this mandatory account smooshing annoys folks is that it means the game will not go on sale in certain countries where PSN doesn't operate for legal or business reasons. Insider Gaming have compiled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/countries-that-dont-have-psn/">a list of countries</a> which don't have PSN. In Europe alone this list includes Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Moldova, Georgia, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. If you live in any of these PSNless places, you basically can't play the affected game. This is despite the fact that many of these games are entirely single player. </p><p>As for the reasons behind it, well. Sony's chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki recently spoke about the requirement in an investor call, and said the account linking was done "so that anybody can enjoy the game safely" (<a href="https://www.vg247.com/sony-not-giving-up-on-its-psn-requirement-on-pc">as reported by VG247</a>). But this hardly explains it. The more likely reasoning comes down to digital rights management - they want players to be online so they can check if the game is a legal copy. And this has become such a dogmatic part of their legal and technical process that it now requires cutting off entire markets. It seems a stupid strategy to exclude entire countries of possible sales just to enforce a DRM policy, but corporations are cash-huffing monsters, and do not necessarily value the sales numbers - projected or real - in some nations. </p>
<p>All in all, another example of corporate interest making things worse for everyone, thanks to the arcane legalities and unseeable arithmetic of business. For more lumps of news, please keep reading our website. I promise some of the lumps are actually good. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-10-to-6.1078827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s top ten time… kind of. We’ve got one final group of five, from ten down to six in our list, before we break things out and tackle the final bunch individually. But what games are going to be in this little group? Well, there’s a AAA selection here (if only through alliteration), and potentially a “quadruple-A” game that actually means it. But first, in at number 10…</p>
<h2>10 – Citizen Sleeper 2 Starward Vector</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW, PC – 31st January 2025</em></p>
<p>Sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/04/citizen-sleeper-episode-purge-review/">one of the most acclaimed indie games of 2022</a>, Citizen Sleeper 2 looks to take the same approach to its tabletop RPG narrative stylings, giving you a set of tools with which to navigate its rich narrative. There’s an overhauled dice system, new skills and, most significantly, a ship and a crew that you can customise for each Cycle as you take on jobs within the star system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DdETwG_eyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Still set in the Helion system, Citizen Sleeper 2 lets you hop into your ship, recruit a crew of characters to go with you and head out to explore the Belt, do jobs and get paid. You’re trying to escape your past, in which you fell under the control of a local criminal gang, rewriting your body’s code to do so, but introducing malfunctions to your system and having to run with a price on your head and no memories.</p>

<h2>9 – Avowed</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 18th February 2025</em></p>
<p>Will you save the world or doom it? That’s the choice that runs through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a>, as you gain more and more power on your journey as an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, tasked with investigating a spiritual plague that threatens the whole world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYvTNAaXMUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Avowed takes us back to the Living Lands, a mysterious islands in the fantasy world of Eora, which it shares with Obsidian’s previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/29/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review/">Pillars of Eternity</a> games. However, where those games were both top-down CRPGs and part of the genre’s revival over the past decade, Avowed is shifting back to one of Obsidian’s areas of expertise: first person action RPG adventuring. Avowed is not a fully open world game, but has several large open areas that you can explore and, in that regard, it might be comparable to one of Obsidian’s other acclaimed hits, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a>.</p>
<p>Originally set for release at the end of 2024, Xbox decided to hold off on Avowed’s launch in a busy release window to try and find a little bit of breathing room in early 2025. That…. hasn’t necessarily worked out, but with more time to polish and the promise of a first party Xbox game, this is certainly one to watch.</p>
<h2>8 – Atomfall</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 27th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Oh sure, Chornobyl and Three Mile might the most infamous nuclear plant accidents in history, but we can do good old fashioned meltdown with the best of them in old Blighty. OK, so the Windscale Fire wasn’t a meltdown, but as it burned for several days, sprinkled nuclear material across the UK and to the continent, and was part of a government cover up, it’s pretty up there.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Atomfall - Release Date Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_07x5LvQiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what were they covering up, <em>really</em>? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> spins us off into an alternate version of events where the surrounding area was rapidly locked down, the locals kept in line and monitored by the military group Protocol, and advanced retro-futuristic technology the order of the day. Can you unpick the mystery?</p>
<p>It might look like a very English Fallout, but this is a rather different style of game, where scarcity of resources plays a big factor in pushing you to melee – you get to fight roving bands of bandits dressed like Morris dancers – and investigating the story will be a bigger part of the experience.</p>
<h2>7 – Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-20th-march-2025/">20th March 2025</a></em></p>
<p>Fans have been demanding an Assassin’s Creed set in Japan pretty much since 2007, and they’re finally going to get what they want with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> – even if it’s been embroiled in a disappointingly inevitable amount of internet discourse, thanks in no small part to featuring a black immigrant samurai as one of the two playable characters. That’s something that Ubisoft has at times struggled to communicate well with fans and gamers around the world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga. The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those persky Templars. Their stories will be intertwined, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>
<h2>6 – GTA 6</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Late 2025</em></p>
<p>It might almost seem sacrilegious for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> not to be topping our most wanted chart, and yet here we are. We’ve no doubt that, for the global gaming population, GTA 6 is set to be another defining cultural event, much like GTA 5 was back in 2013, but it’s not quite got our juices flowing the same way as the games that have made it into the top 5. Still, we’re as keen as anyone to see that second trailer…</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story, featuring Lucia as the first female protagonist in the series, getting out of prison at the start of the game after a bit of “bad luck”. Revisiting Vice City, this is a modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, deeply influenced by the&nbsp;breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular.</p>
<p>Take Two has targeted the back end of 2025 for release, though given the scale and ambition of these games, we wouldn’t be surprised to see this slip to early 2026, sneaking into the same financial year.</p>
<p><em>We’ve rattled through out Most Wanted 2025 lists so far, but it’s time for a little break, I think. We’ll see you on Monday for #5 and round this out through next week.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-fights-against-its-designation-as-a-chinese-military-company-by-the-us-department-of-defense.1078824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-against-its-designation-as-a-chinese-military-company-by-the-us-department-of-defense/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese corporation Tencent has <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will fight its inclusion in the list of Chinese military companies <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-00070.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided by the US Department of Defense</a>. Earlier this week, the news caused a significant drop (around 10%) in the company's stock.</p>
<p>Tencent is seeking a negotiation with the US Department of Defense but may also initiate a lawsuit if it cannot reach an agreement. Here's the full official statement:</p>
<p><em>As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the CMC List is a mistake. Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group.</em></p>
<p><em>The CMC List is also distinct from the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List (NS-CMIC List) maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company.</em></p>
<p><em>The Company intends to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake. During the process, it will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List.</em></p>
<p>Tencent offers various online products and services in China, like the messaging apps Tencent QQ and WeChat, though it is perhaps best known in the Western world for its gaming division. For a while now, it's been the largest gaming publisher in the world by revenue, well ahead of Sony and Microsoft, although the latter has reduced the gap following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>Tencent also invested heavily in game studios located outside China. It owns Riot Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-offers-to-fully-acquire-funcom-scope-of-dune-survival-game-to-be-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funcom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-the-division-devs-create-sharkmob/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharkmob</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-buy-sumo-digital-for-919-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sumo Group</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-majority-grinding-gear-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grinding Gear Games</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-imminent-acquisition-leyou-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leyou</a> (owner of Athlon Games, Splash Damage, and Digital Extremes). It also holds majority stakes in <a href="https://wccftech.com/turtle-rock-studios-is-the-latest-studio-acquisition-made-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turtle Rock Studios</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquired-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techland</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-becomes-a-majority-shareholder-at-rime-developer-tequila-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tequila Works</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-starve-mark-of-the-ninja-klei-entertainment-acquired-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klei Entertainment</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-1c-entertainment-polish-group-to-be-rebranded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulqrum Publishing</a> (previously known as 1C Entertainment), <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-wake-up-interactive-teases-new-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wake Up Interactive</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightingale-inflexion-games-bought-tencent-spatialos-not-being-used/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inflexion Games</a>, 10 Chambers Collective, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yager-spec-ops-the-line-gets-strategic-minority-investment-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yager Development</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-purchased-36-percent-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fatshark</a>, Miniclip and Supercell, as well as minority stakes in Don't Nod, Shift Up, Epic Games, Bloober Team, Marvelous, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-gets-new-investments-by-sony-and-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FromSoftware</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy</a>, Krafton, Kakao, Paradox Interactive, Frontier Developments, and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Rumors about the potential acquisition of the latter company have <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intensified</a> lately. Just yesterday, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed</a> advisors to review potential sale options. A couple of years ago, Tencent reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-is-reportedly-shifting-its-ma-strategy-to-majority-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted</a> its M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) strategy to majority deals only.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There has been a flurry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>-related news in recent days, but not from Nintendo itself. Now, the Mario maker has broken its silence on the week's reports.</p>
<p>During this week's CES trades show in Las Vegas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">reportedly-accurate models of Nintendo's under-wraps Switch 2 were shown off</a> by accessories manufacturer Genki. Several images and videos of this model were subsequently shared across social media (as you can see below). It is worth noting that Genki has since said <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html">its model was created based only on leaked information from the industry</a>, and it has not actually seen a Switch 2 console. </p>
<p>Nintendo has now issued a statement to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, telling the world that those images and videos making the rounds are "not official".</p>

</figure>
<p>Here's the very to the point, translated statement from the article: "The images and videos, they are not official."</p>
<p>While this statement is fairly innocuous in a lot of ways, and not exactly surprising given we already knew it was not Nintendo itself showcasing the hardware, this marks the first acknowledgement by the company that these leaks are even happening at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has not actually said anything about the accuracy of the third-party Switch 2 model which has been shown.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>In addition to that mock Switch 2 model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">yesterday we had some further console leaks</a>. Purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards started showing up. Meanwhile, another report suggested Nintendo's upcoming console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock. There were also some new murmurings over the Switch 2's optical sensor.</p><p>Nintendo will be sharing something official on its Switch successor soon enough, though. It previously confirmed we would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">receive a proper announcement before the close of the fiscal year</a>, which ends 31st March. What we do know for sure is that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bald headed assassin simulator Hitman: World of Assassination has amassed an impressive body count of 75 million players.
</p>
<p>
World of Assassination was originally launched in 2021 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S under the name of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>, and was then retitled two years later when content from the trilogy's other games was added in. 
</p>
<p>
Today, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is celebrating the game's continued success. A million players logged on in December alone, the studio said, lured in by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-next-elusive-target-is-jean-claude-the-splitter-van-damme">fresh mission starring 90s action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>.

<p>
Many of those players will likely be people sampling the game via its Free Starter Pack option, which also currently lets you take down Van Damme as one of the game's limited-time Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
Amusingly, IO says that only 40 percent of players who attempted to take down Van Damme have been successful at doing so. (The developer tracked the longest successful attempt at seven hours, with the shortest just 21 seconds.)
</p>
<p>
Van Damme disappears from the game as an Elusive Target at the end of this weekend, on Sunday 12th January, but you can buy permanent access to a mission featuring the star in a £4 DLC mission pack.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, IO says it is working on more content for Hitman to release later this year - though there's no details yet on what. 
</p>
<p>
IO is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">its under-wraps James Bond 007 game</a> and a mysterious fantasy game project. Additionally, the company is now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">handling publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, the AAA game from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies.

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> film adaptation, set to star Star Wars actor Donnie Yen, has been canned.</p>
<p>That's according to Yen himself, who confirmed the cancellation to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," he said. "I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately... I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>
<p>"Well, on to better things."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-donnie-yen-says-sleeping-dogs-movie-in-production">Yen confirmed the film was in development in February 2018</a>, but little has been heard since and no release date was given, so it's not particularly surprising to discover its cancellation.</p>
<p>Sleeping Dogs was a 2012-released open world game published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, which was something of a GTA-style game set in Hong Kong but with martial arts combat and parkour.</p>
<p>Though received well by critics, it criminally remains a cult classic.</p>
<p>Still, a film starring and directed by Hong Kong filmmaker Yen would've been a natural fit. And the live-action reveal trailer above certainly hints at what we're missing.</p>
<p>Plenty of other film adaptations have been revealed recently. Sony confirmed earlier this week both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers will be adapted to film</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-gets-groundbreaking-anime-adaptation-on-crunchyroll">Ghost of Tsushima is also set to be adapted to an anime series</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been confirmed that The Last of Us Part II Remastered, scheduled to be released on PC in April, will require a PSN account to function, despite having no online features. This follows the trend established by many PlayStation-centric games that found their way to PC platforms in the last year or so, but it doesn’t make it any less irritating for players.</p>



<p>This disruptive inclusion means that The Last of Us Part II on PC won’t launch in the several countries where the PlayStation Network doesn’t operate, which is one of the chief issues at play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backlash-continued">Backlash Continued</h2>



<p>Last year, a sudden change brought this requirement into the Helldivers 2 universe, with players being prompted to link a PSN account to continue playing the game. It caused a monumental downfall for the game, with tens of thousands of negative reviews being cast against the title.</p>



<p>That situation was rectified, but Sony would go on to make it a base requirement for further ports, such as God of War Ragnarok and Horizon: Forbidden West.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> discovered the requirement after wishlists went live. The Last of Us Part II Remastered will hit PC platforms – such as Steam and Epic Games Stores – on April 3. Instead of a Last of Us Part III, players are once again being forced to satisfy themselves with the iterations that have been re-released so many times over the years.</p>



<p>The game will arrive just as the second season of the popular HBO live-action adaption is set to drop. It was recently confirmed – along with a new trailer – that The Last of Us season two will hit screens worldwide in April. While a date wasn’t stressed, it’s expected to coincide with the PC release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<p>Tactics.</p>

<p>Recently, a job listing surfaced for a ‘Project Senior Producer’ in Los Angeles, working at a new PlayStation studio in Los Angeles. In the listing, it’s explained that the office is part of a ‘newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders’.</p>



<p>It’s expected that this is Jason Blundell’s studio, the legendary developer who departed Deviation Games in September 2022. It was mentioned in December 2023 that Blundell was set to lead a PlayStation studio, and later rumours suggested that he would be partnering with Bungie to produce a new action game in a sci-fi universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rumours-galore">Rumours Galore</h2>



<p>In the job listing discovered on the PlayStation site and shared by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-has-a-new-studio-in-los-angeles-working-on-a-new-ip.1078485/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">users on Restera</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are a newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders and experienced game developers. </p>



<p>Our mission is to create the next groundbreaking AAA original IP while reimagining the development process with a lean and highly efficient approach.&nbsp;We’re&nbsp;seeking talented individuals who share our vision and are eager to join us on this journey.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5413216004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The listing</a> is all business and doesn’t mention anything to identify the game, nor does it confirm the name of the studio or who is leading it, but the strongest possibility is that it’s Jason Blundell’s studio.</p>



<p>Blundell boasts a stunning career that saw him march through high-profile roles at Treyarch during Call of Duty’s peak. He was instrumental in the success and popularity of the franchise’s Zombies ecosystem, but in February 2020, he departed the company to found Deviation Games.</p>



<p>Deviation would later be shut down before it could ship a single game.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-linkedin-ex-deviation-games-employees-set-up-a-new-studio-with-sony-led-by-jason-blundel-new-ip.868227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumoured a while ago</a> that former Deviation Games employees would be funnelled into a new Sony-backed studio with Jason Blundell at the helm, and this could be that claim brought to fruition.</p>



<p>What do you think about this? Do you have high hopes for Jason Blundell’s next project? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It was just announced that HITMAN: World of Assassination has passed a unique threshold, securing 75 million players worldwide in just under a decade. In the words of IO Interactive, this has increased ‘its status as the most successful Hitman game of all time’. </p>



<p>In December 2024 alone, one million active players were recorded assuming control of Agent 47 and hunting down all manner of targets across a range of maps, missions, and modes. On December 12, Jean-Claude Van Damme was added to HITMAN: World of Assassination as a new and challenging elusive target.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination is a live-service title firmly rooted in the universe that debuted way back in 2000 with Hitman: Codename 47.</p>



<p>This decades-old franchise has maintained a solid following over the years, transitioning through the various gaming generations and touching everything from mobile to VR. It’s an industry staple and features an instantly recognisable protagonist and concept.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, IO Interactive explained:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
As expectation grows of a new Half-Life game announcement, fans believe they can now see evidence of the project on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, let's address the obvious. Yes, the decades-long wait for Half-Life 3 has become something of a meme and all suggestion of its existence is to be treated with caution. That said, there's strong evidence that Valve is once again working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailing datamined assets and code snippets</a> backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved.
</p>
<p>
All signs point to something being afoot, and now Steam seems to show Valve has a second unreleased game lurking behind the scenes (as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Deadlock</a>, which is still listed as an 'upcoming release' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-croaks-down-on-deadlock-cheaters-by-letting-you-turn-them-into-frogs">despite being in beta</a>). 
</p>
<p>
A thread on the Valve <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1hw5kx6/i_could_be_onto_nothing_here_but_is_this_new">reddit</a> has highlighted the recent change that now lists two games from the developer as 'upcoming', with some sleuthing work by fans using the Wayback Machine pointing to this change occuring sometime within December 2024.
</p>
<p>
Searching for Valve on Steam and filtering via upcoming releases and then specifically games does indeed list two projects - with only Deadlock visible.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
It's unlikely this project is In the Valley of the Gods - the next game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> developer Campo Santo that was put on indefinite hold. For starters, its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/687440/In_The_Valley_of_Gods/">Steam page</a> is publicly visible, and its developer and publisher are both listed as Campo Santo still rather than Valve.
</p>
<p>
A warning on the search page suggests that search results may exclude some products based on content or language preferences, but even with all filters disabled, Valve's second upcoming project does not appear. So, what gives?
</p>
<p>
This year will mark the fifth anniversary of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, Valve's most recent entry in its legendary shooter series that was designed specifically for VR. But Half-Life has certainly been on Valve's mind more recently than that. 
</p>
<p>In November, Valve made a big deal out of celebrating <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>'s 20th anniversary, with a big update that added a director's commentary, a documentary, and packed in the game's two episodes of DLC. We even learned a bit more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">why Valve never made Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a>, as well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Aaron Callaway decided to beat the game without any weapons by relying only on emotes, including the Hadoken fireball popularized by Street Fighter's Ryu and Ken.</p><p>Callaway posted a video on YouTube that demonstrated how an emote-only Monster Hunter: World run works. He notes that the other two emotes used were Street Fighter's Shoryuken and Devil May Cry's guns. However, the Shoryuken drained too much stamina and the DmC emote wasn't ideal either. That's why Callaway came to rely on the Hadoken, even though it's also comparatively weak and can only dish out 13 points in damage at most.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFHmXH1YPig" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zFHmXH1YPig" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's one thing to say you've done something and another to show it.

            <p>
It's probably not a huge surprise to hear at this point, but Sony has confirmed The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will - like numerous other single-player PlayStation games before it - require a PSN account in order to play when it launches for PC this April.
</p>
<p>
Sony, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">faced a major backlash last May</a> when it announced it would be making PSN accounts mandatory for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC - a move that meant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">players in the 177 countries where PSN is unavailable</a> would no longer be able to play the game they'd purchase. Ultimately, the outcry was significant enough that Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">relented</a>, but that hasn't stopped it from implementing PSN requirements for an increasing number of PC ports since then.
</p>
<p>
It's a decision that's continued to draw criticism given the requirement - which was originally justified as being necessary for the "safety and security" of online play - is now being implemented across both multiplayer and single-player games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, for instance, <em>does</em> have a multiplayer component, despite being a predominantly single-player title, while other PC releases requiring PSN - such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, and Until Dawn - are purely single-player experiences.

<p>
And now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered (as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/">spotted by VGC</a>) has joined the steadily expanding list of predominantly single-player PlayStation titles - online leaderboards <em>are</em> supported in its roguelike No Return mode - requiring a PSN log-in on PC.
</p><p>
For most, that requirement is probably little more than a somewhat irritating inconvenience. But for others - namely, those based in one of the aforementioned 117 regions where PSN is unavailable - it means The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered simply won't be purchasable on PC. And given Sony previously confirmed this month's PC port of the single-player <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> also requires a PSN account, it appears this is a path it's now determine to follow.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">Epic Games Store</a> on 3rd April, the same month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">season two of HBO's acclaimed The Last of Us television series begins airing</a>. Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">called the remaster</a> - which includes the likes of increased texture resolution, increased level-of-detail distances, and improved shadow quality - the "best way to play a genuine classic" when it arrived on PlayStation 5 last year.

<p>The list of Counter-Strike Major winners is filled with some of the biggest names ever to grace the professional stage. Not every player gets to lift the trophy at one of the most illustrious esports tournaments, so doing so puts you in legendary company.</p>



<p>As of the start of 2025, 21 Majors have been held. Here’s the full list of all the winners.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-counter-strike-major-winners">All Counter-Strike Major Winners</h2>



<p>The reigning Major champions are Team Spirit. The primarily Russian roster, spearheaded by 17-year-old undeniable AWP prodigy Danil “donk” Kryshkovets, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a> to close out the 2024 season. It was the first Major victory for the organization and all its players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Here are all the teams and players that have won a Counter-Strike Major, starting with the most recent:</p>

<h2 id="h-counter-strike-major-records">Counter-Strike Major Records</h2>



<p>The Astralis organization holds the record for the most Major wins as an organization with four. Notably though, the organization has struggled in recent years, and has failed to qualify for the past four Majors. Astralis has not reached the playoffs of a Major since winning StarLadder Berlin 2019.</p>



<p>Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen has won the most Majors as an individual with five, having won four with Astralis and one with Vitality. Dupreeh is tied with Dan “apEX” Madesclaire and Finn “karrigan” Andersen in total Major appearances with 19. However, dupreeh has the sole distinction of having attended all 19 of the CS:GO Majors.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, the ongoing saga of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a> reached a new turning point with the release of Revenant Act 3. But the conclusion of that chapter means that players are getting new weapons and other improvements going forward.</p><p>Bungie has shared <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-09-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the details about Destiny 2's latest updates</a>, including a pair of legendary weapons. The first is called Red Tape, and it's a stasis scout rifle; while the second is a stasis rocket launcher named Heretic's Fervor. You can see both weapons in action in the new trailer below, as well as a glimpse of the new exotic mission, Kell's Fall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pVboiodni8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-pVboiodni8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Completing Kell's Fall will give players access to yet another weapon: A powerful exotic shotgun called Slayer’s Fang. Players can also replay Kell's Fall to upgrade Slayer's Fang with up to four catalysts. Starting with the next episode debut, Heresy, on February 4, Destiny 2 will also increase the caps for Strange Coins to 199, while Osirian Ciphers and Nightfall Ciphers will be bumped from 10 to 30. Bungie has also invited players <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/fotl2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to begin voting</a> for next fall's Festival of the Lost Armor. </p><p>Earlier this month, the original Destiny <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-destiny-game-gets-strange-update-for-new-years/1100-6528649/" data-ref-id="1100-6528649">got a holiday-themed update</a>, which surprised players since the focus has been on Destiny 2 for years. Late last year, players also discovered an exploit that gave them the Dawning Event Card Upgrade for free. Bungie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-who-found-a-destiny-2-exploit-can-keep-their-free-loot-says-bungie/1100-6528364/" data-ref-id="1100-6528364">was pretty cool about that</a> and allowed players to keep the upgrade even though it ordinarily costs $10.</p>
