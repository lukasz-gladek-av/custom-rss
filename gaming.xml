		<p>We’ve always been huge Futurlab fans here at TheSixthAxis, and it’s nice to have a bit of Thursday action from the team behind Velocity and Powerwash Simulator. For fans of spraying things down, bringing things up to a sheen and climbing on small footladders to see onto ledges, today is a good day, with the announcement of Powerwash Simulator 2, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2 | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFwqxoF7MwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First and foremost, all that soaking action will look better than ever, with an improved set of visuals, a whole new campaign and, of course, new locations and items for you to clean down. The new campaign will have you uncovering more of Muckingham’s mysteries, as well as have you visiting grime-coated locations like Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City.</p>
<p>There’s going to be a new home space – presumably you can clean this up too – and here you’ll be able to display awards and trinkets that you’ve gained while doing a hard days cleaning.</p>
<p>If that’s not enough, you can now share campaign progression online together for the first time, and in addition to online play, split-screen co-op will be available as well, meaning you can clean digital homes together, while neglecting your own.</p>


<p>We loved the original Powerwash Simulator, awarding it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">8/10 for its original version</a>, and 9/10 for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">excellent VR rendition</a>. Talking about the original we said, “PowerWash Simulator is a rare example of a game that more than lives up to its expectations. If the calming loop of the gameplay gets you then you’ll easily find hours of your life disappearing along with the dirt and grime. Add in some interesting challenge modes and a story that caught me by surprise and you have a game that more than deserves your time”. We then called the VR version, “the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</p>
<p>Futurlab have promised more details in April, so stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for all your Powerwash Simulator 2 news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom has published a new exploration trailer for the upcoming massive multiplayer survival game Dune Awakening. The video goes through the basic progression every character will have to go through after crash-landing on Arrakis: first, surviving, crafting a stillsuit, founding a home base, and making vehicles to roam the desert planet.</p>
<p>Eventually, players will venture to the biggest and most dangerous map, the Deep Desert. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-unveils-mmo-structure-and-overland-map-confirms-persistent-closed-beta-is-now-ongoing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> earlier by Game Director Joel Bylos, this huge map can house hundreds of players at once and is always PvP enabled.</p>
<p><em>The Deep Desert is this massive area, a minimum of 500 square kilometers. It's actually a bit larger than that. That's where you can meet hundreds of other players in Dune: Awakening. There is probably going to be a player cap if too many people go there, but it should be able to handle quite a lot of people, and that's a completely seamless set of servers that are all connected together.</em></p>
<p><em>It's generally a PVP map with a strip of PVE as people enter so that they can be safe when they come into the map and don't get ganked. The cool thing about the Deep Desert map is that we have this thing called the Coriolis Storm, which every week wipes the Deep Desert and sets it with a new landscape and new points of interest, so it's an infinitely explorable space and a really cool place to hang with your friends.</em></p>
<p>In today's trailer, Funcom also remarked that the Deep Desert map will reset every week, explained in-world by the massive Coriolis Storms, which will sweep over the map and change it. This also means Dune Awakening players will then get to explore as if it were new when it comes to its points of interest and resource nodes. It's even possible for explorer types of players to get in there just after the reset, survey the map, and then either share it with allies and clan members or sell it on the Exchange, the game's version of the traditional MMO-style auction house.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered game will launch on PC in a little over two months. Its benchmark and character creator tool are already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-is-out-on-may-20-for-49-99-benchmark-and-character-creator-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on Steam, though. For more details <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-roundtable-qa-privately-hosted-servers-are-under-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Dune Awakening</a>, check out our developer Q&amp;A from a recent press event.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Crikey, it's still looking rough out there in the industry at the moment, isn't it folks? Yesterday unfortunately brought the news that another online game is shutting down, with the studio alongside it. In this version of the story that we've heard all too often recently, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spectre-divide">Spectre Divide</a>, a tactical free-to-play first-person shooter whose whole gimmick is that you control your own character and a clone, allowing you to switch between them on the fly.</p>
<p>It was certainly a fresh take on the genre, but our former reviews editor Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spectre-divide-is-a-new-tactical-shooter-with-one-big-gimmick-controlling-two-bodies-at-once">did wonder if that was enough to set it apart from Valorant or Counter Strike</a>. As evidenced by developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/mountaintop-studios">Mountaintop Studios</a>' imminent closure only six months after the game launched, it was not.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The studio shared the news on the official Spectre Divide X (formerly Twitter) account, with a lengthy message explaining that the game hasn't found enough growth in the two weeks since season 1 launched. Essentially, it all came down to the fact that there simply weren't enough players and revenue to "cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio." 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
As of right now, Mountaintop expect to take Spectre offline sometime within the next 30 days, with new purchases now disabled, and if you've spent any money on the game since season 1 launched you'll be getting a refund too.
</p>
<p>
Mountaintop also noted that they did everything they could to keep the game going by bringing on a publisher, finding additional funding, or even getting themselves outright acquired. The post also points to some "tough stumbles" at Spectre Divide's launch that may have contributed to the closure. There was clearly some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2641470/view/4570678714934677865?l=english">strong feedback early on in relation to the cost of things like weapons and characters</a>, which prompted the developer to apologise and make price cuts.</p>
<p>
Still, there's no denying that it's a bad time for live service projects like this, even if you do all the right things, and have a genuinely unique idea. Spectre Divide has at least fared better than Sony's paid hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">lasted a whole three weeks before being taken offline forever</a>. Here's hoping all the Mountaintop devs can land on their feet.

And not in a bonkers imaginative way either, but in an, “<em>Oppenheimer</em> made $1 billion and no one is ever telling me what to do again,” kind of way. Or maybe this really is part of some wild reinterpretation of The Odyssey and Odysseus’ son Telemachus, seemingly played by Tom Holland, just happens to run into some Vikings on his quest to find his lost father. Maybe there is time travel. Maybe this whole thing is a meta-commentary on people paying way too much attention to leaked Hollywood set photos. I hope so.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-skate-microtransactions-range-from-%E2%82%AC5-%E2%82%AC99-in-closed-alpha.1133439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-skate-microtransactions-range-from-e5-e99-in-closed-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Tuesday night, Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the first to report</a> of microtransactions being added to the closed alpha playtest of EA Skate. Now, just a couple days later, we have an idea at what EA is charging for their San Van Bucks (SVB) within the game.</p>



<p>Thanks to a Reddit user by the name of <a href="https://postimg.cc/gallery/CkGNDr3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sm1one_out_there</a>, it appears that EA is charging users a range of €5-€99—the prices shared are in Euros, but the conversion for microtransactions is usually similar to USD, so expect $5-$99—for the in-game currency. </p>



<p>At €5, you get 500 SVB. At €9.99, that jumps to 1050 SVB including a 5% boost in the amount you receive. The rest of the options are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>€24.99 – 3,000 SVB</li>



<li>€49.99 – 6,250 SVB</li>



<li>€99.99 – 13,000 SVB</li>
</ul>



<p>Based on other images shown, as well as previously announced plans by EA, all of the microtransaction purchases go towards in-game cosmetics. There are no pay-to-win mechanics coming to EA Skate.</p>



<p>An example of item costs include 200 SVB for socks, 300 SVB for board art, and 400 SVB for a tank top.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that the microtransactions are currently only being added to PC and PlayStation players during the playtest. EA and Full Circle will also cease giving players “random grants of SVB” that it had been doing in prior playtests. </p>



<p>They also reaffirmed that “any SVB purchased will be credited back at Early Access launch” provided you are using the same EA account for both playtests and Early Access. Lastly, it was confirmed that items acquired during the playtest will also be reset at Early Access launch, but not during the playtest itself.</p>



<p>What do you think of microtransactions being added to Skate’s closed alpha? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>While Nintendo fans eagerly await the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 broadcast</a>, the Mario company made a different announcement today. Nintendo will open an official Nintendo store in San Francisco this May, and it's just the second Nintendo store in the United States. The other one is in Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.</p><p>The San Francisco store is located in the city's Union Square area at 331 Powell Street. The store will be stocked with Nintendo game consoles and games, along with accessories, apparel, home goods, and souvenirs that are only available at the San Francisco location.</p><p>It seems fans won't just be able to walk into the store when it opens on May 15. Nintendo said there will be "reservation requirements," and more details will be shared in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Fans can enter a sweepstakes for a chance to win a trip to the grand opening event for the Nintendo San Francisco store on May 15. The sweepstakes offers up a three-night, four-day trip for you and up to two guests.</p><p>The contest is open to US residents who are 18 or older. To enter, fans must have a Nintendo Account and can <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">redeem 10 Platinum Points to enter</a>, with a limit of five entries per person. The full terms and conditions can be found on <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's website.</a></p><p>In 2021, Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-nintendo-shutters-california-office-1847966405" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">closed its San Francisco-based office in Redwood City</a>. Outside of the US, Nintendo has an official store in its home country of Japan, located in Tokyo.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch later this year, with a big reveal set for April 2. That's when fans can expect to learn more about the system and its games, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">rumored Mario Kart 9. </a></p>

            <p>
Relaxing cleaning sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> is getting a full-blown sequel, and it's due out this year. Eurogamer can also confirm the game will launch on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator 2 will soak into PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and Windows Store, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point in 2025, with more details of the Switch 2 version to follow.
</p>
<p>
British studio FuturLab has come up with several major improvements for this new iteration, including four-player online co-op with shared progression, as well as a two-player local splitscreen option.

<p>
The game will also now feature a Central Homebase hub for your PowerWash business, which you can customise with various furnishings, and show off collectible rewards.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator 2 will feature a full new campaign, picking up where the original's truly wacky ending left off (no spoilers here, scrub). That means heading back to the filthy town of Muckingham and its surrounding Caldera County for more filth-ridden jobs.
</p>
<p>
These include a parade float, tram and teapot house, a quick initial look at the game has revealed. PowerWash Simulator 2's visuals have also clearly had a scrub up, and there's mention of a new soaping system where you can cover an area and quickly rinse away even the toughest grubbiness.
</p>
<p>There are "no plans" currently for a VR version, FuturLab told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>
FuturLab says more than 17 million players have played the original PowerWash Simulator to date, and experienced its relaxing gameplay and dopamine-inducing 'pings' when sections are complete. I can't wait for more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mountaintop Studios has announced that its free-to-play first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em>is to shut down soon, and that the studio itself will also be closing its doors.</p>

<p>Per a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2641470/view/544477779605849692" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em>will cease service "within the next 30 days". Mountaintop will also be disabling any new in-game purchases and refunding any money players have spent since the launch of the game's first season a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>The studio says that this season's launch "hasn't achieved the level of success [it] needed to sustain the game and keep Mountaintop afloat", so not only will the game be stopping service, but the studio will be shutting down "at the end of this week".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down-shooting.jpg?itok=_C9iEAed 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down-shooting.jpg?itok=-WHFo7Aa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em>is shutting down within the next month or so.</figcaption></figure><p>Mountaintop says that it was "optimistic" in the first week of&nbsp;<em>Spectre Divide</em>'s first season, with around 10,000 players apparently checking into the game across all platforms in that time period.</p>

<p>However, the studio says it hasn't "seen enough active players and incoming revenue" to cover either the game's operation or the day-to-day running of the company, and that it's "stretched [its] remaining capital as far as [it] could".</p>

<p>The studio goes on to say that it's tried everything, from finding a new publisher through seeking additional investment and even "an acquisition", but that "in the end, we weren't able to make it work".</p>

<p><em>Spectre Divide</em>'s situation is sad, but it's far from unique. Just a week or two ago, Phoenix Labs announced its&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-style action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may" rel="nofollow">will shut down in May</a>, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">not just smaller studios either</a>.</p>




<p>Mountaintop's closure is also part of a wider industry wave that has seen studios like&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">Monolith</a>, the Seattle-based <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow"><i>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</i>division of NetEase</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">multiple Ubisoft branches</a>&nbsp;affected.</p>

<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em>before its shutdown (which still doesn't have an official date), you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2641470/Spectre_Divide/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10002871" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/spectre-divide/9pm7wssrw9df" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

		</div>
	<div>
		<p>If one can be said to feel sorry for an F1 team, I feel sorry for Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton is starting the 2025 F1 campaign with Ferrari after enjoying one of the greatest runs in the sport's history with the Silver Arrows team. Six drivers and seven constructors championships. 84 race wins, the equivalent of four complete F1 seasons spent on the top step of the podium wearing a Mercedes uniform. And now, for his F1 career's final act, he's wearing red.</p><p>It feels like only Ferrari could’ve drawn Hamilton away from a team with which he had become synonymous; that no matter what Mercedes meant to Hamilton, no matter what they’ve accomplished together, Mercedes is still not Ferrari. If you’re one of the great F1 drivers and you have the chance to go to be a Ferrari driver, you go. Thirty-five years after his death, the Commendatore still has the power to summon drivers to Maranello.</p><p>There’s a clip that made the rounds, shorty after Hamilton's move was announced, of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufB9B1WRxTs&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>Sebastian Vettel talking about the Catholic nature</u></a> of the Ferrari brand, back in his days with the team, specifically calling out people who work for Mercedes as being crypto-Ferrari fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Except brand feels like the wrong word. People who talk about the “brand” are usually in the business of relating to things as commodities, and they use the word to transform emotion and identity into a quantifiable asset, the same way “content” is used to reduce art and storytelling to an interchangeable slurry meant to fill people’s time. Ferrari is a triumph of branding because the company has never felt like it’s calculating enough to think like that. It inefficiently produces high-maintenance sports cars that look and sound so beautiful that reason and practicality are silent in the face of them. People who are convinced that everyone who drives a Audi or McLaren is a rich asshole will at the same time buy a Ferrari shirt or keychain because the allure of the dream is stronger than the reality that only plutocrats can truly live it.</p><figure></figure><p>The team occupies such a special place in Formula 1 that it used to receive <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a1882991/850-million-f1-question-why-ferrari-red-bull-receive-more-prize-money-mercedes/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>tens of millions of dollars annually</u></a> from F1, just because of the name. Whenever tensions with the sport’s governing bodies boil over, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12474/10100578/ferrari-threaten-to-quit-f1-as-sport-races-towards-epic-power-battle?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Ferrari threatens to quit</u></a>, which is taken very seriously because it is, or was, the one team that is basically synonymous with the sport itself.</p><p>Whether Ferrari is <em>that</em> good a racing team doesn’t matter. Too much can be made at times of Ferrari mistakes, but you can’t deny that the team has struggled at times to interpret and react to the twists and turns of an F1 race. Where other teams might be angrily questioned by their drivers over the radio, Ferrari and its drivers would engage in discursive negotiations at 190 mph.&nbsp;</p><p>Behind the sneers and disdain its detractors have for Ferrari during its down periods is something else though: expectation. It’s worse if Ferrari has a bad year or decade because, on some level, everybody expects this team to be great in a way they don’t expect of similarly storied teams like McLaren or Williams. Every team struggles, but Ferrari is treated as if every bad result reflects underlying moral failings that are disturbing the natural order.</p><p>After the mounting frustration and disenchantment that characterized Fernando Alonso’s and Sebastian Vettel’s periods with the team, it seemed like Ferrari’s spell should finally have been broken. Two era-defining talents had each gone there expecting to win a lot of races and at least a couple championships, and each had seen their fortunes wane while Red Bull and Mercedes became F1’s foremost teams. Now Hamilton is testing his own luck. Or maybe he's testing something else.</p><p>Because beyond the pragmatic reasons why Hamilton might have chosen to move on—Mercedes' lackluster results with a series of joyless cars, Ferrari's improving form, the king's ransom Hamilton is rumored to be paid—there's something priceless that Ferrari could offer that Mercedes never could: a fresh start. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new report claims Xbox’s upcoming gaming handheld is being developed in partnership with Asus.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-and-asus-partner-up">Xbox and Asus Partner Up</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Microsoft was working on a partner gaming handheld for 2025 called Project Kennan. Now, through a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-project-kennan-gaming-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, we know that Xbox is partnering with Asus on the project. The device will be similar to the Asus ROG Ally but with “an Xbox-y twist.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Xbox x Asus gaming handheld will seemingly follow a more ‘Xbox style’, featuring an Xbox Guide button that was reported earlier. However, it is unclear whether the device will be a separate SKU from the ROG Ally 2 or be a version of that device, which is “subsidised by Xbox”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also tells us that the Xbox x Asus handheld will not play Xbox games, as it is “a tried-and-true Windows PC in essence”. Players will have the same access as they have on the Asus ROG Ally, being able to play games from Xbox Play Anywhere, Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. At the same time, they can also use other stores such as Steam, Epic Games Stores and launchers like Riot on the upcoming handheld.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-project-kennan-specs-price-and-more">Project Kennan Specs, Price and More</h2>



<p>The report also discusses the specifications, price, and other details of the Xbox x Asus gaming handheld. The device could use an AMD Z2 Go or a Z2 extreme chipset. The cost, which has to be taken with a massive grain of salt, could be between $499 and $599 for the base model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Microsoft wants the upcoming handheld to resemble the Xbox as closely as possible, and it will exist “as a proof of concept of sorts.” The Xbox apps are being redesigned to be better optimised on small screens, and the Xbox Game Bar also received an update recently to make it look more like an Xbox rather than a Windows PC.</p>



<p>In other news, a next-gen Xbox console is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned for 2027</a>. According to claims, the next console might <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-not-a-console-at-all-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not be a traditional one</a>. What are your thoughts on the Xbox x Asus handheld?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There are apparently over 30 new games available to stream via the cloud on PlayStation Portal without using a PS5--and they're all part of the Classics catalog. A new report states that almost every original PlayStation and PSP title that's included with the PlayStation Plus Premium membership now works on the handheld device.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/ps-portal-ps-plus-premium-streaming-update-march-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TrueTrophies</a>, Sony has silently added the PlayStation Classics for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-update-introduces-cloud-streaming-beta/1100-6527882/">the PlayStation Portal cloud-streaming beta</a>. The highly requested feature--which removes the requirement of utilizing a PS5--arrived in November and remains in beta. PlayStation Portal owners must opt in, and originally, only PS5 games part of the PS Plus catalog could be played. Now the library reportedly includes titles like Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, Twisted Metal 2, and MediEvil: Resurrection.</p><p dir="ltr">Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-update-will-let-you-play-in-more-places/1100-6524351/">a PlayStation Portal update offered up the ability to play in more places</a> with better public Wi-Fi access. The device basically pops up a QR code when trying to connect at airports and hotels, so a smartphone is needed to complete the process.</p><p dir="ltr">In November, a report stated Sony was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/">developing a PS5 portable system</a>, with plans to compete against <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Steam Deck. Meanwhile, Microsoft apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">might launch an Xbox-branded handheld later this year</a> in partnership with Asus.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-portal-just-isnt-good-enough/1100-6519416/">The PlayStation Portal</a> launched in 2023.</p>

Positioned as a DLC mod for the official version of the game, Half-Life 2 RTX overhauls the shooter's visuals utilizing Nvidia RTX Remix, an open-source platform that can be used to enhance preexisting games with Nvidia technologies like DLSS 4, RTX Neural Rendering, and Reflex. Nvidia wants modders to use RTX Remix for fan-made remasters, and is backing Half-Life 2 RTX to show what RTX Remix can do.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Half-Life 2 RTX's demo</a> will be released on Steam on March 18.

<p>In Firefight Classic, you and a team of three others will do your utmost to last as long as you can against endless waves of increasingly difficult enemies. Five waves make up a round, and three rounds (plus a bonus round) make a set.</p>
<p>"You can keep the party going for as long as you want. No, really, you could keep the good times rolling with your squad into next week if you really wanted to! Or - at the end of a set - head to the exfiltration zone and end the match," <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/blue-team-operation-launch">proclaims the Halo Infinite team</a>.</p>
<p>"Try not to die, as lives are limited [there are a pool of seven lives], but you'll be able to earn them back by successfully completing a bonus round."</p>
<p>Many are quite excited by this mode's return, with jubilations such as "YES CLASSIC FIREFIGHT FINALLY" gracing the launch trailer's comments section. </p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, Halo developer 343 Industries announced it was working on multiple new games for the franchise under a new name. That name? The very apt Halo Studios.</p>
<p>At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">the studio also gave us a peek at Project Foundry</a> - its experimental look at how the Xbox flagship franchise will look developed in Unreal Engine 5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-adaptive-frame-generation-delivers-consistently-smooth-output-mid-range/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Lossless Scaling's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/adaptive-frame-generation-is-lossless-scalings-latest-feature/">adaptive frame generation</a> is a great proof of concept that can deliver consistently smooth output with low base framerates even on mid-range system configurations.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a quick look at the new feature introduced to the upscaler earlier this month, highlighting how, even on a mid-range system powered by a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and an RTX 4060 GPU, the feature is capable of delivering consistently smooth 120 FPS output with low base framerates, high settings and even ray tracing at 1440p resolution in Control, and at native 4K resolution in Starfield. While the experience is far from perfect due to visual artifacts and the massive latency caused by the low base framerates, which is only partially alleviated by tech like NVIDIA Reflex, the new Lossless Scaling feature is an amazing proof of concept, also considering how it does not rely on any specific hardware technology.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lossless Scaling Dynamic Frame-Gen To Screen Refresh Rate: Impressive!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfDjUUnN6OI?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Everything that Lossless Scaling offers is great for games that do not support upscalers from major vendors, but DLSS, FSR, and Intel XeSS will continue to be the better options for games with official support. AMD's upscaler, in particular, has made some impressive steps forward with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/">latest version</a>, delivering an image quality that is on par with the previous version of DLSS, which still retains the crown of the best upscaler currently available thanks to the introduction of the superior Transformer model which can deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-super-resolution-performance-better-dlss-3-8-quality/">impressive image quality with lower input resolution</a> than the previous CNN model.</p>
