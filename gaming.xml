			<p>Bethesda showed even more support to the Skyblivion mod team, and invited them to tour Bethesda Studios headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. The Skyblivion team shared the excursion with <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1923793664112726161">a post on X</a>, with photos from the studio and with developers from Bethesda, including Todd Howard, thanking the studio for having them and showing them around.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you to our friends Bethesda Studios for having us over and showing us around!</em>" the post reads. "<em>Meeting the legendary people behind some of our favorite games was incredible and was only matched by their shared enthusiasm for Skyblivion and the modding community</em>."</p>
<p>It's the latest show of support after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/">Bethesda gifted the entire Skyblivion team game keys</a> for the recently released Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p>If you weren't aware, Skyblivion is a total conversion mod effort to take The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and recreate it in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It's been in development for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/">more than eight years</a>, and is finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">due to release sometime in 202</a>5, though it'll just be the base Oblivion game on launch, with the Oblivion DLCs due to come sometime later.</p>
<p>When the Oblivion Remaster was first spotted online, ahead of it being officially revealed, Wccftech reached out to the Skyblivion team, who had no ill-will towards the work that Bethesda was doing in its own remastering of Oblivion.</p>
<p>"<em>For the community, it is a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster,</em>" said the Skyblivion team lead Rebelzize.</p>
<p>"<em>It looks like a cool take on it and totally different from what my vision was. Looking forward to trying it myself. Luckily, this thing [Skyblivion] was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all.</em>"</p>

Melee </em>Major tournament when both got caught in the fire forest phase of Pokémon Stadium. With both players separated by one of the obstacles, they twitched back and forth, biding their time to see who would make the first move. It ended up being Pratt, though perhaps not in the way he intended. A rare glitch saw <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/mang0/clip/DoubtfulBoringMushroomWOOP-EOx2mIS8XoYHgZ-R&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/mang0/clip/DoubtfulBoringMushroomWOOP-EOx2mIS8XoYHgZ-R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">him accidentally fall straight through the level</a></span>, cementing Schwab’s victory and the $2,000 first place prize. </p><p>The glitch is triggered by wavedashing, a physics exploit common in high-level <em>Melee</em> that lets players maneuver quickly without leaving them vulnerable. Doing so around the tree in the fire forest phase of the Pokémon Stadium stage, however, opens players up to an uncommon but well-known glitch that will send them falling through the level geometry. Guest commentator Juan “Hungrybox” Debiedma, who lost to Pratt earlier in the tournament, even mentioned the possibility on air, just moments before it unfolded on-screen.</p><p>“There’s just no way LMAO,” Pratt <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/moky_dokie/status/1924255114040402380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/moky_dokie/status/1924255114040402380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a></span> after the match. Not everyone is convinced it was an accident, however. How could a player as skilled and experienced as Pratt succumb to such a one-in-a-million bug? Did he lose that way on purpose because it would be funny, or to prove a point about why certain levels should be banned? Then again, is a briefly viral Twitch clip really worth $2,000? In this economy?</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/soul-sacrifice-review/1900-6407884/">Soul Sacrifice</a> launched in 2013 for PS Vita and came from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keiji-inafunes-soul-sacrifice-headed-to-us/1100-6379783/">a concept created by former Mega Man designer Keiji Inafune</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/freedom-wars-review/1900-6415969/">Freedom Wars</a> arrived the following year in 2014 for the handheld. Both Vita exclusives <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-sacrifice-monster-hunter-in-different-clothing/1100-6396876/">featured Monster Hunter-like similarities</a>, which is notable because Capcom's popular franchise skipped the Sony handheld after being a juggernaut on PlayStation Portable. Nintendo was able to secure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-headed-to-3ds-in-early-2015/1100-6417343/">Monster Hunter 4 as an exclusive for 3DS</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The online <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vita-exclusives-freedom-wars-soul-sacrifices-servers-shut-down-next-month/1100-6498377/">servers for Soul Sacrifice and Freedom Wars were shut down</a> in 2021. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-vita-exclusives-is-getting-remastered/1100-6526546/">Freedom Wars Remastered launched</a> earlier this year, providing a new way to play the game on PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>As for Yoshida, he's been showing up on other podcasts recently, too. For instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-80-games-are-a-steal-based-on-what-they-offer-former-playstation-exec-says/1100-6531628/">Yoshida stated that certain $80 games could be a steal</a> because of the hours of entertainment they provide.</p>

So they over-invested and over-hired and they started too many projects, but after COVID there were a lot more ways for people to entertain themselves so the growth slowed down."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yoshida described the situation that has left thousands of developers out of work (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-reevaluating-playstation-studios-and-cutting-900-jobs">including many at his former employer Sony</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) as "very sad," but claimed the "stupid money" that helped spark that age of over-investment&nbsp;has departed the video game industry in search of the next big thing.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-is-delisting-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-after-one-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">Activision is delisting Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile after one year</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Yoshida feels diverse portfolios and smaller projects can deliver stability">Yoshida feels diverse portfolios and smaller projects can deliver stability</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does that mean there's cause for quiet optimism? Yoshida believes so, but feels the largest companies need to begin (sensibly) investing in portfolio rather than pinning all of their financial hopes on a handful of gargantuan projects with no margin for error.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Each product is different, right? Some live service games are successful—like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Helldivers 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. So you cannot just take one product [or model] and say they're all wrong. Especially with entertainment products, nobody can predict sales, especially when new IPs are tried," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've worked with marketers in the past and they always miss the numbers. So, what big companies should do is invest in a portfolio of titles—because if they just invest in a small number of titles it's a huge risk. Even when you invest in existing successful franchises, because people's tastes will change."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also important, says Yoshida, to moderate the amount invested across that portfolio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains that because big companies have to compete with rivals of similar size and stature, budgets can quickly balloon as competitors attempt to outdo each other. The antidote to that budgetary arms race, he suggests, is to realize that "sometimes limitation is really helpful" for studios and developers looking to push themselves creatively.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-projects-annual-growth-despite-gta-vi-delay" target="_self" data-discover="true">Take-Two projects annual growth despite GTA VI delay</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a sentiment that chimes with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential">advice handed out by </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential">Astro Bot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential"> director Nicolas Doucet at GDC 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where he reminded attendees that "it's okay to make a small game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A lot of the choices we made with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be labelled double-A or maybe lacking in ambition—like the size of the team, the size of the game, the fact there's no text, no voice, and its not an open world," added Doucet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has delisted&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>from both major mobile storefronts, so if you want to play a round of the battle royale FPS, you'd better hope you've already got it installed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on Friday</a>, Activision said that while it's proud of its "accomplishment" in creating an "authentic" mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, the mobile edition of the game hasn't "met [Activision's] expectations" in the same way as the PC and console versions have.</p>

<p>As such, new gameplay updates and seasonal events will no longer be added to&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile</em>, and you won't be able to buy in-game points or the BlackCell battle pass using real currency either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted-stadium.jpg?itok=TQP886zh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted-stadium.jpg?itok=5Cr1jzqK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>can no longer be downloaded from either major mobile storefront.</figcaption></figure><p>If you had&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>downloaded and installed prior to today, then you can still enjoy it now, provided that it's still on your system. However, if you didn't have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>installed on your device before today, then it's gone for good.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like you can redownload it if you previously gave it a shot, either; you've got to have it on your device already, or your access to the game has been permanently revoked.</p>

<p>If you're lucky enough to have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>on your phone or tablet, then you can continue to play it, and cross-progression will still be available, as will servers complete with matchmaking for online play.</p>

<p>You can also continue to spend whatever COD Points you have left over on "available content in the Store"; you just can't purchase any more with your real currency.</p>




<p>For a limited time, if you sign up to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile&nbsp;</em>using your Activision account (and you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>player), you can nab yourself some&nbsp;<em>Mobile&nbsp;</em>COD Points by way of an incentive.</p>

<p>More info about this, as well as all other things pertaining to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>'s shutdown, can be found via Activision's official <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the matter.&nbsp;If you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone&nbsp;</em>player on PC or console, don't fret; that version of the game isn't going anywhere.</p>

It adds a new 6v6 mode called Dual Front, updates several maps, improves player onboarding, and more. On Sunday, Ubisoft also revealed that Siege X will include a dedicated in-game esports tab and that PC players will be able to test out all of these upgrades early through a test server session that will be live between 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET on May 20 and 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET on June 9. Ubisoft is increasing the minimum, high, and ultra PC- spec requirements alongside the launch of Siege X, which it detailed in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4497260-r6x_pc_specs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497260" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4497260-r6x_pc_specs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497260"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4497260-r6x_pc_specs.jpg"></figure><h2>Rainbow Six Siege X PC Specs</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen3 3100, Intel i3 8100</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1650 4GB, AMD RX 5500XT 4GB, INTEL ARC A380 6GB</li><li>Ram: 8GB</li><li>OS: Windows 10/11, DirectX 12</li><li>Storage: 65 GB SSD</li></ul><h3>High</h3><ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen5 3600, Intel i5 10400, AMD Ryzen7 3700X, Intel i5 11600K</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2060 6GB, NVIDIA RTX 3070 8GB, NVIDIA RTX 3080 10 GB, AMD RX 6600 8GB, AMD RX 6700 XT 8GB, AMD RX 6800 XT 16 GB</li><li>Ram: 16 GB</li><li>OS: Windows 11, DirectX 12</li><li>Storage: 65 GB SSD</li></ul><h3>Ultra</h3><ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen5 5600X, Intel i5-11600K</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti Super 16GB, AMD RTX 7900 XT 20GB</li><li>Ram: 16 GB</li><li>OS: Windows 11, DirectX 12</li><li>Storage: 110 GB SS</li></ul><p>Additionally, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/t63XgnGFUidxcAZQiPqoe/rainbow-six-siege-x-and-operation-daybreak-year-10-roadmap-reveal-details" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft teased</a> what's to come throughout the rest of Year 10. Siege X launches alongside a new season called Operation Daybreak. It redesigns the Defender Operator named Clash, who can now deploy her shield and activate its taser remotely. Operation Daybreak also brings other balancing updates to the game, such as electricity slowing Operators rather than damaging them now, reducing limb damage, and adjusting the abilities of Blackbeard, Jackal, Jäger, Thunderbird, and Sledge. The developers also plan to be more efficient in making anti-cheat updates throughout the season.</p><p>When Season 3 arrives several months from now, it will introduce a new Operator to the game, who is from Switzerland and wields a new weapon. It will also remaster the Nighthaven, Lair, and Consulate maps, feature the return of a Halloween event, and bring some changes to Dual Front to set up the new Operator. Then, Rainbow Six Siege will celebrate its 10th anniversary during Season 4, so Ubisoft will have a special in-game event for it. More Operator and map remasters, updates to training mode, and a new playlist called Testing Grounds will also arrive in Season 4.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege X and Operation Daybreak will launch on June 10 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. A test server for Siege X will run between May 20 and June 9.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-stealth-game-physint-is-five-or-six-years-from-release-by-kojimas-estimate/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-plans-to-continue-making-games-in-some-way-even-after-he-has-passed-away/">Hideo Kojima</a> and Kojima Productions next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-could-last-nearly-twice-as-much-as-the-original-has-more-combat-because-people-ask-kojima-for-mgs/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is due to release in a little more than a month. After that, it's anyone's guess as to when the next games we know Kojima has cooking, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">OD</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-return-to-stealth-physint-spurred-by-brush-with-death/">Physint</a>, are going to hit store shelves.</p>
<p>Kojima's guess, at least regarding Physint, is that we won't see its release for another "<em>five or six years</em>." That's what he told French magazine <a href="https://www.lefilmfrancais.com/">Le Film Français</a> in a recent interview (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/">VGC</a>), when talking about his future projects, and aspirations to make movies, now that Death Stranding 2 is nearly out the door.</p>
<p>"<em>Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development. That will take me another five or six years. Maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film. I grew up with cinema. Directing would be a kind of homage to it. Besides, I'm getting older, and I would prefer to do it while still young.</em>"</p>
<p>Kojima doesn't talk about OD, so perhaps OD is right in the middle of the five-to-six-year period, or it'll come afterward, with him working on OD alongside his first big film project. That's all just speculation, but unless we're due to hear that OD has been canceled, it arguably has to be somewhere in the next decade.</p>
<p>I mean, realistically, how much longer will Kojima keep working? He's currently 61, and if his estimation for Physint is correct, then he's technically also just confirmed the first cross-generational release between PS5 and PS6, unless, of course, the PS5 sticks around for more than a decade. And by that time, he'll be 67, looking to start directing movies, and maybe even still working on OD.</p>
<p>This all puts even more importance on Death Stranding 2. Whether you like Kojima's work or not, he's been one of the video game industry's most influential creators for years now. DS2 is officially one of the last game's we'll see from Hideo Kojima, and marks the closing of an era in video games with him officially looking at the exit door, even if he's not yet put a foot over the edge.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a>'s development team has issued an apology following a recent and poorly received update to the game, which led to an influx of negative feedback on Steam.</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki - a cute and colourful dress up game with gacha elements - released towards the end of last year, offering players the opportunity to partake in some cosy RPG fun. However, while the free to play game was well received on its initial launch, things have since soured.</p>
<p>On 28th April, the developer released Version 1.5 or "Bubble Season" for Infinity Nikki. This update was meant to add things such as new challenge levels, tasks and gameplay features, but it also added a number of bugs which included players being unable to start the game on PS5, meaning it had to be redownloaded completely. Other issues included crashes and Nikki not moving, to name but two. Meanwhile, the developer retconned Infinity Nikki's story, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4bFJK5BZ2E">in the words of one player</a>, "dived deep into scummy monetisation practices" with this update.</p>

<p>When the update went live, the game recieved a number of negative Steam reviews. And now, two weeks down the line, the team has issued an apology to its community, adding it has "decided to extend Version 1.5's end date to ensure greater stability and prevent similar issues from recurring" in the game.</p>
<p>"We're acutely aware that these recent issues have impacted your experience and damaged the trust and affection you've placed in us. To all stylists, we offer our deepest apologies," <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1923937697745469653">the developer wrote on social media</a>.</p>
<p>The Infinity Nikki studio continued: "Throughout the development journey since launch, we've faced a multitude of challenges and uncertainties. From optimising performance across diverse devices with varying capabilities to tackling unexpected technical roadblocks, many of these hurdles were unprecedented for our team.</p>
<p>"Rather than offering premature communication, we chose to tackle these problems methodically - responding to your expectations only once we had secured concrete solutions.</p>
<p>"But rest assured, we've heard your feedback loud and clear."</p>
<p>It went on to clarify that the Threads of Reunion storyline's absence in this version of Infinity Nikki was "never intended as a removal" from the game's narrative, and its associated outfit remains on the development roadmap.</p>
<p>"Due to technical hurdles in Version 1.5, we were unable to properly refine the introduction of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> chapter and the narrative setup for Threads of Reunion, which regrettably led to confusion," it said.</p>
<p>"These elements are planned for future updates. Plans are underway to expand tiered cumulative top-up rewards in upcoming versions; new gameplay systems will undergo rigorous design scrutiny to ensure seamless integration into the open-world experience and lore consistency. On top of that, adaptation, performance, and stability issues across various platforms (including PS) have been identified and are being resolved systematically."</p>
<p>Other "adjustments" are also being discussed, the studio said. "Some changes require extended development cycles, but we commit to implementing them through phased updates. We will share progress once plans solidify and milestones are reached. In the meantime, we humbly ask for your continued patience and trust."</p>

</figure>
<p>The studio additionally clarified "the delay arrangements, compensation plan, and key optimisation priorities", which are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Version 1.5 Extension &amp; Adjusted Event Schedules</strong></p>
<p>Due to version scheduling adjustments, Version 1.5 "Bubble Season" will be extended until June 12 (UTC-7).</p>
<p><strong>Version Timelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Version 1.5 End Date: June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7)</li>
<li>Version 1.6 Launch Date: June 12, 2025, 20:00:00 (UTC-7)</li>
</ul>
<p>*The maintenance schedule of Version 1.6 may be adjusted based on actual conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Version 1.5 Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The end date of the following Bubble Season events is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7): [Chase the Bubbles!], [Rainbow Album], [Where Are the Gifties?], [Floating Bubbles], [Rainbow and Pattern], and [Adventure Together].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 1.5 Store:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The end date of [Pear-Pal Selected/Store: Clothing] is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>The end date of [Heartfelt Gifts] is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>The end date of the [Shake Up Bubble Jar!] cumulative top-up event is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>All items in [Bubble Market] will be unavailable on June 12 at 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>The [Serenity Resonance Packs] and [Prismatic Plenitude Packs] in [Store: Featured] will be unavailable on June 12 at 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Version 1.5 Adjustments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The end date of Version 1.5 [Mira Journey] is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>The limited-time items in [Starlit Shop] will be removed on June 12 at 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weekly Tasks "Starlit Pursuit" Delay Notice:</strong></p>
<p>After Version 1.5 launched, we received extensive feedback on co-op features and gameplay. Based on this, we are optimising related systems, and the new weekly tasks [Starlit Pursuit], originally scheduled for May 20 (UTC-7), will now debut in Version 1.6. This delay allows us to refine task mechanics for a smoother experience. Additional details will be announced at a later date—please stay tuned.</p>
<p>In light of this change, 360 [Starlit Crystals] will be given to all players as compensation. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every stylist for your understanding and continued support.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Infold</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The development team said it recognised its communication efforts "may not meet every stylist's expectations", and it is therefore launching a new initiative known as Miraland Round Table. This will allow players to share feedback with the Infinity Nikki team via email (include the keyword [Table Advisor] in the email's subject line and send it to the support team at <a href="mailto:infinitynikki_cs@infoldgames.com">infinitynikki_cs@infoldgames.com</a>) or in-game via the Customer Service tab.</p>
<p>These channels will be prioritised, the Infinity Nikki team said, but added it will still continue to monitor feedback elsewhere as well.</p>
<p>"All collected input - past and present - will be compiled, with key issues receiving direct responses. Your candid feedback - both critical and encouraging - has prompted deep reflection. Drafting this message stirs mixed emotions: guilt over delayed promises, yet gratitude for your unwavering support," the developer said, offering compensation in the form of in-game Diamonds and Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>"Thank you for standing with us," it closed. "Together, we'll make Infinity Nikki shine brighter than ever!"</p>

<p>Recent changes aside, Jessica Orr had good things to say about the game on its release, calling it a "true step forward for open-world gacha games" that "finally brings some much needed competition to the miHoYo monopoly", in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review">Eurogamer's Infinity Nikki review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In classic me fashion, I swanned off for a few days just as another graphics card fracas has spilled out into public view. At the centre this time is the previously unassuming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidias-rtx-5060-gpus-are-launching-soon-with-price-cuts-on-the-rtx-5060-ti">RTX 5060</a>, which you may have noticed is due for launch today yet only has a handful of "hands-on previews" to tell you how big of a graphics it does. Allegedly, that’s because Nvidia have been keeping hold of the drivers needed for full reviews, only providing them at the eleventh hour to press outlets that have previously run these previews. No preview? No review, at least until the drivers release publicly later today, and what's more, the same reports say that these previews were only offered under strict testing provisos set by Nvidia themselves.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-grants-rtx-5060-drivers-access-to-media-willing-to-publish-previews">VideoCardz</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFDz-BQLew">Hardware Unboxed</a>, the mandated test conditions supposedly range from only allowing certain games for benchmarking – judging from the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/pc-gaming/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-first-impressions">previews</a> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/desktop-pc/i-spent-my-first-few-hours-with-the-rtx-5060-playing-doom-the-dark-ages-and-it-feels-pretty-slick-for-under-usd300/">currently</a> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/i-tested-the-rtx-5060-is-8gb-of-vram-really-enough-in-2025">online</a>, these were <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> – to the more egregious demand that RTX 5060 performance figures would focus on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation</a> (MFG). And, in turn, would only be compared to results from older XX60 GPUs that lack DLSS frame gen support entirely.</p>

<p>"We worked with a few chosen media on previews with a pre-release driver," an Nvidia spokesperson told me this afternoon. No comment on the review driver situation, other than a 5pm BST release time, was given.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>RPS was not invited to take part in these previews, and I can’t imagine agreeing to such terms if we were. Although it doesn’t appear that Nvidia required previewers to give positive RTX 5060 takes, with several highlighting the shortcomings of its 8GB VRAM limit, the limited game selection and emphasis on frame-genned performance versus the much older RTX 3060 and RTX 2060 Super are clearly intended to push a particular narrative: one that at best downplays the drawbacks of frame generation and at worst misleads readers with an unhelpfully narrow view of relative performance. GameStar, a German site that took Nvidia up on the offer, <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/geforce-rtx-5060-preview-benchmarks,3433080.html">said in their preview</a> that the GPU giant even specified the in-game settings that each game should be tested with.</p>
<p>The sense that a big, green thumb is pressing down on the critical scales is deepened by the alleged trading of earlier review drivers for a compliant preview. Even if, by that point, reviewers are free to use their own, independently-set benchmarks, the initial wave of RTX 5060 reviews will come from publications that Nvidia has – accurately or otherwise – deemed more friendly than others. Those who refused the locked-down previews, and have thus demonstrated less of a willingness to go along with the desired messaging, will be forced to wait before sharing impressions.</p>
<p>I can’t claim absolute moral superiority here because again, I wasn’t invited, and thus didn’t have the chance to send a "Thanks but no thanks" email (even I <em>hadn’t</em> simultaneously been too busy recovering from gin-assisted groomsman duty). Still, yeah, not a fan.</p>
<p>I have recently noticed Nvidia PRs becoming unusually pushy about how great it would be to test such and such frame generation in such and such game, but functionally those have only ever been suggestions, and I’ve never faced even a veiled hint at retribution for ignoring them in my reviews. Nonetheless, I now find myself in the bizarre position of having had physical possession of an RTX 5060 for nearly a week (posted by Zotac, with no strings attached other than to please not lose or break it), yet don’t have the software means to test or appraise it on the day of release. Like, man, at least Bethesda didn’t send us copies of Starfield while they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-starfield-review-is-going-to-be-a-little-late">withholding the activation keys</a>.</p>

<p>More disturbing still is that this isn’t even the only accusation of editorial manhandling to be laid at Nvidia’s feet today. Big-deal tech YooToobers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus">Gamers Nexus</a> claimed in a video (above) that Nvidia have, with varying levels of subtlety, threatened to cut off their interview access to Nvidia engineering staff in response to a perceived lack of focus on DLSS and MFG performance testing in their reviews. Gamers Nexus have, in fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nfEkuqNX4k">produced</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh1FHR9fkJk">multiple</a> long-form vids on these topics specifically.</p>
<p>It isn’t unheard of for, nor technically outside the rights of, companies to pick and choose who gets primo access for coverage. In tech media especially, there may even be a minor, ethically unbothersome quid-pro-quo involved: attending a virtual briefing, for instance, in exchange for getting onto the review list. But there’s a honking great difference between asking journalists to sit through a thirty-minute slideshow and, essentially, demanding editorial jurisdiction over how their products are evaluated. Nvidia, one of the richest, most powerful firms on Earth, should know better – and should have at least had an idea that being caught fiddling with the independent review process might cause more damage to the RTX 5060 than a few variations of "It’s not much faster than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">4060</a>, is it?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft have finally broken their silence over reports about the use of Azure and Microsoft generative AI tech by the Israeli military during the latter’s on-going invasion and bombardment of Gaza, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/">unsigned statement published 15th May 2025</a>, Microsoft confirm that they have supplied technology to the Israeli armed forces during the assault on Gaza, which began following the killing and abduction of Israeli civilians on October 7th 2023. They contend, however, that their own internal reporting has found "no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza." The news comes a few weeks after the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">called on people to avoid Microsoft games and gaming services in protest</a> at the company’s dealings with the Israel Defense Forces.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to several investigations earlier this year, including <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">a sizeable February report from the Associated Press</a>, the IDF have made use of Microsoft’s generative AI services extensively for combat and intelligence activities since October 2023. This includes the alleged use of genAI models to analyse and prepare data for the purpose of targeting airstrikes. The AP investigation - which is based on interviews with current and former members of Microsoft and the Israeli armed forces, together with internal company data and documents - also discusses the Israeli military's relationship with other big tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco, and Oracle.</p>
<p>These reports have intensified fears among many Microsoft staff that their work is being used as an instrument of war and oppression. Back in May 2024, Microsoft workers <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">launched a petition</a>, "No Azure for Apartheid," demanding an independent audit for potential human rights violations. Microsoft leadership have taken a hard line with certain, more visible protests about the sale of Microsoft services to the Israeli military. In April this year, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-fire-employees-who-protested-the-sale-of-genai-tech-to-the-israeli-military">fired two people</a> who spoke out at company anniversary events.</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft are trying to reassure those who remain. In the blog post, Microsoft announce the completion of an internal review of claims that Microsoft technology has been used "to target civilians or cause harm in the conflict in Gaza," with "additional fact-finding" supplied by an external firm. The blog post comments that Microsoft’s supply of tech to the Israel Ministry of Defense is "structured as a standard commercial relationship," and is therefore subject to their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all">acceptable use policy</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/ai-code-of-conduct">AI Code of Conduct</a>, together with their overall <a href="https://msblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/5/2025/05/Microsofts-Commitment-to-Human-Rights.pdf">commitment to human rights</a>. Microsoft say that, based on "both our internal assessments and external review," they’ve found no evidence that the Israeli armed forces have failed to comply with either document.</p>
<p>The blog also notes that military organisations "typically use their own proprietary software or applications from defense-related providers for the types of surveillance and operations that have been the subject of our employees’ questions." Microsoft, it says, have not created anything like this for the IMOD.</p>
<p>The blog adds, however, that Microsoft did provide the IMOD with "special access" to their technologies in the course of "limited emergency support to the Israeli government in the weeks following October 7, 2023, to help rescue hostages". Microsoft say they retained "significant oversight" during this period, "including approval of some requests and denial of others," so as "to help save the lives of hostages while also honoring the privacy and other rights of civilians in Gaza."</p>
<p>The post also caveats that Microsoft do not have full awareness of how the Israeli military may have used any Microsoft technology that runs on their own servers. "This is typically the case for on premise software," it argues. "Nor do we have visibility to the IMOD’s government cloud operations, which are supported through contracts with cloud providers other than Microsoft. By definition, our reviews do not cover these situations."</p>
<p>It’s an extremely brief response to a lengthy and disturbing series of claims, which expects the reader to take a lot on trust. The blog post does not include the full text of Microsoft’s internal and external assessments, nor does it respond to the detail of the allegations made by the Associated Press and other publications. It doesn’t even name the firm hired to carry out "additional fact-finding" for their review.</p>
<p>The No Azure for Apartheid movement have already called on Microsoft to release a full copy of their internal review. "It's very clear that their intention with this statement is not to actually address their worker concerns, but rather to make a PR stunt to whitewash their image that their relationship with the Israeli military has tarnished," former Microsoft worker Hossam Nasr argues in a statement, circulated by Israeli newspaper <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-17/ty-article/microsoft-says-it-provided-ai-to-israel-for-gaza-war-but-denies-use-to-harm-palestinians/00000196-dbd0-d9a9-a99e-fbd5a6f80000">Haaretz</a>.</p>
<p>Nasr and his colleague Abdo Mohamed were themselves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired by Microsoft</a> last year, after they helped organise a vigil at the company's headquarters for Palestinians killed in Gaza. They’ve since joined the BDS boycott on Xbox and Microsoft gaming products, which you can read more about on <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox">the official BDS site</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>'s recent delay, confirming the push was less than six months, while he stressed that another delay is unlikely.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBlLUo11qWg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, Zelnick said GTA 6's delay was "pretty short," amounting to "less than six months."</p><p>GTA 6's new release date is May 26, 2026. Six months prior to that is November 26, 2025. Rockstar never confirmed a specific GTA 6 release date, only stating that it would come out in Fall 2025. If the delay was less than six months, as Zelnick said, this suggests the company was originally eyeing a late-November or December release date for GTA 6. But of course, nothing is absolutely confirmed on that front.</p><p>Now that GTA 6 has a specific release date, Zelnick said it's unlikely that the game will be delayed again. "Generally, when we announce a date, we're able to hit that date," he said.</p><p>A delay for GTA 6 was always likely, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar game in the past 10+ years has been delayed.</a> It is indeed true that when Take-Two announces a specific date--not a vague release window--that the company sticks to its plans. That's not <em>always </em>true, though. GTA V's PS5 and Xbox Series X|S edition, for example, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-delayed-to-march-2022-new-trailer-shown-at-playstation-showcase/1100-6496035/#:~:text=GTA%205%20On%20PS5%20And,Shown%20At%20PlayStation%20Showcase%20-%20GameSpot" data-ref-id="1100-6496035">given a November 11, 2021 release date before shifting to March 2022.</a></p><p>For GTA 6, Zelnick said Rockstar's ambition to create something truly special is an effort that takes time.</p><p>"Rockstar is trying to create the best thing anyone has ever seen in entertainment. Not just interactive entertainment. That's a tall order," he added.</p><h2>"I don't play video games"</h2><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick was asked if he's played GTA 6. He apparently has not, as the executive replied, "I'm not a gamer. I don't play video games."</p><p>Zelnick said he does share his opinions "pretty openly" about what he sees with regards to game designs and concepts. However, he said his job as Take-Two's CEO is to attract, motivate, and retain the video game industry's best talent, and then to "get out of their way."</p><p>In other Rockstar news, it's been reported that the studio may be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">ports of GTA 4 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2.</a></p>

In a new interview with French magazine <a href="https://www.lefilmfrancais.com/index.php?option=com_papyrus&amp;view=recherche&amp;searchword=hideo+kojima"><em>Le Film Français</em></a>, Kojima said Physint is five to six years away from release.</p><p>This timeline isn’t too surprising – Kojima Productions’ next release is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> on June 26, and the studio is already developing its next game after that, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">OD</a>, for Xbox. Assuming Kojima Productions has no other surprises, Kojima claimed last year that Physint's development would begin in earnest after the launch of Death Stranding 2 (likely up to bat after OD), so the five-to-six-year timeline makes sense.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development.

			<p>Today, at Computex 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now available in over 125 games and applications. Following the news, NVIDIA provided more details and trailers about upcoming games and existing PC games that are being updated to include DLSS 4 and other NVIDIA technologies.</p>
<p>Let's start with Portal with RTX, which was upgraded from DLSS 3.5 to the new version while also updating the Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction models to the latest and greatest versions. Additionally, the game now supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Cache</a>. Taking advantage of the neural shader's capabilities to leverage AI to infer a great many rays and bounces from a limited set of indirect lights, the performance is improved even further. The flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, runs Portal with RTX at 277 average frames per second with full ray tracing enabled, according to NVIDIA tests. The RTX 5080 registers 171.5 frames per second, while the RTX 5070Ti achieves 143.7 frames per second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Portal with RTX | Improved Performance with DLSS 4 &amp; NRC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GyS3TtOC7hA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tomorrow, Saber Interactive will release Roadcraft, a rather unusual game where players will use construction machinery to restore sites damaged by various natural disasters. The game includes DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution (with the transformer AI model), and DLAA on day one. NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation can be enabled via the NVIDIA app overrides and will be added in-game soon. As seen in the trailer, Roadcraft runs at over 250 average frames per second with everything enabled on the RTX 5090.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoadCraft | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXDtRgeXrvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two days later, 1047 Games will launch SplitGate 2's Open Beta, which also features integration of the whole DLSS 4 suite: Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p>On the same day, the popular free-to-play melee-focused Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint will receive the <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously announced</a> path tracing update, greatly improving its visuals. The game already supported DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, but this update will also introduce Ray Reconstruction. In the NVIDIA trailer, the game runs at around 350 average frames per second with everything enabled.</p>
<p><iframe title="NARAKA: BLADEPOINT | Full Ray Tracing &amp; DLSS Ray Reconstruction Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElOkr-bhS2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On May 24, F1 25 launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-pc-specs-revealed-rtx-5080-for-path-tracing-at-1080p60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with path tracing</a> and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex.</p>
<p>In early June, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a> will be released with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation (which was not yet available in the recent beta), Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex. The NVIDIA trailer shows the game running at over 300 frames per second in some instances.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Awakening | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XlYFajRAed0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The same technologies will be available in MindsEye, the single player triple-A action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on June 10</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-physint-five-six-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Physint&nbsp;</em>creator Hideo Kojima has indicated that it's going to be quite a while before we get to play his new take on the "espionage action" genre he helped to pioneer.</p>

<p>In an interview with French cinema magazine&nbsp;<em>Le Film Francais&nbsp;</em>(thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Kojima talks about his love of film, and he also addresses the multiple video game projects he's currently working on.</p>

<p>As well as the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set to launch in June</a>, Kojima also named&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, which he says will "take [him] another five or six years" to make. He's previously stated that the production of the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes" rel="nofollow">heavily impacted by SAG strikes</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=XIPMjIJH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=DvhlVugs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideo Kojima says he'd like to work on a movie after&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">only revealed back in February last year</a>&nbsp;and that Kojima's games usually sport both high production values and a lot of polish, I don't think anyone was expecting to see&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>for at least the next few years. Still, knowing it's that far away is a touch disappointing.</p>

<p>After&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>are released, Kojima says he might like to try his hand at making a movie; he says he "grew up with cinema" and that he'd prefer to make a film "while still young" if he's going to do it at all.</p>

<p>As VGC points out, Kojima doesn't make any reference to&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">collaboration with filmmaker Jordan Peele</a>, but since he's promoting the Sony-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, that might not be so strange.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, too, was announced during a Sony event, so it may well be a PlayStation exclusive.</p>




<p>For the time being, though, Kojima will be focused on the release of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll" rel="nofollow">went gold earlier this month</a>, prompting the filling in of the second eye on Kojima's daruma doll.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>&nbsp;will, if Kojima's estimates are correct, launch somewhere around 2030-2031, thus probably making it a PlayStation 6 title at this point. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has sounded off on increasing game prices, saying he questions why people are complaining about $80 games when that price is actually a "steal" in terms of what's being offered, at least for some games. He said this in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCTm-cxuYTQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Hits Games</a>, stating that many products in regular life have gone up in price over the years, so it was only a matter of time before video games did as well.</p><p>"I think it was almost too late for the video game companies to start looking at the pricing structure," he said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-playstation-exec-says-usd70-or-usd80-games-are-a-steal-as-long-as-people-choose-carefully-how-they-spend-their-money-i-dont-think-they-should-be-complaining/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>In the '90s, many new releases sold for $60 USD. Adjusted for inflation, that's around $80 today, which is the price that Nintendo and Xbox will charge for some games this year. Sony, for its part, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">it might increase prices, too.</a></p><p>Not every game will become more expensive, though. Variable pricing in gaming has existed since the beginning, and it's going to continue into the future. As an example, 2K is charging $50 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">help the game reach the widest possible audience</a>. Yoshida said every game has a "different value [that] it provides," so a game company will decide how to price their product based on the "value that they believe they are bringing in."</p><p>He went on to say that a "really great" game that's priced at $70 or $80 would be a "steal in terms of the amount of entertainment" provided, and the quality of the experience compared to other forms of entertainment.</p><p>"As long as people choose carefully how they spend their money, I don't think they should be complaining," he said.</p><p>Nintendo defended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>'s $80 price point by stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">the game is simply worth that much given what it offers</a>. MK World is the only confirmed $80 game so far, from Nintendo or anyone else, but Microsoft has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">will charge $80 for some Xbox games later this year. </a> Electronic Arts, for its part, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">will not charge $80 for new games</a>, at least not yet.</p><p>Data shows that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to spend $80 or more on new games.</a></p>
