			<p>Too many video games based on popular children’s properties boil down to nothing more than cynical cash-ins, seeking to rob kids of their enthusiasm for their favourite toys and parents of their hard-earned cash. Hot Wheels Monster Trucks: Stunt Mayhem is not that type of kid’s game. Instead, this is an impeccably crafted release, one that will bring immense joy to the thousands of Hot Wheels Monster Truck’s mini fans out there.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hot Wheels Monster Trucks: Stunt Mayhem™ - Launch Trailer (PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1d-2yLOWAQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Imagine Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater but with Monster Trucks, and you’ve pretty much envisaged Stunt Mayhem. Your truck – or let’s be honest, your 8-year-old’s truck – races around an enclosed arena performing over-the-top stunts in pursuit of points. Gathering high enough scores will see you accumulate a vast fan-base, which will in turn unlock new stages, new challenges and, perhaps most excitingly of all, new Hot Wheels Monster Trucks to smash and crash with. Unlike the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/monster-jam-showdown-review/">Monster Jam</a> video game series, there’s no races to be had here, instead it’s all about nailing outlandish stunts within a strict time-limit.</p>


<p>Environments are small but brightly coloured, endearingly cartoony, and cram-packed with detail and depth. Each is based on various landscapes you’ll find within the extended Hot Wheels toy universe. Trust me, you won’t have heard of any of them, but your kid will squeal with delight when they discover they can zoom around Camp Crush. Every arena is littered with things to leap off and obstacles to drive through, ensuring that the three-minutes spent in them is filled with chaotic destruction and engaging activity.</p>


<p>The handling for the Trucks themselves is straight-forward and incredibly accessible. They are also unbelievably manoeuvrable, capable of performing limitless spins, barrel-rolls and front-flips, providing that ramp they just leapt off gives them enough air. In short, regardless of video game experience, any kid will be able to give Stunt Mayhem a go and perform some visually spectacular and fist-pumpingly thrilling Monster Truck manoeuvres.</p>
<p>But don’t let the welcome accessibility fool you; Stunt Mayhem can still offer a decent challenge, requiring the player to return several times to each stage to complete more optional extra missions and make progress through the game. These tasks are simple enough to grasp – objectives like destroy 65% of the obstacles or pop all of the balloons are commonplace – but they encourage and reward exploration and experimentation. There are lots of, “If I leap off that ramp, hit that walkway, and flip off that caravan, can I reach that platform covered in Crush Cars?” moments to be enjoyed here. Overall, the ramping up of the difficulty level is expertly configured for younger gamers, ensuring a gradual rising curve of a challenge is offered, rather than off-putting game-quitting difficulty spikes.</p>

<p>Most importantly for Hot Wheels fans, all the top Monster Trucks are included and can be rabidly unlocked. There’s Mega-Wrex and Big Foot available from the outset, but they’ll soon be joined by Gunkster, 5-Alarm, Race Ace, and the rest. New skins can be unlocked, including glow-in-the-dark chassis, which, I have been informed by my son, are very exciting indeed.</p>
<p>Considering the overall quality of the game on offer, it’s disappointing that the player can’t drive around the epic stunts on each course. These are basically the really expensive and really big Hot Wheels toy sets – think scorpions, gorillas, and volcanoes – each covered in loop-de-loops and twisty turny tracks. They look awesome and are undoubtedly the most exciting feature of each arena, but if you drive into one, you’re just stuck with watching a cut-scene, your controller hanging limply until you are allowed to play again. A missed opportunity perhaps. Boss fights are rather dull too, offering no excitement as they are little more than a treasure hunt with more of those cut-scene stunts to watch.</p>

Most importantly, it’ll keep your youngster busy whilst you wash the pots, order a food shop, and get the hoovering done – what’s not to like?	</p></div>

					<p>It would be the euphemism of the year to say that for BioWare, a lot is riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The once revered maker of roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age has stumbled severely with its last two games, Mass Effect Andromeda and Anthem.</p>
<p>The latest installment in the sci-fi franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn't bad</a>, but it wasn't great, either, and it didn't sell as well as BioWare's parent company, Electronic Arts, wanted. The real catastrophe was Anthem, though. The new intellectual property was designed as a live service game that would be updated for ten years post-launch, but it ended up getting only a couple of patches before the overwhelmingly negative reception from critics and fans alike essentially halted that content roadmap. For a while, BioWare attempted to concoct a major overhaul (dubbed Anthem Next) that could resurrect Anthem, but EA ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-next-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose to abandon the project</a> and let the studio focus on its core franchises: Dragon Age and Mass Effect.</p>
<p>Anthem also had a big influence on the fourth Dragon Age game. At some point, the idea was to make another live service game with coop, and reporter Jason Schreier even <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the developers internally referred to it as 'Anthem with dragons.' Luckily, the magnitude of Anthem's failure, combined with the success of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, proved to Electronic Arts that single player games could still be financially successful, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-will-be-a-single-player-only-rpg-multiplayer-has-been-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convincing</a> the publisher to allow BioWare to focus solely on the campaign and drop multiplayer altogether.</p>
<p>By mere syllogism, one could say that Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has effectively saved the beloved Canadian studio. Many fans feared a third unsuccessful game could persuade Electronic Arts to either sell BioWare or shut it down altogether, and with 2024 proving a terrible year for layoffs and studio closures, this was a concrete possibility. Of course, what Respawn's game actually did was give BioWare a chance, which they could still have squandered. I'm happy to share, though, that they did not. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a great ride that any fan of the studio's games will be able to enjoy.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rook-and-Assan-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The key part is that the developers successfully invested in their own strengths rather than trying to follow the latest trends even if they were out of their expertise. I'm referring specifically to the decision to abandon the open world-like zones of Dragon Age: Inquisition (and Mass Effect Andromeda) in favor of a more old-school approach, reminiscent of the earlier installments in those franchises. Nowadays, it's getting harder and harder to find games that do not offer open world design. Even indie developers, thanks to game-making tools like Epic's Unreal Engine, can do it relatively easily, and many publishers think of it as a definite plus for any upcoming game.</p>
<p>It must have taken BioWare a considerable amount of convincing to get EA to approve the idea, but they did it, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard is definitely better off like this. I have to admit I was skeptical at first, as I am a big advocate of open-world games in general; however, this game proved to me that there's a place for mission-based Western RPGs going forward. For one thing, it goes a long way toward ensuring the game does not overstay its welcome, as everything is more or less connected to the story and the characters.</p>
<p>It was not so in Inquisition, and content bloat is indeed an issue in many open world games save for the very best ones (and even those do have some side content that is just not on the same level as the rest, which developers are forced to add just to populate all the world). That is not to say Dragon Age: The Veilguard doesn't have relatively straightforward quests, but they are still grounded in the same narrative tissue, making them feel like part of one cohesive story.</p>
<p>Following the few initial missions, the player navigates Thedas by accessing the world map and traveling with the Eluvians, the magical mirrors made by ancient elves that allow long-distance travel. Access to the Eluvians may come and go depending on progress (you'll have to unlock some) and story (in some cases, you must head to a specific area just for one mission, and the game will unlock the Eluvian for you). Still, some options remain available for most of the game, allowing players to revisit the same zone multiple times.</p>
<p>It's a good thing, too, because there's actually a fair amount of exploration in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Make no mistake, this is no Elder Scrolls, and you won't find NPCs going on about their lives as in an open world game that simulates real life. Rather, BioWare chose the old-school approach first popularized by the Metroidvania genre: there's a ton of loot and secrets hidden behind puzzles and companion abilities, so you will have plenty of reason to return to exploration regions like the Arlathan Forest, Minrathous, Rivain, the Necropolis Halls, Treviso, the Hossberg Wetlands, and the Crossroads beyond just quests. If you want to make the most out of that exploration feeling, it might be a good idea to remove the mini-map, which is one of several tweaks allowed within the accessibility options.</p>
<p>Would I have preferred more expansive zones? Sure, but they may have come at the cost of something else. Given the quality of the final game, I'm happy with the tradeoff. By the way, prepare yourselves to open countless chests and collect innumerable resources lying around, even in the most linear missions, up to the very final one. And remember: break any box or vase you see in the environments, because they will yield resources that can be used or sold to vendors. Those elements may be a bit trite, but there's a reason they have worked for decades: they make the player feel good, and that's still true to this day. Pretty much the same happens in some of the most acclaimed games of the recent past, such as Sony Santa Monica's God of War Norse saga.</p>
<p>Overall, I finished all the missions in the game (save for two particularly challenging puzzles) in 78 and a half hours, not far at all from the 80-hour mark BioWare promised in the review guide. I would say it's almost perfect for a mission-based RPG: quite meaty but about half as long as the gargantuan Baldur's Gate 3, which perhaps will make it more replayable. Granted, if you wish to complete it quicker, you can absolutely do it - the main path is said to be around 35 to 40 hours.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DA_EA_AbilityWheel2_08b_RGB_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>One of the main areas of innovation for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is in its combat system. Whereas the previous titles featured a larger party of four companions and allowed players to take direct control of the companions, this one sticks to a party of three and only lets you move around as the player character, just like in the Mass Effect series. Moreover, players have to choose three active abilities and an ultimate for their character plus three abilities per companion, whereas Inquisition featured way more selectable abilities in combat. This caused concerns among fans that the franchise's trademark tactical element would be lost or diminished.</p>
<p>However, that's not the case at all. First and foremost, as the developers had already disclosed prior to launch, several abilities have been baked into the core moveset of each class (Warrior, Mage, and Rogue) and do not count toward that same pool of abilities. For example, the Mage can side-step attacks or Fade-step for a longer dodge by double tapping the same button; they can perform a sprint attack or a jump attack with both light and heavy attack buttons; they can charge light attacks, heavy attacks, and ranged attacks by holding the respective buttons.</p>
<p>There are also different mechanics based on the weapon you're using, which can be switched at all times in combat: while the staff lets you create a defensive shield that is maintained as long as you have mana, the dagger and orb are more geared toward a melee type of character who must parry at the right time to be effective. Dagger and orb also have unique mechanics called Arcane Marks, which are applied to the enemy with light attacks; once you get to three hits, you apply an Arcane Bomb, which can be triggered with a heavy attack for heavy damage.</p>
<p>This is just the very basics. Most of these attacks and moves can be augmented through gear and talents; for example, the Greater Passive downfall turns every jump attack on knocked-down foes into a critical hit. The Trait Fade Strike lets you perform a powerful follow-up attack after Fade-stepping; Imbued Defense provides the Shocking Weapons buff (+25% weapon damage) after performing a Perfect Defense, while Return Fire lets you perform a quick counterattack after the aforementioned Perfect Defense. And this is just for the core moveset; there are as many traits and passives that work on the active abilities and other aspects of your build.</p>
<p>On that note, did I say there are also Runes? You can equip three of those at a time (though activating one sets off a shared cooldown) and they can be extremely useful depending on the situation. Examples include freezing or knocking down all nearby enemies, losing all mana to get a big heal, instantly refreshing your or your companion's ability cooldowns, greatly enhancing the efficacy of your next ability, and more. I unlocked twenty-four runes during my time with the game, and each comes with a passive and an active effect to trigger at the right time.</p>
<p>As someone whose favorite genre is RPGs (and MMORPGs), I can safely state that Dragon Age: The Veilguard offers an impressive amount of depth in its build creation. Best of all, skill points can be refunded for free whenever outside of combat, allowing users free reign to tinker around and create their favorite build synergies with a great many options at their disposal. That includes companions, by the way, who are still very important - far more than in any Mass Effect game, I'd say, when it comes to combat. While their skill trees are not as extensive, they still offer several options that players would be wise to carefully evaluate depending on their play style.&nbsp;There are so many buffs and debuffs to consider, not to mention each enemy's vulnerability and resistances, which you can check at any time in combat by pausing the action and bringing up the ability wheel. That's where you can tell each companion what to do against which target, largely preserving the core tactical element of Dragon Age.</p>
<p>It may be different on the lower difficulties, but when playing on Underdog (the second-toughest difficulty after Nightmare, which, however, locks you into that difficulty when beginning a playthrough), pausing the action to think about what to do and properly order the companions around was instrumental to say the least, especially to set up the detonation combos, which work by applying and then triggering an effect like Weakened, Sundered, or Overwhelmed on a target. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is no Dark Souls, but its encounter design is excellent and it offers a worthy challenge even to experienced action and RPG players. There are some fantastic boss fights in the game, both in terms of spectacle and mechanics, forcing you to grow your character and perhaps change your build a bit, as well as learn how to counter the boss's moves as in any great action game.</p>
<p>There is a bit of a catch in that companions do not actually take damage - they are effectively invulnerable in combat. That said, enemies do attack them from time to time, and two of them offer specific taunt abilities to get the attention off you (there's also a Rune that diverts enemies to the rest of the party for a short while). This may irk those who yearn for realistic fights, but in practice, it did not bother me at all. The game was clearly designed around this limitation (probably because they wanted to avoid the issue where they died all the time and forced the player to revive them over and over again) and I did not feel it negatively impacted Veilguard.</p>
<p>In fact, the changes made compared to Inquisition's middling combat are almost entirely for the better. Dragon Age: The Veilguard has an outstanding combat system that finds the perfect balance between action and tactics, giving it a unique identity in the RPG genre.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>BioWare's games have always been narrative-driven, and this one is no exception. The game follows directly on the events seen in Inquisition and its Trespasser DLC with a ten-year gap (just like in real life), and it can be considered the culmination of storylines that have been in motion for a long time in the series. Dragon Age lore aficionados will find several earth-shattering revelations that answer some long-standing questions. Effectively, this game closes one chapter of the overarching world narrative, and the next installment will inevitably have to be centered around different themes and characters.</p>
<p>For this reason, those who played previous installments and know about the lore will get the most enjoyment, although it is not a barrier to newcomers. While creating the player character (the character creator is very robust, although not the most complex I've seen in a game), the game also lets you create the Inquisitor, the protagonist of the previous game, and choose how a few key events from Inquisition unfolded.</p>
<p>Having choices and consequences reverberate throughout their games has also characterized the studio's previous work, especially in Mass Effect and Dragon Age. Again, Veilguard does not disappoint in this area, either. Early on, there will be a major decision to make: the villains are attacking two cities at once, and you cannot be there for both. Each city is tied to one of the companions, and the 'forgotten' city and companion will be transformed in a way. The companion will become ineligible for some time as they deal with the fallout, and when they come back, they will be 'hardened', empowering their damage abilities while closing down their healing ones as they are now hellbent on vengeance.</p>
<p>This is an interesting system, both narratively and mechanically, so it's a shame that it does not seem to apply to the other companions as well. Other than that, you will guide the companions in their personal quests through harrowing times of acceptance and personal struggles, with companion quests ranging from relaxed hangouts to sprawling missions that lead to complex boss fights. Seeing a companion through the entire personal quest is not only fulfilling from a storyline perspective, it will also allow you to maximize the bond with them, level them up, and elevate them to Hero of the Veilguard, a status that empowers their abilities and makes them more likely to survive the final fight.</p>
<p>That's really where most of the choices and efforts made throughout the whole game come to fruition. Allowing each of the companions to solve their conflicts and each of the factions to be as strong as possible is a big factor in attaining the best possible ending, although there are some choices to make even in the final fight, such as sending the right companion to accomplish a certain task.</p>
<p>Overall, the writing in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is great, and the voiceover and tech improvements (mainly facial animations, eyes, and the amazing hair) also help a great deal with the presentation. Just do not expect to act as a villain or even just drive away companions. While in some instances a certain dialogue option led to a companion disapproving, those were so far and few between to not actually matter. This is not that kind of RPG - you're supposed to be a hero.</p>
<p>Companions can be befriended and romanced, as in most previous BioWare titles. In my experience, the romance was a slow but steady buildup, though that may depend on the character, and it's fine by itself since it felt good when it finally happened. There's practically no nudity to speak of, anyway, so if you were hoping for steamy sex scenes like in Baldur's Gate 3, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>Also, a minor criticism regarding cutscenes is that most of the time, companions do not intervene when talking to other NPCs, even when it would be entirely appropriate for them to do so (for instance, when talking with the leaders of the resistance of their city of provenance). Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield, on the other hand, featured a lot of instances where companions interjected, making conversations feel more lively and realistic. Granted, there's still a lot of great banter between companions themselves, and you won't miss on any of that just because you've suddenly entered combat - they are now smart enough to resume that talk once things have settled down.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DA_6-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs on the Frostbite engine, just like the last three games made by the studio. Much has been written on the hardships encountered by the BioWare developers as they attempted to tame an engine originally made for shooter games.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the release, the developers mentioned that they had finally learned how to best use Frostbite. That may be the case, but the performance is honestly underwhelming. I played on a PC with nearly the best combination of CPU and GPU one money can buy (an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090), and yet I had to deal with considerable stuttering throughout it all. That's even with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode (upscaling from 1080p to 4K) and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, not to mention the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-game-ready-driver-is-optimized-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimized Game Ready driver installed</a>. The only way to reduce those stutters was to essentially remove ray tracing, or rather, switch to the 'RT Selective' option, which only applies ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion to specific areas of the game that best showcase the respective effects. Even so, they were not eliminated and occurred regularly.</p>
<p>Those were not shader stutters, by the way. The game compiles shaders the first time you launch it, recompiles them if you change drivers, and verifies them anyway each time before loading the menu. They had to be traversal stutters, as we're used to seeing with Unreal Engine games. However, while Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks good, it doesn't compare to the latest triple-A Unreal Engine releases. Honestly, it might be worth it for EA to allow BioWare to use Unreal Engine, just like Respawn, going forward. I also had to contend with a bug for my whole playthrough: when launching the game with HDR enabled and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, there were flickering skies until I turned off and then on again DLSS FG. On the upside, HDR was well implemented, which is unfortunately rare.</p>
<p>From a visual standpoint, the game succeeds in providing many different biomes to explore as the party treks across Northern Thedas, fulfilling BioWare's promise to bring players to more locations than ever before. The environments generally look great, while the characters are a bit more of a hit-and-miss in that some are almost photorealistic and others look more stylized. In that regard, more uniformity would have been ideal.</p>

It’s not unlike all these '90s movie sequels we're seeing coming back around after several decades – although less extreme in the case of this particular series as it’s only been ten years since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-review-age-of-dragons-has-arrived"><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em></a>.</p>

<p>I bring up this comparison because, at its core, Bioware as a developer had somewhat tapered off, and <em>Dragon Age</em> was dormant for some time following three successive releases starting in 2009. Instead of hashing out whatever they could after the third game, the team took their time in preparing something for the current generation.</p>

<p>The result is now here with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, a fully featured single-player continuation of the <em>Dragon Age</em> world. After ten years of waiting, is it all worth it? Can Bioware restore some of the faith that waned away from fans of the studio?</p>

<p>After playing through <em>The Veilguard</em>, I’ve never been more sure that the answer to that question is a resounding “yes”.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonageveilguard20241017221749_1.jpg?itok=WX48BQPD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonageveilguard20241017221749_1.jpg?itok=l538cvUD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> pulls on the tried and true Bioware formula by putting you in the shoes of a character known as Rook – and as such, everything that character does over the course of the story matters.</p>

<p>From dialogue, to quests, and character interactions – it’s all woven into the ultimate outcome of the story. So much so, that I was almost taken aback by how quickly the game gets you right into the thick of it.</p>

<p><em>The Veilguard</em> kicks off by putting Rook into immediate action (quite literally after the character creator), by way of having to confront a man known as Solas, the Dread Wolf. Solas has one goal: to tear down the Veil that separates the world, Thedas, from the realm of demons. It’s a grand scheme he wants to enact in order to restore his people. Surely it can’t go wrong… until it does.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rook and associates, Solas’ ritual is disrupted, releasing two ancient and powerful gods, Elgar’naan and Ghilan’nain, and imminent destruction upon the world. With everything thrown into chaos, it’ll be up to Rook and their companions to put a stop to them in a world that is fraught with plenty of established strife and conflict.</p>

<p><em>The Veilguard</em>’s story is one that weaves through both the over-arching narrative, and one that relies so much on interactions with different companions, locations, and factions. All of these elements are important as they eventually lead to the story’s conclusion.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonage20241018153703_1.jpg?itok=YpCeMCVW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonage20241018153703_1.jpg?itok=8JaxUONN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For the most part, I found it largely enjoyable. There’s a lot of love in getting to know the different companions that Rook recruits. There’s also a feeling similar to the recent <em>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> movie that inspires a lot of whimsy, but not without variety in their backgrounds.</p>

<p>There’s also a lot of depth in the lore, and in each of the different locations Rook explores and the different people they meet. The writers of <em>The Veilguard</em> did well to make everything feel well-worn within the world, and a lot of that is pieced together in both side quests and companion quests.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that a lot of the optional quests are worth doing in that respect, and you will miss a lot by just rushing through the main story. When Bioware said that everything you do circles back to the finale, they weren’t kidding. That said, I did think the way <em>The Veilguard</em> wraps up is a little anti-climactic. There’s a lot of big things that go on within the story, what with the elder gods and the impending doom upon the world, but the way all of it comes together leaves a little to be desired when so much of it is framed with high stakes and appropriate drama before that point.</p>

<p>Mileage may vary of course, but the journey along the way was something I felt was the strongest part, as well as all the choices you make while doing so through dialogue and other decisions. There are some choices that have immense consequences beyond the immediate action, so those are worth taking into consideration because they will have long-lasting impacts in some cases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonage20241019194700_1.jpg?itok=-Qwtht3b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonage20241019194700_1.jpg?itok=yUuFeRsn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>All of this circles back to Rook and their companions. Rook, the player-created character is a fully fleshed-out and voiced protagonist – one whose appearance, lineage, and class can be completely customized at the start of the game.</p>

<p>They can be an elf, a qunari, human, or dwarf. From there, it’s a selection of their faction and accompanying backstory. For example, I went with the Antivan Crows, who are both assassins and protectors.</p>

<p>Classes in <em>The Veiguard</em> are split into three choices, each of which carries two different weapons. These are Warrior, Mage, and Rogue, which are all self-explanatory. During my playthrough, I went with Mage for the range abilities with spellcasting, but also because I was able to then specialize through the Skills with a blade as a secondary weapon for close combat.</p>

<p><em>The Veilguard</em> lets you re-spec whenever you want too, so there’s a lot of freedom in playstyle throughout.</p>

<p>Your class will largely influence how you approach combat in <em>The Veilguard</em>, but at its core, each one will include a light attack, heavy attack, along with jumping and dodging – all of which can be strung together in action gameplay mapped to the face buttons on a controller.</p>

<p>There’s also an Ability Wheel, which pauses the action so you can pick out both your own individual actions and targets, as well as your companions. It’s an intuitive system that lets you swap in and out of real-time combat seamlessly while giving you more control. I found myself using it a lot when it came to parsing out some of the more challenging enemies, such as the boss encounters. That said, I would have liked to see a bit more variety in the enemies overall. It's one of the few areas of <em>The Veilguard</em> I found somewhat lacking.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonage20241017214945_1.jpg?itok=7uBHGDat 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonage20241017214945_1.jpg?itok=2Bh5OySY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Further combat customization can be found in the Skill tree, in which Rook can tool their playstyle to one specialization. Skill Points are earned throughout <em>The Veilguard</em> through quests, as well as through normal combat. It’s a basic setup, but being able to re-spec whenever you want helps keep gameplay fresh.</p>

<p>Rook’s companions can also earn Skill Points, and this is important because there’s a lot of time that can be dedicated to increasing their bonds, as well as catering them to different combat whims as they all come equipped with different abilities.</p>

<p>For example, there’s Lace Harding, who is handy with a bow and the ability to stagger enemies. There’s also Darvin, a strong attacker who uses his griffon companion as backup. Another interesting character is Lucanis Dellamorte, an assassin who makes use of dual daggers, but someone who can also put buffs on the party.</p>

<p>Each of the seven companions are unique, and their individual stories make them worth spending time with - you can even influence romantic options with them, in true Bioware tradition. Of course, you can choose to ignore them entirely, but you may not like the eventual consequences.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonage20241027170112_1.jpg?itok=qsSqqEkK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonage20241027170112_1.jpg?itok=riDiFIvf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>All of this is wrapped up together in what is no doubt a stunning presentation. <em>The Veilguard</em> looks gorgeous throughout with plenty of visual flair, a dense world, and unique art direction accompanied by an electric soundtrack.</p>

<p>There’s something to be said about the amount of visual variety and fidelity in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and it really helps to tell a world-spanning story.</p>

<p>That said, I did encounter some performance issues in several locations. Quite randomly, there were framerate drops without much of anything going on, so hopefully that’s something that can be fixed in a patch later down the line. I also encountered some bugged out enemies, but it was nothing that was game-breaking.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is no doubt an achievement. And again, the ten-year wait has been a blessing because it allowed the folks at Bioware to come back with something strong, satisfying, and fully polished.</p>

<p>Because that’s what<em> The Veilguard</em> is – a polished game, one with a compelling story and characters with much of the design decisions not dissimilar to that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/mass-effect-legendary-edition-notable-flaw"><em>Mass Effect 2</em></a>. It's a polished game that, I think most importantly, doesn't require any previous knowledge of the series, but if you are a fan, it doesn't shy away from catering to you too.</p>

The complete version will cost $9.99 in the US at first, but once January 30th at 10PM PT rolls around it will cost twice as much at $19.99.</p><p>Existing <em>Pocket Camp</em> players who want to port their game data over will have until June 1st, 2025 to do so, via a linked Nintendo account. The original app’s service will cease on November 28th at 7AM PT, so it seems anyone on the fence needs to have their save data linked and <a href="https://faq.complete.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/29555650212761-Preparing-to-Transfer-Save-Data">prepped for transfer</a> before that. Nintendo has spelled out some of these details in a 12-minute video explainer, which also goes over the existing features that are transferring over and what’s not making the <em>Complete</em> cut.</p><p>What’s new for <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em> is the ability to play without a constant internet connection. Players will still be able to visit and trade with friends online, but the new version can be a fully offline experience if desired. Instead of the premium currency of the original game, Leaf Tickets, the complete version will have Leaf Tokens — earned by exchanging Bells or completing goals. Leaf Tokens will be used for buying furniture or speeding up crafting times, so it sounds like the replacement for in-game purchases may be more grinding. And for those that have a stockpile of the old Leaf Tickets, know that they will not be transferred (best to get spending before that Thanksgiving cutoff).</p><p>The other big new features for <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em> are in-game Camper Cards that players can customize with their avatars and favorite in-game animals. You can create and trade cards with other players in real life via QR codes. Collecting friends via Camper Cards adds their character to a new mountain location called Whistle Pass, where they may occasionally gift you items and enjoy daily musical performances from K.K. Slider at 7PM. Other members of your friends list who made the transfer to <em>Complete </em>may also appear at Whistle Pass. I assume the others will be quietly raptured and never spoken of again.</p><p><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em> can be preordered / pre-registered on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zasa">Android</a> now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SAG-AFTRA has announced that its strike against video game studios will continue. The announcement comes after more negotiations between the parties over AI protections and better general working conditions failed to result in a deal..</p>



<p>“After three days of scheduled negotiations, SAG-AFTRA announced that Interactive Media Agreement negotiations with employers would continue, with new dates to be announced as soon as they are confirmed,” the union <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/video-game-negotiations-continue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>. </p>



<p>“Negotiations resumed with the employer unit which includes Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Llama Productions LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc. on Oct. 23.”</p>



<p>The union says that the strike remains in place against “all signatories to the Interactive Media Agreeement”. The only exception is to games “signed to the Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement or an Interim Interactive Media Agreement.”</p>



<p>The latest video game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strike began in July</a> when SAG-AFTRA called for it after 18 months of negotiations between the union and various game studios. The union believes that studios don’t have their actors’ best interests in mind when it comes to potential AI exploitation.</p>



<p>“We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,” SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said at the beginning of the strike.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-update-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Funday Games and Ghost Ship have released the fourth major&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's packed with plenty of stuff that should serve as a good excuse to revisit the game if you've fallen off it.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect, this update is on roughly the same scale as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-update">previous content drops</a> for the bullet heaven game, and its first major addition is a brand new biome in the form of the Azure Weald.</p>

<p>Described as a "surprisingly wet blue cave with luminescent plants" by the devs, the Azure Weald comes complete with crystals that heal you while you stand near them, although you won't find much Red Sugar to provide sustenance here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-update-4-azure-weald.jpg?itok=VHuQNsri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-update-4-azure-weald.jpg?itok=-StJmMgF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new Azure Weald biome should give you plenty of new reasons to blast bugs in the latest&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>New enemies have also been added, including the Glyphid Warden, which buffs nearby Glyphids' defense, as well as new Mini Exploder and Big Praetorian variants. Spawns work slightly differently in the Azure Weald, too; you'll enjoy periods of calm followed by "larger and more intense" waves.</p>

<p>This latest&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>update also adds a new Mutator system, which gives you both positive and negative modifiers across the Vanguard Contracts and Lethal Operations modes, which are also new to this update.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to see your score at the conclusion of each dive, with scores being based on overall performance across a number of stats including completion speed, secondary objective completion, and more.</p>




<p>Naturally, there are plenty of other changes in&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>Update 4 as well. You can check out everything that's new via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2321470/view/4553794655131533851" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>, it's a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style bullet heaven auto-shooter set in the dwarf-inhabited world of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll battle hordes of alien Glyphids, dig up treasure, and build your loadout through upgrades, all while exploring some of the most dangerous caves Hoxxes has to offer.</p>

            <p>In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're <em>both</em> on the surface.</p>
<p>Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.</p><!--more-->

<p>I'm writing this up partly because the press release does, indeed, call the game "Foddian", and I love that this is a thing now. I love that Bennett Foddy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">game-length exercise in punching you in the hands</a> has become a genre. I love that developers are doing this to us, the Gamers - we definitely have it coming. In fairness, Ascending Inferno seems relatively gentle for a Foddlike. It's more of a traditional 2.5D platformer, with luscious voxel and pixel art, and mechanics specific to certain levels. That said, it does rely entirely on ball physics.</p><p>The setup is that you're a Goth footballer called Dani, who is trying to rescue her brother Vincent from Hell. Vincent, unfortunately, no longer has a body. He's an ectoplasmic orb with eyes. On the upside, this means he can't independently get himself into trouble, like many an NPC in an escort quest. On the downside - nine realms deep, to be exact - this means that he is quite capable of rolling and tumbling all the way to the bottom of the level. "It's not enough to run, jump and platform your way out of Hell - you'll need to dribble, kick and header [as well]" gloats <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442820/Ascending_Inferno/">the Steam page</a>. Yeah, screw you too.</p>
<p>Again, I don't think this is as Foddable as some of the Fodder I've encountered. It doesn't look nearly as soul-crushing as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pushing-it-with-sisyphus">Pushing It! With Sisyphus</a>, and there's no multiplayer like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chained-together">Chained Together</a>, so it won't even ruin all your real-life friendships.</p>
<p>I also really like the obvious fun the developers have had with the realms of the afterlife, each pilfered from Dante's Inferno and equipped with its own visual direction. The trailer gives us a few glimpses: Gluttony is a squalid diner, Lust is a heaving nightclub, Fraud is like a rundown Castlevania themepark. It makes me want to play a Sonic The Hedgehog game set in hell. That's where a lot of Sonic games belong, in fairness.</p>
<p>Ascending Inferno is out today. I guess, given the headline reference, I should end by discussing the music. It seems pretty passable to my unsophisticated ears, like Vangelis but rockier. I probably wouldn't give somebody their beloved's soul back if they played this at me, but I might offer them a consolation prize like, I don't know, the soul of a budgerigar, or perhaps an eHarmony coupon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Three years ago, the Software Preservation Network and the Video Game History Foundation put forth a petition to the US Copyright Office to allow libraries to share the out-of-print video games in their possession with researchers remotely. However, that request has now been denied, and it means this battle to keep out-of-print games alive has come to an end.</p><p>The copyright office sided with the Entertainment Software Association and other video game lobbyists' argument that letting libraries share digital access to their titles would lead to "a significant risk that preserved video games would be used for recreational purposes." Essentially, the argument is that researchers enjoying the remote games would constitute copyright infringement.</p><p>The Video Game History Foundation <a href="http://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released a statement</a> decrying this decision while pointing out that it helped prove that "around 87 percent of video games released in the United States before 2010 remain out of print." Video Game History Foundation founder and director Frank Cifaldi also shared his own statement, <a href="https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/1849869475782459704" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a>, "I'm proud of the work we and the orgs we partnered with did to try and change copyright law. We really gave it our all, I can't see what else we could have done. This fails the needs of citizens in favor of a weak sauce argument from the industry, and it's really disappointing."</p><p>The copyright office's decision also stated that giving libraries the asked for exemption would potentially harm video game companies' attempts to repackage and sell their older legacy titles to modern consumers. But as noted by the VGHF, even companies like Nintendo have let many older titles fall out of print or remain unavailable to consumers as downloadable titles.</p><p>It's unclear if video game preservationists can take any steps to challenge this decision. Meanwhile, the ESA already announced earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-esa-says-its-members-wont-support-the-one-form-of-game-preservation-that-might-actually-work/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it opposes any compromise about sharing out-of-print games</a> remotely among researchers.</p>

			<p>Starfield 2 is going to be one hell of a game, according to a former Bethesda designer who worked on The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, as it will address much of the original game's criticism.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/starfield-2-one-hell-of-a-game-claims-designer-bethesda/?callback=in&amp;code=ODE2ZJC2NZYTM2Y4MC0ZMMJKLWI3NGQTZWUXMZU4NJBMNJMW&amp;state=22be1898c559444ca029c628e9f2b835" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoGamer</a>, Bruce Nesmith commented on the franchise, which was launched last year, highlighting how it has the chance to reach the same heights as The Elder Scrolls series over time. When the studio built Skyrim, they had the "tremendous advantage" of Oblivion, which, in turn, had the advantage of Morrowind. All the team had to do was continue to improve the formula and add new stuff, an advantage that Starfield did not have. For this reason, Bruce Nesmith is really looking forward to the second entry in the series, which he feels will be one hell of a game because it is going to address a lot of the things the original game is close to getting right. The sequel will be able to take everything that is in the original game, put new stuff in it, and address its issues. In a lot of ways, Starfield may end up becoming the next Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed, two series that had some troubled beginnings but then went on to become some of the most appreciated gaming series ever with multiple sequels.</p>
<p>It is indisputable that Starfield needs something more to become a memorable series like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout. Too many issues prevent the first game from reaching its full potential, and these issues have only become more evident over time, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review of the Shattered Space expansion.</a></p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has released a new&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update by the name of Crimson Eye, and as well as getting the game ready for its long-awaited console release, it's also bringing some pretty big changes.</p>

<p>After being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween">times</a>, a&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console release was confirmed for 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike">back in July</a>, and earlier this month, Kinetic revealed that the multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game would finally be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on October 29th, which is, well,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/KineticGamesDev/status/1847186876119027991" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tomorrow</a>.</p>

<p>Ahead of that release, the Crimson Eye update has been deployed, and it's introducing a new Halloween weather type by the name of the Blood Moon, which makes ghosts stronger but brings brand new rewards with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update-darkness.jpg?itok=Yvl7esPv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update-darkness.jpg?itok=KUlPpLab 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s new Halloween event is sure to scare you, just in time for Halloween.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the Halloween Blood Moon event, you're also getting a brand new Event Board to help track in-game challenges. You can find it in the Warehouse, and it's worth spending a bit of time with it if you're a&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>regular, because some things have been moved around to accommodate it.</p>

<p>The game's physics have also been upgraded; doors should no longer push you in or out of locations, and low-FPS players won't clip through the floor anymore in Point Hope. That is...assuming they're not ghosts, of course.</p>

<p>Plenty of other changes have been incorporated as well, including sweeping optimizations that result in "higher performance and more consistent frame rates", among other things. You can check out the full Crimson Eye <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-crimson-eye" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes here</a> if you wish.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting horror game in which you and your fellow hunters must venture into haunted locations to document the spirits that haunt them.</p>

<p>You're armed with an arsenal of ghost-hunting equipment to help you do so, and that equipment can be upgraded. There are a range of spooky creatures and locations to discover, so if you're looking for the perfect Halloween treat to play with your friends,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>might well be it.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005673" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> tomorrow.</p>

<p>Back in August, Nintendo revealed that&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shutting-down-in-november">would be taken offline</a>, but the gaming giant also announced that an offline version of the game would be made available sometime following the shutdown.</p>

<p>That online version is arriving on December 2nd, it turns out, and it'll cost you $20, although that cost is being reduced to $10 for the first two months or so of the game's release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-version-campsite.jpg?itok=XMT9xfZV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-version-campsite.jpg?itok=s28gl1Am 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is going offline soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Dubbed&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em>, the offline version will essentially allow you to play&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>in its entirety without the need for an online connection.</p>

<p>The new version won't have any in-app microtransactions, either, and if you've already been playing&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp</em>, you'll be able to "retain access to a majority of the items and events" in the original online version of the game.</p>

<p>New features will also be added, including QR-based Camper Cards, which you can use to scan your friends and add them to your card list. Once they're on there, you might see them show up in the all-new Whistle Pass area, where you can also enjoy a daily concert by none other than legendary musician K.K. Slider.</p>




<p>Since the original&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is online, there will, of course, be a number of features you won't be able to use anymore when the offline version arrives.</p>

<p>You can't play alongside your friends online anymore; the versions of them you see in Whistle Pass will be offline avatars rather than the players themselves. Leaf Tickets and the Pocket Camp Club subscription service also won't be available, and Leaf Tickets won't be transferred over to the new version either.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/quiet-place-road-ahead-review-say-less-do-more</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review-say-less-do-more.1020897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/quiet-place-road-ahead-review-say-less-do-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who said movie tie-in games were dead, eh? Sure, they tend to not come out at the same time as the movies anymore, and their longstanding legacy as mere “shovelware” may undermine whatever qualities they have, but the keyword here is “vigor”. Intent is never detached from passion, and inspiration forms in so many different ways, which is what <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> aims to prove.</p>

<p>This is the latest title from Italian developers Stormind Games; a new story set within the <em>Quiet Place</em> universe, and fresh off the heels of the warm reception of the most recent film, <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>. This isn’t Stormind’s first foray into the horror genre either, as they were responsible for the rather underseen <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/remothered-broken-porcelain">Remothered</a> </em>games that came out in 2018, and 2020, respectively. If anything else, <em>The Road Ahead</em> is looking promising.</p>

<p>You play as Alex, a young lass who is hiding from the nearly-invulnerable “Death Angels”, along with her father Kenneth, her partner Martin, and Martin’s mother Laura. Taking place 4 months after the aliens crashed down on Earth and ravaged the planet, Alex finds out she’s pregnant with Martin’s child, the aftermath of which causes a fissure between the 4, driven deeper when Martin sacrifices himself to save her from a Death Angel attack.</p>



<p>It seems like a pretty heavy plot, right? There’s a lot of human tension on display, not unlike the themes present in the films. With that said, I have to get into the story – not just because of its similarity to the plot of the first film – but because of its rather asinine explanations for conflict. There seems to be dropping off points for logic as characters hedge all their bets on Alex being the supreme negative force in their post-apocalyptic shambles of a life.</p>

<p>There are a lot of pieces put in place before and during the game’s chain of events that are explained so briefly, and without a tertiary mention until it’s brought to court. Halfway through the game, Laura goes into a tirade about Alex being a disaster case that’s never really set up, or proven true as time goes on. Hell, the game seems to promise human raiders at several points which never comes to fruition either.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay, it’s a throwback type of horror situation: A first-person game of hide and seek with the Death Angels, similar to your <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outlast-2"><em>Outlast</em></a>’s or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/observer"><em>Observer</em></a>’s in that there’s no way to really fight back against your foe. You are practically a walking conduit of noise at all times, which <em>The Road Ahead</em> executes with an immense variety. Flares, wind-up flashlights, puddles of water, autumn leaves, tin cans, barrels, doors that have not been lubricated once since they were put into place, latches, and so on and so forth.</p>



<p>It’s certainly worth commending the number of ways <em>The Road Ahead</em> wants you to think about soundplay, even if it is to the point of completely arbitrary nonsense. The level design suffers as you can see the clear path of intent with each new area, where Death Angels can focus on sound traps, although as time goes on, that becomes an issue for the Death Angels too. When they’re forced into a playground to be a constant threat, there’s a good chance that their monstrous hit boxes will create sound by themselves, spooking them constantly.</p>

<p>The crowning jewel is the microphone gimmick, inspired by the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/alien-not-aliens-why-isolation-right-move"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a> mechanic, and working exactly the same. If you have a microphone plugged into your controller or PC, then any noise made will be picked up by the game, and will be a direct source of noise for the Death Angel to grab. In execution, it plays out exactly how you’d expect – that is to say, a reminder of how little <em>The Road Ahead</em> trusts you with it.</p>

<p>In <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, the Xenomorph wasn’t stupid, but they were still bound by the game's rules and structure. You had time to escape if you accidentally just belched into the microphone after necking the last bit of your rum and coke. In <em>The Road Ahead</em>, any large amount of noise is immediately met with a game over, and I’m not talking about the Death Angel merely spawning in – the game will wrestle control from you and force a death, regardless of where you stand.</p>



<p>This is another one of those double-edged sword situations, where unless the game explicitly states it, safety isn’t guaranteed; a noble cause that reminds players of the hopeless situation. At the same time, however, <em>The Road Ahead</em> doesn’t trust the player with a single inclination that isn’t explicitly set up by the game itself. Constant tutorials regarding mechanics, text logs everywhere which reinforce said tutorials, before AND after it’s been stated.</p>

<p>Throughout your average 5-hour long playthrough, you will be bombarded with these gameplay-interrupting tutorials – right until the very end of the game – a total of 51 times, which is frankly insane. Whenever you perform a contextual button press, camera control will be wrestled from you. Whenever you enter a new area, chances are you’ll be forced to look at the scary thing. There’s an objectivity presented as fact which I personally cannot stand, and I’m not scared, just annoyed.</p>

<p>There’s one other unique mechanic <em>The Road Ahead</em> possesses, and that’s inhalers. Early on, it’s revealed that Alex is an asthmatic, and regularly needs one-time-use inhalers so as not to trigger an asthma attack which can point Death Angels in her direction. If one does happen, then I <em>think </em>you have to pull off a brazen QTE, and I use the word “think” because, despite two playthroughs, I couldn’t get one to trigger once through natural gameplay.</p>



<p>It’s such an overwhelming experience to sit through, and I don’t use that word lightly. Constant demand to vary the gameplay up, none of it ultimately providing the same solution as simply crouch walking. It even breaks the universe’s own rules at a certain point, with no other explanation than to justify a truly pathetic emotional climax that it doesn’t earn, which I feel sums up the entire experience perfectly.</p>

<h2><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>The Road Ahead</em> feels like it demands to be a fearful experience, to be a heart-wrenching story to listen to, and rarely will it put the work in to prove that. It’s a slog to sit through even at 5 hours long, it’s a haunted house ride that provides a teleprompter when it wants you to be scared, and it refuses to let you see the game with your own eyes.</p>

<p>Not unless there’s a tutorial on how to open them, at least.</p>
