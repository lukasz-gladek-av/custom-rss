            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Trainers around the world will be returning to Lumiose City tomorrow as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> DLC drops on 10th December. But there's plenty more to look forward to than just new Megas — some major returning Mega Evolutions have also been confirmed, including a headlining trio.</p>
<p>Earlier today, alongside the announcement of a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-legends-z-a-mystery-gift-code-list">Mystery Gift 'mon</a>, The Pokémon Company revealed that Sceptile, Blaziken, and Swampert will be getting their Mega Stones very soon.</p>
<p>However, similar to the Kalos trio's stones, the Sceptilite, Blazikenite, and Swampertite Stones will only be available via the Z-A Battle Club's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-battles-all-seasons-and-rewards">Ranked Battles</a>. Which means you need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to get them.</p>
<figure data-uuid="464a0329e0ab6"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/464a0329e0ab6/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>These three stones will be available ink ranked season 5 (Sceptilite), season 6 (Swampertite), and season 7 (Blazikenite) and you don't need the DLC to get the stones. You will, however, apparently encounter these Pokémon <em>in</em> Mega Dimension.</p>
<p>The date for the new seasons hasn't been confirmed yet, but we'll let you know when, as we're sure you'll want this excellent trio of Megas on your team.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something a little more immediate, then you'll notice that most of the trailer up top focuses on Alpha Charizard, which you can get via a new Mystery Gift code. It'll make a very spicy Mega Charizard X or Y, we reckon.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Are you excited for the Mega Dimension DLC tomorrow? Will you be getting these three Mega Stones? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

Today, the development team has provided a new look at some of the game's standout features ahead of the launch of the Alpha version later this month.</p>



<p>Today's new screenshots, which can be found below, provide a new look at the party members, the detailed environments, combat sequences, and the first look at the mind map powering the detective gameplay, which I found to be among the most interesting additions to the experience when I had the chance of seeing the game in action during this year's Gamescom.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the new batch of Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy precedes the launch of the game's Alpha version, which will debut on December 16 on Steam. This early version of the game allows players to test out some of the game's features, including the tactical turn-based combat system and the investigative features that suit the Inquisitor protagonist well, while helping Owlcat with the game's development.</p>



<p>Although it may not look that much different from its predecessor at a glance, Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy packs a lot of improvements and new features that will set the two games apart. Combat, in particular, has been significantly enhanced, with an overhaul of the cover system and a new targeting system that opens up numerous tactical options. You can learn more about them by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-gamescom-preview-inquisitors-are-always-right/"><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy hands-on preview.</strong></a></p>

            <p>Look lively, me hearties. There, cast your eyes starboard. Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced PEGI rating ahoy. The fair winds have seemed to be blowing our sails towards Ubisoft's long-rumoured remake or remaster of the fourth mainline Assassin's Creed, the one that's all piratey, for years at this point. At last, it seems, we may be on track to slide our hull into its port.</p>
<p>Our compasses have endured much flitting between different directions, buffetted by the rogue gusts of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease">voice actors saying a thing</a> and many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">reports also saying things</a>. The seasick landlubbers among us may indeed finally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">breathe their sigh of relief very soon</a> after all, it would seem.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That said, if you're hoping this <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced">freshly unearthed listing</a> on the Pan European Game Information ratings board's website is awash with details about Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced, you're going to be disappointed. Spotted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">YouTuber Corkben</a>, the listing's naught but a name, an indication that you'll have to be 18 to play this Ubisoft-developed game, and a selection of reasons that rating's been applied.
</p>
<p>Violence, bad language, and the most piratey of all infractions: in-game purchases. Some combination of the same trio adorns <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=assassin%27s+creed&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-bz8nbznbz_F9jMJ_MJXFYGrsaKZAZWOHaA9gS6afh1Y&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">the listings</a> of all the other Assassin's Creed entries, though those have some additional blurb about platforms and release dates that the Black Flag Resynced rating is currently missing. The timing might suggest a a formal announcement at this Thursday's Geoff Awards, something that'd seem to mesh with recent reporting alleging a release early next year.</p><div>

<p>This year's seen plenty of Black Flag remake chatter, regardless of Ubisoft continuing to remain tight lipped on the subject, as they have since such a project was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">first reported to be in the works</a>. Back in September, French publication Jeux Vidéo Magazine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-will-release-early-2026-and-swaps-modern-day-sections-for-more-piracy-claims-report">claimed</a> that Ubisoft Singapore, Ubisoft Bordeaux and Ubisoft Belgrade are involved in putting together the remake. The magazine also asserted that this Black Flag revamp will ditch with the original's modern-day Abstergo office-wandering segments for some cut content featuring Mary Read. The likes of inventory and combat mechanics have reportedly been tweaked to more closely mirror recent entries Shadows and Valhalla.</p>
<p>So, hoist the main sail! We're headed for remake-laden land at last. Or just an island covered in fools' gold.</p>

<p>It’s 2025, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is about to be released for what feels like the millionth time. Skyrim is available on just about every platform in the world at this point, even the Amazon Echo to an extent, but now you can add another format to the list.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Exclusive: CD Projekt-Backed Cyberpunk TCG Revealed, Featuring Characters From 2077 and Edgerunners — Here's Everything You Need to Know]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-tcg-revealed</link>
            <guid>1377277</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The brainchild of Mike Pondsmith back in 1988 as a TTRPG, Cyberpunk as a property has exploded in the past decade, thanks in no small part to CD Projekt Red and 2020's release of their first-person RPG, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Now, five years and expansions, patches, and board games later, the world of Cyberpunk is trying its robotic hands in a brand new – and highly competitive – market with a fully fledged, and collectible, <strong>Cyberpunk: Trading Card Game</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has had the opportunity to speak with the teams at WeirdCo and CD Projekt Red, who are working on the newly announced TCG, to get a better understanding of the designers at WeirdCo, how this partnership came to be, and even some goodies about the game itself. We've also got an <strong>exclusive first look</strong> at key card art from the Cyberpunk TCG <strong>(flip through the gallery below)</strong>, featuring Cyberpunk 2077's Saburo and Yorinobu Arasaka, and their handy bodyguard, Goro Takemura. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WeirdCo, a new face in the world of TCGs, has been working in close partnership with CDPR themselves to devise this new card game, aiming to capture the tone and aesthetic of 2077 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cyberpunk-edgerunners">Edgerunners' Netflix anime</a>, to deliver a game that doesn't just feel like another TCG just with a coat of Cyberpunk yellow overtop. One way the team is doing this is by working with high-profile artists, both internal to CDPR and the wider community, to deliver gorgeous card art featuring faces that will be familiar to anyone worth their wait in Chrome. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking with Elliot Cook (WeirdCo President) and Luohan Wei (WeirdCo CEO), both co-founders of the business, I wanted to know how this new studio came about. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliot began, "WeirdCo was formed when Luohan and I met each other through our mutual mentor, Bill Mooney: a true legend in the digital gaming space. We immediately hit it off over our passion for building games that truly connect with their communities. Later, we formed WeirdCo to create games together — ones that authentically bring together and inspire people." </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Players can look forward to collecting an array of unique variants of characters including V, Johnny, Panam, Judy, Adam Smasher, and more."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"CD Projekt Red has a similar goal, and when we saw this in each other we knew it would be a great partnership. What has been paramount, and the question we ask ourselves daily, is “how do we make a game that represents and celebrates every part of Cyberpunk — everywhere it has been and everywhere it is going?" That is the north star of our development."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Cyberpunk being one of the biggest media properties right now, I was curious how a brand new group could tackle such a monster IP, but despite it being a new team, the group working on the Cyberpunk TCG has worked on other large IP card games you probably have heard of. "We at WeirdCo have direct experience working on some great card games" Elliot explains. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Marvel Snap, Duel Masters, and Universus, to name a few. At our core we are disruptors, just like CD Projekt Red, and we both strive to inspire our players. We saw this in each other from the beginning, and I think CD Projekt Red saw our love for the Cyberpunk 2077 universe too. This is an IP that deserves to be explored in different and exciting ways, and we’re committed to doing this authentically with Cyberpunk TCG, side by side with the community."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of CD Projekt Red, they have been a constant ally during the game’s design and development. Elliot provides further details, "We have worked with CD Projekt Red very closely since the beginning of development. They have been the ideal partner; you may even see the same amazing artists who worked on Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and more as featured artists in Cyberpunk TCG! Every part of the TCG has the impeccable RED touch, ensuring this is a completely authentic Cyberpunk experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Cyberpunk TCG won’t be CDPR’s first collaboration in the tabletop space, with other titles like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-board-game-review"><u>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City</u></a> and <a href="https://review/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone Board Game</u></a>, but I was curious what unique joys or challenges came from working on a TCG, so I asked Patrick Mills, CDPR’s Franchise Content Strategy Lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every collaboration is unique, and we’re lucky to work with many partners who are passionate and extremely dedicated to their crafts. While making a physical TCG is something completely new for us, we see the genuine excitement, enthusiasm, and talent in WeirdCo that act as the foundation of any successful collaboration." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Their passion for the franchise has been evident at every stage, and they’re doing an incredible job developing an engaging TCG that ensures an authentic Cyberpunk experience. On the flip side, many of us at CD Projekt Red are huge TCG enthusiasts too — so we’re thrilled to be entering this space with WeirdCo"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that is clear is that both teams at WeirdCo and CDPR are taking care to ensure that this is faithful to the Cyberpunk property that its creator, Mike Pondsmith, imagined back in 1988. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"For the initial release, our primary goal is to represent the core identity of Cyberpunk 2077"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want Cyberpunk TCG to be authentic to the spirit and dynamic nature of the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, and wanted to create a TCG that is accessible to Cyberpunk fans who have never touched a card game.” Luohan says, “At the same time, as TCG players ourselves, we wanted our game to have the depth necessary to entertain for a long, long time. And I think we have struck that balance well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliot continues, "The best part of this job is spending hundreds of hours with the Cyberpunk universe — whether that’s replaying Cyberpunk 2077, watching Edgerunners for the fifth time, or reading all the Dark Horse comics. Every one of us at WeirdCo loves the Cyberpunk universe, and we built the TCG bit by bit on this foundation. At each step we analyzed every little detail, constantly asking ourselves: "How do we make this more authentic to Cyberpunk?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fan favorite characters will be making an appearance as well in this TCG and picking who would be included in this first set was a big decision. "For the initial release, our primary goal is to represent the core identity of Cyberpunk 2077 by featuring many of its most iconic and beloved characters,” explains Patrick. “We’ve collaborated closely with WeirdCo to ensure that the artwork and flavor of every card faithfully captures the essence of who they represent, providing a snapshot of their personalities and what they stand for, as well as including memorable moments players will instantly recognize. Given the complexity of our characters, we wanted to capture their many facets across multiple cards. So, players can look forward to collecting an array of unique variants of characters including V, Johnny, Panam, Judy, Adam Smasher, and more."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the WeirdCo side, Elliot shares, "We worked very hard to figure out which Legends make the most sense for players, and which ones make the most sense for the overall theme of Set 1. While some of them, like V and Johnny, are obvious hits, we have a few surprises up our sleeves too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Being a game composed of a ton of cards, artwork is pretty important in a TCG and WeirdCo is special care to make sure that what players can expect is nothing short of beautiful. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve been working for a long time with a team of over 20 talented artists for Set 1, and are excited to explore new ways of bringing the world of Cyberpunk to life through our card art. Working with artists like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itoscaresme/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ito</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vincenzo_riccardi_vinartwork/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincenzo Riccardi</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jsraphael_/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Raphael</a>, who each bring their own unique flair to the project, makes each card more exciting than the last," Elliot continues, "We’re not sharing gameplay details yet, so there’s not too much I can say. But Cyberpunk is known for its beautiful yet tragic atmosphere — this is a major focus of ours when it comes to the card art."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Details on how Cyberpunk TCG will work remain shrouded behind CDPR's and WeirdCo's firewalls, so we have a bit yet before we have an in-depth picture of how it plays. Cyberpunk's TCG will be launching its crowdfunding campaign in 2026, which is right around the corner. WeirdCo and CDPR will be revealing more of the game soon, along with a deep dive into how the game plays, more artwork, and card reveals, with some more special reveals found only here on IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The TCG space is pretty crowded with new contenders entering the ring, it seems like every quarter or so, but few have the name recognition behind them like WeirdCo has with Cyberpunk. The fact that this project has so much support from CD Projekt Red behind it puts it in a different league from others, even before it's out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The excitement from the designers is electric, with Luohan leaving players with this, “I can’t wait for players to see how we’ve adapted the themes of Cyberpunk, like taking on gigs or building a crew, to a trading card game format. I think it is both true to Cyberpunk itself while being innovative to the TCG market as a whole; it’s a perfect combination in this way.” As far as I know, no other TCG lets you play with Keanu Reeves, so that is already a big plus in its favor. Wake up, Samurai, there's a whole new way to burn the city coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this sounds up your alley, follow the game and get yourself a special and exclusive Lucy "Nova Rare" card free by signing up over on the game's <a href="https://www.launchoracle.com/weird-co/cyberpunk-trading-card-game/MF7J3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Launch Oracle page</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1012459"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via POFUPOFU STUDIOS:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Seina: A Tale of Spirits</em> is a cozy, hand-painted adventure inspired by Japanese nature, folklore, and traditional values. Players explore a watercolor world filled with peaceful forests, ancient shrines, and friendly spirits, discovering a gentle narrative through non-verbal storytelling, expressions, and atmospheric details. Designed for relaxation and reflection, the game invites players to wander at their own pace, uncovering small secrets and quiet moments of beauty.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Players follow Mika, a young girl searching for her missing cat who accidentally wanders into a serene spirit realm. This world reflects memories held by nature itself, shrines forgotten by time, paths shaped by ancient folklore and gentle spirits who guide or observe her journey.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As Mika explores deeper, she uncovers small stories hidden in the world: places where past and present quietly overlap, revealing themes of companionship, kindness, and respect for nature. Instead of confronting danger, Mika connects with the environment and its spirits, learning how everything in this world is intertwined. The narrative unfolds softly through discovery, offering an emotional journey built on subtle details and moments of tranquility.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1012467"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Seina: A Tale of Spirits</em> focuses on peaceful exploration and intimate discoveries. Players wander through hand-painted locations, interact with friendly animal spirits, and solve light, accessible puzzles. Storytelling happens through gestures, environmental clues, and visual expression rather than dialogue or traditional cutscenes.</p><p>Each area encourages players to slow down, observe, and explore at their own rhythm. The world reacts gently to Mika’s presence—spirits respond with curiosity, shrines reveal fragments of memory, and small secrets emerge for those who take the time to look.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hand-Painted Watercolor World</strong> – Explore environments created in soft watercolor tones, inspired by Japanese nature and folklore.</li><li><strong>Cozy, Stress-Free Exploration</strong> – No combat, timers, or pressure. Just peaceful wandering and simple discoveries.</li><li><strong>Friendly Animal Spirits</strong> – Meet glowing, charming spirits with unique personalities that enrich the journey.</li><li><strong>Light, Accessible Puzzles</strong> – Designed for all ages, adding gentle interaction without disrupting the game’s calm atmosphere.</li><li><strong>Non-Verbal Storytelling</strong> – The narrative unfolds through expressions, gestures, and atmospheric details rather than dialogue or text-heavy scenes.</li><li><strong>Heartfelt Inspiration</strong> – A personal journey crafted by a solo woman developer, shaped by real experiences traveling through Japan.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p>Evidence of a remake or remaster of the fan-favorite Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is solidifying, with a listing from European content-rating board PEGI emerging.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PEGI listing</a>, the re-release of the Ubisoft classic is titled Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced, and it unsurprisingly has an 18 adults-only rating for violence, language, and in-game purchases. Ratings are generally a sign that a title's release is imminent.</p><p>"Resynced" is an amusing subtitle for a re-release, most likely referring to the in-universe Animus virtual reality machine that lets the player character experience historical events through an avatar, "syncing" them with memories of someone else from that time period. If you really want to make a stretch, "Resynced" could be a nautical pun.</p><p>The existence of this Black Flag revisit has been an open secret in the industry for years, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-coming/1100-6515623/" data-ref-id="1100-6515623">leaks dating back to 2023</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-voice-actor-hints-at-a-potential-black-flag-remake/1100-6532817/" data-ref-id="1100-6532817">voice actors hinting</a> about the project. Per reports as recent as this November, the Black Flag remake <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-may-reportedly-launch-sooner-than-you-think/1100-6536439/" data-ref-id="1100-6536439">may launch on the week of March 23, 2026</a>.</p><p>Still unclear is if Black Flag Resynced is a straight remaster, similar to the treatment the Ezio trilogy and Assassin's Creed III received (with the latter simply titled "Assassin's Creed III Remastered"). "Resynced" could imply new or changed content for Black Flag--it's already been reported that this re-release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">won't feature any modern-day sections</a>, which would be a major change from the original game.</p><p>Should Black Flag Resynced surface in early 2026, it will be a nice drop for Assassin's Creed fans, who recently learned that the latest title in the franchise, Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-second-dlc-expansion/1100-6536570/" data-ref-id="1100-6536570">won't get a second major DLC</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ec1d4fb898d23"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ec1d4fb898d23/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p>Somehow, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-skyrim-anniversary-edition-lands-on-switch-2-today">Skyrim returned</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, the rumours are true, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> is back (again), as a free Switch 2 upgrade. Making the most of the hardware's updated specs, the new release bundles in a whole host of fancy features, like enhanced performance and resolution, better load times, and Mouse Mode, <em>and</em> it gives us yet another chance to replay the iconic 2011 RPG in all of its <em>fus ro dah</em>-ing glory.</p>
<p>Keen to learn more about this new release, we were recently lucky enough to sit down with Bethesda Creative Director <strong>Matt Carofano</strong> (who was Lead Artist on the original game) to talk all things Skyrim. We chatted about Matt's favourite Skyrim moments, the game's mind-blowing Switch 1 reveal, the re-release process, and, of course, the team's plans for the future.</p>
<p>We began, however, right back at the start of his Skyrim journey. So, don your fanciest armour set, grab a tankard of Velvet LeChance, and prepare for a walk down memory lane.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Jim Norman): Let's start back at the beginning. What's your earliest memory of working on Skyrim?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt Carofano (Creative Director):</strong> I remember Todd Howard and I were talking about where we should set this, and we both naturally coalesced around the realm of Skyrim — 'Let's go to that province, it'll be great!'</p>
<p>A lot of that was a reaction to the previous games we had done. The theme of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/elder_scrolls_iii_morrowind">Morrowind</a> was 'stranger in a strange land,' so very weird, alien, and unusual, with high-fantasy elements. For <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion">Oblivion</a>, we wanted to do more of a traditional European fantasy game. So there was a tonal shift between those games. When we got to Skyrim, we wanted to take a little bit of the strangeness, deeper culture, and more interesting things, but not too alien as we did in Morrowind. The home of the Nords, Skyrim, fit that really well, so we were excited about that province and wanted to work there.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest things I did were making the map and planning out what the world was. So I was looking for references around the world — the <em>real</em> world — of dramatic places that we could put together into a game. For us, the world is the main character and the foundation of the game. It's also inspirational for the team. So if you have this backdrop of frozen lands, a beautiful tundra, this forest in the south, the canyon off to the west, it's inspirational for the designers to write stories. Otherwise, you come at a game, and it's sort of a blank canvas; it's a bit like, 'Oh, what do we do? Who are the people who survive here?' It informs the characters and the quests. So for us, making the world is the first step in pretty much every game we do.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4bedc6ba68f76"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4bedc6ba68f76/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>At what point did you know that you were onto a winner?</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to explain, because I was a fan of the Elder Scrolls before I started working here, and when I was working on Morrowind, I was like, 'This is the greatest thing ever!' I'm obsessive about the games we make, so are the people here. It's always on your mind; you're always thinking, 'What can I add to the game? How can I make it better?' I don't know if that's healthy or not, but that's just the way it works!</p>
<p>We knew Skyrim was something special throughout the development cycle, but really that last period where it all started coming together, and we were playing it and play testing, and you see all the systems layer together, and it's working as a game, I knew we had something good. The team felt it.</p>
<p>Did we know it was going to become what Skyrim became? No, absolutely not. I think it's still a shock to everyone here that Skyrim has been such a popular game, that we have such amazing fans who have played it for over a decade. That's pretty incredible. So none of us take that for granted, and we're really honoured and privileged to have this franchise that people love so much.</p>
<p><strong>You can see Skyrim in a lot of different games and properties that have come out since. What is it about this game that makes it so appealing?</strong></p>
<p>Our motto is, "let you be who you want and play how you want." You can make incredibly varied characters in this game — how they look, their race, all that, but also how they play, the skills you want to get into. So we're very freeing and open-ended.</p>
<p>Additionally, you take that kind of character, and you put them in the world and say, 'We're not going to railroad you to the main story. In fact, we encourage you to ignore it and do whatever you want.' So we write stories that we're really excited about. We think they're good, and we want people to play them, but the true story of the game is what the player does. It might be, 'I made my character and just wandered off in this direction, got into trouble, and it was really fun.' That was different from a lot of other games in the industry.</p>
<p>So there's something exciting about the freedom we allow to go anywhere, play how you want, and tell your own story in this world we made. It's really the ultimate kind of sandbox role-playing game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5ffb9ecf629f7"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5ffb9ecf629f7/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I have a very distinct memory of accidentally using a spell in a town and turning the entire place against me. Do you have one of those defining Skyrim memories from your first time playing through it?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but I'll add on to yours. We made NPCs overreact to what you did. Everyone attacks the chicken in Riverwood, which is the very first town you come to, and then you're wanted. Like there's no getting around it. We talk about that moment a lot, because it's fun and funny, but it just presented itself because we made it a crime to attack the chicken, and the chicken is in the same faction as the town, so the people of the town will defend the chicken. It was initially unintentional and became a bit funny, but it might be a bit punitive. So we discussed how much we wanted to let you get away with playing around in the world without getting into too much trouble, and how quickly we can reset things.</p>
<p>For me, it's the surprise of going somewhere, and the systems of the game overlapping and something unexpected happening. Whether it's a giant is hurting something, then monsters attack, and then a dragon shows up, and you're like, 'This is not what we planned for,' but it turns out to be really fun.</p>
<p><strong>What's the re-release process like for you? How do you approach returning to a game again after working on it for over a decade now?</strong></p>
<p>It's really easy. We're huge fans of Nintendo, love working with them and getting our games to their consoles. And because there's a new console, it's 'Hey, let's bring back one of our most beloved games to the Switch 2 and see how we can improve it and make it the best experience for that console'. Some old fans will keep playing and want to play that version, and then there's a whole new generation who might be getting a Switch 2 for the first time, and that's the first time they've ever played Skyrim. So that's really it.</p>
<p>It's a bit of a joke at this point how often we release Skyrim, but it's a great game. We want everyone to be able to play it in the best way possible.</p>
<p><strong>What was the process like of developing it for the Switch 2? How does it match up against consoles you developed for in the past?</strong></p>
<p>We had previously done the version for the Switch, so this was going back to that and making improvements on it. So it was really an easy development process and actually pretty quick in terms of our timelines. Making the game takes years and years and years, but bringing it to this new console was a much, much faster process.</p>
<p>A lot of it was really just focusing on taking advantage of the new hardware. We can use DLSS now and get better resolution, better performance, and the game loads faster. Switch 2 has the Joy-Con 2 controllers that let you use mouse controls, so we added that. A lot of it is really just, 'How do we take advantage of the Switch 2? What can it do? And [how can we] give players the best version of Skyrim for that console?'</p>
<figure data-uuid="81bcc234f9b41"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/81bcc234f9b41/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What feature are you most pleased to see implemented this time?</strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of things. Overall, it's just general performance. The game performs better, runs smoother, and loads faster. So it's just a better play experience on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Several years after we released Skyrim, we did a remastering process. We spent over a year on that project — I worked on that quite a bit — and we improved the lighting, graphics features, and things like that. That came to the Switch version, but there are some subtleties we can turn up and make better [on Switch 2], particularly the volumetric lighting is nicer on Switch 2. That's something I was personally very excited about, having tweaked all the numbers for the different weathers, fog, and clouds for months and months and months. Getting the best version of that on the Switch 2 is really important to me.</p>
<p><strong>Seeing Skyrim on Switch 1 was such a monumental part of that console's early life. What was it like working with Nintendo on that version?</strong></p>
<p>It was exciting to put one of our modern games on a Nintendo console, and the Switch was super exciting to everybody when it came out. I'm a big Nintendo fan. I have the Switch, I have the Switch 2. I played a lot at home with my family. But seeing it on a portable device was just really cool. And the thought of being able to sit on your couch or go anywhere with this and play a full, deep game like Skyrim that lasts for hundreds of hours was really awesome.</p>
<p>Then it was the fun stuff of getting the sword swing to work with the Joy-Con, or one of our artists here, Christiane Meister, made Zelda assets that we put on that version. As a fan of Zelda, having a Nintendo as a kid, and playing the original Zelda, and then, in a roundabout way, getting some Zelda in a game that I made was really cool.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any other Nintendo franchises that ever crossed your mind as a Skyrim crossover?</strong></p>
<p>It was always Zelda. A fun fact: the [former] voice of Mario [Charles Martinet] is Paarthurnax in Skyrim. So that was pretty cool too. But no, because Zelda is one of the first open-world RPGs, it was pretty awesome to have that connection there.</p>
<p><strong>Skyrim has defined over a decade of your working life now. What other games have really stood out to you in that time and inspired your work?</strong></p>
<p>The one that immediately jumps to my mind is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. It took me a little while to get, but once it hooks you, I felt like I was an outlaw at the end of the Wild West, and the experience of living in that world. It's truly a masterpiece of a game.</p>
<p>I love the subtle moments in gaming where you're just riding your horse, appreciating the view, and then some birds fly by. It's things that we love putting into our games to make you feel like you are truly living another life in another world. A lot of games are focused on action and combat. But when you can take a moment and breathe and really experience something else, I think that's some of the best that gaming has to offer. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an amazing, amazing game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c8daae20ee960"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8daae20ee960/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>With Skyrim now making the jump, are there any other Bethesda games that we will see come to Switch 2 in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we did just announce that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> is coming to Switch 2, so that's really exciting. That's coming next year. Past that, nothing else to say! Whether we can do another game or not, I don't know. But it's cool to see. We've come back to Skyrim, and now a Fallout game is going to make that jump, too. We're really excited about that.</p>
<p><strong>As a gamer, what do you make of the Switch 2 so far?</strong></p>
<p>I have a different perspective on Skyrim because I've probably played it more than almost anyone on Earth. I tested and played it for years while we were making it, and then I come back to it every so often when we're making our current games — that can be a Fallout, that can be <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield">Starfield</a>. I revisit our games and see what was special about them, what are the things we want to bring forward? Are there things we want to change or do differently? A lot of us do that here, but I take the time to go back and play our old games and see how that can inform or inspire what we're doing currently.</p>
<p>So getting a chance to play Skyrim again on the Switch 2 was like, 'What was fun about this? How did some of the game systems work here?' It's always a thought on our minds, as we're replaying old stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Are you ever able to just enjoy Skyrim, or is there always a little bit of dev brain going on?</strong></p>
<p>There's always a little bit of dev brain going on, and it even affects gaming in general. I'm currently replaying the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remaster, but in every game I've ever played, I start the game, I stop, I look at the textures, and I spend time thinking about the technology they're using. I try to turn that off and just enjoy it, but that happens in every game. There are moments, though, even playing Skyrim, where I just get lost in a dungeon, and I'm once again a stealth archer sneaking around killing everybody. It's great.</p>
<p><strong>So, stealth archer is your preferred play style?</strong></p>
<p>It is, and I will stake a claim to being an OG stealth archer because I always play that way. I enjoy the magic system, too, but yes, I played that way internally with the game before it became a meme, but that's okay. I tend to enjoy stealth games in general, so it's fun.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a0d7ce84bce65"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0d7ce84bce65/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What other assets from the game's early days do you still think hold up today?</strong></p>
<p>At the very beginning of this project, I started building Riverwood. That was our testing ground for the game systems and how the game worked and felt. Every time we started a new game internally, while we were making it, you started in Riverwood, and that was the test. So I built the farm houses there, the stone walls, and the wooden walkways. I was just setting up that location. I did a lot of world art on Skyrim, as well as the art direction. So that's what comes to mind when I think of Skyrim. We had an internal testing loop of starting at Riverwood, then going up to the first dungeon of Bleak Falls Barrow. That was our early, early loop of the game, and later it branched out to a bunch of things. We had a full team working on stuff.</p>
<p>At that point, I jumped over and worked on the College of Winterhold with our designer, Brian Chapin, who was the lead designer of the Mages Guild. So I made that tower in the interior. That was fun to work on for a while, but at that point, there's a huge team going, and I'm more managing the work than building the assets.</p>
<p><strong>It must be interesting to still see your fingerprints on those locations, after all this time.</strong></p>
<p>A little bit for sure. But also, at that point, it was more working with concept artists, art directing, having input on everybody's work, and just guiding people. That's really what it's about. My job is mostly helping everyone's ideas come to fruition in the game and making sure they all gel and work together in a good way.</p>
<p><strong>Was there any inciting inspiration that spawned those towns for you?</strong></p>
<p>It's a mix of things. As I said before, I'd start with a map, design the world, and we would lay out where the towns would go. A lot of that I was doing myself early on. Then I'd work with design on what would work for those locations.</p>
<p>If I jump back to Oblivion, we had a map made, and I drew maps and layouts of all the towns to get ready for the team to work on. Some of that just comes from liking worldbuilding and trying to think of what these things could be. It's almost like being a dungeon master from when you played <strong>D&amp;D</strong> as a kid, but in a professional setting.</p>
<p>With Skyrim, we have awesome concept artists who start painting and drawing, and then the team starts to build it. It becomes a much more collaborative effort. It starts with a few small seeds of things, some ideas, and then we're working with a big team to make it all happen.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a64318c6d508a"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a64318c6d508a/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>And are those ideas still spawning? What else would you like to do in this world in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Ha ha, trick question! There's a lot. All I can say is, yeah, we're working on new things, very, very excited about it, but unfortunately, can't talk about any of that just yet.</p>
<p>But I will say this, I described how we make games as an obsession which never turns off. It seeps into everything. You're out in the world, and you see something cool, it's like, 'Hey, this view, these trees look really amazing. Let's make a mental note, we should recreate that.' It's a weird obsession with getting into the details of life and then how you can bring that to a game and make something interesting.</p>
<p>I did a lot of photogrammetry scanning of rocks and dirt for Starfield — I mean, hundreds of pieces of rock and dirt. I did some travelling and went to Hawaii, and scanned volcanic rock and stuff. But I think it comes from a fundamental excitement of how everything can be interesting if you really pay attention to it and think about how that works, and then recreating that in a virtual world. I think it brings something to it. Everyone here becomes little dungeon masters over our worlds. You research how smithing works or how people fish in real life, so you're making these observations, condensing them, and recreating them into a fantastical setting.</p>
<p>It really just comes from a fascination with life and trying to make something that other people are going to enjoy from that.</p>
<p><strong>That is a very wholesome and somewhat poetic way of dodging the initial question! [laughs]</strong></p>
<p>Oh yes, and we may be doing that again on a future project. There's your answer, right? [laughs]</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As far as worst-kept video game industry secrets for 2025 go, the top two would arguably be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/">Leon Kennedy being in Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Ubisoft's upcoming remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>. After the former had a major leak, which practically confirmed what has long been suspected, the latter has matched it with a leak of its own, as a PEGI rating for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was spotted online.</p>



<p>Initially spotted by <a href="https://x.com/CorkbenYT/status/1998396558027440489">X (formerly Twitter) user and YouTuber CorkbenYT</a>, the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced">PEGI 18 rating on the official PEGI website is listed as from Ubisoft EMEA</a>. It appears that the "<em>Resynced</em>" subtitle is Ubisoft's play on 'remake' or 'remastered,' and could likely be the new official title for the upcoming remakes that <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot confirmed the company would be doing back in June 2024</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To be clear, while Guillemot confirmed that players can expect to see remakes of older Assassin's Creed titles from Ubisoft, no individual remake has yet been confirmed, though we've had several rumours that the remakes would start with Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. </p>



<p>Just last month, a new rumour pointed to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Black Flag remake arriving sometime in March 2026</a>, which would put it just ahead of Ubisoft's new fiscal year, and it would also mean that unless Ubisoft is looking to shadow-drop this remake, it would be announcing it fairly soon.</p>



<p>That announcement could come <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">during The Game Awards later this week</a>, or, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/">Ubisoft opted to skip 2025 with its Ubisoft Forward event</a>, we could see that event return in the beginning of 2026 with an event in January or February to announce the remake's arrival in March.</p>



<p>At this point, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/">after this year's rumours</a>, rumours <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/">from previous years</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">comments from Edward Kenway's voice actor</a>, the remake is all but confirmed to be coming. All that's left is for Ubisoft to show it off, and hopefully it does so soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bethesda Still Beating Skyrim Like A Dead Horse With Switch 2 Version]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683</link>
            <guid>1377232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The never-ending mission to port <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-2021-and-bethesda-has-announced-another-skyrim-port-1847521204"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> to every possible platform continues</a>. This time, Bethesda has announced that the popular open-world RPG is getting a Switch 2 release. And you don’t have to wait long, as this new port of <em>Skyrim</em> is available now, and is free for previous owners of the game’s Anniversary Edition on Switch.</p> <p>On December 9, Bethesda released a trailer for the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of its <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734">classic 2011 RPG, <em>Skyrim</em></a>. And yup, that sure looks like <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, a game that feels like it has always been a part of my life and which is visually aging worse than I expected.</p>

  <p>The Switch 2 version of <em>Skyrim: Anniversary Edition</em> will cost you $60. If you already own the original Switch version of <em>Skyrim Anniversary Edition</em>, you can download the Switch 2 version for free. If instead you own the older, non-<em>Anniversary Edition</em> version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch (yes, there are multiple versions of the game on most platforms now), you’ll need to pay $20 to upgrade.</p>

 <p>So what do you get in this new version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2?<a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/fGtFCgI7J9FL3l6oi9j3B/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-on-nintendo-switch-2"> Well, Bethesda claims</a> that its popular RPG loads faster and has better performance on Nintendo’s new console when compared to how it ran on the OG Switch. It also boasts enhanced resolution and DLSS anti-aliasing. And yes, it supports Switch 2 mouse controls, motion controls, and Amiibo, and features the old <em>Legend of Zelda</em> exclusive cosmetic DLC seen in the old Switch port.</p> <p>Did the world need yet another way to play <em>Skyrim</em> in 2025? Probably not. But I bet this is going to sell really well, and I can’t wait to write about Skyr<em>i</em>m being ported to the PlayStation 6 in a few years. Meanwhile, we’ll still get to play <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6…</em>eventually.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-is-clearly-taking-no-margin-on-its-nano-power-bank-as-it-returns-at-its-lowest-price-for-the-holidays-2000649289</link>
            <guid>1377229</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are officially behind us. It was a week-long celebration of discounts and offers across every category you could possibly think of. Missed grabbing something? Don’t worry. There are new deals for holidays.</p>
<p>Apple users still looking to treat themselves to a reliable power solution without the typical cable mess should consider grabbing the ultra-slim. 5,000mAh Anker Nano power bank. I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6310/">t usually retails for $55, but thanks to Amazon holiday deal, you can snap it up for just $41 right now, but only if you act fast.</a> The discount applies to all color options, so you can pick the one that complements your phone. Got an iPhone 16 in the stunning Desert Titanium? Go for the golden or the classic black version. Have an all-black model? Add some pop of color to it with the white or green power bank! Be sure to nab the deal quick, as these leftover discounts expire soon. We’re not expecting these to last more than a few more hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6310/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Attaches to Your Phone, Plus Supports Wired Charging</h2>
<p>It’s (mainly) a wireless power bank, featuring an ultra-slim design. At just 0.3 inches thin, it supports Qi2 certification and snaps at the back of your phone to deliver power on the go. Its 15W output is enough to juice your device up without waiting too long. You can expect an iPhone 16 Pro to go from 0 to 25% in just over 40 minutes. We won’t exactly label it as “ultra-fast”, but considering how it becomes a part of your phone and doesn’t make you feel like you’re carrying an extra accessory when out and about, it’s not too bad. The bulky versions offering better speeds are heavier and a bit inconvenient to carry around, so if ease of use and portability are what you’re after, it’s worth it.</p>
<p>Charging may stop automatically when your phone hits 80%, to preserve the battery and prevent overheating. Once your device cools down, the power bank gets back to work. To get you the best of both worlds, it also supports USB-C fast charging, which can get an iPhone 17 from 0 to 25% in 35 minutes. Recharging the power bank itself won’t take forever either. It’s capable of hitting 100% in just under two hours.</p>



<p>Reliability comes from graphene cooling, dual NTC chips, and smart heat control that Anker has packed it with. It says under 104°F, which is 14 degrees cooler than the industry standard for safer charging. Compatibility-wise, it plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17. It won’t work with an iPhone 16e or iPhone SE Series, though. Best of all, you can even top your AirPods using the charger; great for non-stop jamming on the road. The box comes with the power bank itself, USB-C to USB-C charging cable, welcome guide, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a reliable, fuss-free charging solution that’s super easy to carry around, this Anker Nano power bank offers all that and more. It becomes a part of your phone to provide it the power it needs, plus supports wired charging for when you want to prioritize speeds. This deal brings its price down to just $41, but it expires soon. It was a part of the Amazon’s holiday deals, the discount won’t be around for long either. Act fast before that happens!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Saros Getting ‘New Look’ at The Game Awards 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/saros-getting-new-look-at-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1377223</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has just confirmed that players will receive a new look at Saros at The Game Awards 2025 on December 11. </p>



<p>Saros is the next sci-fi shooter from the hands of Housemarque, the team responsible for bringing us games like Returnal, Nex Machina, Matterfall, and more. They provided players with a look at the title’s gameplay during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September’s State of Play event</a> and have now confirmed a new look at the title for TGA. </p>







<h2 id="h-saros-pre-order-announcement-expected-at-the-game-awards">Saros Pre-Order Announcement Expected at The Game Awards</h2>



<p>PlayStation confirmed Saros’s presence at The Game Awards 2025 through a new post on their <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1998407291754729536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post says that players will receive a “new look” for the title, but doesn’t explain what that means. We could receive a new gameplay trailer or a trailer focusing on the narrative bit as well. Some players are also speculating that pre-orders will open that day, as the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-pre-orders-expected-imminently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated in Taiwan</a> recently. </p>



<p>Saros is an entirely new IP from Housemarqye which focuses on a “haunting story of a lost off-world colony on Carcosa under an ominous eclipse.” The key difference between Saros and Returnal gameplay is the presence of permanent resources and progression, which makes every death valuable. Which means that even though the world will change after each death, players can come back stronger with the ability to choose and permanently upgrade their loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit parts.</p>







<p>In other news, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider title</a> will be revealed at The Game Awards, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> will appear at the event as well.

Where are Lloyd and Nya, the other two members of the ninja squad from the show? We don't know, but don't count out the possibility they'll be added later--especially since the trailer description teases another major Ninjago update in 2026.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619700-legopasskaioutfit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619700" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619700-legopasskaioutfit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619700"></a><figcaption>Kai from Ninjago is becoming fully human for the first time in Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619700-legopasskaioutfit.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619702-dragonenemy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619703-icesanctumscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619704-lightningtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619705-earthtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619706-legopasskaioutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619707-premiumrewards-builds.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619708-legofortniteninjago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619702,1300-4619703,1300-4619704,1300-4619705,1300-4619706,1300-4619707,1300-4619708" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619702-dragonenemy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619703-icesanctumscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619704-lightningtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619705-earthtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619706-legopasskaioutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619707-premiumrewards-builds.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619708-legofortniteninjago.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619702-dragonenemy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619703-icesanctumscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619704-lightningtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619705-earthtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619706-legopasskaioutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619707-premiumrewards-builds.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619708-legofortniteninjago.jpg"></figure><p>On the gameplay side of this week's update, Lego Fortnite Odyssey is getting a new Ninjago island this week with new weapons, like Nunchuks and Shurikens, as well as new elemental abilities that you'll need to master by questing to Elemental Sanctums around the island.

            <p>Video game workers from multiple unions across Europe have released a joint statement pledging a "united front" against industry exploitation.</p>
<p>Last month, delegates from six game worker unions met in Paris for a summit hosted by French union Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV) to discuss the challenges facing the games industry, and are now demanding better working conditions without threat of layoffs, free from AI, and free from "authoritarian mismanagement".</p>
<p>"Our jobs are under threat, we are denied a voice in our workplaces, and policies such as 'return to office' and tools like generative AI are being forced upon us, even though they degrade our working conditions," the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/blog/">joint statement reads</a>.</p>
<p>"Multinational companies already operate globally. Game workers already collaborate transnationally. It follows, then, that unions must also organise across borders."</p>
<p>The statement comes from unions in the UK (IWGB Game Workers), France (STJV), Ireland (Game Workers Unite Ireland), Germany (ver.di Game Devs Roundtable), Italy (FIOM-CGIL Milan Work Council) and Spain (Coordinadora Sindical del Videojuego). It follows joint meetings and a solidarity protest outside the Paris office of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>' parent company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">31 members were dismissed from the Grand Theft Auto maker</a>.</p><p>"From these meetings, one thing became absolutely clear: that together, workers can transform their jobs, their careers, and their lives for the better," the statement continues. "We can do something, and we will. We vow to increase cooperation between our unions in both the short and long term, and to stay united in front of all that's going on in our industry and the world."</p>
<figure>

<p>For the past few years, mass layoffs have rocked the video game industry worldwide. <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">According to one tally</a>, 10.5k employees lost their jobs in 2023, a further 14.6k lost their jobs in 2024, and so far this year an estimated 5.3k have lost their jobs. That's on top of stories such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-alleges-saboteurs-within-the-company-were-behind-its-poor-reception-according-to-new-report">reported mismanagement at MindsEye studio Build A Rocket Boy</a>, as well as widespread use of AI technology - EA CEO Andrew Wilson, for instance, stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">AI is "the very core of our business"</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a historic milestone for the video game industry," said IWGB Game Workers delegate Scott Alsworth. "For the first time, we are seeing game workers organising across borders, coordinating campaigns, and standing together in solidarity. For years, there has been a collective sense of isolation, a climate of fear - many have felt powerless and divided in the face of seemingly unstoppable conglomerates. But now, we're marshalling politics in the workplace and learning over again, in adversity, the struggles of the past. That there is indeed strength in unity."</p>
<p>The IWGB Game Workers union has been instrumental in supporting the Rockstar employees who were controversially dismissed back in October. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">union has launched a legal claim against alleged unfair dismissal</a>, which then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">made its way to UK Parliament</a>.</p>
<p>Later, a report claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">Rockstar employees were dismissed for sharing internal company messages on an employee and union-only Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Well, isn't this a surprise that <em>nobody could have seen coming</em>. Bethesda has today announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> is getting a free Switch 2 upgrade. What's more, it's available today!</p>
<p>Any Dragonborns playing on Switch 2 will get to experience the 2011 RPG at an enhanced resolution, with improved load times, performance optimisation, Mouse Mode support and more. Let's not forget that the Anniversary Edition packs in the game's three official expansions — Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire — Creations Club items, and those sweet Zelda crossover assets that we all enjoyed in the Switch 1 base game.</p>
<p>The above reveal trailer gives you a pretty good idea of what we can expect from the game on Switch 2 (<em>it's Skyrim</em>), but you can get an even better look by checking out the images below.</p>

<p>Those with the Switch 1 version of the Anniversary Edition can nab the Switch 2 upgrade for free. Otherwise, you can upgrade from the base game to the Anniversary Edition for £17.99 (or your regional equivalent) or buy the whole thing for £52.99.</p>
<p>We recently sat down with Bethesda Creative Director Matt Carofano to find out more about this new version - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-a-bit-of-a-joke-at-this-point-skyrim-dev-on-returning-for-a-switch-2-re-release">check out our interview</a>.</p>

              <p>With there being little sign of the&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771"><em>Pokémon TCG&nbsp;</em>bubble</a> bursting any time soon, and many <em>Pokémon </em> cards literally worth more than their weight in gold, it’s becoming all too normal to hear stories of thieves breaking into stores and stealing the shiny cardboard. A particularly audacious example happened in California this weekend, where around $100,000 worth of cards were stolen by a masked gang in a matter of minutes—a gang who could well be responsible for a number of other similar crimes.</p> <p>As reported by local LA station <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/burglars-ransack-burbank-card-shop-steal-100000-worth-of-rare-trading-cards/"><em>KTLA 5</em></a>&nbsp;(thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-thieves-steal-cards-worth-100000-in-latest-californian-store-heist"><em>IGN</em></a>), a group of burglars were filmed on CCTV breaking into the Burbank card shop and making off with armfuls of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards. The implication from store owner Kiet Nguyen’s description of the footage is that the team seem very experienced, getting in and out of the store in just a couple of minutes, seemingly knowing exactly what they wanted to take.</p>

 <p>“They tip over and smash a glass display case to grab its contents,” Nguyen told <em>KTLA</em>. “Moments later, they’re seen carrying three large bags filled with stolen goods to an awaiting getaway car. The vast majority, they were targeting <em>Pokémon</em> cards. They inadvertently took some lock boxes from the back that also had [rare] sports cards.”</p>

 <p><em>KTLA</em> goes on to report that the police suspect this particular gang of three could be responsible for a number of similar card shop break-ins around Southern California, not least because this particular burglary seemed so practiced.</p> <p>It’s not an exaggeration about the price of gold thing, by the way. I just looked it up; the average <em>Pokémon </em>card weighs just under two grams, and the same weight in gold is currently worth around $270. The Mega Charizard X ex SIR in <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-charizard-chase-card-2000645074">the current Phantasmal Flames set</a> is currently selling for $600, while new sealed product sells on resale markets for at least twice its MSRP. Meanwhile, a sealed booster box of 2021’s Evolving Skies currently sells for $2,350, some&nbsp;<em>eighteen</em> times the original store price.</p>

 <p>This is not only making <em>Pokémon</em> cards close to impossible for regular fans to buy or even find on sale, but also making the product increasingly high-risk for stores given the suddenly ballooning value of their stocks. Nguyen had thought his Burbank store to be well protected in a safe area, saying that he believed, with his multiple layers of security, “the deterrents were good enough.” Sadly not.</p> <p>Clearly, given the incentives and ease with which stolen sealed product and non-graded cards can be resold, breaking into a card shop is now a more lucrative crime than breaking into a jewelry store, with less protection likely to be in place, but a far easier time grabbing the equally valuable loot.</p>

            <guid>1377166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long-awaited Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake might have just gotten one step closer to being released, as the PEGI ratings board has published a new listing that talks about ‘Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced’.</p>



<p>There’s no fresh information on the listing, which says that the game will have ‘violence, bad language, and in-game purchases’, but this is deeper validation that it’s preparing to be revealed by Ubisoft after all these years.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-flag-remake-seems-to-be-called-resynced">Black Flag Remake Seems To Be Called ‘Resynced’</h2>



<p>For those not in the know about Assassin’s Creed, the game is all about ‘synchronization’. Players explore vast open maps and slowly learn the lay of the land, becoming adjusted to their ancestors’ memories and ‘synchronizing’ with events that occurred hundreds of years before.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s appropriate for the Black Flag remake to be called Resynced.</p>



<p>The listing on the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=assassin%27s+creed&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-i0li0NzwBJhdRBDPCsKjBAyuSVn5_-ycuy9Fg1XUMz0&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PEGI website</a> doesn’t give much away:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">Insider Gaming exclusive report</a> published just a few weeks ago, we confirmed that the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake is set to be released before March 31, 2026.</p>



<p>In September, it was claimed that the Black Flag remake would be ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/">more RPG-heavy</a>‘, with Ubisoft’s teams aligning the game more closely with the broader, more ambitious titles that have been released in recent years, like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Origins</li>



<li>Odyssey</li>



<li>Valhalla</li>



<li>Shadows</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this year, drama sparked when Matt Ryan, the voice of Edward Kenway in Assassin’s Creed Black Flag, revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/">he faced legal action</a> when he insinuated at a convention that the Black Flag remake was happening.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remakes-buster-sword-almost-had-a-more-realistic-version/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has revealed how Cloud’s iconic Buster Sword almost received a more realistic version. </p>



<p>The Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has revealed quite a few details about Part 3 in recent days. He revealed that the game experience is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>” and has narrowed the title down to two options. Now he has provided a small tidbit on the questions they pondered while creating the Buster Sword for FF7 Remake. </p>







<h2 id="h-buster-sword-was-just-a-regular-sword-players-wouldn-t-accept-it">Buster Sword Was Just a Regular Sword “Players Wouldn’t Accept It”</h2>



<p>During an interview with Julien Chièze on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/square-enix-director-naoki-hamaguchi-considered-giving-cloud-strife-a-more-realistic-sword-for-final-fantasy-7-remake-but-decided-jrpg-fans-wouldnt-accept-it-we-stayed-faithful-to-the-og/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s Buster Sword. For those unaware, the Buster Sword is an iconic weapon wielded by Cloud Strife, known for its massive size. The director revealed that during the development process, there were discussions about the “aspect of the weight” and how Cloud swinging an enormous sword with one hand would “weaken the sense of realism”. </p>



<p>So at the time, the development team considered creating a “more realistic version of the Buster Sword” for Cloud to wield in Final Fantasy 7’s Remake. However, they decided against it as “it was just too iconic, and if we’d made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn’t accept it.” Hamaguchi concluded, stating that “stayed faithful to the OG” in the end and “a whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call.”</p>
