                <p dir="ltr">Remasters and remakes are arguably more popular than ever--in video games and even movies--but Sega doesn't sound too keen to revisit the Sonic Adventure series. Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka was recently asked about updating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-adventure-2-review/1900-2777051/">Sonic Adventure 2</a> specifically and stated there are "no plans" for it.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/144842/takashi-iizuka-sonic-racing-crossworlds-interview-june-2025" rel="nofollow ">Shacknews</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-adventure-director-says-dont-expect-remakes-or-remasters-anytime-soon/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), Iizuka was discussing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworld-preorders-are-live-on-console-and-pc/1100-6532225/">the upcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> when the interviewer mentioned their love for Sonic Adventure 2. As such, Iizuka was asked about remaking or revisiting the 2001 game, to which the developer replied: "I am really appreciative of everyone who likes the Sonic Adventure series, but when I think about what it would take to bring that game up to the standards and expectations of what the modern gaming audience would want, I think it would be about as much time and energy as it would to make a new title."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Sonic SAVED Sega</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As such, Iizuka noted that "part of me is thinking maybe I should just make a brand new title and that’s why there's currently no plans." What's interesting here is that 2011's Sonic Generations did get a remaster as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/">Sonic X Shadows Generations</a> from last year. The game also arrived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">on Switch 2</a> earlier this month.</p><p>Up next for Sonic Team is the previously mentioned Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. It's the fourth entry in the racing subseries for the Blue Blur and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-will-feature-hatsune-miku-and-persona-5s-joker/1100-6532201/">will feature crossover characters like Persona 5's Joker</a> and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/sonic-racing-crossworlds-spongebob-squarepants-character-reveal-trailer/2300-6466144/">SpongeBob Squarepants</a>. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to launch September 25 on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. A Switch 2 version is also in the works for a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Capcom has released an update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter: Wilds</a> which has fixed a shader compilation problem on PC, causing high CPU loads and horrendous performance issues.</p>
<p>The title 2 update, which is out now, alters the game so shader compilation occurs upon the game's initial launch, rather than during gameplay. It'll take some time, but players will no longer need to manually delete shader cache files in order to improve performance. That's good!</p>
<p>These performance issues led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge">Monster Hunter Wilds receiving an overwhelmingly negative rating on Steam</a>. The game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">which suffered from performance issues from day one</a> on PC, had an increased rate of crashes and visual bugs as of an update a month ago.</p>

It has waned in recent months, though as of writing a surge of returning players have hopped back into the game with title update 2's release.

			<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition may not be too far from release on Nintendo Switch 2, as the new edition of the popular action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware has been recently rated in the United States.</p>



<p>As the game has been available for a while on other formats, the Switch 2 edition's ESRB rating, which can be found <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40550/elden-ring-tarnished-edition/">here</a>, wouldn't have been notable if the game's release date was known. However, the fact that the rating has been made public shortly before this week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namco-summer-showcase-my-hero-academia-game/">Bandai Namco showcase</a> suggests that the release date announcement and subsequent release may not be too far in the future.</p>



<p>The Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition was among the third-party games revealed during the big Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event held back in April. The new edition of the celebrated game will come with new features not found in the original release, such as two new starting classes, four new Armor sets, new weapons and skills, three Torrent customization options, and some yet-to-be-detailed quality-of-life improvements. The Tarnished Edition will also include the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a></strong>, which introduces a second map and some pretty challenging enemies.</p>



<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on Nintendo Switch 2. You can learn why the base game is one of the best action RPGs by FromSoftware by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/backyard-baseball-01-release-date-and-returning-mlb-stars-revealed.1231848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cult classic baseball game&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>is due for a re-release next week, and according to a new report, just three of the game's original 31 licensed stars will not be returning.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.sportico.com/leagues/baseball/2025/backyard-baseball-2001-game-release-date-mlb-players-list-1234858525/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sportico</a> (which cites new <em>Backyard Baseball&nbsp;</em>series owner Playground Productions), 28 of the players who appeared in the original&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball 2001</em>, including icons like Derek Jeter and Jose Canseco, will be returning for the new re-release, which is coming to Steam and mobile devices on July 8th.</p>

<p>According to Sportico, while some players were easy to track down, others were more difficult. Playground CEO&nbsp;Lindsay Barnett (that's Playground Productions, not&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fable-2025" rel="nofollow">Fable</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Playground Games) says that the studio contacted some of&nbsp;Álex González's current coaching students to track him down, for example.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backyard-baseball-01-mlb-stars-gameplay.jpg?itok=ir5tGdpD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backyard-baseball-01-mlb-stars-gameplay.jpg?itok=10HRX4PJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>will feature 28 of the original game's 31 players.</figcaption></figure><p>The three players who won't be featuring in this re-release are Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas, and Barry Bonds. As Sportico points out, Bonds hasn't appeared in an MLB-related game since <a href="https://ryanferguson.co.uk/blogs/blog/why-was-barry-bonds-not-in-video-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">backing out</a> of a group licensing agreement in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>Barnett said that working with MLB on&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>"just could not have been easier", and that the league "really love[s] this brand", referring to the&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p><em>Backyard Baseball&nbsp;</em>belongs to the wider&nbsp;<em>Backyard Sports&nbsp;</em>series, which also includes takes on sports like American football, association football (or "soccer", though the word feels hollow in my mouth as a Brit), and basketball.</p>

<p>As well as re-releasing&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01</em>&nbsp;and other games in the&nbsp;<em>Backyard&nbsp;</em>series, Playground is also currently working on a <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/backyard-sports-new-video-game-tv-film-adaptations-1236213649/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand new title</a>, although we don't know around which sport the new game will revolve yet.</p>




<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3104970/Backyard_Baseball_01/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on July 8th, so make sure to wishlist it if you're after a slice of nostalgic sports action.</p>

            <p>Capcom have a tough fight on their hands at the moment. No, Arkveld hasn't escaped from its lair to terrorise the non-OP masses. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been suffering from some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash">pretty nasty performance issues</a> on PC.</p>
<p>While they don't look to have the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> running as well as some kind of crash and stuffer-free Usain Bolt quite yet, the release of Wilds' second title update has seen the studio try to curb some shader compilation and VRAM-related problems.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alongside deploying the update, which brings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-second-title-update-is-adding-in-lagiacrus-from-monster-hunter-3-when-it-arrives-next-week">Lagiacrus and a bunch of other new stuff</a> to the game (including Fender guitars, because why not), Capcom have put out a fix aimed at stopping shader compilation while you're playing from causing "high CPU load and unstable performance".</p>
<p>Now, instead of shaders being complied once you're hunning the mons, that process'll take place at launch when there's a fresh update to apply, and you won't need to worry about trying to delete your shader cache files in order to improve the situation.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Steam hunters!</p><p>With Title Update 2's arrival, we have resolved a previous issue where shader compilation during gameplay caused high CPU load and unstable performance. </p><p>Please be aware of the following when booting up the game after installing the latest update:</p><p>⚪ Shader… <a href="https://t.co/PzXQK3NGvV">pic.twitter.com/PzXQK3NGvV</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter Status (@MHStatusUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1939617276677759340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>That's not the only thing the devs have done, with title update two's <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html">full patch notes</a> revealing some other Steam-specific tweaks designed to help reverse the game's recent review fortunes in the Valve money place.</p>
<p>First of all, you'll now have a warning pop up if you try to launch the Wilds with out of date GPU drivers, an unsupported OS, or while using compatibility mode. There's also some extra support for Nvidia and AMD upscaling and frame generation tech.</p>
<p>The big fixes in the notes, though, concern VRAM. Capcom have tweaked how much of it's used when the game's streaming textures, fixed the VRAM usage estimate in the game's settings not being accurate, and rectified that last one also affecting distant shadow quality readouts.</p>
<p>As for how much these fixes have improved things performance-wise for PC Wilds, the verdict so far looks to be a bit mixed, with some folks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1lo0yeu/title_update_2_is_good/">reporting</a> that things are generally better and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1lo0i4v/framerate_issues/">others</a> still seemingly running into crash and frame rate problems.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When your job involves writing about video games, you quickly come to realize there are way too many video games to ever keep track of. You have two options here: painstakingly trawl storefronts and lists of new releases every week in an effort that will almost certainly destroy you, or trust that the universe will put cool games in front of you when the time is right.</p><p>Here’s an example of the latter: This weekend I randomly saw a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/annacwebs.bsky.social/post/3lsr2d23wtk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Bluesky</a> about a browser game called <a href="https://computerjames.itch.io/stealth-cw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stealth Crossword</em></a>. The game appears to have come out a few months ago, and developer ComputerJames says it’s a remake of a game they made six years ago. It’s a very short game, taking me about 10 minutes. ComputerJames describes it as “the forced stealth mission in a game that really shouldn’t have one.”</p><p>The genre this stealth is forced into is a crossword puzzle. Your character turns into any letter you press on your keyboard, and you then have to slot that letter into crossword clues to spell a word. Overtop this wordplay is a stealth game about international espionage, complete with cameras to avoid, blind spots to hide in, bad guys to disguise yourself in front of, and secrets to uncover. The game has two endings, and is, in ComputerJames’ words, “100% not procedural and un-replayable.”</p><figure><figcaption>ComputerJames</figcaption></figure><p>Switching to a new letter sends you back to the start of a level, so you have to think a bit strategically about how to fill in the crossword clues, and you also have to employ the usual stealth game timing and navigating. There are a few twists on the crossword mechanics I won’t spoil, but the game never loses focus on its core idea. Neither the stealth nor crossword gameplay is too challenging, but when combined they turn into some new thing that works perfectly even though when you step back to think about it, the whole idea is weird as hell.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d absolutely play a much longer version of <em>Stealth Crossword</em> if one existed, but I also love that it’s just this small, contained thing that was put before me completely at random. Instead of letting it cause me to panic about how many other cool games I’m surely missing out on, I’m just going to be psyched that I saw it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city"><h3>Congratulations To Zohran Mamdani, NYC’s (Second) Gamer Mayor</h3></a><p>"Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba"><h3>This Game Sure Looks A Lot Like Venba [Update]</h3></a><p>Prolific copycat studio makes a copycat game of Venba, stripping it of any life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga"><h3>You win, Rent-A-Girlfriend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Hypnohead and publisher tinyBuild have announced the release date for roguelite city-builder&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, and it's set to arrive on PC next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>will arrive on July 21st. According to tinyBuild, the game has enjoyed 300,000 demo downloads and has amassed over 200,000 wishlists from hopeful fans. That's a lot of people who'll be over the moon to discover a release date has been revealed, I'm sure.</p>

<p>With&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, tinyBuild and Hypnohead promise to "[take] the base-building genre in a new direction" by "adding in roguelike elements to make each reign fresh". I suspect games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/against-storm" rel="nofollow">Against the Storm</a>&nbsp;</em>would have something to say about that, but I see what they're driving at.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-king-is-watching-city-building.jpg?itok=H2ypKkKg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-king-is-watching-city-building.jpg?itok=RZ7fzUWi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>comes to Steam next month.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's name comes from a mechanic whereby you must be watching certain facilities and buildings for them to be productive; the moment your gaze moves elsewhere, those facilities essentially slack off, so you'll need to keep your eyes on the places you most need to be productive.</p>

<p>You'll also need to manage resources carefully, choosing which resources to prioritize and which ones to put on the back burner for different situations. Hypnohead and tinyBuild say that every decision you make will shape your reign.</p>

<p>The roguelike elements in&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>manifest in the form of new challenges and variables for each run; you may, for instance, be confronted with "cursed cemeteries", or you may need to do battle with generals you've never faced in combat before.</p>




<p>However, you'll unlock permanent bonuses like increased troop limits and new facilities between runs, ensuring that you're constantly increasing the scope and range of your power.</p>

<p><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on July 21st. There's no word yet of ports to other platforms.</p>

The tale of a smart, innovative man stranded on Mars went on to have a great movie based on it, directed by legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott. It was a glorious success story...and then Weir published <em>Artemis</em>. Oh good lord, what a fall. An astoundingly terrible book, it is one of the most excruciating examples of the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.jezebel.com/strong-female-characters-arent-enough-goddammit-1592135553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.jezebel.com/strong-female-characters-arent-enough-goddammit-1592135553">strong female character</a></span>” trope, and while rights to make a movie were purchased before it was published, it’s not really a surprise that nothing’s happened with that since 2018.</p><p>Fears that the author, who self-published <em>The Martian</em> after being rejected by various imprints, might be a one-hit-wonder grew, until 2021's <em>Project Hail Mary</em> appeared, and was a completely compelling piece of sci-fi on par with his first book. Phew! And now, we have a first trailer for the inevitable movie adaptation, starring Ryan Gosling as the book’s main character, Ryland Grace. Even better, the screenplay is by Drew Goddard, who not only wrote <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em>, <em>Cloverfield</em>, and many episodes of <em>Buffy</em>, <em>Angel</em> and <em>Lost</em>, but also adapted <em>The Martian</em>. Oh, and it’s being directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the pair behind <em>The Lego Movie</em> and the writers of the<em> Into The Spider-Verse </em>movies.</p><p>So Ryland Grace is a junior high science teacher with a specialist background in molecular biology who is rather forcibly drafted to help with an effort by the European Space Agency to investigate a universal phenomenon of “dimming,” whereby stars are losing luminescence, including, rather pressingly, our own. Grace is pressured into joining a years-long mission to a star, Tau Ceti, that is resistant to the dimming, to find out why. Except, as you’d expect, lots goes wrong. But this isn’t a movie about that!</p><p>If you’ve not read the book, the latter third of the trailer might feel like quite a spoiler, and—I dunno—if I were marketing this, I’d have been a bit more subtle. But in truth, it’s actually setting up the vast bulk of the story, and really gives nothing away about the true extent of the narrative.</p><p>This is, without giving any specifics, a story about a unique relationship, and if the film can match the intimacy and uniquely peculiar nature of the novel, it could be very special. Or, the movie could trivialize that aspect and be far more about shit exploding in space. Who knows. But still, it looks pretty and fun so far.</p><p>The movie, which also stars Sandra Hüller, Liz Kingsman, and Lionel Boyce, is headed to theaters in March of next year. I imagine we’ll be seeing a lot more of it before then.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/project-hail-mary-trailer-ryan-gosling-andy-weir-1851785317]]></content:encoded>

I prefer the older version,” wrote one Steam player.” It feels better and looks better. Why couldn’t this just be an update or something? And for the price tag it just feels very meh.

It also detailed a series of upcoming patches to address the various issues, including “major improvements to chat input, scoreboard layout, and HUD elements,” and “Fixed softlocks, graphical glitches, and input issues in various screens.” Based on some players’ assessment of the <em>Master Crafted</em> Edition in general, however, it still might not be worth picking up. </p><p>The Anniversary Edition is currently 75 percent off, letting us get an already solid version of the old-school FPS for just $10. The <em>Master Crafted Edition </em>was more of a bone for console players anyway, since the <em>Anniversary Edition</em> never came to Xbox or PlayStation, and the original version of <em>Space Marine</em> wasn’t supported by backwards compatibility. Even there, however, Xbox Series X/S players (the game’s free with Game Pass Ultimate) have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1l9czva/lost_progresssave_on_xbox_series_x_on_master/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1l9czva/lost_progresssave_on_xbox_series_x_on_master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaining about a major bug that’s eating their save files</a></span>. </p><p>“Played earlier today. Shut down the game like I always do, and turned back on today only to get greeted by missing save for campaign,” wrote one player on Reddit a couple of weeks ago. “Happened to me too,” responded another. “I am done with this version of the game for now. I couldn’t play online at all and today I just saw my save is gone.” Refunds aren’t available for that platform though, and the issue doesn’t appear to have been patched out yet. </p><p>The <em>Master Crafted Edition</em> isn’t available on PS5 yet, possibly due to the Game Pass deal with Xbox. Hopefully, all of these issues get ironed out before it arrives. In the meantime, <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s new horde mode isn’t a bad substitute. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-refunds-ps5-1851785318]]></content:encoded>

Fryer--who no longer works for Xbox--recently shared her response to Microsoft's recent handheld and console partnerships and concluded that the company "has no desire" to create hardware anymore.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFG7YxFFCnY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-is-dead-says-founding-team-member-it-looks-like-xbox-has-no-desire-or-literally-cant-ship-hardware-anymore" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Fryer noted that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a> won't have any exclusive games to drive sales and added that Microsoft's partnerships with Asus on the handheld and AMD on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">the next generation of Xbox</a> reflects a dim future for its consoles.</p><p>"Obviously, as one of the founding members of the Xbox team, I'm not pleased with where things are today," said Fryer. "I don't love watching all of the value that I helped create slowly get eroded away. I'm sad because, from my perspective, it looks like Xbox has no desire--or literally can't--ship hardware anymore. So, this partnership is about a slow exit from the hardware business completely. Personally, I think Xbox hardware is dead."</p><p>Fryer acknowledged that remasters of classic games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> have been massively successful, but she questioned Xbox's ability to make new hits. She also notes that Microsoft has a valuable resource in Game Pass, but believes that it's not enough to drive hardware sales on its own.</p><p>Former Xbox Live and Game Pass vice president Mike Ybarra had a slightly different assessment on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1939298865976647790" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. While Ybarra also believes that Microsoft is pulling back from hardware, he thinks it can become the biggest gaming publisher if it focuses on that goal alone.</p><p>"They have to figure out what needs to change, and fast," wrote Ybarra. "I'm a big fan and will always bleed green... Pick your lane and stick to it... It's simple to me, Xbox should strive to be the world's largest publisher of entertainment content. Get rid of everything else and get focused. Do not be afraid to say what you are. Embrace the lane... Straddling the fence is not a winning plan."</p><p>A recent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-xbox-layoffs-reportedly-coming-soon/1100-6532671/" data-ref-id="1100-6532671">a new round of layoffs may hit Microsoft's gaming division</a> as soon as this week. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said multiple times that the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">needs to cut Xbox staff to be a sustainable business</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's latest quarterly report</a> noted that net revenue the company achieved net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%). The Xbox division also posted year-over-year revenue growth.</p>

<p>Another console port first</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Hamster, known for its suite of retro <strong>Arcade Archives</strong> ports, has revealed its next Switch 2 game as part of the Arcade Archives 2 series. And, just like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a>, it's another polygonal arcade-to-home port. This time around, it's <strong>Air Combat 22</strong>, which is coming to both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_air_combat_22">Switch 1</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_2_air_combat_22">Switch 2</a> on <strong>3rd July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/06/namcos-air-combat-22-is-coming-to-arcade-archives-on-ps4-ps5-switch-and-xbox">Time Extension</a> (via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/46058">Famitsu</a>), Air Combat 22 is an arcade game from 1995 and a spin-off of the original 1993 <strong>Air Combat</strong> arcade game. These games would eventually become part of what we know as the <strong>Ace Combat</strong> series, which actually celebrates its 30th anniversary <em>today</em> (for the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/air_combat">console port of the original</a>, at least).</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version comes in at <strong>$14.99</strong>, with the Switch 2 one priced at <strong>$16.99</strong>. And, those of you who don't have a Switch 2 yet, you'll be able to buy an upgrade pack when you eventually upsize for <strong>$2.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Both versions of the game come with "Original Mode", "High Score Mode", and "Caravan Mode", but the Arcade Archives 2 version (for Switch 2) will also get a resolution bump and additional modes such as "Time Attack" (not Network Mode though, as this is a single player game).</p>

<p>Air Combat 22 was a step-up in nearly every way to its predecessor. Named for running on the Super System 22 hardware, the game let you choose form one of three aircrafts — Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Sukhoi Su-27 and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor</p>
<p>Notably, this is the first time that Air Combat 22 has ever received a console port, so it's fantastic that we're finally getting it in a more-accessible format. And if the Ridge Racer Switch 2 version is anything to go by, you're in for a treat.</p>
<p>Let's hope we get more Ace Combat love on Switch 2, especially after the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7</a> port.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Glitch in the Matrix</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then</a> is a visual novel that tells the story of Mark Borja, a high school student who grapples with the usual day-to-day of teenage life while trying to figure out why he’s experiencing weird cases of déjà vu. It’s a slow burn; one that relishes in the quieter, mundane aspects of life that many TV shows and movies would rather you believe didn’t exist.</p>
<p>With beautiful pixel art visuals at its heart, Until Then feels a lot more ‘alive’ than a lot of visual novels, with dialogue and actions taking place entirely within the scene; so in other words, no ‘talking head’ sequences where static characters are nattering to one another from across the screen.</p>
<p>There is a supernatural element that slowly reveals itself, but it’s best if I keep this under wraps here. This is a game that works best with as little prior knowledge as possible, and its story will definitely tug at your heartstrings on more than one occasion through its 10-15 hour runtime.</p>
<p>Gameplay is understandably pretty limited, and you’ll spend most of your time simply pressing ‘A’ to advance the dialogue. Occasionally, you’ll be able to move left or right through the environment, and developer Polychroma Games has also seen fit to include a bunch of fun little minigames. Again, these all fit into the narrative wonderfully, so one moment you might be trying to jam a stick into some floating fishballs, and the next you’ll be playing a tune on the piano. They're really cool and help to break up the experience nicely.</p>
<p>I have to give a massive shoutout to the sound design, too. A lot of the music is composed of slow, gentle melodies no doubt designed to heighten moments of emotion, but the true star of the show is the diegetic sound. Almost all of the public scenes are bolstered by background noises of folks just going about their day; it gives a wonderful sense of place, but also a weird, ethereal feeling to the bizarre events that play out.</p>
<p>While I do appreciate a slow burn, there were definitely a few scenes that outstayed their welcome. One in particular sees Mark simply trying to keep himself entertained at home: he watches TV, plays games, and even chats to random strangers on his phone. It demonstrates his boredom and loneliness well, but I think the same goal could have been accomplished a bit quicker. Mark's bored, but that doesn’t mean I need to be.</p>
<p>This is a minor gripe, though. Until Then is a wonderful story that manages to feel both strange and relatable, and it’s well worth playing. One quick note on the Switch 2, however: the game hasn’t been optimised for the new console yet, so after a certain point early on, it simply didn’t work for me. Stick to the Switch 1 for now.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/until-then]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-possible-generative-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-players-reckon-theyve-spotted-some-undisclosed-generative-ai-work.1231755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Update June 30th 11:43AM: 11 bit studios has issued an official response to the report of generative AI being used for some of its assets.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the studio says the text on the screen in the Command Center was created with generative AI, but it was a "placeholder" and was never meant to be featured in the full release. The studio says the text is being updated.</p>

<p>Additionally, 11 bit says the AI-generated subtitles pertain to movies your alters can watch in your base, and these subtitles were handled by AI due to "extreme time constraints".</p>

<p>The studio says it always planned to bring in translation partners, and that this process is now underway, but that using AI for subtitles in the meantime was "the wrong call".</p>

<p>Original story follows below.</p>

<p>Original story: Eagle-eyed&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>players reckon they've spotted some undisclosed generative AI work hiding in one of the game's background screens, which would technically contravene Steam's guidelines if it's true.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/did_the_alters_captain_use_a_little_bit_of_ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EarthlingKira</a> noted that text shown on a screen in the game's Command Center area displays the line "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data", which sounds an awful lot like the kind of thing ChatGPT or a similar AI chatbot might spit out.</p>

<p>Later in the same thread, another user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/comment/mz9sx70/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a> that the subtitles for the Brazilian Portuguese version of&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>appear to have been created using AI as well, as it seems to include part of a prompt given to a chatbot to translate phrases into Portuguese.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-generative-ai-text-anomaly.jpg?itok=69mt4Kru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-generative-ai-text-anomaly.jpg?itok=A_JWvtMy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure! Here's a screenshot of&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>. (No AI was used in the retrieval of this screenshot, or, indeed, in the writing of this story.)</figcaption></figure><p>If the text and Brazilian Portuguese subtitles in question were indeed generated by AI, then this would seem to contravene Steam's guidelines on the technology.</p>

<p>While Valve does allow generative AI content in games on Steam (although this <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-explains-its-rules-on-ai-content-in-steam-games" rel="nofollow">wasn't always quite so straightforward</a>), it requires developers using gen-AI to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-changes-rules-on-ai-to-allow-vast-majority-of-games-that-use-it" rel="nofollow">disclose that they're doing so</a> when the game is submitted.</p>

<p>As you've probably guessed already,&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>' Steam page doesn't contain any such disclosure, so if AI was used, it was either done without developer 11 bit studios' knowledge or ignored during the submission process.</p>

<p>With that said, a PR representative for 11 bit studios has <a href="https://x.com/callmeshawnp/status/1935830483214254450" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">publicly stated</a> on social media that generative AI was not used during the creation of&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>. I've reached out to 11 bit for clarification on this and will update this story as soon as I hear anything.</p>




<p>Some players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/comment/mz4l9e5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">questioned</a> whether or not&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>' supposed use of generative AI is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/comment/mz4nwe9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">even a particularly big deal</a> or not in this case. Their argument is that the asset in question would probably consist of "lorem ipsum"-style placeholder text if it wasn't AI-generated, and that this isn't a particularly taxing creative task.</p>

<p>The counterarguments, of course, are the usual ones when it comes to generative AI; it's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-search-wrong-a-lot-inacurracy-study" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">often wrong or nonsensical</a>, it's <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmentally damaging</a>, and it could be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/openai-cto-mira-murati-ai-may-cause-some-creative-jobs-to-disappear.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">taking away opportunities</a> for creatives to flex their muscles, even for background assets.</p>

<p>If you've been sitting here throughout all of this wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit studios.</p>

<p>The game revolves around Jan, an astronaut who's left stranded on a hostile planet. Jan is forced to clone himself in order to keep his space station running, but each of his clones is quite literally his own man, and Jan must balance the needs of his "alters" with his mission.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> is a sci-fi management game in which you remix your character's life history in a "Quantum Computer" to generate a workforce of deeply disturbed, borderline non-functional clones. In a twist so on-the-nose I can feel its fingers plucking at my olfactory bulb, developers 11 Bit Studios may have used generative AI to spawn or auto-translate parts of the in-game lore - despite the absence of a generative AI disclosure on Steam.</p><!--more-->
<p>The rumour bubbled up last week, when Reddit user EarthlingKira <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/did_the_alters_captain_use_a_little_bit_of_ai/">posted a screen</a> of an in-game mission log with the phrase "Sure, here's a revised version focussing purely on scientific and astronomical data". It reads pretty obviously like a chatbot response that was accidentally left in the text after it was generated and pasted into the game. Bluesky user Hietor De Paolo has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zitosilva.bsky.social/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b">posted a screen</a> of a piece of dialogue, featuring the phrase "Sure! The text translated to Brazilian Portuguese is..." This suggests that 11 Bit also used ChatGPT or another genAI tool to translate the game's script.</p>
<p>Valve's Steam policies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">require developers</a> to tell players upfront whether they're using generative AI software, though the policy is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">so vague as to be totally unhelpful</a>. There is no mention of generative AI on The Alters Steam page at the time of writing. Nor did the developers tell me they were using generative AI when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">broached the subject</a> at an event in Poland last year. They did have a booth at the event that let attendants create and chat to AI personas, but I perhaps naively took this for a stunt dreamed up by the PR team - there was no suggestion that any of it would be part of the game itself.</p>
<p>GenAI continues to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">a Trending Topic, with strong undertones of Discourse</a>. The industry's largest publishers, especially Microsoft, have bet billions on the success of generative AI tools of one kind or another. You can't sign into a Windows laptop these days without being harassed to generate something - go on, do it for uncle Satya Nadella.</p>
<p>While genAI appears to be widely used in game development as a continuation of older, less romanticised automation tools, many developers and creatives are rightly suspicious of the bigger promises around genAI, seeing the supposedly magical artmaking technology as a source of ugliness and error and a threat to their livelihoods, foisted on them by snake oil merchants who, for all their talk of <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/practical-ai-how-ludos-generative-ai-tools-aim-to-help-democratise-game-development/">"democratising"</a> the creative process, are only accountable to their shareholders. Unions have attempted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sag-aftra-union-reach-tentative-agreement-with-game-companies-that-could-end-the-latest-voice-actor-strike">put "guardrails"</a> on genAI in game development, with varying success.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, I wondered whether The Alters' premise of cloning a character from the protagonist's own backstory could be interpreted as a parody of how generative AI bots appropriate and regurgitate existing texts and imagery. Lead designer Rafal Wlosek told me that 11 Bit did consider making your space station's Quantum Computer a talking AI character, but this was not envisaged as an actual genAI bot, nor a commentary on today's genAI tools. "I think it was [conceived] before GPT showed up to the general public," he said. Wlosek added that he was "very interested" in the discussion around generative AI and that 11 Bit "will be watching closely", but they had no plans to engage with the subject in The Alters.</p>
<p>I've reached out to 11 bit for clarification about the presence of genAI material in The Alters. I feel I should have been more on top of this, as the Rock Paper Servitor who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-alters-review">reviewed The Alters</a> and thought it was, on the whole, pretty decent. In my defence, I didn't spend much time combing the lore bits in the menus, because I was on deadline.</p>
<p>There's been some suggestion on Reddit that translation and optional lore writing are tertiary tasks, and thus, appropriate to hand off to a bot. This seems wildly silly. Translation and localisation are demanding and "creative" pursuits. Languages do not mesh easily - it takes wit and imagination to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-jolly-cooperation-of-localising-dark-souls">capture, say, the peculiarity of Dark Souls dialogue in English</a>. The Alters is about making subtle differentiations between versions of "the same" person. Choice of wording during dialogue was often key to my understanding of each Alter, and I have yet to encounter a chatbot capable of such delicacies. </p>
<p>As for lore document writing, you could say that my inattention to this side of The Alters during my review supports the view that it is an inessential extra. But come now - I don't think anyone can seriously dispute the importance of lore text to a sci-fantasy jobbie such as this.</p>
<p>In any case, the arguments about whether genAI can deliver on these fronts ignore the wider point that genAI is, essentially, just the latest way of trimming costs, shaving away labour and increasing output, to ensure that the industry can continue to be a mechanism of transferring wealth upwards. The Alters really does feel like an allegory for all that, despite 11 Bit's protestations - the basic stakes of the plot are that your employers want you to treat the Alters as bots, even as they protest that they are living beings who deserve a future. But this is a big, sticky issue that we probably need to revisit in op ed form. In the meantime, I'll let you know as and when we get clarity from 11 Bit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clone-generating-game-the-alters-may-have-used-ai-to-generate-some-writing-despite-the-lack-of-a-steam-disclosure]]></content:encoded>

Now, the game has been set for a release date in early July, and Playground Productions has confirmed that 28 out of 31 MLB players from the original Backyard Baseball '01 will return for the remaster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmNTH8ku6Hs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MmNTH8ku6Hs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The announcement didn't specify which of the three MLB players didn't lend their names and younger likenesses to Backyard Baseball '01's remaster. But some of the confirmed returning players include Cal Ripken, Jr., Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Alex Rodriguez, and Derek Jeter.</p><p>In partnership with Major League Baseball, Backyard Baseball '01 will feature logos from MLB's professional teams in addition to the players representing the league. Like the earlier Backyard sports remasters, Backyard Baseball '01 will recreate the classic gameplay for touch and modern PC controls.</p><p>"We're honored to partner with MLB to bring this iconic game to modern gaming devices for the first time," said Playground Productions CEO Lindsay Barnett in a statement. "Backyard Baseball '01 was a game-changer in many ways--introducing some of the sport's biggest legends into the Backyard universe. We can't wait for fans to relive the joy of building their dream team with both our beloved original characters and baseball's greatest pros from that unforgettable era."</p><p>Backyard Baseball '01 will be released on PC via Steam and on mobile devices on July 8. The remaster of Backyard Baseball '97 was ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 last October. However, there's currently no word about whether Backyard Baseball '01 will eventually join it on consoles. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> griefers are pinning ornithopters to the ground in PvE zones, summoning worms with thumpers, and feeding helpless players to the monstrous beasts in otherwise safe regions of the game.</p>
<p>It works due to vehicle collision. While Funcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">removed the ability to damage other players by ramming into them with ornithopters</a>, you can still push other players' vehicles around by flying into them. What these griefers are doing is essentially parking their own flying vehicles on top of players looking to harvest spice or flour sand, stopping them from flying out of the reach of incoming sandworms.</p>
<p>This comes following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-deep-desert-pve-expansion">a massive patch made the PvP Deep Desert significantly safer</a> for PvE-minded players, allowing them to farm the highest tier of resources without fear of roaming ornithopter gangs. In response, those who got a kick out of hunting down these combat-averse players have seemingly taken their devious behaviour elsewhere.</p>

<p>It's worth noting victims of this strategy do have ways out. They can attempt to slip out of the grasp of these griefers and fly away, or retrieve their scout ornithopter (while it has no stored cargo) with a vehicle back-up tool. However, taking the second approach still leaves you stranded on the sand with a worm approaching, forcing you to make a break for the nearest safe spot.</p>
<p>This, obviously, trapping players on the ground isn't an intended vehicle interaction. So what can Funcom do? Well, they can remove vehicle-on-vehicle collision altogether in PvE zones. This was a popular community-suggestion during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">the whole ornithopter squishing saga</a>.</p>
<p>The counter-argument is, harvesting spice on open sand is meant to be dangerous! While Hagga Basin isn't a PvP zone for the most part, you're still meant to keep your head on a swivel for incoming dangers. Removing this vehicle collision issue could make harvesting spice too easy.</p>
<p>It's a tricky one. Removing vehicle-on-vehicle collision is likely harder than it looks, and may have knock-on effects on the wider game. It's unlikely Funcom can flip a switch to make it work in PvP areas and not in PvE ones. There is a touch of irony with this, as an update to make the PvP endgame safer for PvE players has consequently made the PvE area more dangerous.</p>
<p>In my heart I can't really be mad at these sorts of shenanigans. Obviously for the player taking things slow and steady, happy in Hagga Basin, it would be incredibly frustrating to get pinned and eaten by a worm. But I also can't help but shake the feeling that these sorts of hyjinx add a wild west charm to Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">one I hope never goes away</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-griefers-are-parking-on-other-players-and-feeding-them-to-worms]]></content:encoded>

Griefers are in an all-out war against everyone else on their server, and yet there's zero way for solos to band together to stop it.

JFC, y'all are pathetic. This was in Hagga. I had players tonight telling each other to doxx me when I stood up to them in Hagga chat.

"Entrapping someone by abusing game mechanics intended to prevent grief of a similar kind, ala pinning people with ornithopters that otherwise can't be destroyed or escaped in a PVE zone, is griefing. Griefing should be explicitly and implicitly disallowed. If you're in a PVE zone, you should not have to worry about players killing you through an abuse of mechanics."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, there has been no public response from Funcom about the issue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.
