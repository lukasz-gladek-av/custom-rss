			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-is-out-next-week-adding-a-new-class-and-tons-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt</a> press presentation, Grinding Gear Games Game Director Jonathan Rogers sat down to answer several questions from the assembled press, both regarding the new expansion and the game as a whole. You can find the full transcript below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dawn of the Hunt will launch simultaneously on April 4th across all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-CnACIrCOkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 has two radically different gameplay tempos: the slow, methodical campaign and the faster endgame, more similar to the first game. Do you aim to slow down the end game and provide players with more agency to use slow reactive skills like parry, blocks, and combo skills?</strong></p>
<p>The answer to that is that it's not that in the endgame things suddenly change or anything. It's just that there are various meta builds that I would say were overpowered and have led to a situation where, in order to fight in the endgame effectively, people have tended to center around a few broken things. Now, this patch also contains a full rebalance that will improve a lot of the more broken things that have been going on, which means that we don't have as many people feeling like they're forced into some of that stuff, which should balance things out. The other thing is that we're changing the on-ramp to endgame quite a bit, especially with things like being able to die in the endgame. You should be in a scenario where people don't feel the need to use that staff and those builds are not so much available. We do want to make it so that you can still get very powerful as you go through, but it should be more earned than it is currently, where there's just a few broken things. It will take a while for us to get all that stuff fully resolved. It might take a few iterations before every single broken thing is ironed, but it's a constant goal and we'll get there in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Will unique bosses created by wisps drop increased loot?</strong></p>
<p>Yep, absolutely. That's the whole point.</p>
<p><strong>Are we going to face monsters as strong as we've seen in the first Path of Exile if we juice the wisps too hard?</strong></p>
<p>We've obviously got a very different balance overall. One thing we want to try and avoid is having monsters that are just complete damage sponges. That being said, it is important that you have the ability to make mistakes, to go too far with this kind of stuff. If you add a lot of mechanics to maps, you can get to the point where content becomes very, very difficult, but obviously more rewarding as well.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any information about the development progress of the Druid class?</strong></p>
<p>I don't have anything to announce right now. The plan is to announce it and release it as soon as we can. Classes do take a long time. There's a lot of work involved in them. One thing we've definitely learned is that it's hard to promise a specific release timeline for a class.</p>
<p><strong>In the last season, there wasn't much of a balancing nerfing the class skills or items. Are you going to make balance changes during the season or continue the way you did in the last season?</strong></p>
<p>When we went into early access with Path of Exile 2, we did believe that we'd be able to do a bunch of nerfing and that kind of stuff during leagues, which we don't normally do. We quickly found out that it's really just like a live game. You can't just nerf stuff mid-league because it breaks people's builds and they get very angry. We pretty much stopped doing that very quickly. This update will do a huge amount of balance and then anything really egregious we'll fix as it comes up, but generally speaking, we try to leave the balance mostly alone during the league. We now effectively bottle up all of those balance changes and then we release them when we're doing a season. As I said, it's a full game rebalance this time. A lot of the things that players are currently complaining about, like Herald Device and this kind of stuff, will definitely get nerfed this season.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Different Rogue exiles have different sets. There are lots of different ones that they can have. There's actually 12 Rogue exiles in this version. The idea is to try and make it so that, basically, the big full set of uniques that could drop from regular content can spawn on them. They all have specific AI for those uniques but they have lots of different options. There'll be Rogue exiles that contain most uniques that you would want to find. They're very interesting fights because they know how to use the items. They're pretty cool and&nbsp;feel very PvP-like. They're dodge rolling around and everything.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do Rogue exiles have preset items, or will it be completely random?</strong></p>
<p>They do have random items, but I believe that different Rogue exiles have different sets. There are lots of different ones that they can have. There's actually 12 Rogue exiles in this version. The idea is to try and make it so that, basically, the big full set of uniques that could drop from regular content can spawn on them. They all have specific AI for those uniques but they have lots of different options. There'll be Rogue exiles that contain most uniques that you would want to find. They're very interesting fights because they know how to use the items. They're pretty cool and feel very PvP-like. They're dodge rolling around and everything.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of changes in the new content touch on player feedback. How do you balance that with Grinding Gear's vision for Path of Exile 2?</strong></p>
<p>We always listen to the players to determine what the problems are, but we still have our ideas with regard to how we're going to solve those problems. The players are really the ones bringing things to our attention. Normally, there'll always be some kind of third way. Like, we've got an idea of how it should be, and the players have an idea of how it should be. If we try to combine the concerns of both us and them, we'll come up with a third way. There are a few issues that aren't like that, but generally speaking, we're always going to be able to come up with some kind of thing that both the players can get excited about and we can feel happy about as well. Ideally, that's the best solution.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to enable players to loot items from the ground in case they die immediately after killing a mob?</strong></p>
<p>That's kind of something that I would say is pretty disliked as far as solutions go, because we tend to avoid things that don't make any physical sense thematically. Obviously, if you're dead you can't pick items. I know that's one of those issues that players are unhappy about, but fundamentally, there is just a thing of if you die, you don't get to loot stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Will the least-played Ascendancies, as Acolyte, Chronomancer, Warbringer, and Witch Hunter, get changed in the update?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't say Chronomancer is not very well played, but for the others, the overall balance is changing very significantly. The reason why certain Ascendancies are played the most is usually because there's something broken going on with them. It isn't necessarily the case that the less played ones need buffing, although in lots of cases, we will do it. Effectively, all your previous assumptions just need to be thrown in the bin because there's enough changes as far as balance is concerned that you just can't expect things to work exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>Can the Smith of Katava take multiple of the armor modifiers, and does it require committing one Ascendancy point for each of them?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can take as many as you like as long as you have Ascendancy points. It's a question of, do you want to be using the other elements of the class or do you want to go all in on those armor modifiers, which can be pretty powerful. There's just quite a lot of choice there in this class.</p>
<p><strong>What additional uses do you have planned for gold in the future?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not going to announce any right now, but it's just useful having that currency around.</p>
<p><strong>It looks like map portals are tied to the number of resurrects and get lower if it gets harder. If we have some maps with fewer portals to go back and forth, does it mean we won't be able to carry as many items, especially for maps with multiple breaches?</strong></p>
<p>That is the case. However, I guess the theory here is that you shouldn't generally need to take more than an inventory or two full of items. It is a concern, though, and we'll have to see how well it works. I would hope there's something that we can do to alleviate that. I'm just thinking right now that maybe after the map is completed, we could allow potentially more, but I'll have to think about that. It's actually something that I should probably um investigate a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>Will Temporalis get removed or overhauled? It broke the game in several ways.</strong></p>
<p>It's not getting removed and it's not getting overhauled either. It might get nerfed a little bit but I should mention that it's not like everyone should be getting a temporalis just on demand. It's supposed to be a very hard unique to get. Just due to the other balance issues, it meant that getting a Temporalis was much easier than it would have otherwise been. Consider what you actually have to do to get one: you have to be able to play through Sanctum without getting hit one time. It shouldn't be something that is easy to get. Sometimes, we balance things by rarity, like, they are supposed to be a broken thing, but if you get them, they are incredibly ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is one of those cases, but because there were builds that allowed things to be very broken, it just meant that there were too many of them in the economy. Something I just want to stress is that it should be possible to become incredibly powerful. It's just that it shouldn't be the case that you get that without a huge amount of effort. For example, it really was a problem that the pinnacle bosses got killed in like 14 seconds the first time that people fought them. It really should be a long, protracted battle the first time, but of course, once you've played it several times, you've had more time to grind other stuff, you get to the top of the end of what is economically possible.</p>
<p>At that point it's fine to be killing pinnacle bosses in 14 seconds. It's just that it shouldn't be like that the first time. It's a question of getting the power scaling right. When you release a new game, there's just tons of stuff that's unintended.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I am definitely very keen to get it done this year. I would be very disappointed if we weren't able to. It's not 100% guaranteed. We might slip. I'm still very much hoping that we're not going to. Looking at the content of this particular expansion, there's a lot of stuff going on here and a lot of it is reactionary to the problems that we saw with the game, but in the background, we've still got artists and people all working on other acts. There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work going on in creating the rest of the content.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are you planning to adjust the drop rates of currency items?</strong></p>
<p>There's always adjustments. Generally speaking, normal currency is mostly fine. We don't really have a particular issue with it. There are certain things, for example omens are not common enough and we made it so that every ritual has an omen in it now. But I wouldn't say overall that currency items needed a buff or anything like that. We're mostly happy with them.</p>
<p><strong>Any hints about the remaining story? Will they be released individually or maybe as a big story </strong><strong>league or expansion?</strong></p>
<p>We are planning on launching them later. We're not going to announce when that's going to be for the time being, but obviously, they all have to get done by the time we get into full release.</p>
<p><strong>You initially talked about wanting the Path of Exile 2 early access phase to last one year. Now we're a little further in, does it still feel like a realistic goal to reach the state you want for 1.0?</strong></p>
<p>I am definitely very keen to get it done this year. I would be very disappointed if we weren't able to.<br>
It's not 100% guaranteed. We might slip. I'm still very much hoping that we're not going to. Looking at the content of this particular expansion, there's a lot of stuff going on here and a lot of it is reactionary to the problems that we saw with the game, but in the background, we've still got artists and people all working on other acts. There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work going on in creating the rest of the content. We might have released more of that stuff if it hadn't been for the fact that we felt like we had to add a lot of in-game features. Can we get it done this year? I think it's possible.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to change gold so it isn't a drop item but rather an auto-pickup on kill, like expedition artifacts received that QoL in Path of Exile?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely not. I think it's nice that you pick it up. It's got a relatively large pickup radius; you just run over it. I don't have any particular problems with this myself at this point.</p>
<p><strong>What changes to the trading system can players expect during the Path of Exile 2 early access?</strong></p>
<p>I don't have anything to announce about this, but I do have some things I want to try and improve here. Obviously, currency is much easier to trade. There are other things people want to do with trading. There are things that I would potentially change,&nbsp;and we definitely want to make sure we're testing those changes before the end of early access because it's one of those things that can affect the economy pretty significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Will the new update implement more cosmetics people have unlocked in POE1?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is yes. I don't have a list of them, but we're continuing to move through that list and add more things, so yes, more of them will be added.</p>
<p><strong>Will you please clarify if this update is a league on its own or if there will be several leagues before the next major content update?</strong></p>
<p>Every new update we do will contain a new economy. In this particular case, we decided not to put any of the content exclusive to the new economy, but in the future, we may decide to do that before early access is over. But generally speaking, there's probably going to be more content in these Path of Exile 2 updates than what you would have seen in Path of Exile 1 leagues in the past, just because we're finishing the game at the same time. That should result in a lot. In this particular case, our focus was really more on endgame and making sure there were lots of new encounters to find there. While we did add the wisps throughout the game and we've also added a strongbox&nbsp;and things like that, we didn't think it quite rose to the level of being able to make it exclusive to the league and to be able to call it a challenge league in the way that we would have done in the past.</p>
<p>The wisps were the closest thing to a new league mechanic here, but as I said, we decided not to make them exclusive this time. I am keen to do exclusive challenge league content for future expansions before the end of early access just because when we do that, we can also decide whether we want to remove them, change them, or mess around with them. That's our plan, but honestly, we'll see because, ultimately, everything comes down to the degree to which we want to feel like we're addressing the concerns that people have online.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, having plus level link levels to skills feels like a must since it gives such a large power boost for one mod. Is it intentional? Are there any changes coming to it?</strong></p>
<p>It is intentional and it's exactly the same as having increased physical damage on weapons. There are certain mods that are more powerful than others; that's part of the fun of finding them. It's one of those things, just like how you need run speed on boots. There are certain things that you want to be able to find. You need chase mods in order to make the bad mods feel better. It's just part of the design.</p>
<p><strong>Any plans to add a higher difficulty mode for existing acts?</strong></p>
<p>No, because even the fact that we have two difficulties right now is not the final stage. We'll be removing that difficulty the moment we have the rest of the campaign. The higher-difficulty content is the endgame content, which is already done. While it all looks unique, it technically remixes all the act content and reuses the bosses in different ways. It's not like you don't have high-level content to do; it's just that it's done in a way that feels different from the campaign.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'There is actually a chance of not being able to add all classes in time. I suspect we're probably not going to have all of them for full release, but we'll see. It depends on how things go and where things end. Obviously, I'd like to get them all in, but they do take a long time to make. The most important thing for the full release is that we have the full campaign and there's all the content that we need. It's not like we've got a shortage of classes. If we didn't have one or two of them for the full release, that wouldn't be the end of the world. We'll try to get them all in, but if we don't, then whatever.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will all the remaining classes be added to early access before release, or could some&nbsp;be held back for the full launch of Path of Exile 2?</strong></p>
<p>There is actually a chance of that. I suspect we're probably not going to have all of them for full release, but we'll see. It depends on how things go and where things end. Obviously, I'd like to get them all in, but they do take a long time to make. The most important thing for the full release is that we have the full campaign, and there's all the content that we need. It's not like we've got a shortage of classes. If we didn't have one or two of them for the full release, that wouldn't be the end of the world. We'll try to get them all in, but if we don't, then whatever.</p>
<p><strong>The last time, you mentioned that Path of Exile 1 will continue receiving updates as long as it has players. Are the current player numbers sufficient to justify ongoing development?</strong></p>
<p>So it absolutely is. The issue with Path of Exile 1 development really just comes down to studio bandwidth from the perspective of designers who know how to make Path of Exile. We don't have a huge number of them. Obviously, we have a bunch of people who work on the game, but in terms of game director tier people who are able to lead a project like that, we don't have enough to the point where we can just be, okay, you just go off and you do your thing.</p>
<p>Mark and I have to keep an eye on it. For that reason, it's been a challenge to get the structure in place so that we can actually get both games rolling. Right now, I think we're getting to that point, but it certainly was a bit rough around the launch of Path of Exile 2's early access where POE 1 stuff got quite paged in order to make POE2 happen. We're going to continue to do that stuff.</p>
<p>With regard to your question, our company had both games in the top 20 player concurrency for Steam at one point a few weeks ago. I'd certainly say that both games have their place with<br>
regard to player popularity. It's definitely worth continuing to support Path of Exile 1.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any mana cost changes?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I don't even know what they are because, as I said, everything's just been rebalanced. Some will go up; some will go down, and some will go sideways. For the specifics, you're going to have to wait for the patch notes to see.</p>
<p><strong>Will Path of Exile 2 and its predecessor alternate new seasons from now on, or will there be another Path of Exile 2 season after Dawn of the Hunt?</strong></p>
<p>There will be another Path of Exile 1 season between Dawn of the Hunt and the next Path of Exile 2 season for sure. As for how it works going forward, we're keen to alternate them, but it's going to come down to the realities of development and what happens. Certainly the eventual goal by the time everything is rolling and working smoothly, it will definitely be the case that they're going to alternate like that, but I can imagine scenarios during early access of POE 2 where POE 1 might end up with a delay here or there.</p>
<p><strong>Any plans for the endgame map to have an option to place bookmarks or better navigation changes?</strong></p>
<p>We actually do have plans for this. Unfortunately, they didn't make it for this update. We have UI designs. I have a feeling you might see them in 0.21. We definitely know that that's an issue, but our UI guys were quite busy. We'll get to it.</p>
<p><strong>With the Atlas tree expanding, are we going to have more points for the Atlas tree?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you are. Actually, I don't remember the number now. Both the corrupted Nexus objective and the unique map objectives get you Atlas points. Both the tree and the points have expanded.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Grinding Gear Games has unveiled Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt, a huge free expansion to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed action RPG title</a> currently in early access. The expansion launches next week on all platforms; don't forget to also check out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press roundtable Q&amp;A with Game Director Jonathan Rogers</a>, who revealed even more details about the expansion and the game's future.</p>
<p>Dawn of the Hunt introduces the first new class since the early access of Path of Exile 2: the huntress. She is a spear-wielding warrior born into a society with strict traditions. She was exiled from her homeland after using her powers to defend her. She specializes in both melee and ranged combat, dashing into and out of battle. Spears have extended range and a short dash, but unlike other melee weapons, you can also throw them. In order to make a hybrid ranged/melee character work, the developers had to think about ways to make it fun to both enter and exit the melee range. The first skill players will get as a Huntress is Whirling Slash.</p>
<p>As well as striking in a circle the player, the skill creates a whirlwind that blinds enemies. Leaving the whirlwind will make it explode, and the more Whirling Slash is used, the bigger the explosion gets. Once out of melee, the Huntress can follow up with something ranged. She can whip the spear around to shoot twisters towards foes. These twisters bounce off walls and can hit enemies multiple times. Twisters can also be thrown inside a whirlwind to shoot out extra tornadoes that do way more damage. In her off-hand, the Huntress will hold a buckler which allows her to Parry.</p>
<p>While holding that down, the character will counterattack any incoming attack from nearby monsters, stunning them. Additionally, the monsters will take extra attack damage from your follow-up strike. Some of the specific class skills have been designed to be used after a Parry.</p>
<p>Disengage is a skill that does a quick jump back, damaging enemies in front of you. It can be used to interrupt other actions like dodge roll. If you use it against a parried enemy, it causes an explosion and gives you a frenzy charge. However, the Huntress cannot Parry too much, lest they get stunned and possibly killed.</p>
<p>The Huntress also has a variety of elemental spear throw attacks. Lightning Spear bounces lightning between your foes. Explosive Spears can be thrown into the ground and detonate after a while, incinerating anyone caught in the blast. All spear throws can also be empowered by frenzy charges. For example, Explosive Spears will cause an even larger explosion and leave fire on the ground. These empowered versions can activate even more combos. Using Whirling Slash off a ground fire will suck it into the whirlwind, adding fire to the explosion. Using Twisters inside a fire whirlwind will shoot out fire tornadoes as well, and you can do similar combos with ice and lightning, too.</p>
<p>A key aspect of hunting is exhausting your foes by causing blood loss. Rake dashes towards your target and unleashes a deadly slash opening up wounds on your enemies. You can follow up with Disengage and watch them bleed out as they run towards you. On the monsters health bar, you can see how much blood loss the enemy has experienced. The Huntress has skills to take advantage of this: for example, using Blood Hunt will thrust forward and cause a bloody explosion. the more blood loss, the bigger the explosion. Thunderous Leap will allow you to jump onto and explode any Spears either in the ground or in your enemies.</p>
<p>As well as hunting animals, the Huntress also has the ability to work with them. While fighting any beast, you have the ability to tame it and use it as a companion. You can only have one companion at a time, but it will keep the mods that were on it. Try to find a rare beast with good mods to take full advantage of your ability to tame. There's a huge amount of synergy between ranged and melee options. There are a total of 22 new skills available for the Huntress.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ritualist-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The first Ascension class you could choose is the Ritualist, which has embraced the darker side and harnessed the power of animal sacrifice and plague. The Corrupted Life Force skill causes all enemies around you to grow volatile blood boils on their skin. When those enemies are slain, the boils will burst, spreading corrupted blood to all enemies around them. The Ritualist also excels in taking advantage of magical trinkets. The Unfurled Finger skill allows you to equip an additional ring on a finger. Taking Mystic Attunement increases the bonuses of all the rings and Amulets you have equipped. You can even cut your own hand sacrificing some of your own blood to empower yourself.</p>
<p>The Amazon Ascension is for those looking to hunt more than just beasts. Trained as a guard to the most important Elders, the Amazon will use more traditional fighting techniques mastered to perfection. The Predatory Instinct skill will cause you to reveal weaknesses in the defenses of rare and unique enemies, allowing you to deal more damage. You can see those weak spots represented on their life bars. While using Elemental Infusion, any charges you consume will infuse your weapon with elemental power, causing any projectile attacks to explode on impact. The Critical Strike skill is as simple as it sounds: it takes your accuracy and gives it to you as Critical Strike chance.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt also brings three new Ascendancy classes for other classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lich (Witch) -</strong> The Lich tears their own soul apart, becoming a master of undeath and chaos. The Lich is a master of Chaos and Curses who can use her own life to enhance her Energy.</li>
<li><strong>Smith of Kitava (Warrior) -</strong> The Smith of Kitava forges weapons of destruction in fire and suffering. Embrace sheer power and take Smithing skills to greater heights by resonating with the insatiable one - Kitava.</li>
<li><strong>Tactician (Mercenary) -</strong> The mercenary Tactician brings military-grade brutality to the battlefield. As a former trained Blackguard Elite, the Tactician is able to decimate the monsters of Wraeclast while earning a healthy income at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The expansion also adds two new skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raise Spectre -</strong> This skill lets you trap and summon the souls of almost any monster in the game. With hundreds of monster variants in Path of Exile 2, expect endless experimentation to find the perfect undead army.</li>
<li><strong>Summon Rhoa Mount -</strong> Call forth a Rhoa to fight by your side or mount it to move at full speed while attacking. But beware, taking too much damage can knock you off, leaving you vulnerable to a brutal fate.</li>
</ul>
<p>This expansion also brings a massive overhaul to character development by adding over 100 new Support Gems to enhance build diversity. Support gems add a variety of interesting effects to your existing skills, modifying them in game-changing ways. For example, Haemocrystals turn bleed effects into explosive Vaal crystals, and Caltrops allow your existing skills to litter the battlefield with slowing hazards.</p>
<p>A big focus of the expansion is to expand on the endgame. There are over a hundred new unique items, ensuring high-level characters have more thrilling bounty to chase. New crafting tools have also been introduced as rewards across many areas of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 20 new runes have been added allowing you to craft new mods onto your gear</li>
<li>Runes now scale with multiple tiers, allowing for stronger mods that remain viable in the endgame.</li>
<li>We're expanding crafting options further by introducing more specialized socketable mods, with the first wave arriving in an upcoming content update.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more. The so-called Azmeri Spirit has made itself present in Wraeclast. When approached, these wisps will flee, and monsters coming into contact will be infused by it, making them more powerful. Wisps will also find and possess Rare or Unique monsters, granting them powerful new abilities, and powerful new rewards. There are twelve distinct types of wisp, each with their own mechanics and rewards.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt adds eight new Maps to the game, offering fresh challenges and rewards. In each case, players will have interesting new encounters to look forward to, such as&nbsp; being forced to fight mirrored Rare monsters in a shifting, warped reality in The Fractured Lake, or being thrust into the wild Ezomyte Forests of The Phaaryl Megaliths where rune-carved stones surge with energy. Survive the storm-fueled gauntlet of deadly boss waves, and you’ll earn full boss rewards and exclusive Runes.</p>
<p>The update introduces four new Unique Strongboxes, each with deadly mechanics and valuable rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ogham's Legacy features a rune-carved stone and a slain creature that, when activated, revives as a powerful Rare. Each defeat triggers another resurrection with added modifiers making the fight progressively more difficult, but also more rewarding.</li>
<li>Ixchel’s Torment harnesses ancient Vaal thaumaturgy, unleashing Chaos-empowered guardians to protect a powerful artifact. Victors will be rewarded with a unique item featuring a specific Corrupted outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essences also received major upgrades, with four new Corrupted Essences - Hysteria, Delirium, Horror, and Insanity - offering new combat mechanics and powerful new crafting outcomes, such as guaranteed double Enchantments when using a Vaal Orb on belts.</p>
<p>Corruption has continued to spread throughout Wraeclast and has formed into larger and larger zones. In the center of each one lies a Corrupted Nexus, the home of three new terrifying bosses, amalgamations of Corruption itself. Upon defeating these bosses, any remaining areas within the zone of Corruption will become cleansed. Cleansed Maps have additional new monsters, a new boss, and their own set of Modifiers and rewards.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RogueExilesCinematic-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt also introduces Rogue Exiles - others like you who have been exiled and are openly hostile. They will challenge you in a fight to the death. These NPCs have the ability to Dodge Roll and avoid your abilities with smart pathfinding, smart targeting, and much more action-packed gameplay. Rogue Exiles use the same skills available to players, and even the same items. They aren't just dressed up in those items; they know how to take advantage of the Uniques they are using, which, of course, will be available for players once they have prevailed.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's a significant rebalance of the endgame. The number of towers has been drastically reduced, but they have been made much more powerful. Tablets now affect twice as many areas and running higher tier Maps in Towers increases this number further still. In addition, each Tower will be able to consume up to three Tablets at once. These changes greatly reduce the amount of busy work required in the endgame while improving the player's ability to use them. On top of that, Towers can now spawn with all mechanics, and have their own new Bosses.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt will launch on Friday, April 4.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-hunts-new-huntress-and-ascendancy-classes-look-sick</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunts-new-huntress-and-ascendancy-classes-look-sick.1147107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-hunts-new-huntress-and-ascendancy-classes-look-sick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-011-full-patch-notes" rel="nofollow"><em>Path of Exile 2</em></a>, the long-awaited sequel to a cherished ARPG, is fully underway and players have had the chance to dive head first into its sumptuous content. It <em>is</em> in Early Access, however, so we can expect many updates with new inclusions. That said, Patch 0.2.0, dubbed <em>Dawn of the Hunt</em>, is sure to shake things up with tons of new content.</p>

<p>Along with the brand new Huntress class in <em>Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt</em>, there are also three new ascendancies (and two for the Huntress) that will drastically change up how you play. This is what I want to focus on, because outside of additional endgame changes, players are chomping at the bit for new characters to play.</p>

<p>Introducing the Huntress, a spear-wielding range and melee hybrid class that can tame wild beasts and channel elements and spirits to slay her foes. Her signature spear can be used to fight enemies up close, or you can throw it at enemies as a ranged attack.</p>



<p>One of the Huntress' signature abilities is the Whirling Slash, which sets a whirlwind on the ground that blinds enemies and causes damage. In a press-only preview of this class, we saw her use this ability multiple times to create a larger whirlwind. You can also enhance the whirlwind by using certain elemental attacks, creating fire or lightning-based tornadoes, as an example.</p>

<p>What stuck out to us, however, was the ability to tame beasts. The Huntress can choose a companion from enemy beasts, though we don't quite know the limitations. What we do know is that it allows players to tame rares -- even those with monster-only modifiers -- so you'll want to keep a look out for those with good synergy with your build.</p>

<p>"There is going to be some level of competition for getting the rares," said which have the best mods, because they come with all the powers they had while they were rare, so you're probably going to want to keep an eye out..." said <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>Game Director Johnathan Rogers during a press Q&amp;A TechRaptor attended.</p>



<p>Her two ascendancy classes -- which are essentially specializations to further improve your character -- include Ritualist and Amazon. The former is a "forbidden magic" archetype while the latter is more of your typical spear-wielding warrior focusing on furiously attacking your enemy.</p>

<p>The Witch, Mercenary, and Warrior also get one new ascendancy class each. The Witch can become a Lich, the Mercenary a Tactician, and the Warrior a Smith of Kitava. The Smith of Kitava is a very intriguing take on ascendancy classes -- other than being able to improve your weapons mid-battle, you can also drastically alter your armor.</p>

<p>The Smith of Kitava can allocate ascendancy points to disconnected nodes on their skill tree, which essentially adds modifiers to their armor. This would replace the stats on your armor with whatever node you choose, but it allows you to pick modifiers that are much more powerful or even unobtainable from normal loot drops.</p>

<p>"In terms of fulfilling an interesting part of your build, they're just pretty cool," said Rogers. "Now the other thing as well, if you want, because you can choose how many other of the ascendancy nodes or how much of the armor crafting nodes you want, you can put all of your mods -- like you can put all eight ascendancy points into that, and now you have, that's a pretty damn powerful armor you have at that point."</p>



<h2>What other Changes Are Coming to <em>Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt</em>?</h2>

<p>There are a <em>slew</em> of other changes including a skill gem that gives you a mount to ride on, but to go over each and every change would be a Sisyphean task, so be sure to check Grinding Gear Games' announcement <a href="http://pathofexile.com/dawn-of-the-hunt-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As a quick rundown, players can expect dozens of new skills, new maps, endgame changes, and even rogue exiles.</p>

<p>Rogue exiles are NPCs players can fight that and have the same abilities as other players, including dodge rolling. They are smarter in nature and drop the loot set they're wearing, meaning there's a high risk of engaging them, but the reward is worth it.</p>

<p>With <em>Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt</em>, players can dive back or continue playing with tons of new added content. This particular update launches on April 4th at 3pm EST, so you won't have to wait long to dive into these new additions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-zombies-unveils-shattered-veils-map-and-new-enemies-for-season-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap is live now. It provides new details about the Zombies mode, including the Shattered Veil map and new enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-season-3-map-shattered-veil">Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 3 Map: Shattered Veil</h2>



<p>Shattered Veil is the new map for Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 3 on April 2. It is set in an old mansion called Colton Hall. Players have arrived to meet S.A.M. with the Sentinel Artifact in their possession. They must unlock the mysteries of this artefact with the help of S.A.M.’s synthetic mind; however, things will not be that easy for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players must enter Colton Hall and confront the new tyrant from the next chapter of the Black Ops 6 Zombies narrative. The map features different areas to explore, including a main hall with a massive fossil exhibit, an outdoor area, and a basement to unearth all kinds of mysteries.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-brings-new-zombies-enemies">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Brings New Zombies Enemies</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap has revealed brand new enemies for the Zombies mode. First up is the Elder Disciple, a strange floating apparition found in the mansion’s estate. These enemies can use dark magic to summon more undead to the battle and even force them to evolve. Low-ranking zombies can transform into a Doppelghast or some other sinister form with the help of the Elder Disciple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zombies Season 3 also sees the arrival of other entities from the Shattered Veil. Players should keep an eye out for the toxic zombie, as it can leave a damaging pool of acid around it. However, it is easy to spot, with its greenish hue and more skeletal exterior, and it makes shrieking sounds when close.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-season-3-new-weapons">Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 3 New Weapons</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap has introduced two new wonder weapons for the Zombies mode: the Ray Gun Mark II and the Wunderwaffle DG-2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ray Gun Mark II allows players to attack multiple Zombies simultaneously through a three-round burst of energy and doubles as a bludgeoning instrument. Players can also test three different variants of the Ray Gun Mark II. The W variant provides similar bullet patterns as a submachine gun, the P variant mimics a shotgun, and the R variant can be compared to a Marksman Rifle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other new weapon is Wunderwaffle DG-2, the best way to electrify hordes of zombies quickly. Players can use this weapon to inflict chain-lighting bolts that can stun crowds and provide terminal damage over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Warner Bros. Games has canceled the planned Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition. </p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new report</a> from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the definitive edition and DLC’s cancellation comes as part of “an ongoing restructure at the entertainment company’s video game unit.”</p>



<p>The project was officially canceled this week “due to concerns that the amount of content was not substantial enough to justify the price being considered.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> exclusively first reported</a> on the development of the Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition and DLC back in October 2024. The new version of the game was scheduled to include 10-15 hours of additional content, including a new story quest, side quest, activities, and outfits.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-exclusive-yves-guillemot-s-internal-memo-on-ubisoft-and-tencent-s-new-subsidiary">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE – Yves Guillemot’s Internal Memo on Ubisoft and Tencent’s New Subsidiary</a></h6>



<p>In addition to the definitive edition of the game, the DLC was expected to be available separately for those who already owned the base game.</p>



<p>With no extra content now planned for Hogwarts Legacy, the studio seems to be moving forward focusing on the eventual sequel to the popular game. Back in November, outgoing Warner Bros. Games president <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Haddad said that Hogwarts Legacy 2</a> was a “very big priority” for the company and that production on the game was in progress.</p>



<p>The sequel is being developed by the same studio—Avalanche Software—that developed the first Hogwarts Legacy. The original game has sold nearly 35 million copies, and has remained a top-selling game each month since its February 2023 release.</p>

                <p>Amazon Luna+, the game-streaming platform run by the online retail giant, is adding a trio of high-profile games from Electronic Arts. Amazon has <a href="https://amazonluna.blog/amazon-luna-signs-multi-year-content-deal-with-electronic-arts-and-expands-to-sweden-portugal-152881cdd355" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> that it's reached a multi-year deal with EA to bring "many" of its games to Luna+, and this begins with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and 2023's Dead Space. These three games join Luna today, while more are coming to Luna "soon."</p><p>EA executive David Tinson said it partnered with Amazon in part to help its games reach an even bigger audience. Amazon teased that some of the upcoming EA titles to join the Luna catalog will include EA Sports games, though no titles were named outright.</p><p>Luna+ is not part of Amazon Prime but is instead an additional $10/month subscription (after a free seven-day trial). The subscription service has more than 100 games in the catalog already, including Batman: Arkham Knight, Sonic Frontiers, Resident Evil 2, Control, Alien: Isolation, and Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga. These games are playable over the cloud on a variety of devices, including Amazon's own TVs and tablets, as well as smartphones and PC.</p><p>Luna is one of many cloud-streaming services in gaming today, sitting alongside Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia's GeForce Now. Some EA games are also streaming on Xbox Cloud Gaming, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-adds-cfb-25-today-but-only-for-ultimate-subscribers/1100-6530430/" data-ref-id="1100-6530430">including College Football 25. </a></p><p>The appeal of such services is that users do not need a beefy PC or high-end console because games are streamed. However, a good cloud-gaming experience requires a consistent and powerful connection.</p><p>Amazon created its own Luna controller, too, and it's on sale now for $45 (down from $70). Luna is also compatible with a controller you may already own, including Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch controllers.</p><p>Amazon also confirmed that Luna is now available in more places, including Sweden, Portugal, Belgium, and Luxembourg. This brings the total number of supported countries to 14 worldwide. The other supported countries for Luna are the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Poland, and the Netherlands.</p>

            <p>Grinding Gear Games apparently didn't expect action role-playing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> to do as well as it did when it launched in early access late last year.</p>
<p>The New Zealand-based company suspected that the £25 entrance fee, there temporarily while the game is in open development in early access (it will eventually be a free to play game), would put people off. But it didn't. At its peak, Path of Exile 2 had between 800,000 and 900,000 concurrent players. It was, I'm told, the company's biggest ever release.</p>
<p>"It was absolutely 100 percent a success," company co-founder and game director Jonathan Rogers told me in an interview. "As we started to get closer to release and see pre-sales and stuff like that, suddenly it was like oh crap, this is looking like it might be one of our biggest releases ever, and then it did indeed turn out to be. And that is indeed our largest release by quite a lot that we've ever done."</p>
<p>But intense popularity can change things. What was once intended as a way for dedicated fans to help shape a project ended up feeling more like a full-scale release, which meant development priorities had to change. "And you saw that early on where we started doing a bunch of changes, like nerfing stuff that needed to be nerfed," Rogers said.</p>

<p>"We immediately ran into the situation we would normally expect in the full released game, which is a bunch of players are like, 'oh you're breaking my build', so we had to realise, okay, we have to treat this like it's a released game in this regard and be a bit more careful," he said. Less experimenting, more treating it like a live service operation.</p>
<p>"Whenever you've got players, it derails what your plans are," Rogers added, "and it has to. It's good that it does because it forces you immediately to be responding to what the game needs, which now becomes very obvious because you've got actual players playing it." Devs don't have the time to test some things as intensely as players, collectively, do. That's why we're seeing a big push to expand areas like the endgame now, for example.</p>
<blockquote>"I would be incredibly disappointed if we weren't cracking a million [concurrent players] for the full release."</blockquote>
<p>The other side of intense popularity is unexpected stories related to your game such as the headline-grabbing revelation that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/01/20/elon-musk-finally-admits-to-path-of-exile-2-account-boosting-in-dms/">Elon Musk paid someone to boost his Path of Exile 2 </a>account - play his character for him - for some reason. Presumably bragging rights.</p>
<p>This appears to be against <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/legal/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy">the game's Terms of Service</a> - players can't make money by performing services in the game, as a booster would - but Musk doesn't seem to have been reprimanded. So I asked Rogers what the procedure was for dealing with suspected cases of boosting such as this. "I don't really want to comment about that whole drama, to be honest," he said.</p>
<p>To which I asked him what he thought more broadly of Path of Exile 2 being in the news in this way. "I don't know. It was kind of weird," he said. "But it is what it is."</p>
<p>Since release, the concurrent player numbers for Path of Exile 2 have significantly dropped off; a quick glance at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">Steam's Most Played chart</a> shows a high point of around 25,000 players today. But this doesn't worry Rogers.</p>
<p>"No, no, not at all. Not at all," he said. "Because the thing is, ultimately, the way we've always developed our game is that it's seasonal. The way people play our game is that they come, they play for a month, they enjoy what they do, they leave, then they come back after the season ends."</p>

<p>There's a pattern to it, Rogers has come to realise. Player numbers dip after your initial release, dipping at around update 0.2, which is what we're getting next week, and then from 0.3 onwards they start to rise again. "This is what happens with action-RPGs," he said. That's what happened with every market GGG launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile">Path of Exile 1</a> in.</p>
<p>He's confident, then, Path of Exile 2 can go even bigger than early access <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2s-full-release-has-a-65-chance-of-arriving-this-year-says-grinding-gear-games-so-what-could-go-wrong">when it launches in full, potentially this year</a> - and if not this year then shortly after, in early 2026. "100 percent it will be [bigger]," he said. "And the reason for that is because, for that one, you've got the fact that it's going free, and there are a lot of people, of course, who will try a game once it's free, and then they'll discover they enjoy it. I have no doubt it will be bigger.</p>
<p>"Look," he added, "I would be incredibly disappointed if we weren't cracking a million [concurrent players] for the full release, and honestly, I think we can do better than that."</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 launched in early access in December last year, and I reviewed it, and loved it. It's an action-RPG that considerably ups the risk, making for a more frugal and perilous campaign than in genre-relative, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. "Soulslike thrills combine with sky-high production values to make Path of Exile 2 a hugely impressive package, even in early access," I wrote in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 early access review</a>.</p>
<p>Update 0.2, which is dubbed Dawn of the Hunt and due next week (4th April), brings a significant amount of new content to the game, including a considerable rework of the endgame, a brand new Huntress class to play as, scores of new items, monsters, and encounters, new ascendency class options, and more. Grinding Gear Games showcased <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pathofexile">Path of Exile 2 patch 0.2 in detail on Twitch</a>.</p>

Remember Secret Level, that Amazon show that came out last December? I wouldn't blame you if you already forgot about it, for the most part it was pretty forgettable considering how much of it could be boiled down to "damn… video games are violent, huh?", except positioning that as universally cool, actually (let's leave that whole conversation there). Easily the weirdest of all the episodes was the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pac-man">Pac-Man</a> one, given that it was only Pac-Man in the sense that there was a floating yellow orb thing that kind of looks like the titular, iconic video game character.
</p>

<p>
Really, though, it's about some humanoid alien being told to eat everything it comes across by this orb, called Puck (get it?), resulting in something that's admittedly intriguingly alarming and grotesque, but also has such ridiculously high levels of edgy animated short film from the early days of YouTube energy. Three days after this episode came out, there came the surprise reveal that this episode is getting a Metroidvania video game adaptation called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, for reasons I couldn't begin to understand.

<p>
And now, thanks to the powers that be at Nintendo during today's Direct, a release date has been confirmed for the confusing game: July 18th. The release date announcement came with a snazzy new trailer that revealed you also get a mech? Honestly, the whole thing is unheard of levels of silly, I'm still struggling to believe that this is a real game that's been greenlit, but hey ho, perhaps we've got a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> on our hands.
</p>
<p>
Still can't quite tell if the story will be the exact same as the Secret Level episode, there's some big discrepancies (and a much bigger <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>: Automata vibe to it), so we'll all just have to wait a few more months to find out.

But a new look at an improved gameplay feature in the upcoming remake, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>, might just be enough to convert this jaded fan who’s convinced the series peaked at <em>Sons of Liberty</em>. In a 12-second clip, Naked Snake can be seen swapping his camo from a foresty look to something more suitable for an urban environment in record time. It’s way faster and less cumbersome-looking than the camo-swapping of the original.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap has revealed new multiplayer maps, modes, additional equipment, and multiplayer ranked play changes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-maps">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Maps</h2>



<p>In Black Ops 6 season 3, players can check out five new maps and a variant. Barrage is a 6v6 medium-sized Core map set in 1968 Vietnam. Nomad is a 6v6/2v2 small-sized Strike map where players battle in the ruins of a fortified settlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next up is the return of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beloved-cod-maps-coming-back-to-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-favourite map</a>, Firing Range. Black Ops 6 Season 3 has received a remastered version of Firing Range, a 6v6, medium-sized Core map that finally returned to the series after Black Ops 4 in 2018. Next is Haven, a 6v6, medium-sized core map set in a KGB Safehouse in 1991.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last up is Signal, which is again a 6v6/2v2, small-sized Strike Map. Players start their battles from opposing submarine bays while going through the Control room of an ocean rig numbers station. Additionally, a Nuketown variant called Blazetown will be released for a limited time mid-season.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-multiplayer-modes">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Multiplayer Modes</h2>



<p>Coming to the new multiplayer game modes revealed in the Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap, players will see the return of two classic modes, Sharpshooter and Demolition. There’s also a limited-time mode called Joint Operators.</p>



<p>Sharpshooter is a free-for-all party mode where every player needs to use the same loadout, and it changes every 45 seconds. Every time it changes, you will receive a new primary weapon, secondary Weapon, dedicated melee weapon, tactical equipment and lethal equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Demolition, players will alternate between attacking and defensive positions across two bomb sites. The attacking team wins when it destroys the bomb and receives a time bonus for the first detonation. All the players from the attacking team spawn with bombs, and there are multiple respawns for both teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Joint Operators, players need to test their skills in a gauntlet of five Core mode variants in a single match: Head Stash (TDM), Inhalation (Domination), Hotbox (Hardpoint), Very High Target (HVT), and Munchies (Kill Confirmed). The modes will include some modifiers, too, like double health, low gravity, hallucinations and third-person POV.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-perks">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Perks</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap reveals additional equipment, such as two new perks and a scorestreak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Close Shave is an Enforcer type Perk, which automatically uses the player’s Dedicated Melee attack when they perform a weapon butt attack. Vendetta is a Recon-type perk that arrives mid-season. When the player respawns, it makes their killer’s last known location for a short duration—bonus points for exacting revenge. Death Machine is the new Lethal type Scorestreak.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-multiplayer-ranked-changes">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Multiplayer Ranked Changes</h2>



<p>Lastly, Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap has revealed new changes and additions for Multiplayer Ranked Play. Players can take their competitiveness to the next level as the same settings, maps, modes, and weapon restrictions used by the Call of Duty League have been added to the game. Winning matches rewards players with SR (Skill Rating), and progressing through the ranks will reward players with Rank Skins and Win Challenge rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have added Retroactive SR Adjustments to reverse the impact of cheaters. When a Ranked Cheater is banned, any players that lost against them will be refunded their SR. Also, a new feature has been added that lets you rejoin Ranked Matches if they were disconnected. However, players need to rejoin within 5 minutes. Check out Ranked Play rewards and Weapon Blueprints <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-three-critical-launch-announcement#MULTIPLAYER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-the-first-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a space as crowded as the soulslike genre, it can be difficult to stand out, but after two hours with the uber-difficult Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, it seems the folks at Leenzee Games may be onto something. Taking place in a magical reimagining of dynastic China, you play a pirate warrior who has some serious moves, making use of intricate and deadly spells, an arsenal of weapons with potent movesets, and an upgrade tree that’s much more involved than your typical action-adventure game. This makes for an adventure where, more often than not, I felt like the scary badass the rest of the world should be afraid of, rather than the other way around. Of course, the upper limit on just how much I could make myself feel like an overpowered Dynasty Warriors character was my own skill level and understanding of Wuchang’s extremely complex systems, which I could only dive so deep with during my limited demo. But what I’ve seen so far has me quite optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main way Wuchang: Fallen Feathers seems to differentiate itself from its peers is that here, instead of a few basic sword moves, a handful of meager spells and abilities, and a tiny health bar, you’re given a pretty extensive toolkit of formidable tools to play with. Each weapon allows you to unleash unique flurries of attacks that send you soaring into the air, darting across the map, and performing insane feats of dexterity that are far beyond what’s possible in most soulslikes. It got to the point where I felt like the area boss stomping my enemies flat, rather than a scared, cautious adventurer facing incredible odds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That feeling of superiority might have something to do with how those abilities are acquired: by harvesting them from fallen enemies. That’s right! Every defeated foe is more than just a handful of upgrade materials. You actually get to learn their moves and put them to use against future opponents, eventually turning you into a deadly reflection of everyone you’ve bested in battle, and in my time with it I already began to feel like a power-stealing badass in short order. And this was just the opening areas of the adventure too – I can only imagine how wild things get later on when you’re squaring off against more powerful opponents and presumably unlocking even more insane abilities.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I can only imagine how wild things get later on when you’re squaring off against more powerful opponents and presumably unlocking even more insane abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t get me wrong: there were still plenty of instances where my eagerness or lack of awareness got me absolutely smashed to pieces, but I also felt like I had way more options for cutting the enemy down to size. For example, one move I was given while wielding a giant ax let me leap straight into the air to ludicrous anime-level heights, then smash down on my opponent, stomping them flat and leaving a minion-shaped impression in the earth. Another weapon, fast moving dual blades, gave me the ability to fire off a bunch of small, sticky explosives every time I dodged, which then exploded doing a small amount of damage, but more importantly, interrupting enemy movement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These abilities and weapon combos, combined with spells that let me do things like fire off a deadly disc of fire, allowed me to play much more aggressively than I’m accustomed to, and it’s clear there’s just a whole lot more to learn with Wuchang in general. I didn’t have nearly enough time to fully wrap my mind around the various skill trees, ability customization options that let me alter how my weapons functioned, and spellcasting system, but it’s clear this borrows quite a bit from RPGs and will need to be thought through if you want to max out your levels of badassery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That will be pretty helpful to do too, because of the two bosses I took on in Wuchang, one of them was extremely aggressive and equally beefed up with fancy movesets. It took me quite a few tries to learn her quick, convoluted attack patterns, and master the timing for parrying her attacks, especially in the second half of the fight when each swipe of her blade sent out massive gusts of wind that knocked my on my butt and did way more damage than I thought the wind was capable of. Eventually, though, I stood triumphant against her devilish tricks. Rather than a feeble goon hopelessly outmatched by an enemy clearly above my power level, Wuchang’s boss fights made me feel a lot more like a peer locked in a duel with strong weapons and destructive abilities to see who was more worthy of success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one part I didn’t get a completely strong read on, it’s Wuchang’s story, which centers on a disease spreading throughout the lands that drives people mad and makes them sprout feathers. I didn’t see enough to say whether or not this is likely to go the distance, but I will say I’ve lost count of the number of soulslikes in the past few years that have leaned on that incredibly tired trope. I get that having a disease that turns people into monsters offers a pretty easy reason to make everything in the world want to kill you, which is very helpful in this kind of game, but man am I ever tired of seeing it. I’d really like to see Wuchang break free from some of the story cliches in the same way it seems to be switching things up when it comes to combat style.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I get that having a disease that turns people into monsters offers a pretty easy reason to make everything in the world want to kill you, which is very helpful in this kind of game, but man am I ever tired of seeing it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also worth noting just how visually impressive Wuchang is, which is by no means the norm for the genre. Even if I was dying half a dozen times to the same boss or lost among a sea of disgusting, mutated enemies, I was at least able to content myself with how downright gorgeous everything looked, ruined and deeply troubling as the world was. That said, I did notice somewhat long load times after each humiliating defeat that respawned me back at a checkpoint, and I have to wonder how much of that hang time is owed to the world and characters looking so dang good. In fairness, there’s very little chance this thing’s been optimized enough to be representative of the final product, but since I was playing on a PC that seemed fairly powerful, it’s definitely something I’m going to want to keep an eye on as I check out future builds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With only a short exploration area and two boss fights to contend with, I only caught a small glimpse at Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, but I already feel pretty good about its chances at being more than just another soulslike to add to the ridiculously overflowing pile. The movesets are intricate and interesting, the RPG mechanics seem deep and offer a lot of freedom (even if I can’t claim to understand some of them fully), and the boss fights gave me a serious run for my money that’s rare these days. All that’s already got me pretty excited to play more.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, that's the Tomodachi Life community, who are celebrating all over social media in the wake of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-announced-for-nintendo-switch">announcement of Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream today</a> at the Nintendo Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seriously, I don't think I've seen gamers this happy in a long time. Across Twitter/X, Bluesky, Reddit, and other social platforms, Tomodachi Life lovers are having the time of their lives, and making the memes to prove it. Here's just a small sample of the many, many, MANY celebrations to make your day:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">TOMODACHI LIFE SEQUEL ARE YOU KIDDING ME <a href="https://t.co/Zj6wFyRfxo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Zj6wFyRfxo</a></p>— Wind Waker Switch 2 Daily (@WindWakerDaily) <a href="https://twitter.com/WindWakerDaily/status/1905267552869060671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I hope whoever made the Tomodachi Life summoning circle is living their best life right now <a href="https://t.co/9sCHgADL0o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/9sCHgADL0o</a></p>— sephi (@SephiGoat) <a href="https://twitter.com/SephiGoat/status/1905269369719914837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Even better are some of the Reddit threads posted <em>before</em> the Direct, suggesting it was foolish to hope for a new Tomodachi Life, and now filled with replies joyfully eating crow about it:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">it’s time <a href="https://t.co/fBlRKW31zG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/fBlRKW31zG</a> <a href="https://t.co/aD0lfOzl47" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aD0lfOzl47</a></p>— M1das (@M1das_OW2) <a href="https://twitter.com/M1das_OW2/status/1904940990718501256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations as well to this very, very specific Twitter account that's been keeping the fires burning for Tomodachi Life for years now:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">OH MY FUCKING GOD</p>— Number of days without Tomodachi Life 2 (@Tomodachi2count) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tomodachi2count/status/1905274570711478758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One segment of the community is especially excited by what they see as a tease of a long-awaited feature in Tomodachi Life: same-sex relationships. Way, way back in 2014, Nintendo issued a formal apology to fans of the game for not including same-sex relationships, saying that it was "not possible" to change the game's design so drastically after launch by implementing them in a patch. However, Nintendo also said, "We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream's trailer today, there was a brief encounter between two women that some fans are interpreting as a tease that Nintendo is about to fulfill its promise to fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>“We apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life. if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series…design a game-play experience …that is more inclusive…”</p><p>Then does that team these two are hinting at,,,y’know😳 <a href="https://t.co/FZP35A1ids" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FZP35A1ids</a></p></div>— Senpai (@_CSenpai_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_CSenpai_/status/1905271126202216575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">NINTENDO ARE THEY GAY????

We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long term growth and success. With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are committed to building a sharper, more focused organization-one where talented teams will take our brands to the next level, accelerate the growth of emerging franchises, and lead innovation in next generation technologies and services, all with the goal of delivering enriching, memorable games that exceed players' expectations, and create superior value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does the deal mean in reality? This new subsidiary includes the teams developing the Rainbow Six, Assassin’s Creed, and Far Cry franchises based in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia, as well as Ubisoft’s back-catalog and any new games currently under development or to be developed. So, it sounds like existing projects are safe, and there is no word yet on more layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The transaction is expected to complete by the end of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Developing...</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Ubisoft has launched a new subsidiary dedicated to its big three IPs - Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry - in a move CEO Yves Guillemot has called a "new chapter" for the publisher. Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> holds a minority stake in the new entity after investing €1.16bn.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's announcement follows several reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">a new venture was being considered using the company's assets.</a>. Earlier this month, Bloomberg claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">Ubisoft was mulling over the launch of a fresh business unit part-owned by outside companies</a>, noting such a tactic could potentially result in the new entity being valued higher than Ubisoft itself following years of falling share prices and a string of disappointing game launches.
</p>
<p>
In today's announcement, Ubisoft valued its new subsidiary at around €4bn. This, it wrote, "highlights the strong value of [its] IPs, significantly reinforces its balance sheet, and enables [it] to continue its efforts to become a more agile organisation, unleash the full creative potential of its teams and better align its resources with the constantly evolving expectations of players."

<p>
It also confirmed the business unit will be the new home of all Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry development teams based in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Additionally, the new subsidiary will control each series' "back-catalogue and any new games currently under development or to be developed."
</p>
<p>
"Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote in a statement accompanying the announcement. "As we accelerate the company's transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft's operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies."
</p>
<p>
As to what the new subsidiary will <em>do</em>, Guillemot says it'll focus on "transforming [Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry] into unique ecosystems". The announcement goes further, claiming the "greater investment and boosted creative capacities [will] drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features."
</p>
<p>
Away from the new subsidiary and its three big-name brands, Ubisoft says it'll concentrate on "nurturing the development of iconic franchises including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</a> and The Division, accelerating the growth of top performing titles and leveraging disruptive technologies on selected new IPs, while continuing to deliver state-of-the-art production game engines and online services." More details are set to be shared at a later day.
</p>
<p>
This seismic shake-up of Ubisoft's structure follows a tumultuous few years for the publisher - which recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">confirmed it was undertaking a strategic review to help it right-size the business</a>, amid tumbling share prices and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">number of high-profile flops</a>, including last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Ubisoft's failings have also significantly impacted staff - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">string of job cuts</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">studio closures</a> in recent times have seen its employee numbers shrink from over 20,279 people in 2022, to 18,666 in September 2024, with more redundancies having been made since then.
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how Ubisoft's newly announced subsidiary might improve its fortunes, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, at least, is off to a good start - it's already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-tops-2-million-players-surpassing-the-launches-of-origins-and-odyssey">attracted over two million players</a>, "surpassing the launches of [Assassin's Creed] Origins and Odyssey".

During this event, the UK-based tabletop studio announced new products coming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer The Old World</em></a>. Here is everything they announced.</p>

<h2>The AdeptiCon 2025 Preview Event Announcements</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/or72z0uw/every-reveal-from-the-warhammer-preview-show-at-adepticon-2025/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop assembled everything announced during the AdeptiCon 2025 preview event. Those announcements covered both major tentpole franchises and various spin-offs.</p>

Yes, the Space Wolves are getting new miniatures, a dedicated army box, and their own codex. These new miniatures include new Wolf Guard units and the Blood Claws.</p>

<p>For those that have rejected Imperium dogma, the preview included a new look at several Chaos Space Marine chapters. Like the Emperor's Children, the World Eaters, Death Guard, and Thousand Sons are getting their own dedicated codices. More blood for the Blood God.</p>

<p>On the gameplay side of things, the AdeptiCon 2025 Preview event highlighted a new Chapter Approved Mission Deck. This deck will change Matched Play by introducing three new ways to play: Incursion (1000 points), Strike Force (2,000 points) and the new Asymmetrical War mode. As the name implies, Asymmetrical War features uneven deployment zones and differing primary objectives.</p>

The Typhon box ramps up the battle on Volkus, where the Adeptus Mechanicus must fend off a swarm of Tyranids. Yes, playable Tyranids are coming to Kill Team. The box even includes Tyranid-themed terrain.</p>

<p>In the land of the Mortal Realms, the AdeptiCon 2025 Preview event confirmed a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-spearhead-mode-introduced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer Age of Sigmar Spearhead</a> set. The set, Spearhead: Sand and Bone, brings the smaller, more streamlined Spearhead rules to the dark lands of Dolorum and the chilling deserts of Ossia. The set includes new twists, Battle Tactics, Objectives, rules for four new Spearhead armies, and terrain fitting a Realm of Death.</p>

<p>Those new Spearhead armies are the Cities of Sigmar's Fusil-Platoon, the Serephon Sunblood Prowlers, the Ossiarch Bonereapers Mortisan Elite, and the Ogor Mawtribes Scrapglutt.</p>

First is the introduction of the Grand Cathay army for the forces of Order. This East Asia-coded army will be getting an arcane journal and battalion box with 50 miniatures. Those miniatures will include 30 Jade Warriors, 10 Jade Lancers, two different artillery units, and the battalion's leader: A Shugengan Lord astride their Great Spirit Longma mount.</p>

<p>The preview extends into the forests of the old world. On the side of chaos are the forest-dwelling, corruption-spreading Beastmen Brayherds. They will be receiving an arcane journal and battlion box of their own. Their units include ferocious shamans, chieftains, Tuskgor Chariots. Challenging them on the side of Order are the Wood Elf Realms wit their own battalion box respectively.</p>

<p>This preview is but a glimpse of announcements and developments coming to Games Workshop's franchises in the future. Release dates and price points for these announced products are all pending.</p>

Mixed in amongst <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630255/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-trailer">a trailer for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">the surprise reveal of a mobile news app</a>, the company also announced what it calls “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">virtual game cards</a>.” They’re billed as a lending system that makes it relatively straightforward to share digital games between devices. But really, they’re a tool that could make the transition to the Switch 2 later this year much easier.</p></div><p>As Nintendo explains it, these virtual cards work a lot like physical cartridges. You can “eject” a game from one device and then load it onto another, so long as the second Switch is tied to your account or a member of your family plan. Digital games “can also be lent to a Nintendo Account family group member’s system via local wireless connection,” and they’ll be able to play the game for two weeks before it’s automatically returned to you.</p><p>It’s an extremely Nintendo feature, in that it’s a playful attempt at bringing traditional physical game features into the digital realm, and that it also has some caveats, like the limited two week period, which is nowhere near enough time to make a dent in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. Still, it seems to be a step up from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/wiki/gamesharing/">the way sharing currently works</a>, where a secondary Switch can only play games if it’s connected to the internet to verify things, rendering it largely useless while traveling. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fvirtual-game-cards%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo specifies in the fine print</a> that “once a virtual game card is loaded to a system, not only can you play it without an internet connection, but other user accounts on the system can play, too.”</p><p>More interesting than the feature itself is the timing. It’ll be available as part of a system update for the Switch at some point in April. Also happening in April? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">The big Nintendo Direct where the company will reveal actual details of the Switch 2</a>, presumably including the price, release date, and line-up of launch games. Expectations are it won’t be much longer after that before the Switch 2 finally launches.</p><div><p>Sorting out the sharing features is good news for current Switch owners. But because it’s happening at the end of that console’s lifecycle, it’s pretty clear Nintendo means for this to be a hopefully painless way of moving to the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">The next console will be backward compatible with original Switch games</a>, and that library is incredibly important. Not only is it huge, but it’s filled with some of Nintendo’s most successful games ever, like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/21/15382628/mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch-best-features">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>.</p></div><p>And it’s a library that keeps growing: there are still major Switch 1 games in the works for this year, like <em>Metroid</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, while the just-announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/637362/to"><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></a> doesn’t even launch until 2026. In the press release announcing the virtual game cards, Nintendo made sure to note that they “will also work with Nintendo Switch 2 systems at launch.”</p><p>Nintendo has always had a complicated relationship with the internet and user accounts (see: Friend Codes). But the new virtual card system at least makes it clear that the company sees the importance of creating a more unified system for users to play things across devices. Because whenever the Switch 2 does launch later this year, there’s going to be a whole lot more people with multiple consoles in their homes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Employees Worried About Layoffs After Tencent Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal.1147008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Thursday afternoon, Ubisoft announced that it was forming a new subsidiary company with Tencent that will include the company’s three biggest franchises along with a number of studios. This has led to a number of employees within Ubisoft to become worried about mass layoffs happening in the coming months either before or after the deal with Tencent is completed.</p>



<p>Not long after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the deal was announced</a>, multiple current Ubisoft employees reached out to express feelings of uneasiness and concern about the future of the company. Specifically, those not working on Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal email acquired</a> by Insider Gaming, Ubisoft’s Marie-Sophie de Waubert said that she understands that there is uncertainty and questions surrounding what’s going to happen. She also tried to calm any worries about those not working on the three franchises.</p>



<p>“I also want to be clear: if you’re not currently working on these brands, it doesn’t mean your work matters any less,” she said. “This agreement will benefit all of Ubisoft, giving us the means to spark more innovation and creativity across the board. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, and you play a vital role in shaping it.”</p>



<p>Despite the messaging, however, some aren’t buying it.</p>



<p>“We feel [expletive] if we’re not on the big three,” one current Ubisoft employee said under the condition of anonymity. “They can say these things in an email, but when it comes down to it, we feel like we know where priorities are.”</p>



<p>Said another employee currently working on an unannounced project, “I want to think our team is okay right now, but we don’t know. You’d think they’d have at least some sort of clarity for us before publicly announcing the deal.”</p>



<p>The other messages received all relayed similar sentiments. There is some excitement and hope that a turnaround is coming for the company, but until questions about their status are answered, those in various areas of the company don’t want to get happy.</p>



<p>“We just want to know what’s going on,” one source said. “They promised transparency and regular communication with us, but we’ll see if that actually happens.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft regarding what the deal with Tencent means for its employees and the possibility of layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to the article.</p>



<p>Ubisoft anticipates the full deal to be completed before the end of 2025.</p>

<p>The product has evolved into something akin to Slack, but for personal use. It's used by artist communities, game developers, open source projects, influencers, and more to manage communities and coordinate work. In some cases, people simply use it as an extremely robust group messaging tool for groups of friends without any games or projects involved.</p>
<h2>Limited ads to tackle limited revenue</h2>
<p>For years, Discord proudly touted a "no ads" policy, but that dam has broken in some small ways in recent months. Discord began offering game publishers opportunities to create special "quests" that appear in the Discord interface, wherein players can earn in-game rewards for doing specific tasks, like streaming a game to friends. A new format, called video quests, is planned for this summer, too.</p>
<p>The new ad products are meant to drum up Discord's revenue potential in the lead-up to an IPO; the platform already offered premium subscriptions for access to more advanced features and a marketplace for cosmetics to jazz up profiles.</p>
<p>So far, the ad products are, by and large, much less intrusive than ads in many other social networks and seem to be oriented around providing some user value. However, an IPO could lead to shareholders demanding more from the company in pursuit of revenue.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us Part II</a> debuted in 2020, it did so after a few major plot points were spoiled online well in advance. Now, with the show set to adapt that story when The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on HBO in a few weeks, there's a risk a whole new audience will have their experience altered by the prevalence of spoilers online. But for showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, the latter of whom is now living through this predicament for a second time, spoilers aren't a huge concern.</p><p dir="ltr">"I feel like the best way I could respect the audience is by not thinking about them too much when I'm working on whatever I'm writing. That way I could just make the best decision with as little outside influence as possible, and make the best internal decisions for the characters, for the story, for the medium," Druckmann told GameSpot. "And you know, when it comes to like, what are we going to spoil or not spoil? You know, I fought tooth-and-nail when we made the game, and that all blew up in my face at the end, when we had those leaks that happened like months before the game came out. So I've learned to not put so much stock in that. But also, now I have a creative partner, HBO. I kind of follow their lead here as far as spoilers and what we should show and not show and just, you know, again, approach it as if we're doing it for the first time, assuming the audience doesn't know anything. They're not Googling what happened in the game or not."</p><p dir="ltr">Even with spoilers floating around for those who can't resist looking for them, the second season, like the first season, changes some details in order to ensure the team is "making the best choices for this moment in time," as a TV audience has different needs than a video game player.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1584" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466722"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on April 13 on HBO and Max.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4466722-bella-ramsey.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"But also, again, my approach with the show is, I assume you know nothing," he continued. "I assume you haven't played the game. I guess there's some assumption you've watched the first season, but even that, we're not 100% sure, so HBO created this beautiful recap of Season 1."</p><p dir="ltr">I asked the pair if the production team created any content meant as spoiler disinformation, like when creators for Lost or Game of Thrones would film scenes they had no plans to use just to fill the spoiler forums with disorienting noise--a practice that horrifies Mazin.</p><p dir="ltr">"The thing is, it's really hard to make the show. We use every second of every day to make the stuff we want to make," he said. "The thought of spending time shooting stuff we don't want to make is sort of a horrifying prospect to me. And I think Neil's right. The thing about spoiler stuff is it's kind of overrated; the impact that it has is overrated. And you can look at that just empirically with The Last of Us Part II, which had the leaks. There was all this spoiler outrage, and then the games sold gazillions of copies and won every award you can win, and it was beautiful. It didn't matter the spoiler. Like, I always use the example of Titanic, although, honestly, I could use Chernobyl, too. 'Hey, here's a spoiler. It blew up, right?' [The] Titanic sinks, and we all still went to the theater to watch it because we don't care about that. We care about the relationships."</p><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Season 2 premieres on HBO and Max beginning on April 13 and will run for seven episodes on a weekly release schedule. The season won't cover all of The Last of Us Part II's story, and a third season is planned, though not yet officially announced.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch - Virtual Game Card Update Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The capitalization of "Edition" in that phrase is what's interesting--while Nintendo has mentioned that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backward-compatible</a> with select Switch 1 games, the company hasn't elaborated further on how that will work. This new phrase, and the way it's presented on this official Nintendo website, implies that it is an official term to distinguish between Switch 2-only games and Switch 2 versions of other games. Switch 2 Edition games could refer to enhanced versions of Switch games, though whether such a thing will exist or if there will be any upgrade cost remains unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been multiple rumors of games that have previously launched on the current Nintendo Switch receiving some sort of enhancement on the upcoming successor. The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been mentioned among the likely candidates, while the recent Xenoblade Chronicles X remaster was found to be hiding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-editions-hidden-mode-could-hint-at-switch-2-feature/1100-6530249/">secret 60 frames-per-second mode</a> within its code.</p><p dir="ltr">Virtual Game Cards were one of many announcements during the most recent Nintendo Direct, which also included the debut announcements of new games in Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rhythm-heaven-is-coming-to-switch-but-not-until-2026/1100-6530421/">Rhythm Heaven</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-coming-to-nintendo-switch-in-2026/1100-6530426/">Tomodachi Life</a> franchises. The Direct also provided updates on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-slick-new-suit/1100-6530408/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-reveals-its-big-twist-on-gameplay/1100-6530425/">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not directly mentioned "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" games as of this writing, but that may change during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Direct livestream slated for April 2 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p>

While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> didn't have the massive scope of the dev's other titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or the most recent </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the game's director did have one particular vision for the game's storytelling that required a significant amount of convincing to get the team on board—and that was with how the fonts would look in-game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During GDC 2025, game director Joshua Sawyer (previously helming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of Eternity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) spoke about his work conceptualizing and building </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s approach to text-based storytelling and how the game's fonts needed more than static characters in speech bubbles to authentically depict an evolving game world with different cultures via a "typographic voice."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rats, horse testicles, and fonts—OR: How to go the extra mile with your game">Rats, horse testicles, and fonts—OR: How to go the extra mile with your game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Sawyer's panel, titled "Justifying Absurd Expenditures on Fonts and Other Silly Features," he broke down some common struggles developers tend to fall into when trying to deliver a product. In many cases, developers tend to provide a game that is seen as a "minimum viable product," especially at first. which is a game with baseline features and nothing particularly noteworthy. Another approach is to elevate the concept go for the "maximum viable product."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-your-next-game-needs-a-babygirl" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why your next game needs a babygirl</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some examples he included were </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Plague Tale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s dynamic, fully animated rat swarms, which appear like a living mass to players. In another example, Sawyer brought up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s infamous horse testicles, which shrink when riding in cold climates. As Sawyer put it, adding these features—which aren't always vital for a game—do a lot to elevate the experience into something more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What about the maximum viable product? It's way more than what's needed, you got every bell and whistle—you're inventing bells and whistles, and you're trying to elevate the experience through a type of unique maximalism that hasn't been seen [in a game]," said Sawyer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the above, Sawyer explained his vision for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a 16th-century European detective game where players must read and analyze intent and meaning from character interactions to make critical choices. Inspired by games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>80 Days</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Night in the Woods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s unique approach to storytelling highlights its dynamic text presentation, featuring animated medieval-era typography that's unique for each interaction and NPC. This gives </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a feeling that you're looking into a living medieval-era painting or illustrated tome that's being created as you go—which Sawyer stated was to depict the "physicality of writing in books."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/uc-santa-cruz-professor-roleplays-gig-economy-publisher-negotiation-and-layoffs-with-game-design-students" target="_self" data-discover="true">UC Santa Cruz professor roleplays gig economy, publisher negotiation, and layoffs with game design students</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Depending on your choices and the protagonist Andreas's growth, the game's approach to text will evolve and shift over the course of the game. As the game director described it, being passionate about a feature is the first step of getting your concept off the ground, but the following steps include getting your team on board with the idea and then bringing it to life in a compelling way—which present unique challenges all their own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of many problems is that there were [letter] character set issues, so these might have supported the languages they originally came from," said Sawyer. "For example, many of the [characters] came from German or Swiss sources; while they might have been clear, they didn't have the characters that might be needed in Polish or Spanish or French or anything else. So that was tricky. Also, if they looked authentic [to the era], they were often quite difficult to read. Yes, we wanted them to look authentic, but the difficult-to-read part is not good for a game full of text."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What's in a font?">What's in a font?</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Achieving 'creative sobriety' in game design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sawyer described </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as "not a small game, but not an 'indie' game"—given that it had support from Microsoft Game Studios. With over three years in development and a team of 13 by the end of production, it was a modestly sized game, but Sawyer's ideas for using dynamic typography for its storytelling presented a wrinkle that took time to work out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What sets </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> apart from other reading-dense RPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pillars of the Earth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is how it makes the act of reading—and viewing the text—a part of the experience. You essentially become a medieval-era detective. This was a part of the core vision of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, in that 16th century Bavaria was a melting pot of different cultures and social classes, and protagonist Andreas must be able to navigate a diverse society with unique characters who have different philosophies and worldviews, all reflected in the font-style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To build out the whole suite of custom typography, the developers contacted Lettermatic founder Riley Cran. Working with Cran's company, they designed the game's six custom fonts—Peasant, Cursive, Humanist, Printed, Textura, and Thread Puller. Creating each font—aiming for authenticity rather than total accuracy— allowed the developers greater control over the text, at the cost of being time-consuming. Sawyer recommended that devs try to create their fonts to own it, but only if they have the resources and means to do so.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The control you have with the fonts is unparalleled, it's fantastic," he said. "You can get exactly what you need; you can get support for any localization you want, and it's your font. You don't have to worry about ongoing licensing issues and all that sort of nonsense. We eventually released our fonts for basically free to the public, and they use it for making shit posts and memes, which is the highest point of it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another vital resource that Obsidian Entertainment relied on was the accessibility teams at Microsoft, who helped hone the visual presentation of the text for readers of all kinds and text related to specific cultures. Sawyer cited some instances where the game touched on specific topics, and Microsoft sensitivity readers offered feedback to help refine it further.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One method that Sawyer suggested to elevate the look of the text and give it a dynamic feel was the stroke-by-stroke illustration of letters in real-time, which he noted wasn't exactly met with enthusiasm from the team. "So when I brought up stroke-by-stroke rendering to the team, it wasn't that people hated the idea, but there was skepticism about it," said Sawyer. Eventually, the engineering team—opting out of his initial pitch of using different alpha channels to similar motion—used his concept and built it with Adobe Illustrator, applying gradients and animation to recreate real-time illustrative pen strokes on parchment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sell your vision">Sell your vision</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sawyer concluded the talk by giving attendees tips on how to best present their concepts to their teams. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the dynamic text and fonts showcased a level of authenticity for the game's setting and concept of playing within a living book—something that Sawyer admitted took effort to get right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is not enough for you alone to believe in this mission—the team does have to believe in this vision as well," said Sawyer. "The vision also has to include a plan, which will make people feel somewhat more confident in the idea that you are giving them. If you succeed with the core features, people will be more confident and happier about the idea of doing other things related to it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to go the extra mile was worth it as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is widely regarded as one of Obsidian Entertainment's best games. All it took to help the game reach its success and elevate its concept was coming up with an idea that seemed far-fetched, but ultimately worth the effort.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.
