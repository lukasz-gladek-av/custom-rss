                <p>If you're in the market for new board games, Humble has you covered with its latest bundle. The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fboard-game-night-with-dire-wolf-digital-friends&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-board-game-night-dune-imperium-wingspan-scythe%2F1100-6525612%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Board Game Night With Dire Wolf &amp; Friends</a> bundle offers as many as nine digital board games and two add-ons for $18. Among the games on offer are Dune: Imperium, Wingspan, Terraforming Mars, and Scythe, all of which are playable on Steam. </p><h2>Humble Bundle: Board Game Night With Dire Wolf &amp; Friends</h2><ul><li>Dune: Imperium</li><li>Scythe: Digital Edition</li><li>Wingspan</li><li>Quilts and Cats of Calico</li><li>Terraforming Mars</li><li>Terraforming Mars: Prelude DLC</li><li>Terraforming Mars: Hellas and Elysium DLC</li><li>Everdell</li><li>Munchkin Digital</li><li>Root</li><li>Sagrada</li><li>50% off coupon for Root: The Riverfolk expansion</li><li>50% off coupon for Munchkin Digital: The Unnatural Axe expansion</li></ul><p>Like other Humble Bundles, the Board Game Night bundle comes with multiple tiers, so you can still get some great games even if you don't want to pay the full price. At the lowest tier, you'll pay $7 for Sagrada, Scythe: Digital Edition, and Root, along with a coupon to nab Root's Riverfolk expansion. Paying $10 adds Wingspan and Munchkin to the deal, as well as a coupon for Munchkin's The Unnatural Axe expansion. For $15, the bundle adds Terraforming Mars and its DLC, as well as Everdell. Finally, the $18 tier tosses in Quilts and Cats of Calico and Dune: Imperium.</p><p>Humble Bundles also always pair with a charity, with a portion of the proceeds for the Board Game Night bundle going to the <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Worldwide Wildlife Fund</a>. You can choose how much you contribute to the charity, or opt to pay more than the top tier cost to increase your donation.</p><p>In Dune: Imperium, you'll use a combination of deck-building, worker placement, and strategy to try to take control of the Spice flow in Arrakis. Dune: Imperium exited early access in March, so it's still a fairly new release that regularly sells for its full $23 list price. Steam is currently selling it for an all-time low of $16, just two bucks less than the full board game Humble Bundle. Dune: Imperium bundled with eight other digital board games and more content for $18 total is quite the deal.

Wingspan won numerous awards when it first released as a physical board game in 2019, but the digital edition is superb, too. If you're interested in the physical board game, Wingspan is available at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FWingspan-Strategy-Board-Game-with-Swift-Start-Pack%2F485178793%3Fathbdg%3DL1200%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-board-game-night-dune-imperium-wingspan-scythe%2F1100-6525612%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fstonemaier-wingspan-with-swift-start-game-pack%2F-%2FA-82006492&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-board-game-night-dune-imperium-wingspan-scythe%2F1100-6525612%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>.</p><p>Another standout is Scythe, which imagines an alternate history following World War I that's dominated by mechs as factions compete to try to take over a war-torn Europe. Scythe is pricey in physical format (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stonemaier-Games-STM600-Scythe-Board/dp/B01IPUGYK6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$80 for the base game</a>), so it's nice to see the digital version in such a budget-friendly package.</p><p>Humble has a bunch of other notable bundles you'll want to check out while you're stocking up for board game shenanigans.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/oxygen-esports-boston-breach-shutdown/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Recent reports have surfaced online pointing to a total breakdown at Oxygen Esports, the Kraft Sports-backed organisation that fields teams in a range of titles, including Call of Duty, Apex Legends, and VALORANT. It’s the parent company to the Call of Duty League’s Boston Breach, which this season put up one of the worst performances we’ve seen in the history of COD esports.</p>



<p>Lots of details are up in the air at present, but according to sources, Oxygen is laying off all staff and shutting down operations – this should, by association, also pull down Boston Breach, which is due to compete at the Esports World Cup in just a few days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-biting-the-dust">Biting the Dust</h2>



<p>Oxygen Esports was never particularly successful as an organisation – especially of late – but this is a crushing and sudden blow for the industry. It was a few days ago that the Rocket League scene was hit by a sudden cancellation of the Shift Summer League Playoffs mere minutes before they were supposed to take place – the root cause of this has now been revealed as Oxygen’s impending shutdown.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/esports/sources-oxygen-esports-to-cease-operations-and-lays-off-all-staff-2854984/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Dexerto</a>, it was confirmed by Boston Breach’s players that they’ve been ‘kicked out’ of the training facility operated by Kraft Sports at Patriot Place. They’ll still fly to Riyadh to compete in the Esports World Cup, but after that, the future is uncertain.</p>



<p>It’s anticipated that shareholders and senior staff will confirm the future of the brand by the end of the week, one way or another. Stay tuned to catch all the comments as they’re delivered. In the meantime, we’ve reached out to Oxygen Esports to see if we can expedite this information.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-players-profile-wipe-compensation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-players-are-compensated-for-%E2%80%98profile-wipe%E2%80%99-error-but-it%E2%80%99s-still-no-good.947625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-players-profile-wipe-compensation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed that only a portion of players were impacted by the recent ‘profile reset’ malfunction. Those who were hit by the ‘accidental wipe’ have been compensated in-game with a substantial amount of money and boosts to their skills, but ultimately, they’re still without the progress they’ve accrued over the last six months, which for some equals hundreds of hours of play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-wipe">Just Wipe</h2>



<p>Here’s what Battlestate Games handed down instead of an apology for this devastating malfunction:</p>



<ul>
<li>100 million Roubles</li>



<li>50,000 USD</li>



<li>50,000 EUR</li>



<li>All Labs keycards</li>



<li>4 x Money Case</li>



<li>DSPT</li>



<li>Reserve Marked Keys</li>



<li>All skills LL45</li>



<li>All Traders maxed</li>
</ul>



<p>Even the compensation is now causing issues, as some players were wiped with a low-level, low-tier account and have now been granted an utter bounty in-game. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The in-game compensation has been sent to all the players whose in-game profiles have been lost due to technical malfuction.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EscapefromTarkov</a></p>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1821290746852601926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Regardless of it being merely a week or two from ‘wipe’, it’s a huge imbalance that is having an impact on the game even now. The in-game trading system is in tatters as everything has become monumentally expensive.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how many players were impacted, as Battlestate Games hasn’t been transparent about the issue – nor did the company apologise for the loss. Ironically, many players have expressed their dismay at <strong>the compensation</strong>, stressing that they’d rather have had their account wiped if <strong>this </strong>is the reward for having that happen.</p>

As much as 80 percent of all students are rumored to worship a being known as Arfoire, and the authorities have chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat. Basically, Gamindustri is pretty messed up, you guys. Ahem. Thus did Gamindustri fall into complete and utter disarray.</p><p>Will the Goddesses be able to reclaim their world from ASIC’s grasp, or will they be forced to wander the Gamindustri Graveyard, forever lost?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four or More for War!</strong> – Have up to four characters on the battlefield, and four more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!</li><li><strong>Stella Goes Rogue!</strong> – Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this realtime mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you – you just sit back and eat pudding! Be careful though, because if she dies in the dungeon, she’ll lose all her special gear!</li><li><strong>The World’s Your Oyster!</strong> – Customize the Gamindustri experience with Plans, which allow you to do things like increase/decrease enemy difficulty, change the items you’ll receive from a dungeon, and more!</li><li><strong>Build-a-Sword!</strong> – Use Idea Chips and Blank Discs to create custom equipment that can open up new worlds of skills for you!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia: Re;Birth3: V Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>It’s time to Nep-Nep like it’s 1989. Neptune’s been sucked into an alternate dimension of Gamindustri! In order for her to escape from this late ’80s world, Neptune will have to collect enough shares to open up the path to her own dimension. Sounds easy enough—except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs (also known as Goddesses), including Neptune!</p><p>Forging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the ’80s forever?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>+1 to Combos!</strong> – Customize attack combinations with up to five moves, opening a whole new array of ways to defeat your enemies!</li><li><strong>Bring a Dungeon Buddy!</strong> – The real-time mini-game Stella’s Dungeon is back, and this time she can bring friends!

One evening, as rain falls outside, a group of men burst in, killing Yushin before Yui’s eyes. With nothing but his soul remaining, Yushin must fight tooth and nail, possessing any body he can on the quest to find his sister and uncover the truth behind her disappearance. With only seven days left before his soul fades away, can he save her in time? Transport yourself to feudal Japan in the last years of the Edo period, and experience a tale of rain and reincarnation, brought to life with striking new 2D visuals.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Soul-Shifting Showdowns</strong> – Lacking a physical form, you’ll need to shift your soul to other bodies on the quest to find your sister. Possession puts you in complete control of whoever and whatever you inhabit, giving you access to a variety of weapons and fighting styles.

Who will you speak to? How will you intervene? The decisions, and the outcomes, are all up to you.</li><li><strong>Inclement Intrigue</strong> – This human drama plays out against the rain-soaked backdrop of mid 19th century Japan, rendered in an evocative pixel style. In the somber world of <em>AMEDAMA</em>, beauty and darkness are two sides of the same coin.</li></ul><p>Aihama, Japan. The final years of the Edo period. One rain-drenched evening, a group of men burst into the town’s brother and sister-run umbrella shop. Yushin is cut down in front of his sister Yui, leaving her alone in the world. The next thing he knows, he is looking down at his own stricken corpse—a soul without a body. The grim incident shatters the peace in this quiet backwater. Lurking beneath the surface is an intricate, deep-rooted plot, shrouded in mystery. Until Yui is safe, not even death is enough to extinguish Yushin’s soul. He’ll stop at nothing on his quest, shifting from body to body, possessing anyone and anything to rescue his sister. But with just seven days before his soul departs this world—can he save Yui in time?</p><p>This is a tale of rain, reincarnation, and revenge.</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Development / Marketing:</strong> IzanagiGames</li><li><strong>Planning:</strong> Acquire</li><li><strong>Character Design:</strong> lack (<em><a title="Series > Fate [64 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/Grand Order</em>, <em>Touken Ranbu</em>)</li><li><strong>Soundtrack:</strong> Yuko Komiyama (<em><a title="Series > Monster Hunter [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> series)</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Science says no, even if you're planning to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Omnibus-Peter-J-Tomasi/dp/1779529503?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this gigantic 1,648-page hardcover collection</a> of comic book stories based on Rocksteady's brilliant Arkham trilogy. Now available to preorder for $150 and scheduled to arrive on September 24, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Omnibus-Peter-J-Tomasi/dp/1779529503?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Batman: The Arkham Saga is an essential companion piece</a> for anyone who's a fan of the Arkham games developed by Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Montreal. And the new omnibus edition compiles the whole saga in one volume that may or may not require Batman levels of strength to carry around.</p><p>If the price sounds high, just tell yourself it only costs 11 cents per page, which is a pretty great deal. Joking aside, the omnibus could realistically be split into five volumes (at least) at $30 each, which sounds very reasonable. Also, Amazon frequently discounts books before launch, and you won't be charged for your preorder until it ships. If Amazon drops the price before then, which is a common occurrence for big comic book omnibuses, you will pay the lowest price offered since placing your order.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346044-batman-arkham-saga.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346044" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346044-batman-arkham-saga.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346044"></a><figcaption>Batman: The Arkham Saga Omnibus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346044-batman-arkham-saga.jpg"></figure><p>With Batman: Arkham Asylum a smash-hit after it was released in 2009, DC Comics didn't waste any time creating extra content for fans to dig into. This omnibus collects all of the Arkham comic book backstories, from the Dark Knight's first years on the streets in Batman: Arkham Origins to the dark and deadly stories of Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis and everything in between. The full list for this collection includes:</p><ul><li>Batman: Arkham Asylum: The Road to Arkham</li><li>Batman: Arkham City #1-5</li><li>Batman: Arkham City: End Game #1</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight #1-12</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight Annual #1</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight: Batgirl &amp; Harley Quinn #1</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis #1-6</li><li>Batman: Arkham Knight: Robin Special #1</li><li>Batman: Arkham Origins Special</li><li>Batman: Arkham Unhinged</li></ul><p>These are all great mini-series and one-shots featuring several of DC's best creators at the helm, and Batman: Arkham Unhinged is notable for being a digital-first series that has been added to this collection. While it was later reprinted in traditional comic book form, it is nice to have it included with the other series in this omnibus. Another cool thing about this hardcover is that the Arkham City series was illustrated by Carlos D'Anda, who worked with Rocksteady to create several unique redesigns for Batman and his rogues gallery in the Arkham games.</p><p>It's worth checking out how these games came together, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Rocksteady%C2%92s-Batman-Arkham-Asylum/dp/141971385X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and there is a superb book detailing all this work</a>, although it is pricey because it's out of print.

If you're up for a replay, you can unlock some superb concept art, character models, and more with these games.</p><p>Batman: The Arkham Saga isn't the only upcoming 2024 omnibus or graphic novel featuring the Caped Crusader and his Gotham City foes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-discovery-wants-to-license-franchises-batman-harry-potter-studios<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">AAA Game of Thrones games when?</h2></div><section><p>Batman. Justice League. Harry Potter. Looney Tunes. Game of Thrones. The list of intellectual property owned by Warner Bros. Discovery is massive, and an awful lot of it seems ripe for being turned into a video game. If you're thinking WB's been a little slow to leverage that library, it sounds like the company's leadership agrees, and is looking not just to make more of its own games, but to license out some of its biggest franchises to other game studios in the future.</p><p>Today on the Warner Bros. Discovery Q2 earnings, call CEO David Zaslav and president of global streaming and games JB Perrette responded to a question about the "strategic value" of games to Warner Bros. given recent "uneven performance". The company had just reported gaming revenue down 41% year-over-year due to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">underperformance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> compared to Hogwarts Legacy's massive success last year. Does WB see games as a core part of its portfolio?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Seems like the answer is yes. Both Zaslav and Perrette explained that they wanted to grow the gaming business, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-games-says-it-plans-to-double-down-on-live-service-despite-suicide-squad-failing-to-meet-expectations">especially in the free-to-play space</a>, which Perrette says can help balance out some of the ups-and-downs of the cyclical console industry. That's part of why WB acquired Player First Games, developer of Multiversus, earlier this year.</p><p>Zaslav followed up by noting that not only did WB want to keep leveraging its eleven studios, but that there's "also a lot of interest among others in coming to take advantage of some of that IP for gaming, which we're looking at."</p><p>Here's both of their answers in full below:</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery reported revenue of $9.7 billion for the quarter, but an overall net loss of $10 billion, $9.1 billion of which was due to impairment charges. The company also reported subscription services were up 3.6 million subscribers from last quarter, bringing its total to 103.3 million. </p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Oculus Studios had previously acquired Ready at Dawn, which had found success with the Lone Echo series, to develop VR games for its platforms.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brutal to hear about the closure of Ready at Dawn. Here’s a documentary I made about the studio while at Game Informer. Woof, double-whammy of sadness this week. <a href="https://t.co/Nd9NU5vqkH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Nd9NU5vqkH</a></p>— Ben Hanson (@yozetty) <a href="https://twitter.com/yozetty/status/1821277472404750675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"As many have already heard, this morning Ready At Dawn Studios is closing its doors. I've been at RAD for over 10 years and I am incredibly sad to see this wonderful team I've grown to love be broken apart this way," designer director Robert Duncan wrote. "That said, at least for now I'm trying to focus my effort on (and, let's be honest, distract myself by) finding solid places for all my dear friends to land. If anyone has any leads/positions they'd like to share, please feel free to reach out to me directly and I'll try my best to get you in touch with good folks that might be interested."</p><p>The games industry mourned the closure on social media and elsewhere, with many describing it as underappreciated. MinnMax founder Ben Hanson posted a documentary he produced with Game Informer that provides a snapshot of the studio circa 2014, when it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_OcS4gAGw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preparing to release The Order: 1886</a>.</p><p>Ready at Dawn's history extends all the way back to 2003, when it was formed by former employees of Naughty Dog and Blizzard Entertainment. It was particularly well-known for its prowess on the PlayStation Portable, producing multiple God of War games for the platform. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Following the mixed reception of The Order: 1886, Ready at Dawn began to move into VR, releasing Lone Echo for the Oculus Rift in 2017. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/01/lone-echo-review">We wrote at the time</a>, "Lone Echo and Echo Arena are the rare games that demonstrate the true value of VR and hand tracking. Its sense of movement feels great, and it couldn’t exist in any other way."</p><p>After it was purchased by Oculus Studios in 2021, Ready at Dawn released Lone Echo II, but otherwise has not put out a game since. A report in mid-July stated that Meta was reportedly cutting its Reality Labs division's budget by 20 percent in 2026 in order to make a "better long-term impact" in VR development. Meta subsequently told Android Central that this isn't a signal "wider cuts" to the number of first-party games on Quest.</p><p>Ready at Dawn is one many game studios to close in 2024, joining Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin, Roll7, and more in what has been a difficult year for games.

            <p>
Eli Roth's Borderlands movie is nearly here, and early impressions are starting to trickle in - and, well, they're not <em>great</em>. Critics have taken to social media to brand the live-action film adaptation of Gearbox's looter-shooter everything from a "huge misfire" to a "disaster".

<p>
The Borderlands movie has, of course, been in the works for some time now. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-in-the-works">initially announced</a> back in 2015 before utterly vanishing in a puff of elongated silence. Then, just as it looked like the project was dead and buried, Gearbox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hostel-director-eli-roth-is-helming-the-borderlands-movie">re-announced it</a> in February 2020, this time with Hostel director Eli Roth at the helm.
</p>
<p>
Since then, the high-profile likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cate-blanchett-cast-in-eli-roths-borderlands-movie-adaptation">Cate Blanchett</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-signs-up-jamie-lee-curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>, Gina Gershiwn, Kevin Hart, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">Jack Black</a> have all (rather mystifyingly) signed onto the project, giving fans at least some hope it wouldn't entirely suck. Unfortunately, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icnysn53neU">recent trailers</a> haven't inspired much additional confidence.
</p>
<p>
And now, following press screenings and the lifting of social media embargoes, critics are starting to have their say. "Borderlands is a disaster," opined <a href="https://x.com/AdriCaporusso/status/1821041077018882518">Bitesize Breakdown writer Adriano Caporusso</a>. "Filled with every cliché you can ponder, this film swaps the mayhem and imagination of the games for a lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud with annoying characters and a cast with not one ounce of chemistry."

<p>
Granted, "lifeless, unfunny...with annoying characters" sounds pretty much on-the-money for Gearbox's series post-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a>, but probably not what you want in a movie. "It's really bad," <a href="https://x.com/SmatthewAF/status/1821056580751913225">wrote Awesome Friday critic Matthew Simpson</a> on social media. "I really wanted to like it, but an uninspired plot + several phoned in performances + being stuck in a weird place where it looks both expensive and cheap at the same time make it a huge misfire." He did, however, have good things to say about Jack Black's performance, calling it "great".
</p>
<p>
Darren Movie Reviews was similiarly positive about the rest of the movie's cast, also calling its stars "great" - despite a "rushed and dull screenplay", "underdeveloped" characters, and "flat" jokes. "Not bad," they concluded, "but utterly forgettable.
</p>
<p>
It goes on, of course; Loud and Clear Reviews writer Edgar Ortega <a href="https://x.com/edgorteg/status/1821068763921576391">likened Borderlands</a> to a movie "an out of touch executive thinks the 'cool kids' find appealing". He slammed its "obnoxious quips that feel dated as soon as they leave the actors' mouths", before declaring it, "Not even so bad it's good, just a complete mess."
</p>
<p>
Freelance critic Sean Patrick Kelly did at least <a href="https://x.com/SKonMovies/status/1821041076167377236">praise</a> the movie's "exceptional level of detail for those who have played the video games", before adding, "I don't know if that's enough to stop people from accusing it of being a Guardians of the Galaxy rip-off."
</p>
<p>
Full reviews from major publications will presumably start appearing over the next few days, but if you're willing to take a chance on the whole thing regardless of critical opinion, the Borderlands movie arrives in cinemas this Friday, 9th August.

The revival marks the 10th anniversary of Nolan’s ninth movie and will include 70mm IMAX showings.</p><p><em>Interstellar </em>tracks astronauts on a mission to find a new habitable planet for Earth’s remaining residents to flee to. It’s a movie about the destruction of the planet and the power of love, and one of Nolan’s more emotional and human projects. It’s the only time he’s worked with McConaughey, and the actor gave one of his best  performances in it at the peak of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-mcconaissance&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-mcconaissance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the McConaissance</a></span> (<em>Dallas Buyer’s Club</em> was a year earlier). </p><p>So why the delay?  “The theatrical release date was pushed to align with the home entertainment relaunch,” <em>Variety</em> reports. I have no idea what that really means since <em>Interstellar</em> is already available at home, but the publication says Paramount disputes recent rumors that the shift was due to lost or destroyed copies of the original 70mm reels. </p><p>Instead, Paramount says it has plenty of archived copies of the movie, but that some film reels experience wear and tear from standard use. The company adds that it’s normal for them to become unusable after their original theatrical runs. I guess Paramount just didn’t want to get clobbered by <em>Transformers One</em> at the box office that month. </p><p>Whatever the case, it’ll be worth it to wait a few extra months so fans can once again witness <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lcGnMhvsA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lcGnMhvsA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the coolest space sequences in film</a></span> on the big screen.

Namely, players were earning millions of XP in seconds. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1elthyx/i_just_leveld_from_29_to_63_in_one_second/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1elthyx/i_just_leveld_from_29_to_63_in_one_second/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One video on Reddit showed a player killing a stronghold boss</a></span> and jumping from level 29 to level 63 in one second. Wowza! At first, nobody was sure exactly why this was happening, with some theorizing it was a bug involving the rogue class and how it interacted with the new dagger. But Blizzard has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/the-umbracrux-unique-power-temporarily-disabled-in-diablo-4-season-5-345712&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/the-umbracrux-unique-power-temporarily-disabled-in-diablo-4-season-5-345712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">since stepped in and offered an explanation</a></span> and a temporary solution.</p><p>On August 7, <em>Diablo </em>global community development director Adam Fletcher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/temporarily-disabling-the-umbracrux-unique-power/180525&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/temporarily-disabling-the-umbracrux-unique-power/180525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">provided an answer on Blizzard’s official forums</a></span>. </p><p>“The team was made aware of an issue where players were able to obtain a significant amount of experience while killing certain bosses with ‘The Umbracrux’ Unique equipped,” posted Fletcher. “We will be disabling the unique power for this weapon while we work on a fix for this.” </p><p>Fletcher further explained that players will no longer be able to spawn shade totems using the dagger, which is its unique power and likely the thing breaking in some wild way to cause these XP explosions for some players. The community director did say players will still be able to find this weapon via loot drops, and technically they can still equip and use it, too. But its unique ability is currently disabled for all. </p><p>“Once we have a finalized fix, we will re-enable this and communicate this out to players,” said Fletcher. “Thanks for all the reports on this issue. We hope to have a final fix for this soon.”</p><p>Sadly for those looking to power level using this trick, that won’t be possible.

Discovery reported today that its game revenue suffered a major drop this quarter from the same period last year, largely due to weak performance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p><p>Games revenue, under the WB Games division, dropped 41% year-over-year. Though Suicide Squad's struggles were the main culprit, it was admittedly up against stiff competition: last year's comparable included strong sales of Hogwarts Legacy, which launched in February of 2023 and continued to do exceedingly well throughout the year that followed. It <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-copies-in-2023-warner-bros-teases-more-harry-potter-games">sold 22 million copies in 2023 alone</a>, and has since reached 24 million.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Suicide Squad, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">panned by critics</a> and called "disappointing" by WB Discovery boss David Zaslav last quarter, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">resulted in a $200 million impairment charge in that report</a>. An impairment charge is a practice businesses use when they need to write off or report a reduction in the value of some of their assets that they previously thought would have a higher value.</p><p>Speaking of impairment charges, Warner Bros. Discovery undertook a massive one this quarter outside of games. The company reported revenue of $9.7 billion, but an overall net loss of $10 billion, $9.1 billion of which was due to impairment charges. Officially, WB cited the charge as due to "the difference between market capitalization and book value, continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market, and uncertainty related to affiliate and sports rights renewals, including the NBA."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Best Video Games of 2024 So Far</h3></div></output><p>The first part, about book value, is WB reevaluating the value of its TV networks segment in light of customers and advertiser interest in streaming and digital content over traditional TV. But the NBA bit was likely responsible for a hefty sum of the impairment charge too. WB's contract for NBA media rights expires after the 2024-2025 season, and the NBA appears to have <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/warner-bros-discovery-nba-amazon-basketball-1236017771/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opted to take its business to Amazon instead</a>. Though WB has since attempted to exercise what it says are its rights to match Amazon's offer and is suing the NBA over them, it doesn't seem likely to win.</p><p>While all that sounds fairly dismal, WB's subscription services were up 3.6 million from last quarter, bringing its total to 103.3 million. This is the first time the company has passed 100 million subscribers.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-has-a-lot-to-like-and-a-little-to-worry-about<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Feel the need for giant-robot speed.</h2></div><section><p>Jumping headfirst into Mecha BREAK’s chaotic, frenzied combat is overwhelming at first. That’s partially because its presentation is dizzyingly stylish, with flashing neon beams and blisteringly fast mecha screaming through the sky as you and your teammates do your best to capture a king-of-the-hill-like objective or push a payload. The chaos amps up the energy and tension of each skirmish, and certain bots (like my favorite: the Falcon) have additional abilities to help kick up the speed of a match even further. Mecha Break showed lots of promise during my last hands-on preview in January, and now, after a few more hours of hands-on time with the multiplayer mech shooter in its open beta, I’ve had the opportunity to experiment with more of Mecha BREAK’s arsenal of mecha, as well as get a better feel for its modes and controls. And I’m still highly impressed with its arena shooter-style gameplay and with how good it looks.</p><p>While my go-to mech is good for jetting around above the battlefield, laying suppressing fire, and stacking up assists, it’s kind of a glass cannon. That’s where something like the Tricera comes in. New in this beta, this tanky terror is appropriately named after the armored dinosaur. It may be slow and less maneuverable than Falcon, but what it lacks in speed and mobility, it makes up for in raw firepower with its twin gatling guns, overhead cannon, and beefy shields. Each mecha truly feels and plays differently, and I loved swapping between them from match-to-match.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Mecha BREAK Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Even the act of unlocking new mecha is really cool. Instead of just gaining a new selection in your pre-match lobby: unlocking a mech using one of the two in-game currencies I encountered triggers a really flashy cutscene, flexing Mecha BREAK’s stellar mecha design while showcasing some of the new chassis’s capabilities. It does remind me a bit of unlocking a new playable character in a gacha game, which points to some potentially concerning monetization practices. Emphasizing my concerns, Mecha BREAK appears to have something resembling a battle pass, complete with premium and free tiers along with a premium currency. Everything I saw in the beta was free, and most of the apparently premium unlockables I found were cosmetic, with only one mecha being gated behind battle pass progression. But just as gameplay in a game’s beta might not reflect the final version at launch, monetization and in-game mecha or currency prices might not be final either.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unlocking a mech using one of the two in-game currencies I encountered triggers a really flashy cutscene, flexing Mecha BREAK’s stellar mecha design while showcasing some of the new chassis’s capabilities. </p></div><p>The looming threat of aggressive monetization tactics aside, I had lots of fun with this beta… even if I had some trouble shaking off my rust after a few months. After a match or two spent grappling with its controls thanks to an unfortunately scant tutorial, I was eventually able to get back up to snuff with Mecha BREAK’s fast-paced gameplay. As I unlocked and tried out more and more mecha, things started to fall back into place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Its half-baked tutorial—which doesn’t seem like it’s changed or improved since my last preview —left me with more questions than answers about the starter Alysnes’ mecha’s abilities. This was even more frustrating given the fact that you can take any mecha into a firing range of sorts to test out its abilities from the main menu after completing the tutorial, which was a much easier way to learn each machine’s strengths and weaknesses, free from the introductory level’s dissociative chaos.</p><p>It doesn’t help that the tutorial begins abruptly, seemingly in the middle of a story without any context, and doesn’t have any bearing on the rest of what I saw in the beta. Backed by flat, generic dialogue trying to squeeze story and plot into a place where it doesn’t make much sense, the tutorial (where you essentially march forward, shooting spongey enemies before taking on a titanic boss mech) felt like an entirely different game compared to its high-energy multiplayer, which I couldn’t put down.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The modes I saw all followed pretty standard objective-based modes you’d find in any team shooter: I escorted payloads and captured objectives, and had lots of fun doing it thanks to Mecha BREAK’s combat, which is easily the star of the show. By catering to different playstyles and power sets, each mecha felt distinct and natural within its suite of abilities. Equipped with a diverse mix of melee and ranged attacks and helpful abilities like cloaking or shields, I found something to enjoy in every match I played—not just ones where I got to play as the mecha I was best or most comfortable with.</p><p>While this beta doesn’t add too much new content on top of what I’ve already seen in previous versions, it did cement my excitement for Mecha BREAK’s eventual launch thanks to its polished gameplay and visual style. But it also left me more wary about its other modes, which are still gated off, and its monetization structures. Let’s hope my worst fears about those don’t come to pass.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the Kickstarter campaign for Brandon Sanderson's <em>Cosmere RPG</em> has gone live. Formerly known as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stormlight-archives-ttrpg-will-have-skill-based-magic-system-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Stormlight Archives</em></a> RPG, this tabletop game features an original RPG system set in the world created by the iconic fantasy author. And in a single day, it raised more than $5 million.</p>
<h2>The <em>Cosmere RPG</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>
<p>According to the Kickstarter campaign page, the <em>Cosmere RPG</em> will encompass the entire universe of Sanderson's novels. This is a noticeable change in scope from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sanderson-announces-stormlight-ttrpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original announcement</a> in November of 2023.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cosmere-rpg-official-artwork.jpg?itok=4zt_lsqo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cosmere-rpg-official-artwork.jpg?itok=vEuu_ggt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Basically, the RPG will launch with books based on the <em>Stormlight Archives</em> novels. It will encompass three books. The <em>Stormlight World Guide</em> is a 224-page book on the history, culture, and key figures of the world of Roshar. The <em>Stormlight Handbook</em> is a 256-page player handbook. Lastly, the <em>Stonewalkers Stormlight Adventure</em> is a prewritten module.</p>
<p>Afterwards, additional books and supplements will be added to the <em>Cosmere RPG</em> based on the <em>Mistborn</em>, <em>Elantris</em>, and <em>Worldhopper</em> series respectively. This material can be used either for standalone adventures or grand worldhopping epics. If you're a fan of any of these books, the RPG material will include official lore and new canonical material.</p>
<p>For those interested in the Cosmere RPG's core gameplay or character creation, several VTTs have free demos available. Demiplane has <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/cosmererpg">a character creator</a>, and a beta version of the core rules are on <a href="https://forge.fantasygrounds.com/shop/items/1865/view">Fantasy Grounds</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cosmere-rpg-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=RpfqKLbp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cosmere-rpg-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=vHch8jFg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are several stretch goals and add-ons for the <em>Cosmere RPG</em>. The add-ons include official dice, miniatures, a GM screen, tokens, battlemaps, and item decks. As for the stretch goals, only two have been unlocked at the time of writing: a 24-page PDF visual guide of Roshar, and a Lifelight green plot die. More will be revealed as the campaign progresses.</p>
<p>The pledge levels of the <em>Cosmere RPG</em> are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>The E-Reader at $60:</strong> Your choice of two core rulebooks in PDF format.</li>
<li><strong>The Reader at $95:</strong> Your choice of two rulebooks in hardcover format.</li>
<li><strong>The Player at $195:</strong> The Stormlight and Mistborn World Guides and Handbooks, a set of dice, and a set of Opportunities and Complications cards.</li>
<li><strong>The Game Master at $295:</strong> Everything in The Player tier, the <em>Stonewalkers Stormlight Adventure</em>, GM Screen, the <em>Mistborn Legacy</em> campaign, tokens, maps, and a deck of item cards.</li>
<li><strong>The Collector at $385:</strong> Every book and accessory, Stormlight Liquid Core Dice and Stormlight RPG Miniatures.</li>
</ul><p>Within the first day, the <em>Cosmere RPG</em> Kickstarter campaign raised&nbsp;$5,250,350, completely dwarfing its initial funding goal of $250,000. In addition, it eclipses similar TTRPG success stories on the platform like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steinhardts-guide-to-eldritch-hunt-raises-26-million-on-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Steinhardt's Guide to The Eldritch Hunt</em></a><em> </em>and<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/one-ring-rpg-second-edition-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The One Ring</a></em>, The campaign concludes August 29.</p>

			<p>It's no secret that PlayStation has a ton of unannounced projects being developed, with one of them being developed <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-later-playstations-firesprite-issues-statement-following-februarys-layoffs/">by Firesprite</a>. This game is set to be a single-player narrative horror. At the moment, there is no real information about this project.</p>
<p>Firesprite was obtained by Sony in 2021, with leaks and rumors regarding this project dropping over the years. This includes an internal document, revealing the code name for the project to be "Heartbreak." Whether that still remains true is uncertain.</p>
<p>Colin Moriarty, an insider has claimed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzgSPOaVG4Y&amp;t=3204s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast from Last Stand Media</a> that the game could possibly be set on an island, with a female protagonist. However, apart from that, we don't know a whole lot about the game, and what stage of development it is in.</p>
<p>Despite that, there are still leaks that have a huge amount of information in them, which could explain a lot about the unannounced project.</p>
<p>One of the main hints about Firesprite's project is the website of Firesprite's Game Designer, Emily Stell who lists the project as a "narrative horror game," with the platforms listed being PlayStation 5 and PC. In addition to this, it says that it is being made by using Unreal Engine 5. It isn't unheard of for PlayStation exclusives to be ported to PC, as we have seen Ghost of Tsushima, The Last of Us Part 1 and Returnal come to PC in recent years.</p>
<p>In addition to Emily Stell's page, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10vidAT5YiKkCMdFG2fdAddwC4Gvqf3Qe/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the resume</a> for Firesprite writer Ren Alex-Rose who worked for Firesprite from 2022 until April of 2024 suggests that she worked on designing characters and plot lines "within pre-established IP," which seems to confirm some suspicions.</p>
<p>There is also speculation that the game isn't a unique IP, but a new game coming to an existing IP. This has been suggested by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1b1gzcx/comment/ksexsqj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Schreier</a>, who hinted at it on Reddit. At the moment, we don't know what horror IP this could be referring to, as there are many that are getting new developments in both movies and games right now.</p>
<p>In addition to Stell and Alex-Rose, there is a Pinterest profile from the Environment Artist Andreas Houin, who is currently working at Firesprite. In <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/andrashouin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his boards on Pinterest</a>, with boards dedicated to Cosmic Horror, Architecture and Scifi. Although we have no idea what horror IP this could possibly be for, but we will be keeping an eye out for any future announcements from Sony or Firesprite for their upcoming development.</p>

<p>It’s been an absolutely wild month for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, with numerous announcements and leaks building up the hype train. Thanks to a recent leak, we have the complete list of achievements in the game and the unlock requirements for most of them. Here are all of the Black Ops 6 achievements on launch!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-one-of-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-achievements">Every One of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Achievements</h2>

<p>While we’re not sure if there are any directly tied to completing any of the game’s achievements, we’re sure Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 offers a wide variety of challenges and unlocks in multiplayer. </p>



<p>To keep everyone’s attention, Activision always implements rotating challenges to earn XP, along with unique weapon-specific challenges to unlock additional attachments, kits, and camo schemes. We believe Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will follow suit, but that’s a safe guess, isn’t it?</p>



<hr>



<p>Apparently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hundreds-of-people-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>hund</span>reds of people are already playing Black Ops 6</a>, way ahead of the beta launch! I certainly wish I were one of the lucky few; how about you?</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Strand rocket launcher Crowning Duologue makes its return in this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-solstice-2024-start-date-rewards-and-everything-we-know/2900-5615/" data-ref-id="2900-5615">Solstice of Heroes</a> event in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, but in a form we haven't seen before. Like the other weapons that are only available during the summertime event, Crowning Duologue has had its perks refreshed this year, and some of them are pretty excellent for dealing massive damage in PvE scenarios. While Crowning Duologue might not replace your go-to rocket launchers like Apex Predator, it can be a great alternative for certain builds or to take advantage of Strand surges in certain events.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's how you can get Crowning Duologue and the god roll perk combinations you'll want to chase.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Crowning_Duologue">How To Get Crowning Duologue</a></li><li><a href="#Crowning_Duologue_God_Rolls">Crowning Duologue God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Crowning_Duologue_PvE_God_Roll">Crowning Duologue PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Crowning_Duologue_PvP_God_Roll">Crowning Duologue PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347125-20240806172148_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347125" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347125-20240806172148_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347125"></a><figcaption>Crowning Duologue</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347125-20240806172148_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Crowning_Duologue">How To Get Crowning Duologue</h2><p dir="ltr">Four weapons are only available during the Solstice of Heroes event, and Crowning Duologue is one of them. That means that the rocket launcher is part of the Solstice loot pool. The best way to get it and to farm multiple rolls is from playing Solstice's Bonfire Bash event, which drops various Solstice weapons at the end depending on your performance. You can also sometimes get Crowning Duologue from Solstice packages, from completing Solstice bounties, and from the Solstice event card. Still, those methods are less reliable than just farming Bonfire Bash.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Crowning_Duologue_God_Rolls">Crowning Duologue God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crowning_Duologue_PvE_God_Roll">Crowning Duologue PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Volatile Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Blast Radius, -5 Velocity, -5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Alloy Casing  <ul><li dir="ltr">+30 Reload Speed, -10 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Reconstruction  <ul><li dir="ltr">This weapon slowly reloads itself over time, up to double capacity.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Bait and Switch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Deal damage with all equipped weapons within a short time to give this weapon a damage boost.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you mean to use Crowning Duologue to do damage, the winning perk combo is Reconstruction and Bait and Switch. Reconstruction is similar to Auto-Loading Holster but boosts your magazine to hold two rockets at a time, and Bait and Switch gives you a serious damage boost if you quickly land a shot with each of your weapons before swapping to your rocket to put the hurt on bosses. For everything else, focus on reload speed to get additional rockets as fast as possible so you can keep firing. The combo can make Crowning Duologue a significant DPS weapon. However, because of its archetype, it'll never be quite as good as some of the top-tier meta rockets right now, like Apex Predator. Still, this is a good alternative to deal Strand damage when you need it.</p><p dir="ltr">An alternative roll here is Chain Reaction and Hatchling, shifting Crowning Duologue from a damage-dealing role to an enemy-clearing one. Chain Reaction is always a fun time since it can take out multiple enemies at once, and Hatchling means those kills will spawn additional Threadlines to run around killing more enemies. For that roll, you'll want to focus on Blast Radius to catch even more aliens in your explosions.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crowning_Duologue_PvP_God_Roll">Crowning Duologue PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Volatile Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Blast Radius, -5 Velocity, -5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Velocity, +10 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Hatchling / Impulse Amplifier  <ul><li dir="ltr">Hatchling: Precision final blows or rapidly defeating targets with this weapon spawns a Threadling at the target's location.</li><li dir="ltr">Impulse Amplifier: Massively increases projectile velocity, increases reload speed.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Cluster Bomb / Chain Reaction  <ul><li dir="ltr">Cluster Bomb: Rockets spawn cluster bombs upon generation.</li><li dir="ltr">Chain Reaction: Each final blow with this weapon creates an elemental damage explosion.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Blast Radius</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Rockets in PvP mostly rely on the blast radius and velocity stats to be effective: Blast radius to make as big an explosion as possible to get multiple targets, and velocity to get a rocket to its target as quickly as possible, making it tougher to dodge. Crowning Duologue has some perks that can seriously bump the first one, but keep an eye on the velocity stat if you're chasing a PvP roll. Hatchling and Cluster Bomb or Chain Reaction pair well here, with the latter two expanding the size of the explosion when a rocket hits--Chain Reaction requires actually catching enemies in the blast to expand it but can catch opponents unexpected, while Cluster Bomb just adds more bombs to the blast zone. If you can kill more than one Guardian with a rocket, which is the whole point, then Hatchling rewards you for your efforts by creating a Threadling to chase down more opponents.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if you're finding your rockets aren't getting to their targets in time to actually kill them, or if you're missing a lot, consider Impulse Amplifier. The perk massively gooses your velocity stat to speed up your rockets, and while a big blast is nice, it's not especially useful if your rockets are too slow.</p>

						<h5>The Sims 4: Lovestruck</h5><p><span>25 July 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Mac, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The Sims 4 Lovestruck is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815270/The_Sims_4_Lovestruck_Expansion_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest expansion</a> to be released for the simulation game. So far, a lot of the expansions haven't quite grabbed my attention in the way this one has. The only one that has come remotely close is Cottage Living. However, I was pleasantly surprised with what Lovestruck had to offer.</p>
<p>An expansion that is tailor made to those who enjoy giving their Sims a dramatic love life, this was everything I was hoping for and more. It had some of the classic cheesy traits and features that were seen in previous games, with nods to The Sims 1. Being able to get a vibrating love bed made me happy, as it reminded me of all of the nostalgic hours I spent playing The Sims 1.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For the character creator, I found that the options were somewhat lacking. While I loved the nose and cheek blush available in the make-up section, it felt as if there were a lot of opportunities that they overlooked. For example, there was not a single piece of lingerie for either men or women. Considering Lovestruck is a pack about romance and spicing up relationships, it seemed weird to me to not include something that is commonly used for doing just that. However, looking at the party outfits, it seemed that the outfits there were more like lingerie, and seemed more suited for indoor affairs rather than outdoor.</p>
<p>I did really like the hair options that were added with this pack, and I could see myself actively using some of them if none of my custom content foots the bill. Overall though, I did feel that the clothing and accessory options for both men and women were slim pickings, and there were plenty of missed opportunities.</p>
<p>The interactions that were added to the game were adorable. I loved that they could either be really cute and worried in their interactions, or very bold and brazen in their attempts to sway someone. I liked the new date system, where you could choose what type of date you were going on. Whether it was a date for sims to get to know each other, or a romantic date to keep the spark alive, there were multiple options. Along with that, you could pick the goals for the date so that you could win awards by the end of it if you were successful.</p>
<p>Compared to packs like Get Together and Get To Work, I feel that Lovestruck actually managed to breathe some realism and depth into the game where the other packs failed. Relationships were more dynamic, as were the interactions. Whether you let them happen on their own, or you picked the prompts, it still felt more realistic than the five repeating interactions sims players usually do in order to boost relationships.</p>

<p>One of the main features that really lets <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">The Sims 4</a> down is how empty the cities feel. While they are aesthetically pleasing to look at on the map, there is so much space that could be utilized and just isn't. Ciudad Enamorada is no different. There is a huge lack of starter homes for sims, and considering your sims only start with 20,000 simoleons after creation, this choice didn't make much sense to me. I understood the appeal of having lavish homes and a city that is built up where the richer sims could live. However, most of the cities available in all of the expansions for The Sims 4 at least have a few starter homes that are affordable.</p>
<p>One of the other features that didn't quite sit well with me was the inclusion of a dating app named Cupid's Corner. While I liked the concept, it overall just fell relatively flat. You could choose two of your Sim's traits to showcase on the app, while taking a selfie. The selfies always turn out a little bit janky, which can add some comedy to the dating app.</p>
<p>I did try to utilize it for my sim, but found that going out into the world and interacting with people organically worked better for her. She had more success in going to a bar randomly than she did with the dating app.</p>

<p>Considering this is an expansion all about love and romance, I was truly disappointed with the lack of traits that came with the expansion. There was only one trait that came with The Sims 4: Lovestruck, and it was a trait about being romantically closed off, making a sim take their time in a relationship. While I liked that it added more dynamic conversations and opened up the possibility for a more realistic relationship, I didn't like that there were no other traits to be found.</p>
<p>Additionally, only one job came with the expansion. I understand that it may be a little bit difficult to create jobs off of something like this, and I did really like the one job that they added. Being a Dating Consultant was a lot of fun, as your sim just had to go around and give unsolicited dating advice. However, the lack of aspirations was also extremely disappointing. I feel that there was a lot of potential to add fun aspirations or traits for this expansion, and it all just came up empty.</p>
<p>Overall, The Sims 4: Lovestruck does do a good job at sprucing up the game and trying to make it a little bit more dynamic, the same way Growing Together did. However, some of the features were incredibly lacking, and I felt that there could have been much more added to make it worthwhile. I really liked the new interactions that they added to the game, but aside from that, the expansion was still quite flat.</p>
<p><em>Played on PC. Code given by Publisher.</em></p>

					
					

<p>While the customization options for the expansion were adorable, and the romance interactions between Sims added a lot more depth, there was an astonishing lack of features added in this expansion. There was a ton of room for new traits and aspirations, but only one was given for each category. Overall, while it made relationships more dynamic, the rest of the world felt empty.</p>

And we’re doing that right now,” said Iger during the recent earnings call. <br></p><p> “We started our password-sharing initiative in June,” mentioned Iger. “That kicks in, in earnest, in September.

This is the fourth price increase the service has received since it launched, and it means that starting in October the ad-free version of Disney+ will cost you more than double what it cost back in 2019. Back then Disney+ was just $7 a month. Today, it’s $16 a month. Yikes. </p><p>But hey, Disney is actually making money off its streaming services now, which is something other companies like Paramount can’t claim.

The shotgun has never been especially impressive, but this year, a revamp of its perks have changed things, making it a great addition to your loadout for taking down other players in the Crucible. If you've been struggling to get a good Matador 64, Compass Rose should offer comparable stats and be a little easier to chase. It's also not bad for PvE, but the new perks on Compass Rose make it potentially as useful in PvP as some of the top shotguns in the meta. Here's how you can get Compass Rose and what rolls you'll want to focus on during Solstice of Heroes.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Compass_Rose">How To Get Compass Rose</a></li><li><a href="#Compass_Rose_God_Rolls">Compass Rose God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Compass_Rose_PvP_God_Roll">Compass Rose PvP God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Compass_Rose_PvE_God_Roll">Compass Rose PvE God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Compass_Rose">How To Get Compass Rose</h2><p dir="ltr">Compass Rose is one of the four weapons that are part of the Solstice of Heroes loot pool, and thus only available during the event. The main way to get it is to play through Bonfire Bash, the Solstice event--you can access it from the Tower map in the Director. Compass Rose will be among the random weapons you can get from completing the event. Alternatively, you should be able to occasionally pick up Compass Roses from Solstice packages, event card Triumphs, and Solstice and Forge bounties you complete during the event. The most reliable way to farm Compass Rose, however, is to finish Bonfire Bash runs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346923-20240806172141_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346923" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346923-20240806172141_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346923"></a><figcaption>Compass Rose</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346923-20240806172141_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Compass_Rose_God_Rolls">Compass Rose God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Compass_Rose_PvP_God_Roll">Compass Rose PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Small Bore  <ul><li dir="ltr">+7 Range, +7 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Slickdraw / Threat Detector / Slideshot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Slickdraw: Significantly increases handling, significantly decreases target acquisition.</li><li dir="ltr">Threat Detector: Increased reload speed, stability, and handling when enemies are in close proximity.</li><li dir="ltr">Slideshot: Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts range and stability.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Opening Shot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improved accuracy and range on the opening shot of attack.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The common go-to perk combo for a PvP shotgun is Threat Detector and Opening Shot, and with its revamp this year, Compass Rose can now roll those perks. However, the theory going around is that Slickdraw might be a better choice. High handling on a PvP shotgun is great because you want to quickly pull that gun out for a point-blank blast to an opponent's face, whether it's to finish off a hurt opponent or surprise someone in tight confines. Slickdraw kicks handling up to 100 for Compass Rose at the expense of target acquisition, but at close range, you shouldn't really need any. Threat Detector also boosts your handling, but requires you to be close to two opponents to get the benefit, where Slickdraw has no prerequisite.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, Slideshot is always a good choice for a PvP shotgun if you like slidy, agile play--and if you don't, skip this one, because sliding all the time is essential. The perk boosts your shotgun's range right after a slide, making it great for coming in hot around a corner to surprise an opponent, even if they're not perfectly in position for a point-blank blast.</p><p dir="ltr">All the perks are great with Opening Shot, which adds to the range at which Compass Rose can be deadly, and with the rest of your choices, you want to boost range as much as possible to make it more reliable that you'll get those one-hit or finish-off kills.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Compass_Rose_PvE_God_Roll">Compass Rose PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Stability, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Assault Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Stability, +5 Rate of Fire</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Grave Robber  <ul><li dir="ltr">Melee final blows or dealing damage with a charged melee reloads this weapon's magazine from reserves.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Trench Barrel / One-Two Punch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Trench Barrel: After a successful melee hit, this weapon gains increased damage, handling, and reload speed for a short duration--or until three shots are fired.</li><li dir="ltr">One-Two Punch: Hitting an enemy with every pellet in a shot increases melee damage for a short duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Handling / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In PvE, Compass Rose isn't necessarily the best shotgun out there, but it can be very useful for melee builds. Both Trench Barrel and One-Two Punch pair well with punchy builds. With Trench Barrel, you boost Compass Rose's damage after you land a punch, while with One-Two Punch, Compass Rose boosts the power of your melee, so pick the perk that works best with your build. Meanwhile, Grave Robber lets you use your melee to reload the shotgun, circumventing any slow reload issues you might have with the gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, Compass Rose can also roll Incandescent, which is always a fun perk for Solar builds and can be great with certain builds meant to knock out a lot of small enemies quickly. None of these options are particularly unique to Compass Rose, but they can all make it pretty useful.</p>

            <p>
Ready at Dawn - the studio behind the likes of Lone Echo and The Order: 1886 - has reportedly been shut down by its currently owner, Meta, after over two decades of operation. The news follows heavy job cuts at the studio last year.
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn Studios was founded in 2003 by former members of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> and Blizzard, and was initially known for its work adapting Sony's Daxter and God of War franchises for the PlayStation Portable. In 2015, its first original game, The Order: 1886, released to mixed reviews on PS4, and the company would later shift its focus to VR.
</p>
<p>
Its first VR project was 2017's acclaimed sci-fi adventure Lone Echo, followed by standalone multiplayer spin-off Echo VR (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-and-ready-at-dawn-to-shut-down-popular-multiplayer-game-echo-vr">shut down last year</a>), then a sequel in 2021. Amid Ready at Dawn's success in the VR space, Meta announced it was purchasing the studio in 2020.

<p>
News of Ready at Dawn's closure by Meta comes via Android Central, which <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing">reports</a> the studio is permanently shutting its doors, effective immediately. The publication, citing word from a Meta spokesperson, says today's closure is intended to ensure Meta's VR-focused Reality Labs "stays within [its] new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a 'better long-term impact' in VR development".
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Meta reported a second quarter loss of $4.5bn at its Reality Labs division, which followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-loses-a-billion-per-month-on-its-arvr-division-but-believes-it-will-be-worth-it">$3.8bn loss</a> during its first quarter.
</p>
<p>
Android Central doesn't reveal the number of Ready at Dawn employees affected by today's closure, but was told by Meta that the move "isn't enough to trigger the California WARN Act" - suggesting no more than 50 employees remained at the studio following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-heavily-impacted-by-latest-meta-layoffs">significant layoffs</a> last year. At the time, those layoffs were reported to have affected one third of Ready at Dawn's staff, including its studio head.
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn employees impacted by today's closure are said to have been "encouraged to apply elsewhere" within Meta, with the company claiming it "wants to retain as many talented developers as possible." Meta reportedly also said the closure isn't a sign of wider cuts to the number of first-party games it releases on Quest, insisting it's "still committed to VR development".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Meta for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-ui-database<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You might not be an information nerd like me, who wrote an entire Master's thesis arguing that <em>Half-Life 2</em> is basically a library catalogue, but you probably appreciate a good video game interface. The newly-revamped <a href="https://www.gameuidatabase.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game UI Database</a> is geared toward developers, but there's ton of great stuff in it for anyone who's ever paused to admire (or hate on) a game menu. </p><p>The Database is the work of Edd Coates, and contains over 55,000 screenshots and videos of various video game menus, inventories, game over screens, health bars, maps, objective markers, and more. It's been around for a few years, but its 2.0 version released this week, after what Coates <a href="https://x.com/EddCoates/status/1820555119152300230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> was "nearly 3 years of work" that added, among other things, the ability to filter by "screen types, controls, textures, patterns, HUD elements, colour and more!" </p><p>As a <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival game fan</a>, I've really enjoyed the Database's collection of crafting menus, which shows just how varied--and challenging to create--these kinds of interfaces are. And, as a stealth game fan, I had fun poking through the selection of hacking and lockpicking screens, reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/11/21363734/video-game-lock-pick-museum-itchio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable lockpicking  museum</a> from a few years back.</p><figure><figcaption>Game UI Database</figcaption></figure><p>It's cool to see how different games handle these elements and convey information to the player, and the Database's search tools let you really drill down into finding what you're looking for. Users can submit their own examples for Coates to add.</p><p>Coates wrote in the changelog for the 2.0 update, </p><blockquote><p>I can’t believe it’s finally here!! What began as a promised anniversary update in 2021 quickly feature-crept its way into what would become the biggest project of my <em>life</em>...  What you’re seeing here is three years of hard work, rebuilding everything from scratch in an attempt to create the dream website that I’ve had in my head for well over a decade.</p><p>2.0 is only the beginning (but please don’t ever let me do a 3.0).</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
