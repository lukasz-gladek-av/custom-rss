The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/leading-technology-companies-and-foundations-back-new-initiative-to-provide-free-open-source-tools-for-a-safer-internet-in-the-ai-era-302371243.html">Robust Open Online Safety Tools (ROOST</a>) initiative aims to make core safety technologies more accessible for companies and provide free, open-source AI tools for identifying, reviewing, and reporting child sexual abuse material.</p><p>The initiative was partially motivated by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138356/ai-companies-csam-thorn-training-data">changes that generative AI advancements</a> have made to online environments and aims to address “a critical need to accelerate innovation in online child safety,” according to founding ROOST partner and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Details about the CSAM detection tools are slim beyond that they will utilize large language AI models and “unify” existing options for dealing with the content.</p><p>“Starting with a platform focused on child protection, ROOST’s collaborative, open-source approach will foster innovation and make essential infrastructure more transparent, accessible, and inclusive, with the goal of creating a safer internet for everyone,” said Schmidt.</p><div><p>The <a href="https://roost.tools/">ROOST</a> announcement comes amid a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24205393/kids-online-safety-act-minors-age-verification-kosa">huge regulatory battle regarding child safety</a> on social media and online platforms, with companies seeking to appease lawmakers with self-regulation methods.</p></div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/cybertiplinedata">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a> (NCMEC) reports that suspected child exploitation increased by 12 percent between 2022 and 2023. As of 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite">over half of US children were on Roblox</a>, and the company has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse">repeatedly criticized</a> for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">failing to tackle child sexual exploitation</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24296652/new-york-childrens-online-safety-act-gounardes-privacy">exposure to inappropriate content</a> on its platform. Roblox and Discord were also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23390796/roblox-discord-facebook-snapchat-social-media-lawsuits-addiction-child-abuse">singled out in a social media lawsuit filed in 2022</a> that alleged the platforms failed to stop adults from messaging children without supervision.</p></div><p>Some founding members of ROOST like Discord are providing funding, while others are opening their tools or expertise to the project. ROOST says it’s partnering with leading AI foundation model developers to build a “community of practice” for content safeguards, which will include providing vetted AI training datasets and identifying gaps in safety.</p><p>The initiative says it will be making “tools that already exist” more accessible, effectively combining various detection and reporting tech from its member organizations into a unified solution that’s easier for other companies to implement. Naren Koneru, Roblox’s vice president of engineering, trust, and safety, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91275256/roblox-joins-27-million-industry-nonprofit-to-support-online-safety">told <em>Fast Company</em></a> that ROOST may host AI moderation systems that companies can integrate through API calls. There’s some ambiguity about what ROOST’s AI moderation tools will include, however.</p><p>For example, Discord says its contributions will build on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23950604/lantern-program-csam-child-exploitation-google-meta-discord-privacy">Lantern cross-platform information-sharing project</a> it joined in 2023 alongside Meta and Google. It could also include <a href="https://github.com/Roblox/voice-safety-classifier">an updated version of Roblox’s AI model</a> for detecting profanity, racism, bullying, sexting, and other inappropriate content in audio clips, which the company is planning to open-source this year. It’s unclear precisely how the tools will intersect with existing first-line CSAM detection systems like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna">Microsoft’s PhotoDNA image analysis tool</a>.</p><p>Alongside <a href="https://discord.com/safety/safer-internet-day-2025">its participation in ROOST</a>, Discord has released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609310/discord-ignore-mute-users-feature-block">a new “Ignore” feature</a> that allows users to hide messages and notifications they receive without notifying the people they have muted. “At Discord, we believe that safety is a common good,” Discord’s Chief Legal Officer Clint Smith said in the ROOST announcement. “We’re committed to making the entire internet - not just Discord - a better and safer place, especially for young people.” </p><p>ROOST has raised more than $27 million to support its first four years of operations, backed by philanthropic organizations including the McGovern Foundation, Future of Online Trust and Safety Fund, Knight Foundation, and the AI Collaborative. The ROOST organization will also be supported by experts in child safety, artificial intelligence, open-source technology, and “countering violent extremism” according to the press release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last March, Sega <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">sold off Company Of Heroes and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War developers Relic Entertainment</a> in the course of wider "restructuring", "realigning" and lay-offening at the house of Sonic. Relic's new corporate partners are a holding company established by the UK investment firm Emona Capital LLP - an arrangement that apparently lets them operate like an independent studio, though I'm fuzzy on the moving parts. </p>
<p>I was happy to hear that Relic had escaped outright closure. I'm even happier to hear that they're making more strategy games - a mixture of revival projects, big new games, and smaller productions with a faster turnaround.</p>
<p>All that's from a brief chat with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/company-of-heroes-developer-relic-to-build-for-the-future-with-smaller-titles-and-classic-revivals">Game Developer</a>, in which CEO Justin Dowdeswell lays on the talk of sunlit uplands. Relic will continue to support their existing games, like 2023's Company Of Heroes 3. They'll also work on projects of similar scale and complexity, perhaps including remasters or re-releases for older Relic games. There's the dangled carrot of remakes that "capture the spirit of the originals" but, by implication, take a few liberties with the fundamentals. Picking which older Relic games to revive will, as you'd expect, be a "multifactored process" of haggling it out with external partners.</p>
<p>And then there's the prospect of smaller Relic projects that, in Game Developer's paraphrase, will allow the developers to "explore new genres and experiences". Relic's hope is to develop and ship these in under two years. </p>
<p>"We're looking to operate with smaller teams on shorter timeframes, which means likely getting a game in market roughly in the 1-2 year range," Dowdeswell explained. "Budget costs will vary depending on scope, but these titles will have a notably smaller budget than the big Relic RTS games we will continue to work on." </p><p>Relic <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/relic-hit-with-layoffs-following-sale-from-sega">cut back on staff</a> following the Sega sale, but Dowdeswell insists the company are on a "much better footing" these days. Fingers crossed that it all pans out, I guess. While they're a different team nowadays, I still venerate Relic as the creators of the original Homeworld, to say nothing of Dawn Of War, and their recent stuff has been pretty good: Katharine (RPS in peace) called Company Of Heroes 3 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/company-of-heroes-3-review">"a glorious comeback"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/handful-of-users-claim-new-nvidia-gpus-are-melting-power-cables-again/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The 12VHPWR and 12V-2x6 connectors are both designed to solve a real problem: delivering hundreds of watts of power to high-end GPUs over a single cable rather than trying to fit multiple 8-pin power connectors onto these GPUs. In theory, swapping two to four 8-pin connectors for a single 12V-2x6 or 12VHPWR connector cuts down on the amount of board space OEMs must reserve for these connectors in their designs and the number of cables that users have to snake through the inside of their gaming PCs.</p>
<p>But while Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Arm, and other companies are all PCI-SIG members and all had a hand in the design of the new standards, Nvidia is the only GPU company to use the 12VHPWR and 12V-2x6 connectors in most of its GPUs. AMD and Intel have continued to use the 8-pin power connector, and even some of Nvidia's partners have stuck with 8-pin connectors for lower-end, lower-power cards like the RTX 4060 and 4070 series.</p>
<p>Both of the reported 5090 incidents involved third-party cables, one from custom PC part manufacturer <a href="https://www.moddiy.com/products/ATX-3.0-PCIe-5.0-600W-12VHPWR-16-Pin-to-16-Pin-PCIE-Gen-5-Power-Cable.html">MODDIY</a> and one included with an FSP power supply, rather than the first-party 8-pin adapter that Nvidia supplies with GeForce GPUs. It's much too early to say whether these cables (or Nvidia, or the design of the connector, or the affected users) caused the problem or whether this was just a coincidence.</p>
<p>We've contacted Nvidia to see whether it's aware of and investigating the reports and will update this piece if we receive a response.</p>

<p>While writing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">a wide-ranging history of Windows <em>Minesweeper</em></a> for Boss Fight Books in 2023, I ended up playing many variations of Microsoft's beloved original game. Those include <a href="https://illarn.itch.io/hexasweeper">versions with hexagonal tiles</a>, <a href="https://stingby12.itch.io/my-very-epic-custom-minesweeper-variants">versions with weird board shapes</a>, and versions that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/787980/4D_Minesweeper/">extend <em>Minesweeper</em> into four dimensions</a> or <a href="http://gravitation3d.com/xezlec/">more</a>, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Almost all these variants messed a little too much with the careful balance of simplicity, readability, reasoning, and luck that made the original <em>Minesweeper</em> so addictive. None of them became games I return to day after day.</p>
<p>But then I stumbled onto <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper"><em>Dragonsweeper</em></a>, a free browser-based game that <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/">indie developer Daniel Benmergui</a> released unceremoniously on itch.io last month. In the weeks since I discovered it, the game has become my latest puzzle obsession, filling in a worrying proportion of my spare moments with its addictive, simple RPG-tinged take on the <em>Minesweeper</em> formula.</p>
<h2>Exploresweeper</h2>
<p>Like <em>Minesweeper</em> before it, <em>Dragonsweeper</em> is a game about deducing hidden information based on the limited information you can already see on the grid. But the numbers you reveal in <em>Dragonsweeper</em> don't simply tell you the <em>number</em> of threats on adjacent squares. Instead, the "numbers are sum of monster power," as the game's cryptic "Monsternomicon" explains. So a revealed square with a "14" could suggest two 7-power devils nearby or two 5-power slimes and a 4-power ogre, or even seven 2-power bats in a particularly weird randomized arrangement.</p>
<p>Destroying those monsters means eating into your avatar Jorge's health total, which is prominently displayed in the bottom-left corner. Jorge's health can safely go down to zero hearts without dying—which feels a bit counter-intuitive at first—and can be restored by using discovered health potions or by leveling up with gold accumulated from downed monsters and items. If you can level up enough without dying, you'll have the health necessary to defeat the titular dragon sitting in the middle of the board and win the game.</p>

<p>The first few times I played <em>Dragonsweeper</em>, it seemed impossible to make significant progress. I'd defeat a few of the low-ranking monsters revealed at the beginning of the game, use all the level-ups and health potions I could, and then be stuck with no health in a situation where it seemed like I had to guess to continue. The balance between logic and luck seemed completely out of whack.</p>
<p>The game didn't really click for me until I read a comment suggesting that I think of Jorge's hearts as a sort of "exploration budget" to probe the frontiers of unrevealed tiles. Instead of clicking on the monsters you can already see (or deduce directly), it's usually much smarter to click on multiple tiles <em>if and when</em> you can be sure those tiles won't kill Jorge.</p>
<p>So if I see a revealed "14" tile with 10 points of known adjacent monsters, I know I can click the other adjacent tiles and take just four points of damage. In exchange for that health, I gain more board information and more gold and items to continue the cycle of healing and exploration. After literal decades of <em>Minesweeper</em>-honed instincts to never click a potentially dangerous box, <em>Dragonsweeper</em> had to train me that it was OK to trade "danger" for information in this way.</p>

<p>While most <em>Dragonsweeper</em> monsters end up acting as simple damage sponges, a few have some hidden abilities or patterns that only become apparent after a bit of guess-and-check gameplay. It pays to follow the Monsternomicon's directive to "Observe Monster Patterns When Dead," looking at the fully revealed board to figure out the kinds of locations where certain monsters congregate and exploit that knowledge as you plan your strategy.</p>

<h2>Just one more dragon</h2>
<p>Variants like <a href="https://hojamaka.com/game/mamono_sweeper_h2/html5/en.html"><em>Mamono Sweeper</em></a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cimu.runestonekeeper"><em>Runestone Keeper</em></a> have similarly tried adding RPG systems to the basic <em>Minesweeper</em> formula in the past, but they ended up feeling a little too complex and difficult to parse for my tastes. <em>Dragonsweeper</em> adds just enough randomized monster battling and item collecting to stay interesting without becoming unwieldy under the weight of intricate systems.</p>
<p>After a few hours of somewhat obsessive play, I got pretty good at consistently killing the dragon on the original version of <em>Dragonsweeper</em>. Then, late last week, Benmergui <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper/devlog/882560/new-dragonsweeper-version">posted an update</a> that greatly improved the user interface, modified some monster behaviors, and "adjust[ed] the challenge." The new version requires a little more care and deduction to make early progress, even though the vast majority of boards still seem solvable with careful play.</p>

<p>Even after you've notched your first <em>Dragonsweeper</em> "win," there's still reason to keep coming back. The game's background scoring system encourages you to defeat not just the dragon but every single monster on the board, a feat that requires careful planning and a bit of luck in finding early gold piles. The latest update also adds an in-game timer (which is only revealed when you win), encouraging the kind of record-chasing speedruns <a href="https://minesweepergame.com/world-records.php">that high-level <em>Minesweeper</em> is known for</a> (my best <em>Dragonsweeper</em> run so far is just under four minutes, but I'm sure that can be improved).</p>
<p>Even with a number of grand, bid-budget gaming epics in my backlog (and my review plate), <em>Dragonsweeper</em> has become the game I'm eager to return to with practically every spare moment I can find lately. It's a perfect "coffee break" game that requires just enough logic and strategy to focus my higher brain functions while offering enough luck to not be rote. As it happens, that's exactly what I'm looking for from a gaming distraction these days.</p>

                <p>Back in the '90s, nothing was better than sitting down in front of a TV to watch a color-coordinated group of teenagers with attitude beat the putty out of various monsters. Fast-forward to today, and Angel Grove's finest warriors are back in the spotlight with the co-op side-scrolling brawler Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind. The digital version of the game launched on consoles and PC back in December 2024, but publisher Atari is finally releasing physical PS5 and Nintendo Switch versions on May 30. A $35 Standard Edition and $50 Deluxe Edition will be available for both systems, and preorders for both are in stock at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DVDNFK57,B0DVDCFYTD,B0DVDDT9VP,B0DVCYY61T" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>.</p><div title="6529354 - Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Rita's Rewind" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3156" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6529354 - Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Rita's Rewind" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-Station-PlayStation/dp/B0DVDDT9VP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-Station-PlayStation\/dp\/B0DVDDT9VP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-Station-PlayStation/dp/B0DVDDT9VP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind Deluxe Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-Station-PlayStation/dp/B0DVDDT9VP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-Station-PlayStation\/dp\/B0DVDDT9VP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-Station-PlayStation/dp/B0DVDDT9VP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Releases May 30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind Deluxe Edition is available for PS5 and Nintendo Switch and comes with a bunch of collectibles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/607154/stop-motion-video-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the biggest lessons of working on stop-motion video games? Rolling up your sleeves — literally.</p><p>“It’s such a nightmare,” Talha &amp; Jack Co developer Jack King-Spooner told me over a video call. “You spend maybe half an hour doing one of the cutscenes. The cutscenes are the most precarious things because you have to have everything in the scene exactly the same. And then your sleeve catches something and you’re like <em>ah, Jesus, and I have to do everything again</em>.”</p><p>King-Spooner worked with Talha Kaya on 2024’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1960900%2FJudero%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Judero</em></a>, an action-adventure game based on the folklore of the Scottish Borders. Now, the creative duo is running a Kickstarter campaign for its new project, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637042083/mashina"><em>Mashina</em></a>, centered around a cute robot who has to drill. It’s a stop-motion game again, but this time, the team is facing the laborious process with some hard-learned lessons.</p><p>The seemingly innocuous gesture of rolling up your sleeves is one of many considerations that studios need to keep in mind when experimenting with handmade characters, objects, and scenes for their games. Stop-motion games aren’t new — the likes of <em>The Neverhood</em>, <em>The Dark Eye</em>, and <em>Skullmonkeys</em> have been toying with this physical-meets-digital marriage since the ’90s. But there’s been a resurgence in recent years due to projects with prominent Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns, such as <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/esbenkongorange/vokabulantis"><em>Vokabulantis</em></a>, and smaller teams keeping the momentum going, resulting in a sparse but steady presence thanks to games like <em>Hylics</em> and its sequel to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/14/7217199/the-dream-machine"><em>The Dream Machine</em></a>.</p><p>To Talha &amp; Jack Co, there are a few reasons behind the popularity of this art style. Aside from the clear promotional aspect of standing out in an ever-increasing crowd, the team is fond of the playful and physical nostalgia of action figures. When I spoke to them, they’d occasionally open drawers to grab figures and individual pieces, from small feet to mountains made of clay, proudly showing them to the webcam and fiddling with them while they spoke.</p><p>“Gaming has been for a long time just an extremely digital thing that you do only by sitting at your computer and changing pixels or programming,” Kaya said. “Now we are in this age where anything can go into a video game, and when you put a lot of literally and metaphorically interesting textures, it just becomes a more interesting work. Stop-motion is a great way to do that.”</p><p>For the team behind the point-and-click adventure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24131922/harold-halibut-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Harold Halibut</em></a>, the reason was more simple: it’s what they knew. The developers didn’t have experience with 3D or drawing, but they knew how to build physical things. That philosophy was the foundation of a development period that spanned over a decade. When it came to animating these handcrafted creations, however, they decided on a different approach.</p><p>Initially, <em>Harold Halibut</em> was supposed to be animated in traditional stop-motion. The proof is in Slow Bros. cofounder and CEO Onat Hekimoglu’s shelf behind him, the namesake character standing inside a display case with his arms pointing down. Hekimoglu tells me that you can actually move his arms and legs, as opposed to the other characters alongside him, which are T-posing.</p><div><p>“When you put a lot of literally and metaphorically interesting textures, it just becomes a more interesting work”</p></div><p>“In the beginning, we were using actual stop-motion animation, but it all felt too static, and also too much like a Photoshop collage, and we wanted to have a modern-looking feel that fits the time we are in, right?” Hekimoglu said. “Dynamic lighting, dynamic camera work, and all that stuff.”</p><p>Eventually, the developer diverged from the original idea to embrace “the best of both worlds,” according to Hekimoglu, taking handcrafted assets and scanning them in a process called photogrammetry. Instead of photographing every animation from different angles, the process involved taking pictures of objects and characters to create digital 3D models.</p><p>“I think actual stop-motion is not very suitable for games,” he adds. “When you are working on a film, everything that happens is inside that one image, that’s why everything feels consistent. You can never have that situation in a video game unless you do a full-motion video game.”</p><p>Hekimoglu’s point of view resonates with some obstacles that studio Wooly Games is encountering. Development for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3159860%2FFeltopia%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Feltopia</em></a> started in the summer of 2023, and the four-person team has been experimenting with an array of handcrafted felt objects in stop-motion fashion since. <em>Feltopia</em> is a shoot-’em-up, traditionally a fast-paced genre, which clashes with the slower nature of stop-motion.</p><p>“I animate at 12 frames a second, and when you have your game going at 60 frames a second, there’s sort of a little bit of mixing and matching that goes along there,” creative director Andrea Love tells me. “So we are exploring some slower types of gameplay, more like 2D platformers, and we’ll see how that goes.”</p><p>Love has been working on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andreaanimates/">stop-motion animation</a> for over a decade, but doing so for a video game is “very different.” Usually, she would build the puppets and sets and put them all together for a composed scene. For <em>Feltopia</em>, everything has to be an isolated sprite or piece of scenery, so she photographs and animates objects as individual assets. “It’s like taking all these different little things and making a felted interactive collage,” Love says.</p><p>Stop-motion requires patience. A little blob that undulates in <em>Feltopia</em> takes around 15 to 20 minutes to make. The animation cycles of the Skyrider, the main hooded character who flies on a pegasus, took around a day, while a boss fight scene unfolded between two to three days. Love also has to create the puppets using wire armatures to rig them up and then remove the wires in postproduction.</p><p>But things get easier with experience. During the first animation tests of <em>Judero</em>, it would take King-Spooner around 10 hours to do one animation. As he became faster and more practical in his workflow, the team was able to increase the scope of the game, adding cutscenes and more elaborate characters. Still, considering that each frame involved at least eight photographs, the total count was in the hundreds.</p><p>“When you’ve taken 200 photos and then you sit back and press play and all of a sudden it’s actually animated, and then it’s even got an extra step when I throw it over to Talha and we get it in the game, and not only is it moving, we’re controlling it, it’s so fun,” King-Spooner said. “It’s kind of magic.”</p><p>Upcoming games like Compulsion Games’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350382/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-doom-ninja-gaiden-trailers"><em>South of Midnight</em></a> and MoonHood’s <em>The Midnight Walk</em> are taking cues from games like <em>Harold Halibut.</em> They blur the line between stop-motion and the technical or visual expectations of modern games, keeping traditional art style without restricting movement or animations. But for those who are sticking with the craft of stop-motion — whether it’s trying to adjust the lighting of a scene due to different weather affecting photographs across multiple days or figuring out the exact density of felt so puppets don’t fall apart — they’re finding joy in the process, while embracing the work involved.</p><p>“That’s usually people’s first reaction,” Wooly Games project manager Michelle Hagewood says. “Why in the world are you doing this to yourself?”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’ll stretch his arms out to hit enemies in close and medium range and it will be your go-to for dealing “filler” damage when Spore Bomb is on cooldown.</p><p><strong>Strangling Prison:</strong> This Ultimate grabs nearby enemies and pulls them together to wherever you aim the ability, dealing steady damage for a while. It’s a great opportunity to group enemies up so they can be taken out by Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, and many other Ultimate abilities.</p><p><strong>Thornlash Wall:</strong> This ability places a small wall at the target location. You have several charges of this one, so multiple walls can be placed. It can be angled several different ways and will Awaken when Groot is nearby, causing it to attack nearby enemies. Use it to block off locations and, ideally, separate healers from the rest of their team. Divide and conquer, baby. If a Duelist gets too greedy and runs ahead of the pack, place a wall behind them to make them easy to knockout.</p><p><strong>Ironwood Wall:</strong> This ability places a larger Ironwood Wall at the target location. You can only place one of these at a time, so think strategically. It can also be angled, and when Groot is nearby, the Ironwood wall will awaken to grant Groot and his nearby allies bonus health based on the damage they deal. While the Thornlash Wall is good to keep nearby, you definitely want to keep Ironwood near points you are guarding.</p><p><strong>Furious Flora:</strong> This is Groot’s melee attack. Hold this down and Groot will perform a three-hit melee combo. The last hit launches into the air, but there isn’t really a reason to use this instead of Vine Strike.</p><p><strong>Spore Bomb:</strong> - This is a grenade-like projectile that explodes, dealing AOE (area-of-effect) damage. Three smaller explosives spread out and detonate again, making this a great tool to throw into groups of enemies. With a short, 6-second cooldown, you should use this basically every time it’s available.</p><p><strong>Flora Colossus (Passive):</strong> This passive awakens spawned walls near Groot, activating their secondary abilities.</p><p><strong>Friendly Shoulder (Team-Up Ability: Passive):</strong> If Jeff the Land Shark or Rocket Raccoon are on your team, they can ride on Groot’s shoulders, taking less damage than they otherwise would. It’s also incredibly cute, which is a bonus all by itself.</p><h2 id="h678072"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Groot?</h2><p>Groot is one of the best Tanks in the game if played correctly. He can solo Tank with steady healers and has lots of versatility due to his ability to create walls. The most potent part of his kit, and the one which takes the most practice, is creating line-of-sight obstructions to cause problems for healers on the opposing team. </p><figure id="" data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Use walls to defend key points, forcing enemies to waste time attacking your wooden constructs to make it through narrow hallways.

It definitely happened. However, it was still a fairly rare occurrence and most big-name actors were careful about appearing in too many. For example, Tommy Lee Jones and other Hollywood stars would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fly over to Japan and other countries to do commercials</a></span> so nobody over here in the States would see them. There was still a fear that if you sold out <em>too </em>much and <em>too </em>often you’d look desperate and signal that your career was ending. And this was the case for decades. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then Super Bowl commercials became bigger and bigger in the 2000s</a></span> and companies spent more and more to create a viral, popular ad. And as this was happening, the lines between TV, movies, and internet content started to blur, while streaming services and YouTube grew in popularity. Hustle culture—the belief that as long as you were getting paid it was worth it—also grew during this time.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> I remember people in 2015 cheering Kim Kardashian</a></span> for appearing in a big Super Bowl ad and celebrating that she “got paid!”</p><p>That has led us to 2025 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly every damn Super Bowl ad</a></span> including famous people to help sell soda or crackers. And it’s all so sad. Watching Harrison Ford, an actor whom I really like and who has turned in some incredible performances, try to connect being a hero to owning a Jeep made me want to throw my TV out the window. Being assaulted with 20 different variations on “Actors and celebs behaving wacky while holding branded products” made me want to throw my phone out the window. </p><p>I think what really drives me nuts about these ads is how transparently greedy it all is. A lot of the people appearing in these commercials don’t need the money and yet, they likely got paid quite a bit to appear. And they just don’t care anymore about even pretending to look like artists or creators with backbones and morals.</p><p> They know that most people don’t care anymore. Everything we watch appears on the same tiny phone screen. The delineation between movies and TV and random viral videos is gone. It’s been gone for awhile. And that means there isn’t anything stopping someone like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Keoghan appearing in an ad for Square Space</a></span>. It won’t ruin his career or cost him fans or make him less of an artist anymore. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actors can freely dig up past roles and characters</a></span>, skin them, and prance about for 30 seconds recreating some moment you might remember, and get paid a lot to do it while suffering no negative consequences.</p><p>You might wonder “Who does this hurt?” or “What’s the harm of celebs getting paid to do commercials?” And to be clear, none of this is really hurting anybody. There are certainly bigger problems in the world right now. But that doesn’t change that it sucks shit—it hurts <em>art</em>. Hawking products for cash makes you a salesperson, not an artist.</p><p>So my suggestion is simple: Let’s start making fun of celebs for selling out and reminding them that its gross. It’s going to take a few years to build up momentum and change anything, but if we pull this off and we go back to making actors and artists feel shame again, we all might be able to avoid shit like Seal appearing as a seal in a fucking soda ad. </p><p>Doesn’t that sounds like a future you want to live in? <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the first half of Season 1 drawing to a close, Marvel Rivals developer NetEase has published a new update regarding ranks. This update helps players understand what to expect at the end of the half and in the second half of the inaugural season and beyond.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, the studio said that the first half of the season will end on February 21. At that time, all rankings will be locked and players ranked Gold and higher will get a costume reward. Those Grandmaster and higher as well as the Top 500 will receive the “Crest of Honor”.</p>



<p>“In the second half of the season, we will be rolling out new costume rewards for Gold rank players, along with brand new Crests of Honor,” NetEase said. “These Crests will recognize players at Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All (the top 500), each with its own unique design to celebrate your skill!”</p>



<p>After the first-half ranks are settled, they will all be reason when the second half of Season 1 starts that day. When it starts, NetEase says  that players will see their rank drop by four divisions. In future seasons, that drop will be six divisions at the beginning and then a drop of four at the start of the second half of each season.</p>



<p>Lastly, the studio says that in order to make sure only players who actually play during the current season can earn rewards, players will need to play at least 10 matches in competitive mode along with meeting required ranking conditions.</p>



<p>What do you think of how Marvel Rivals is handling in-season ranks? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
Relic Entertainment, the studio behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/company-of-heroes">Company of Heroes</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>, has outlined its future plans as an independent studio - including a greater focus on smaller titles and older games - following its separation from Sega last year.
</p>
<p>
Relic was founded in 1997, becoming known for its work in the real-time strategy genre as the years went on. In 2013, the studio was acquired by Sega - but the companies last year announced they would be parting ways, with Relic becoming independent once more.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Relic has undergone a period of downsizing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-sega-studio-relic-hit-by-fresh-layoffs-following-sale">laying off 41 staff</a> last year (a move that followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-lays-off-121-employees-at-company-of-heroes-studio-relic-entertainment">major round of redundancies</a> in 2023), but now the studio has reemerged to discuss its future plans, announcing a "bold" vision that'll see it focusing on three key areas.

<p>
Part of the studio's new strategy will see it 'actively pursuing' the development of "smaller-scope, in-house games" alongside the larger, more complex strategy titles it's known for - all in order to "explore new genres and gameplay experiences".
</p>
<p>
It also intends to 're-imagine classics', through the likes of re-releases, remasters, and "brand-new franchise experiences that capture the spirit of the originals while appealing to a new generation of players." That's alongside Relic's third focus: a "deepening commitment" to and "robust support" for its existing titles, starting with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
The studio has already announced a new update and new DLC for Company of Heroes 3, both launching this month. Fire &amp; Steel, as the DLC is known, promises four new Battlegroups for multiplayer and co-op/skirmish vs. AI. There's the Heavy Weapons Battlegroup (US Forces), Terror Battlegroup (Wehrmacht), Canadian Shock Battlegroup (British Forces), and Panzerjäger Kommand Battlegroup (Afrikakorps), with more details to be revealed closer to release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap-features-chronicle-update-new-maps-sound-recorder-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a packed year of updates and new content coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> with its 2025 roadmap, starting with the Chronicle update, and extending to new maps, various map, character and event reworks, and more.</p>
<p>Alongside the roadmap reveal, Kinetic Games also announced that the game has passed 2 million sales on consoles, and over 22 million sales across all platforms. That’s great going!</p>



<p>The first major update of the year will be Chronicle, which was previewed at the end of 2024. This update will overhaul how evidence is collected, with a new Media tab that will gather together all the photos and videos you’ve collected, as well as audio recordings from the new Sound Recorder tool.</p>
<p>The second update in 2025 will the bring a player character overhaul, refreshing the character models, improving the animations, but stopping short of full player customisation, which will now come in 2026. That will allow the team to focus on the Horror 2.0 update that is also expected in 2026.</p>

<p>But there’s plenty more for 2025 still. A brand new map will be added, and there will be updated version of Bleasdale Farmhouse (arriving in March), Grafton Farmhouse and 6 Tanglewood Drive. The first of which, Bleasdale, will be releasing in March. each will have a complete artistic overhaul, new assets, new animations and a few layout changes to refresh how hunts progress.</p>
<p>Seasonal Events are also getting a bit of an overhaul for 2025, taking the first iteration of these from 2024 and adapting them to player feedback. There will be events for Easter, Halloween and Winter. While the actual event modifiers and goals will be similar, there will be personal rewards, wider map rotations, and more.</p>
<p>We had a great time <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/28/phasmophobia-early-access-console-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">exploring Phasmophobia for its console launch</a>, saying, “There’s a bunch of rough edges from adapting the controls to gamepad, and from that initial learning curve, but Phasmophobia is absolutely that kind of game – grab a few friends, go to a spooky house, and run around in the dark calling out to “Susan” or whatever their name was. You’ll have a hell of a time while you do.”</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dead by Daylight | 2v8: Resident Evil Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The Dead by Daylight collaborations take place outside of Resident Evil continuity, so the game doesn't have to explain how any of this fits into RE's storylines. But the 2v8 mode does feature a map from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3 that recreates Raccoon City's Police Department. Additionally, Resident Evil's green and yellow herbs can be found and used for healing by the heroes. But if either Wesker or Nemesis find the herbs first, they can destroy them and get a boost of speed.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has previously stated that there will be two survivor bots on every team in this 2v8 mode in order to reduce the killer queue time. The current Dead by Daylight x Resident Evil collaboration is only running through February 25. But we know of at least one big crossover coming down the line this summer: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-and-five-nights-at-freddys-are-finally-crossing-over/1100-6525552/" data-ref-id="1100-6525552">Dead by Daylight x Five Nights At Freddy's</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl LIX performance has generated a lot of online chatter, and surprisingly, not all of it has to do with Drake. When the Grammy-winning rapper took the stage for the halftime show, the stage itself took the form of a tic-tac-toe board--but X's and O's were accompanied by a triangle and a square, which were meant to evoke the aesthetic of a "PlayStation-style controller," according to the show's coordinators and set designers. The idea--which Lamar personally dreamed up--was meant to represent the rapper's life as though it were a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people," art director Shelley Rodgers told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" rel="nofollow ">Wired</a>. "A lot of it is showing his journey, [showing him] traveling through the American dream."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1888967930047594584" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show set was inspired by the PlayStation controller, show's art director says </p><p>"Each performance space was shaped like a button on a PlayStation-style controller, a performance intended to portray Lamar’s life as a video game." </p><p>Via: <a href="https://twitter.com/WIRED?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WIRED</a> <a href="https://t.co/OhQZmjTWEM" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/OhQZmjTWEM</a></p></div>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1888967930047594584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Creative director Mike Carson added that Lamar and his production company, pgLang, are "really into keeping things clean and minimal."</p><p dir="ltr">"We went with a monochromatic concrete look and allowed the video game motif to come alive through dialogue, lighting, choreography, and music," Carson said.</p><p dir="ltr">But despite the stage's streamlined, minimalist design, the folks running the show had several difficult hurdles to overcome. Lamar, his backup dancers, the lighting, and the stage itself had to be set up and ready to go in under eight minutes. Once the performance ended, production had had roughly six minutes to get everything off the field--without messing up the turf. Even though the Superdome's turf is synthetic, protecting it was still no small task, especially given the fact that part of the set dressing was a real GNX that had been heavily modified to allow Lamar's numerous backup dancers to enter the stage in a clown car-esque manner.</p><p dir="ltr">"They were on board with our vision from day one," Carson said of Shelley Rodgers, who worked to bring the vehicular optical illusion to life. "Even with this being one of the largest halftime footprints ever, Shelley and team came with clever ideas and guidance to help us maintain the design integrity and get this beast across the finish line."</p><p dir="ltr">But every good game needs a villain, and the halftime show appeared to serve as the final act in Lamar's seemingly endless beef with fellow rapper Drake. At one point in the show, Lamar told his female backup dancers that he wanted to perform "Not Like Us," but had decided against it because "people like to sue." But near the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his 13-minute performance</a>, Lamar performed a lightly censored version of the incredibly popular diss track. The "life as a video game" theme also resurfaced at the end of the show, with Lamar yelling "Game Over!" as the same words appeared in lights across the stadium.</p><p>Drake has yet to make a statement about the halftime performance. Lamar's rival was <a href="https://athlonsports.com/entertainment/drake-kendrick-lamar-reaction-halftime-show-super-bowl-beef" rel="nofollow ">reportedly out of the country</a> during the Super Bowl.</p>

			<p>Last Friday saw the release of the newest dungeon in Destiny 2, titled Sundered Doctrine. In this dungeon, Savathûn guides the Guardians through a Pyramid ship filled with Dread. Alongside the release of this dungeon, an official Dungeon Race will take place, where fireteams will be competing against each other to complete the activity with Contest Mode enabled. The first verified team that finishes the dungeon will receive a customized trophy. Those who complete Contest Mode within the first 48 hours will receive a special emblem and Exotic Weapon. Once the Contest Mode has been completed by a fireteam, Normal Mode will then unlock.</p>
<p>This content launched alongside Heresy, the new episodic content in Destiny 2 which followed on from<a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players/"> Revenant</a> and Echoes.</p>
<p>For those who want to see the teams that competed, you can watch it on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/evanf1997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cbgray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cbgrayYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiktok</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For anyone who completes the dungeon by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the <a href="https://bungiestore.com/rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie Rewards</a> offer that will allow you to purchase the Sundered Doctrine assortment, which includes a work shirt, dungeon bracelet, and pin. Additionally, those who complete the Delver Title by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the Bungie Rewards offer to purchase the Sundered Doctrine Title Pin. Above is a picture of some of the gear that you can purchase should you complete the dungeon in the required timeframe.</p>
<p>Along with the Sundered Doctrine dungeon being launched in Destiny 2, Destiny 2: Heresy launched, which takes Guardians back to Oryx's flagship named the Dreadnaught. Along with this comes new weapons, gear, and subclass Aspects. There will also be new artifact mods to collect and help you become more powerful in-game.</p>
<p>For those who like group content, The Nether debuts as a three-player activity that you can participate in, where players are able to harness the power of the Taken and utilize it to disrupt Anchors and stop the Taken invasion. This event is inspired by the events of Shattered Realm and The Coil.</p>
<p>The Nether event will also feature randomized encounters to keep the content fresh, as well as unique challenges to undertake and opportunities to make your build even stronger by harnessing the strength of powerful boons.</p>

            <p>
Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has hailed PC gaming's "increasing share of the market", in what you could optimistically interpret as the prelude to a GTA 6 PC release date announcement, and less optimistically, as a simple reassurance to investors who are fretting about the decline of console game sales.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> is slated to release on Xbox and PlayStation in fall 2025. As per Rockstar Games tradition, the PC release remains TBA. For context, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> released on PC around 18 months after hitting Xbox 360 and PS3, while GTA 4 took an extra eight months or so, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> a year. 
</p>
<p>
This strategy of releasing PC versions late persists despite Zelnick's comment in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">Ian Games</a> that the PC version of a multiplatform game can account for over 40% of overall sales. "We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," he told the site. "Of course, there will be a new console generation." 
</p>
<p>
Here is some slapdash background on the console biz, which is undergoing something of an evolutionary slow period. Only Nintendo - who basically operate their own games industry nested matryoshka doll-style inside the regular games industry - have announced their next big piece of hardware. We've yet to hear about PS6 and whatever Microsoft call the Nextbox, so there's a bit of a gap on the industry earnings forecast. In the meantime, the existing consoles are slowly petrifying like forgotten dragons, shifting fewer and fewer units between them.
</p><p>
Zelnick reckons the release of GTA 6 might help with flagging console sales, even in a year when the US presidency is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/esa-warns-of-negative-impact-to-come-with-trump-s-video-game-tariffs">picking lots of fights with trading partners</a>. And if it doesn't, hey, there's always the apparently thriving PC market.
</p>
<p>
"When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles," he told IGN. "And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC."
</p>
<p>OK, so, once more with feeling: GTA 6 PC release date when? Being a bear of little brain, I can't really explain Rockstar's tendency to show up late on PC, but I imagine it's not a resource question, given that Rockstar have thousands of developers and still earn megabucks from GTA 5 re-releases and GTA Online. The explanation that makes most sense to me is simply that shipping on PC "late" is an excuse to double-dip - max out the console sales initially, then polish up the tech for re-release on more capable PCs and, perhaps, the next generation of consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the biggest games of 2025 are out this month, as well as some of the longest, with February bookended by massive RPGs that many players may spend all year slowly chipping away at. </p><p>Fans of open-world games are getting a slight reprieve.<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>was originally also going to drop this month but was pushed to March at the last minute. That will free players up to take on sprawling adventures like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> instead. But there are a lot of cool-looking smaller games to checkout this month as well, at least a few of which could become sleeper GOTY contenders in their own right. Here are all the major game releases in February 2025:<br></p></div></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is one of those sequels that takes the first game and tries to make it bigger, more detailed, and more immersive in every way. Based on early reviews, it basically accomplishes that. The medieval RPG sim is bursting with detailed side quests and gameplay friction that makes merely surviving a challenge. It’s been topping the Steam charts this month, even if its grueling realism won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Warhorse Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Deep Silver</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The Nintendo Switch exclusive is now on PC. Where <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em> was a rhythm-based dungeon crawler,<em> Rift </em>is a more familiar <em>Guitar Hero</em>-style puzzle adventure. It takes the enemy pattern recognition of the previous game and applies the escalating anxiety of combat that doesn’t end until the song’s over. It’s really great. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Brace Yourself Games, Tic Toc Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Klei Publishing</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Momodora: Moonlit Farewell</em> is the latest entry in the <em>Momodora</em> series. Released on PC last year, the 2D, magic-infused anime Metroidvania is now on consoles as well. In a crowded genre, it manages to stand out thanks to beautiful art and fun exploration. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Bombservice</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Playism </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Civilization VII</em> is the first new 4X game in the franchise in roughly a decade, and looks to streamline some of the strategy series’ gameplay while also making important changes like altering how historical eras work and adding new crisis events that can upend how things progress. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/civ-7-civilization-6-steam-reviews-ui-early-access-1851757977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/civ-7-civilization-6-steam-reviews-ui-early-access-1851757977">Early players have hammered it</a></span> for its UI and other elements feeling “unfinished,” but it has a strong foundation to build on. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Firaxis Games</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> 2K</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Urban Myth Dissolution Center </em>is a visual novel in which you investigate cursed relics and paranormal anomalies against the backdrop of creepy, lo-fi cutscenes. As Azami Fukurai, you take on the role of detective, working for a <em>Ghostbusters</em>-like organization where you scrape social media to unravel urban legends. I hope it’s basically <em>X-Files</em> with cool psychedelic pixel art.</p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Hakababunko</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Shueisha Games</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>Slimes are usually introduced early on in RPGs as the easiest enemies to kill. In <em>Slime Heroes</em>, however, you actually play as one. It’s a souls-like action-RPG platformer in which you collect gems to unlock new abilities and enact your revenge on a colorful, uncaring world. There’s also local and online co-op. Slime buddies unite!</p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Pancake Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Whitehorn Games</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II</em> is the latest turn-based RPG in the sprawling <em>Trails</em> series. It takes place directly after the events of the first game, and includes cameos from veteran characters that will be harder to appreciate unless you’re up to speed on the previous entries. But if you’re looking for a long, intricate JRPG, this one’s for you. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Nihon Falcom</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> NIS America </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>The second batch of remastered classic <em>Tomb Raider</em> games has arrived. <em>Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered</em> charts the action-adventure series’ shift from PS1 to PS2 and will include some of the bumpier games in the series history. Hopefully, the remastered elements make them easier to appreciate in a new light. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Aspyr, Crystal Dynamics</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Aspyr</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>It’s been a while since we had a big, meaty first-person fantasy RPG. <em>Avowed,</em> from the studio behind <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, will combine <em>Skyrim</em>-like gameplay with the world and lore of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with a heavy emphasis on side quests and negotiating between various factions. It’ll be on Game Pass day one for PC and Ultimate subscribers. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Obsidian Entertainment </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Xbox Game Studios</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>Four friends reunite later in life to retrace their memories of a pivotal summer long ago. <em>Lost Records</em> seems like <em>It</em> for ‘90s kids, leaning more into tech-fueled alienation than occult horror. It’ll be out in two parts with the first one coming this month. I don’t normally mesh well with narrative-driven adventure games but this one has me more intrigued than most. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Dontnod </p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Dontnod</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>  “War is over. War is just beginning.” That’s the slogan of <em>Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog</em>, a retro sci-fi love letter to ‘80s anime where you manage a patrol ship on the edge of space investigating a strange new anomaly. It’s narrative-focused, so be ready for lots of reading, but the pixel-art animations of everything from ship console controls to mechs fighting in space look incredible. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Space Colony Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Astrolabe Games, Meridiem Games</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>When it comes to <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, you either know or you don’t. If you don’t, all that matters is it’s a real-time action spin-off taking place after the events of <em>Infinite Wealth</em>. It follows beloved side-character Goro Majima as he sails around to various islands taking on the local criminal underworld. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Sega</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The once-forgotten Game Boy Advance exclusive is finally back. Action platformer <em>Ninja Five-O</em> was one of the Nintendo handheld’s most underrated games. Now players can once again step into the shoes of ninja Joe Osugi as he takes down a group of mystical terrorists in retro side-scrolling levels. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Limited Run Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Konami</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>With an emphasis on wild movement, <em>The Local </em>is a first-person open-world shoot-em-up that looks super rad. All your favorite movement types are here including rail grinding,  sliding, wall running, climbing, air strafing, and bunny hopping. There’s also multiplayer and a leaderboard for chasing high scores. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Tobey Gronow</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>JINC</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p>It’s time to duel! Yugi Mutou returns to card battling in a collection of over a dozen of the franchise’s earliest games, now with online play, save anywhere, rewind, and other modern quality-of-life features. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Digital Eclipse </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Konami </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Switch</p></div><div><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>is finally makings its current-gen debut with <em>Wilds</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>built from the ground up for modern high-end consoles and gaming PCs. If you’ve never hopped on the monster hunting train before, now is probably the time. <em>Wilds</em> is shaping up to be one of the more visually impressive and mechanically rich entries in the action-RPG series. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Capcom </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Capcom </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The biggest (and only real) golfing franchise returns this month with its latest entry.<em> PGA Tour 2K25</em> overhauls the MyPlayer creation options and adds new swing settings and other tweaks. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> HB Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> 2K</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The viral moment of the show was Lamar performing his now five-time Grammy-winning song “Not Like Us.” The song is one of many Lamar released during a public feud with Drake back in 2024, and has become a cultural phenomenon. With over a billion streams and multiple clips of entire crowds performing it (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including the Grammy’s audience</a></span>), millions of people are celebrating a song that accuses Drake of being a culture vulture pedophile in reference to years of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allegations of grooming young women</a></span> in the entertainment industry. The song is a scathing diss on its own, but when it goes on to become a record-breaking, award-winning hit, that’s when you know you’ve lost the rap battle.</p><p>Lamar’s performance of “Not Like Us” was a big moment for the show in a few ways. At the midpoint of the show, Lamar had a brief intermission with some of the show’s dancers, during which he said he wanted to “perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,” while the instrumental “No Like Us” briefly played. This was seemingly a reference to Drake’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple lawsuits regarding the song</a></span>, and at first, it seemed to imply that Lamar was barred from playing it at the show. He then transitioned into a medley of “Luther” and “All the Stars” featuring the immaculate R&amp;B singer SZA, my queen, and it seemed like that was it. Lamar would omit his biggest hit seemingly to avoid further controversy…until about three minutes later, when he went to chat with his dancers one more time, said this was “bigger than the music,” and that someone “tried to rig the game, but you can’t fake influence.” Again, this was seemingly about Drake’s lawsuit trying to muzzle the song’s cultural impact.</p><p>Then he starts rapping and the crowd goes wild. In Super Bowl halftime shows, artists have to trim down their songs to maybe a minute or two, and the section of “Not Like Us” Lamar chose to perform is the most explicitly aimed at Drake, even calling him out by name. One popular meme is the point when Lamar looks into the camera with a devilish, shit-eating grin and says, “Hey Drake, I hear you like ‘em young.” The word “pedophile” was left out of the song, replaced by a wordless shout in the live show, but he still had the entire Caesars Superdome crowd singing along to, “Trying to strike a chord and it’s probably A Minor.” Fatality.</p><p>Lamar’s cocky strut while he smiles into the camera became an instant meme, but the entire show was a victory lap in a year-long campaign to bury Drake.</p><p>Hopefully not lost in the sauce is that this was also a commentary on the state of the United States and its attempts to silence Black voices. Samuel L. Jackson made multiple appearances during the show as the U.S. propaganda character Uncle Sam. He starts off emphasizing that the Super Bowl is “The Great American Game,” followed by Lamar rapping the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GNX </em>teaser</a></span> that was released before his latest album, but has yet to be put on streaming services. However, he included a new lyric: “The revolution about to be televised. You picked the right time but the wrong guy.” This was seemingly a dig at fear-mongering President Donald Trump, who was in the audience but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left during the second half</a></span>.</p><p>Uncle Sam returns after Lamar performs “Squabble Up,” one of his more rap-heavy tracks, and calls it “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto.” Then Lamar’s dancers, dressed in red, white and blue, arrange themselves to look like the American flag while he raps. Uncle Sam shows up a few more times to berate Lamar for not playing up what America believes the Super Bowl to be about. After the SZA medley, Sam appears one more time to say that “nice and calm” melodic songs are “what America wants.” He then proceeds to drag Drake across an entire football field. . As incredible as it was to see Drake get bodied on the biggest stage possible, this was a critique of the current state of America and the country’s history of policing Black art and voices. A lot of fans are hoping the overarching message of the show isn’t lost.</p><p>Lamar has had an incredible year and isn’t slowing down. Both he and SZA are preparing to embark on a co-headlining tour starting in April, and after seeing this show I might be about to buy tickets. Stream <em>GNX</em> and also SZA’s <em>Lana</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
