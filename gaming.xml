		<p>One of the most exciting projects we’ve been able to check out recently has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/prologue-go-wayback-playerunknowns-glimpse-of-a-digital-future-that-teaches-us-to-survive-in-the-present/">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>. There’s a whole host of reasons as to why it’s exciting, but the first amongst them is that it’s coming from PlayerUnknown Studios, the development team headed by Brendan ‘PlayerUnknown’ Greene, known globally for the smash hit battle royale PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds, or PUBG. This new trailer is the first true taste of the game’s gameplay outside of our press viewing and selected beta testing. You should definitely join us in the excitement.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KI6H_WNHUlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Prologue uses procedural generation and machine learning to create an 8km by 8km map every single time you play. For context, that’s the same size as Skyrim’s map, and just as with Bethesda’s RPG hit, if you can see it, you can walk there. In fact, that’s the whole point of the game. Your task here is to survive, with each iteration of the map liable to cause you immense stress and strain as you fight against the elements, and your own hunger and thirst. You have to stay warm, dry, fed and watered, and that is far harder than you might first think.</p>
<p>Your task is to make it to the weather station. Each time you drop into the game you’ll start in a cabin, and the weather station will be somewhere between 3km and 6km away. There’s no mini-map, or route finding, you have to use an in-game physical map that your character holds up to read, while then referring to your compass to choose the direction. Just as you would in real life if you were lost in the woods, you have to navigate by the monuments and landscape details that you can see, finding other shacks or cabins along the way that hopefully contain better clothing or additional food to keep you going through the night.</p>


<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is the perfect survival game, and it can really look quite beautiful, assuming you’re able to survive long enough to see it. Prologue: Go Way Back will release into Early Access this summer for PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has released the first gameplay trailer for its second project, the single-player open world survival game Prologue: Go Wayback. The Amsterdam-based developer also revealed that it will be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early access</a> starting this Summer for the rather low price of $20, which will not be increased after the end of the early access phase (estimated to be around a year).</p>
<p>In the game, players are dropped into a vast and wild landscape, equipped with just an old map and the basic tools to stay alive. The mission is simple: reach the weather station, but how to get there depends entirely on the player.</p>
<p>The world is dynamic and unpredictable. The weather can change at a moment's notice, forcing players to adapt to fierce storms and freezing temperatures. Gathering resources, finding shelter, and foraging for food will be essential. Extreme weather conditions can affect the character's stats. Items and even buildings found along the way can be repaired. Additionally, each playthrough will be completely different since it is generated by the studio's machine-learning technology.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KI6H_WNHUlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Brendan 'PlayerUnknown' Greene himself, diving deeply into his 10-plus-year plan to get the metaverse right. Prologue: Go Wayback follows the tech demo Preface: Undiscovered World (which is live now on Steam) and is a mid-step toward the final, full-fledged planet-sized massively multiplayer game codenamed Project Artemis. Unlike Preface and Artemis, it is made with Unreal Engine, albeit mixed with the studio's in-house custom machine learning terrain generation technology.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned interview, Greene said about Prologue: Go Wayback:</p>
<p><em>Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. It's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a testbed for our ML tech.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</em></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is living up to its name, with some truly wild player numbers following its debut.</p>
<p>The next installment in Capcom's Monster Hunter series went live earlier today (28th February) and quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak on Steam.</p>

<p>At the time of writing and according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 933,446 Monster Hunter Wilds players on Valve's platform. It currently has an all time player peak of 987,482, although it seems likely it will smash past this number over the weekend. This makes Wilds one of the most-played games on Steam, surpassing peak player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and even <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>To compare further, Monster Hunter World has an all-time player peak of 334,684, meaning Wilds has almost tripled the former's peak player numbers in less than a day. Are you one of them?</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Capcom gave us all a little teaser for what lies in store for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-content-update-brings-a-new-level-of-challenge-in-april">Monster Hunter Wilds' first post-launch content update</a>, which is now confirmed to be launching some time in "early April". This update will include a "new level of challenge" for players.</p>
<p>But, as for what players can expect in the here and now, well it sounds like quite a rather good ol' time. In fact, our Matt recently awarded the game four out of five stars, calling Wilds the "most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter" to date.</p>
<p>"Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p>
<p>If you are planning on making your way into the wilds of Wilds this weekend, but need a little point in the right direction, be sure to check out our guides coverage. Here's one on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-save-autosave-monster-hunter-wilds">how to save in Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and another on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-upgrade-weapons-monster-hunter-wilds">how to upgrade weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to get you started.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-improve-seikret-controls/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Continuing a process that began with Monster Hunter World, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> attempts to further streamline the series formula to reduce the time players spend in menus and at the base camp to keep them on the field as much as possible, providing them with all the tools they need to effortlessly traverse the new open-world maps.</p>
<p>Among these new tools the game provides is the Seikret, a friendly Bird Wyvern that assists Hunters by giving them access to Supply items and an additional weapon while making traversal way faster than on foot. Unlike Monster Hunter Rise's Palamutes, which served a similar traversal purpose, however, Seikret don't really feel good to control due to some default control settings that the game never really explains unless the player goes through them manually.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250225165234_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The settings you will want to change as soon as you begin your adventure in Monster Hunter Wilds are the Call Seikret Controls (Radial Menu), and the Seikret Manual Controls found on the second page of the Controls menu in the main Options menu. The first one is, by default, set to Auto-move, which puts the Seikret into Auto-move after calling it from either a shortcut or the Radial Menu, which makes the Bird Wyvern head towards any highlighted target, whether it is a resource you have highlighted yourself on the map or any target monster. This option is far from being the best, as it wrestles control away from the player upon calling the Seikret, and having to press buttons to slow it down and make it stop feels clunky and uncomfortable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250225165952_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Seikret Manual Controls option is even more important to change to have better control of the Seikret. The default option, Type 1, makes the Seikret move without player input, similar to Auto-move, as pressing nothing maintains the current speed, while additional button presses are required to slow it down and make it stop. Type 2 is a much, much better option in pretty much every scenario, as the Seikret will only move with directional inputs without needing additional button presses to change the beast's speed, just like controlling the Hunter. And if you still want the Seikret to bring you to your target automatically, you can still activate Auto-move at any time, so changing the Seikret controls this way will provide you with the best traversal options the game has to offer for all sorts of situations. If you're so used to how you call the Palamute in Monster Hunter Rise, you can also change the Call Seikret Controls option so as to be able to call the Seikret by holding the circle/B button with your weapon sheated.</p>
