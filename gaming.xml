			<p>Black Desert continues to get updates, with new classes and new content added to the game all the time. Most recently, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">Land of the Morning Light: Seoul expansion</a> was released, where players were taken to Ancient Korea, where they could explore architecture, meet new characters, and fight off new enemies in the expansion. Today, it's been announced that the new gunslinging class, Deadeye, is available in early access. Those who want the opportunity to try out Deadeye will be able to go through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/News/Detail?groupContentNo=7956&amp;countryType=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Desert Global Lab</a>, where you'll get to experiment with the class' revolvers, shotgun, and Lil' Devil.</p>
<p>This announcement comes after Pearl Abyss marked a decade of Black Desert at Calpheon Ball, which is a global community event that took place at the Suwon Messe in South Korea. For those unable to attend, the event was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlI-kQ6MCew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live-streamed</a>, and players got to see a ton of announcements unveiled as a celebration of the game's longevity.</p>
<p>The 29th class for Black Desert will be launching worldwide on Black Desert Online and Black Desert Mobile on December 24. Additionally, those who have been wanting to try out this MMORPG but don't want to spend any money on it will be able to get it completely free on Steam right now as a limited-time gift for the holiday season. This comes during the Steam Winter Sale, which runs through January 2.</p>

<p>Additionally, as there will be an influx of new players thanks to the game being given away for free, they have boosted progression for those who are just joining. This comes with a 1000% combat EXP boost, which will fast-track progression for those who are on Season Servers. Players will also be able to get Graduation Rewards. These are special materials that players can obtain, which will allow them to craft Ornette's and Odore's Spirit Essence, as well as PEN Boss gear as a reward for completing the latest season.</p>
<p>There are plenty of updates that have been made to Black Desert, including a new mount that has been added to the game, and will be released on January 16, 2025. Black Desert Mobile specifically will also be receiving some major updates, with new content being added to the game in 2025.

			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance will be improved over the open beta, as the game will deliver a better experience than the test version with the same hardware configuration.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-Launch Community Update stream</a>, director Yuya Tokuda confirmed that, while the team cannot provide specifics yet regarding PC performance, PC performance will definitely be improved over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-struggles-1080p-rtx-4070/">open beta test</a>, so players should expect a better experience on the same hardware as in the test version.</p>
<p>During the stream, it was also confirmed that Monster Hunter Wilds will receive a PlayStation 5 Pro day-one patch that will offer some yet-to-be-detailed improvements over the base model. In addition, it was also confirmed that on base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the Prioritize Graphics mode will target 2160p output resolution upscaled from 3072x1728 resolution and 30 FPS. The Prioritize Framerate mode, on the other hand, will target 2160p output resolution upscaled from 1080p and 60 FPS. On Xbox Series X, Monster Hunter Wilds will feature a single display mode that will target 1080p resolution and 30 FPS gameplay. In all cases, AMD FSR will be used to upscale the rendering resolution to the output resolution and not checkerboard rendering as in the open beta version.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds Pre-Launch Community Update also goes over plenty of other changes coming to the final version of the game over the test version, such as weapon-specific changes, the return of hitstop, and more. You can check out the entire stream below.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1870106910751703303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">end-of-year message</a> on social media platform X, GSC Game World pledges to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>throughout next year. As a reminder, the company recently released a major patch for the game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">features over 1800 fixes</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio promises to share the&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap at the start of 2025, although it doesn't commit to a specific date. It's likely we'll get to see what GSC Game World has planned for its latest game sometime in January or February at the very latest.</p>

Though the update was promised for Xbox Series X|S, it seems to be coming to PS5 as well, if GSC Game World's message is anything to go by.</p>

<p>In the post, GSC Game World says the next-gen patch for "the console versions" of&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone Trilogy&nbsp;</em>will arrive next year, and the PC versions of the games will also bring the enhancements introduced by said patch.</p>

<p>They'll include "additional graphical enhancements and other features", as well as mod support, although the latter may be a while away yet.</p>

However, <em>Sonic 3</em>’s isn’t quite as self-explanatory as those in the first two movies if you’re not already familiar with the blue blur and all his friends (and enemies). The first two movies’ post-credits scenes felt like natural extensions of the movies they came from, but <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s is a bit more disorienting and might have left new fans a bit confused.

It starts with Sonic running around, seemingly racing against Tails and Knuckles as seen earlier in the movie. However, in his haste, the hedgehog takes a wrong turn or two and ends up in a New York state park. A bit far from your home in Green HIlls, Montana, my guy. Once there, he’s greeted by none other than Metal Sonic, an evil synthetic recreation of our hero who Doctor Eggman creates in the games to try and match Sonic’s speed and power. At first, Sonic outmaneuvers Metal as his attacker attempts to obliterate him with an energy blast from a cannon in his arm, but is then suddenly surrounded by a squad of his robotic doppelgangers. Just as they all jump in to take him out, they’re struck by a flying hammer covered in pink chaos energy similar to Sonic’s blue and Shadow’s red. It returns to its wielder: a hooded figure who reveals herself to be a pink hedgehog before the movie cuts to black.</p><figure id="" data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-recommend-id="image://50fa5ec864ab98406316a28bf7e88f7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy stands in front of machinery in the White Space in Sonic Generations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re not one of the long-time fans who likely was popping off at this point in the theater, this hammer-using vigilante is Amy Rose. She originally debuted alongside Metal Sonic in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog CD </em>back in 1993. For most of her early appearances, Amy was defined as Sonic’s one-sided love interest—she was infatuated with the hero, but he was too busy being the fastest hedgehog alive to consider something as trivial as romance. However, as the years have gone on, Amy has become a much more well-rounded character and a team leader in her own right. Historically, she’s added some girlypop spunk to the <em>Sonic </em>cast, and after being a boys club for three movies, the live-action universe is in dire need of that.</p><p>But what are she and Metal Sonic doing in the live-action movies? Again, this scene feels pretty disconnected from the rest of the film, so there’s only so much we can pull from in this short exchange. Given that Sonic has traveled to a different part of the country than we’ve seen in the movies thus far, it’s entirely possible Amy has already been on Earth by herself for some time and decided to be a vigilante in New York. How she got here, where she comes from, and just how she’ll feel about more alien animals in her space remains to be seen, but seeing as <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>doubles down on the idea of Sonic and his kind being aliens from different places, it stands to reason that Amy is not from Earth, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-recommend-id="image://ff775c929a58fd96df881621f62ba5c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic looks down at something off-screen in Sonic Forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The bigger question mark in this scene is Metal Sonic. Eggman builds the robot hedgehog in the games, but as we saw not 10 minutes prior, Jim Carrey’s version of the mad scientist has seemingly kicked the bucket in a final moment of heroism. Granted, they also pretended to kill him off at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>, but there were more explicit teases to his survival than anything in <em>Sonic 3</em>. Agent Stone, Eggman’s loyal henchman, has seemingly turned a new leaf at the end of the movie as well, so he’s probably off the table. In theory, anyone could have seen all the events of the first three movies and decided to create a robot version of Sonic, but there’s still the question of why. That’s the major difference between this post-credits scene and previous ones; this one feels almost abstract, introducing new ideas and characters who have no clear, direct connection to what happened in the movie it bookends. I wouldn’t be surprised if this scene is featured in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em>, maybe 10 to 15 minutes into the film with more context to fill in these gaps. But for now, the only thing we really know as a result of this scene is who the new players will be in the next film.</p><p>The second post-credits scene is much shorter and more straightforward. We see that one of Shadow’s inhibitor rings has made a small crater on Earth after it fell to the planet during the final battle in space. The shot lingers briefly before we see Shadow walk into the frame and pick it up. It’s not much, but it confirms that Shadow survived the destruction of the Eclipse Cannon and will be around for the next movie. That’s not too surprising. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is heavily based on <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, in which Shadow is presumed dead after the final battle, only to return in <em>Sonic Heroes</em> after being rescued by Eggman. There are reports of plans for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow-centric spin-off</a></span>, too, so of course they didn’t kill him off for good.</p><p>Overall, I’m starting to wonder if <em>Sonic 4</em> could be a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. Metal Sonic is the primary antagonist of that game, and if Shadow’s reported spin-off introduces the rest of his team, treasure-hunting spy Rouge the Bat and decommissioned Eggman robot E-123 Omega, they’re already halfway to having most of <em>Heroes</em>’ cast accounted for. Whatever the fourth movie ends up being, <em>Sonic </em>fans have a lot to chew on after the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>.

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Cloud Imperium Games Undergoes Major Shake-Up to Hit Deadlines]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-major-shake-up/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-cloud-imperium-games-undergoes-major-shake-up-to-hit-deadlines.1066341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-major-shake-up/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Star Citizen and Squadron 42 developer Cloud Imperium Games has undergone a significant shake-up to its upper management team to hit its deadlines.</p>



<p>Speaking to sources who wish to stay anonymous as they cannot publically talk about the company’s plans, several top-level executives have been laid off, and other top people at the company have been shifted to different roles.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the changes were starting to be implemented earlier this month, with head honcho Christ Roberts announcing the news to staff in an internal memo following the company’s annual “<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/20371-Letter-From-The-Chairman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Letter from the Chairman</a>.” In late November 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games also let go of some of its staff</a>, prominently those in the QA department, as a part of its restructuring efforts.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Insider Gaming has heard of at least three executives with a combined experience of around 25 years at Cloud Imperium Games who have had their positions terminated. It’s said that announcements of their departures will be announced in due time.</p>



<p>In an internal announcement to employees, Chris Roberts said, To achieve this laser focus [of meeting the release of SQ42 and Star Citizen 1.0], it is more important than ever to ensure we have high-performing and efficient teams working throughout the company. In order to achieve this, I have had to make changes to the structure of our teams from the very top of the company and downwards to ensure we have the right people in the right roles, working in person as much as possible from our most critical year yet.”</p>



<p>Speaking with staff, some believe that the change is to save costs rather than to meet deadlines, with rumors around the office even suggesting that Sandi Gardiner, the wife of Chris Roberts, is to return to the company in a more prominent role. Sandi Gardiner left Cloud Imperium Games in May 2019 but remained on the board of directors.</p>

<p>Fortnite has just announced the return of Renegade Raider and Aerial Assault Trooper skins, now available in the OG Season Shop.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-renegade-raider-returns-to-fortnite">Renegade Raider Returns to Fortnite</h2>



<p>After appearing in the original season, the Renegade Raider, the rarest skin, has made its way back to the Fortnite Item Shop. The skin costs 1,200 V-Bucks, but you must unlock it before purchasing it. The OG Season Shop now consists of 4 new cosmetics: the Aerial Assault One Glider, the Aerial Assault Trooper Skin, Renegade Raider Skin and Raider’s Revenge Pickaxe; each of them has to be unlocked by collecting a specific amount of XP before being able to purchase them.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Aerial Assault One Glider – 500 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 500,000 XP)</li>



<li>Aerial Assault Trooper Skin – 1,200 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 1,000,000 XP)</li>



<li>Renegade Raider Skin – 1,200 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 1,500,000 XP)</li>



<li>Raider’s Revenge Pickaxe – 1,500 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 1,500,000 XP)</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the original owners of Renegade Raider and/or Aerial Assault Trooper from 2017 are receiving a token of appreciation from Fortnite. They will receive an exclusive style for both skins in the spring of 2025. All new cosmetics will be removed from the item store on January 31, 2025, so players have till then to gain the XP.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Today, the 2025 roadmap for Once Human was revealed, and with it came some very exciting details for those who play the game. The team behind this horror survival game shared details today on the release date for the mobile version of Once Human, new scenarios coming soon, custom servers, and more. If you want to watch the broadcast for yourself, make sure to check out the video below, where you can watch all of the announcements.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Human | Nalcott New Year Stream" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EH9Z3B2bjkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since its initial release in 2024, Once Human has been highly successful; it has ranked among the top sellers on Steam, and the game has seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-august-update-out-includes-animal-ranching/">consistent updates</a> that add new content, luring players back into the game and providing them with new ways to enjoy the post-apocalyptic world of Once Human. Below is the official roadmap for 2025, where you can see all of the major updates they have planned for the year.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Admittedly, the three new scenarios for Once Human won't be released until much later in the year, with a set release date during Q3 2025. However, the scenarios now have names, which are the following: Code: Purification, Code: Deviation, and Code: Broken. The details of the scenarios have also been announced so players can know what to expect from them when they are released.</p>
<p>Code: Purification is a scenario where the players must prevent pollution from taking over the environment by participating in dynamic events. Players will be tasked with teaming up to clear up the pollution and see the world clearly and unpolluted once more. This scenario has several endings that players can see, depending on the actions that they take during the scenario.</p>
<p>Code: Deviation revolves around the ally Deviations, who are the most popular characters in Once Human. In this scenario, players are tasked with hunting and capturing them, to then fuse them together to create new Deviations to battle against each other in a tournament.</p>
<p>Code: Broken is a PvP free-for-all, where players will get to battle over ten days with randomized events, resources, and apocalyptic superweapons that will cause absolute havoc on the battlefield. Much like Code: Purification, there are multiple endings for this event.</p>
<p>One of the other major announcements is that the mobile version of Once Human will be launching in April 2025. Currently, those who register their interest in the Once Human Mobile version <a href="https://tracking.us.nylas.com/l/6ce931d3de6e45e0ae0c615902ae457b/3/deaf88540e237b9a0062cc0ed5c4ad92a48dca5fd94a93e6393c76c69ba45504?cache_buster=1734626229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via a link</a> will have the chance to win rewards, such as money, in-game rewards, or even an iPhone.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is not getting a PlayStation 5 Pro patch likely due to the lack of a real path to improve image quality on the system.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how developer CD Projekt Red may have decided not to release a PlayStation 5 Pro patch for their latest game because there was no clear way to offer better image quality, beyond using the console's bigger GPU to enhance the game's Dynamic Resolution Scaling, which is already done via the system's Game Boost feature.</p>
<p>Improving Cyberpunk 2077 ray tracing features could have been among the possibilities on PlayStation 5 Pro, but having been developed with an older SDK, CD Projekt Red didn't have access to certain ray tracing and hardware optimization, and would have had to upgrade SDK first before being able to introduce features like ray-traced reflections or global illumination, something that would have opened more issues and require an engineering effort. Introducing PSSR support, additionally, may not have been worth it, as it may not have offered any substantial improvement over AMD FSR.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077: Why Isn't There A PS5 Pro Patch - And What Enhancements Are Possible?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lz5bowN_SLk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 will not get a PlayStation 5 Pro update, CDPR still hasn't abandoned the game entirely. A new update was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-2-adds-several-new-customization-features-and-improved-photo-mode/">last week</a>, introducing new features and improvements, such as new customization options for V, new Photo Mode options and more.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Liberty expansion</a> is also available, but only on PC and current generation systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have announced&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine</em>, a sort of prologue episode for the main game that you'll be able to play for free next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/515196772511908425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, Ice-Pick Lodge describes&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>as a "free prelude" that's "not quite" a demo, although it has similarities to a demo. The studio compares&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>The Marble Nest</em>, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/505230/view/5156014950378312752" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">teaser</a> released prior to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>that Ice-Pick described as a "mood piece".</p>

<p>Despite the similarities,&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>won't function in quite the same way as&nbsp;<em>The Marble Nest</em>; rather than being a self-contained story, it'll "showcase fragments of gameplay mechanics, set the stage for the story, and pull back the curtain a bit" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-announced-street.jpg?itok=swgWRvEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-announced-street.jpg?itok=XCjK9Yqw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>is designed to set up the main&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>experience.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will, according to Ice-Pick, tie into the events of the main game, and it'll "partially overlap" with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s intro, but it'll also give you the chance to see unique scenes you won't see in the main game.</p>

<p>You'll also get the chance to get your first glimpse of the Capital, where the Bachelor's lab is located, and you'll get to discover what drove the Bachelor to leave his lab. Along the way, you'll be diagnosing patients and trying to figure out their secrets as you go.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date or even a more specific release window for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>yet, but it goes without saying that you can almost certainly expect this free teaser to arrive sometime before the game itself does.</p>




<p><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in October</a>, although technically speaking, it was actually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed in July 2020</a> as an expansion to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>(which is itself both a remake of and sequel of sorts to the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>).</p>

<p>As such, in&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, you'll play as&nbsp;Daniil Dankovsky, also known as the Bachelor. You arrive in a small town beset by the plague, and it's up to you to discover said plague's mysterious origins and see if you can put a stop to it.</p>

<p><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is due to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime next year.

But if you’re on an extended trip somewhere with no ability to charge it, you may want to try extending that life even further. Here are some tips for extending the battery life on your PlayStation Portal.</p><h2 id="h899"><a id="brightness"></a>Reduce screen brightness</h2><p>This one is a no-brainer. The brighter you keep your screen, the faster your battery will drain. If you’re in a dark room, you should be able to keep the brightness close to its lowest setting, but you may need to increase it again to see the screen in well-lit locations.</p><p>The brightness setting can be accessed on your quick settings tabs, or you can go into Settings &gt; Display and Brightness. You’ll want to do that anyway for the next trick.</p><h2 id="h900"><a id="light"></a>Turn off the light bar</h2><p>The light bar around the rim of the PlayStation Portal controller looks cool, but it can drain your battery a bit. Since the light doesn’t serve any purpose beyond proof that your device is on, it may be worth disabling altogether.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness to turn this feature off. While you’re there, you can also disable the mute button light, though I doubt that tiny light affects the battery much, if at all.</p><h2 id="h901"><a id="haptics"></a>Turn off the haptics and trigger effects</h2><p>It goes without saying that the PlayStation Portal’s haptic feedback and trigger effects are awesome, but they can also contribute to battery drain in games that frequently use it (this is also true of the PS5’s DualSense controllers). </p><p>If you head to Settings &gt; Controller, you adjust the intensity of these features. I’d recommend turning them all the way off if your goal is to save as much battery as possible, but even just reducing their intensity will help a little.</p><h2 id="h902"><a id="restmode"></a>Set a reasonable time for entering Rest Mode</h2><p>Lastly, make sure you set a reasonable time for the PlayStation Portal to enter Rest Mode, which will turn the screen off and reduce the amount of power it’s using when you’re not actively using it.</p><p>To adjust this feature, head into Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery. The best time setting would be 30 seconds, but even somewhere around 1-2 minutes should help you reduce battery drain when you’re away from the handheld. </p><p>With all of these settings changed, you should save some battery life on your PlayStation Portal. That means more time to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615"><em>Astro Bot</em>’s new Christmas level</a></span>!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It will probably feel like you’ve got all the time in the world to play games over the next week or two, and my gaming the past seven days has been rather sparse. I’ve dabbled with a little bit of Space Marine 2 and more Darktide – a great one-two punch of big hordes and Warhammer 40K co-op – and dipped a toe back into Helldivers 2 to battle the Illuminate enemies. The definitely make for a good change of pace to the bugs and bots of old, and the new city maps are pretty neat as well.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played a handful of different games, with The Thaumaturge and Behemoth in for review, and there’s “the ever-present spectre” of Phasmophobia in his life these days. He also briefly gave TemTem a go –&nbsp;“The fact that Palworld is being sued by Nintendo whilst TemTem is out here untouched whilst being the clearest rip off of Pokémon is kinda silly.”</p>
<p>The Edge of Allegoria is on <strong>Aran’s</strong> plate for a review, which he describes as “a classic Game Boy RPG but with the adult themes turned way up.” He’s also played a bit more of Marvel Rivals with Punisher and Star Lord as his go-to characters, continued on with The Witcher 3 and is just leaving White Orchard, and some more Football Manager 2024, “where I’ve had my contract at Valencia renewed for another 3 years. Probably because I’ve consistently got them into European competitions over the last few seasons and won a couple of trophies. The league eludes me though because of Real Madrid and Barcelona.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> week has mostly featured a combination of Indiana Jones and Nine Sols – “both fantastic games with very different styles and level of challenge. It’s been nice to wander around the world of Indy in between bouts of swearing at difficult boss fights – although I do seem to be faring better in Nine Sols now that I’ve unlocked a few more abilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> watched Secret Levels, which had him wanting to go back to finish off the campaign of Space Marine 2… so he did exactly that, and found it an enjoyable romp on the whole. However, most of his play time has been spent with Kingdom Come: Deliverance – “It’s a drastic change of pace compared to Space Marine 2 and one that immerses you in the life of a peasant looking to climb the ranks in medieval society. It’s a game best savoured slowly, and really isn’t for everyone. I’m hoping to roll credits ahead of the sequel’s release.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> got to check out if Alien: Rogue Incursion was the Alien: Isolation VR game that everyone’s been dreaming about since 2016, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/alien-rogue-incursion-review/">sadly found out that it isn’t</a>. I guess we hope that Alien: Isolation 2 has VR built in, now?</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Ade</strong>. He’s been playing Lego Horizon Adventures with his son, as a nice change of pace from Minecraft, and Sea of Stars in co-op with his partner. He “me” time has been completely consumed by Unicorn Overlord, though. He recommends that you play the demo and also get hopelessly addicted to it.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

It hasn’t been great for showcasing what makes Apple Arcade unique, but on the other hand, it’s hard to complain too much when it means your subscription now includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/23827123/vampire-survivors-news-announcements-updates-dlc-spinoffs"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>.

It’s sort of like a solo version of poker, only with the gameplay loop of a roguelike, which means that you’ll be collecting rare joker cards to augment your hands as you create a deck capable of turning out absolutely absurd scores. It takes a moment for it to click, but <em>Balatro</em> is particularly well suited to mobile, where you can squeeze in a few quick rounds wherever you are… or accidentally let a few hours go by while you try to complete a run.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-4f306230-c99f-45b7-93bf-108a650a43c7"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305485/smart-rings-2024-smart-rings-oura-samsung-galaxy">2024 in wearables: the year of the smart ring</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>When you say “wearables,” people generally think of smartwatches. But 2024 was a relatively quiet year for smartwatches, during which iterative updates reigned supreme. That happens in a maturing category. In exchange for polished products, you lose out on the weird frenetic energy — and sometimes ludicrously bad ideas — found when people are trying to figure out how to make a nascent gadget category work. Thankfully, it seems that energy is starting to bubble up with smart rings.</p><p>Smart rings are not new, but in 2024, there was a sort of renaissance for the category. I had an inkling that might be the case back in January, when several smart rings <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034978/smart-ring-oura-ring-evie-ring-zepp-helio-ces-2024">littered the CES show floor</a>. And then Samsung kicked the door wide open in February by announcing the long-rumored <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24205156/samsung-galaxy-ring-review-smart-ring-wearables">Galaxy Ring</a>. Samsung is a major player in the smartwatch space. For them to branch out into an entirely new wearable category? That’s <em>big</em>. It propels what’s thus far been a niche form factor into the mainstream.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305485/smart-rings-2024-smart-rings-oura-samsung-galaxy">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e6a573b8-736c-439b-b5c6-a0fe754d8c6b"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305570/steam-deck-best-games-2024-verified-playable-valve">8 great games for your Steam Deck</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>The Steam Deck gets better every year, and 2024 was no exception. It’s been my primary gaming device ever since I became a parent, and I love being able to access the humongous library of games available on Steam from wherever I want, whether it’s at home or while the baby is taking a nap at grandma’s house.

Two years ago, after Elon Musk acquired Twitter and announced his intention to ruin it forever, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw an opportunity to build a text-first social network. Now, barely 18 months after its launch, Threads has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322947/mark-zuckerberg-meta-threads-100-million-daily-active-users">more than 300 million users</a> and has been adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306591/threads-35-million-signups-november-growth">a million more every day</a>.</p><p>But Threads isn’t Twitter, and it’s never going to be. Twitter was never the biggest or most successful social network — far from it —&nbsp;but Twitter was at the absolute epicenter of culture for years. It was where politicians went to talk to their constituents and emergency services went to tell people what was happening. It was where newsmakers dropped their scoops first. It was, by a mile, the place you were most likely to have your message actually read — or even replied to! — by an A-list celebrity or your favorite brand. It was a bad business and a frequently badly run company, but Twitter was the most <em>right now </em>place on the internet.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314116/bluesky-threads-2024-social-media-networks-fediverse-twitter-x">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Which, on its face, sounds like someone fell over in the Ubisoft supply closet. But it doesn’t end there, because if you want to play, you have to have an NFT!</p><p>These take the form of Niji Warrior cards, which can be bought via the game’s website, where—like in all normal games—you then have to sign in to your “wallet.” This is where your pretend money and pictures are kept, and in this case it wants you to use something called Eden Online, Ubisoft’s own in-universe creation. (You can also sign into Coinbase or Walletconnect, but not being a crypto-bro, I have no such things.) So, because I actually <em>am</em> an incredible games journalist, I let the thing hook into my personal Gmail account. This apparently generated a wallet I could associate with the account, meaning I was able to “enter the photobooth.”</p><figure id="" data-id="a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-recommend-id="image://a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1126" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-recommend-id="image://a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1126" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here, having repeatedly been told I could “reveal” my card, I was rerouted to a website called magiceden.io, a somehow-surviving NFT “marketplace,” where I discovered that all the 10,000 free options to “mint” a card had already been taken. But I need my Niji Warrior card to be able to play! So, as I read about how this “expanding the universe of the Netflix series” was “built on the Arbitrum blockchain,” and how these “10,000 AI-generated NFTs evolve based on your performance and involvement, unlocking exclusive access to in-game assets, governance rights, and perks tied to iconic Ubisoft franchises like Assassin’s Creed, Rayman and Splinter Cell,” I wondered if it was all too late.</p><p>Only here, on a non-Ubisoft site, written in small print within a section ironically entitled “Vision,” does it reveal that the “mint” is part of an “Early Access for Niji Warrior holders,” the “full launch” happening in 2025, despite the game being listed as out all over Ubisoft’s site and store. It seems we now have to click through to the “Collection” to buy one of them from someone else. Suddenly I’m thinking of Egyptian architects for some reason.</p><figure id="" data-id="19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-recommend-id="image://19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The website telling me I can 'reveal' my ID card, with big red arrows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The website telling me I can 'reveal' my ID card, with big red arrows." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-recommend-id="image://19ee1d4b56035d5ea616e4fd0e2f634c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The website telling me I can 'reveal' my ID card, with big red arrows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I cannot emphasize enough that Ubisoft’s sites imply that you simply “Reveal” your ID card, with no mention of money, no mention that you will need to buy cryptocurrency to have any way to play the actual game.</p><p>Speaking of playing the game, I figured I’d try that instead and see what could be done without shattering my crypto virginity. The first few tries, after discovering that Ubisoft Connect had, of course, yet again forgotten all my login credentials since the last time I was forced to use it, ended in error messages.</p><figure id="" data-id="b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-recommend-id="image://b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1100" data-height="262" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message, courtesy of Ubisoft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An error message, courtesy of Ubisoft." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-recommend-id="image://b39654f4669672c172540c1fb44e977f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1100" data-height="262" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message, courtesy of Ubisoft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I was told the game was “Unable to start download (Code: 17006)“ and also “(Code: 17017).” The link to the support page told me to visit the “Live Feed Update section on Ubisoft Help,” linking to the latter. The Ubisoft Help page has no Live Feed Update section. This is really very good.</p><p>Then, as I was about to write that up, another attempt saw the game successfully download! (For some reason, it refused to acknowledge my two gaming SSDs in its list of install drives.) It was here! I clicked to launch, and here’s my favorite screenshot of the game so far:</p><figure id="" data-id="71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-recommend-id="image://71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A black screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-recommend-id="image://71c1448b25d2f148becab9251b143b24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, OK, that’s not fair.

The most expensive is (oh my actual god) 50 ETH, or $162,975.50.</p><p>Damn, I’m just those two quarters short.</p><p>Oh! And if you thought, “Well, 12 bucks, I could maybe just suck it up and take a look,” the minimum amount it appears to be possible to add to a wallet is $21!</p><p>I cannot tell you anything else about it right now, because Ubisoft is working <em>pretty</em> hard to hide what the game looks like from those not willing to shoot for the moon. The publisher has accidentally forgotten to upload any trailers to its own YouTube channel, instead opting for a hardwired version on their site...which doesn’t show any in-game footage. Like, not even a hint.</p><p>Ubisoft has also, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/ubisoft-releases-new-blood-dragon-game-with-nfts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/ubisoft-releases-new-blood-dragon-game-with-nfts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em> noticed</a></span>, not yet remembered to mention the game on its own socials, instead using an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eden Online sockpuppet account</a></span>.

And that’s what makes up life: a cyclical series of highs and lows.</p><p>Tachibana Sai was born without the ability to feel pain in his heart. He spends his days eliminating any seeds of malice that sneak up on his sister, the one person he treasures, without drawing attention to himself.</p><p>Sick of the never ending monotony he lives through, he chances upon a meeting with Benio Matsuri, a young girl whose aloof demeanor resembles that of a beautifully crafted doll.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he encounters a heart piercing sensation that of falling in love.</p><p>On the edge between day and night, in a twilight world where the dead and living mingle, stands an apartment building called Maison sans Nom, which is home to a group of boys and girls.</p><p>A ruthless boy who knows no pain in his heart. A lonely girl without any friends. A friendly girl who struggles to make connections. A prickly, ambitious girl who is keen to be of help. A boy who loves his own cute self above anything else. A mess of a woman who tries to solve everything through brute force. And a boy with a tender heart who knows no pain in his body.</p><p>This ill-assorted group of residents, hands stained with blood from battling the supernatural Maledicts, shall encounter the hearts they never knew and begin nurturing their souls.</p><p>The human heart is hut a vessel for pain.</p><p>To protect this pain akin to love… To gently break the world apart, piece by piece… Even if it means abandoning humanity. That’s why the heart is but a vessel for pain.</p><p>For life blazes brilliantly, while the heart goes around in an endless cycle.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Benio Matsuri</strong></a> (voiced by <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ka Iwami) – A girl born into the Benio Family, a powerful family of Maledict Exorcists, who is tightly bound by her family’s curse. Due to an incident in the past, causing her to close off her heart, she doesn’t speak and barely shows any emotion. Her eyes remain closed at all times, as if she wishes to isolate herself from the cruel world she lives in. Since she only moves when someone pulls her along by the hand, her demeanor evokes the image of a beautifully crafted doll. She is a Curse Bearer with the ability to give Maledicts form and use their powers freely.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Nobody</strong></a> (voiced by Manaka Iwami) – Another personality that dwells inside Benio Matsuri’s heart that appears when Matsuri is asleep. Nobody sees herself as a shield that protects Matsuri from the cruel world. She can be incredibly selfish, and her words, <a title="Genres > Action [2,386 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, and strong attitude cause her to come across as a haughty, ill-mannered girl.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tachibana Sai</strong></a> (voiced by Yumiri Hanamori) – The protagonist of the story: A ruthless boy who cannot feel pain in his heart. His younger sister, his only family, is the one person he treasures, and anyone who torments her is met with a brutal end by his hands… Yet, yearning to understand the human heart, he often interrogates his victims, even though they cannot respond. Just as he begins to seek respite from his bleak life, his unexpected encounter with Benio Matsuri causes him to experience a kind of pain akin to love in his heart.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kanbara Tatsuki</strong></a> (voiced by Shuta Morishima) – An earnest and sincere boy who was born with a body that doesn’t feel any physical pain. Despite the unjust world around him, he wishes to keep on the straight and narrow, even if no one else does. He began training at a young age under a master who claimed to be invincible in order to become… well, a certain something. He has infiltrated the Benio Family and is biding his time for the chance to free Benio Matsuri, his first love, from their curse.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tsukahara Ao</strong></a> (voiced by Hitomi Sasaki) – A seemingly cheerful and sociable resident of Maison sans Nom. She’s especially close with her friend Ando Mémé. Born as a Curse Bearer, she works as one of the Benio Family’s mercenaries and exorcists. On top of her mischievous tendencies, she wants more than anything to be a housewife. Her <a title="Genres > Cooking [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> might not be up to par now, but she’s working on it.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ando Meme</strong></a> (voiced by Hika Tsukishiro) – A surly resident of Maison sans Nom and a Curse Bearer like Ao. Despite her ambitious and hard-working nature, she tends to scare people off due to her prickly attitude. However, she is keener than anyone when it comes to helping her friends, and Ao is especially reliant on her companionship. Her goal in life is to rake in the money as a top-grade exorcist.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kirishima Tsuyu</strong></a> (voiced by Yukina Shuto) – The landlord of Maison sans Nom. Tsuyu is obsessed with his own cuteness and habitually declares himself the cutest person in the world. He enjoys teasing the other residents, and while they get annoyed with Tsuyu’s antics sometimes, they still adore him. He often earns himself a spanking from Yozora. He is also a content creator who makes full use of his looks while livestreaming as “Chuyu.” He has a preference for strong-willed people and takes a particular liking to Tatsuki in this regard. A Curse Bearer like Ao and Mémé, he possesses a mysterious power.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kandori Yozora</strong></a> (voiced by Hana Kuga) – As the only grown-up resident of Maison sans Nom, Yozora acts as the guardian of the younger residents. She appears to be a beautiful, classy lady… until she opens her mouth. With her frank and outspoken attitude, as well as her tendency to drink cheap booze, gamble on horses, and “borrow” money from the kids without ever returning it, she’s not exactly what one would consider a responsible adult. Yozora does not possess any Maledict powers, but she prides herself on being the strongest martial artist in the world.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Benio Tsui</strong></a> (voiced by Takako Tanaka) – The current head of the Benio Family and Matsuri’s younger sister. Contrary to her appearance as a young girl, she considers herself the matriarch of the family, referring to all its members as her “children,” regardless of blood relations. Inside her heart dwells three different personalities, each with their own quirks and caprices. All are cold, cruel, and ruthless by nature, although she sometimes displays a child-like innocence befitting her age.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Penguin</strong></a> (voiced by Reika Fujisawa) – A mysterious, smartly dressed penguin with the ability to understand and speak human language. However, it is painfully shy, so normally it pretends to be just a regular penguin. It works as a receptionist and bellhop at a hotel where the souls of the dead end up, so the younger residents of Maison sans Nom refer to it as “God.” It has a huge attitude for a cute little penguin and is extremely hard to please. The best way to buy its favor is with sweets and snacks.</li><li>…and others!</li></ul><p><strong>Main Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Planning / Story:</strong> Yukito Urushibara</li><li><strong>Character Design / Art:</strong> Saine</li><li><strong>Developer:</strong> Frontwing</li><li><strong>Background Music:</strong> Fuminori Matsumoto, Hitoshi Fujima (Elements Garden)</li></ul><p><strong>Theme Song</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Title:</strong> “Anata no Kioku no Naka de” (“In Your Memories”)</li><li><strong>Vocals:</strong> Mao Uesugi</li><li><strong>Lyrics:</strong> Yoshikazu Kuwashima</li><li><strong>Composition and Arrangement:</strong> Hitoshi Fujima (Elements Garden)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="【PV】漆原雪人×さいね『花束を君に贈ろう-Kinsenka-』ビジュアルノベルゲーム2025年発売" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHQekt3inMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are more amazing games coming out every week than ever before. Some of them instantly become breakout hits. Others slowly accrue cult status over months and years. Some are finally released and quickly overlooked, cherished by a small coterie of early players and completely unknown to everyone else who might have fallen in love with them. Every year we try to give a handful of the most underappreciated games a quick plug in hopes that others will give them a much-deserved first or second look. Here are some of our favorite hidden gems from 2024.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tiny-terry-turbo-trip-review-simpsons-hit-run-steam-pc-1851517168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-terry-turbo-trip-review-simpsons-hit-run-steam-pc-1851517168"><em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</em></a></span><em> </em>is for <em>Simpsons: Hit and Run</em> sickos. You’re a kid who lies to his family to get a job with a taxi company completing jobs and collecting junk to upgrade your ride. It’s colorful, funny, and has the responsive-feeling controls to match its quirky world. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p><em>Crypt Custodian</em> is a top-down Metroidvania with <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>vibes. You play a cat who’s the janitor of the afterlife. Lots of platforming and puzzling ensues. The art direction is top-notch, the music is calming, and the world is masterfully crafted for an alluring but not frustrating time exploring a gorgeous world. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>If you want something that looks like <em>Pentiment</em> but plays like a <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>-style 2D tactics game, look no farther <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/inkulinati-pc-xbox-medieval-art-manuscript-impressions-1850205499?_gl=1*1m8y9w2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDY0NjIwMy4xNTYuMC4xNzM0NjQ2MzkyLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/inkulinati-pc-xbox-medieval-art-manuscript-impressions-1850205499?_gl=1*1m8y9w2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDY0NjIwMy4xNTYuMC4xNzM0NjQ2MzkyLjYwLjAuMA..">than <em>Inkulinati</em></a></span>. The game takes place inside a medieval manuscript and features plenty of challenging strategic scenarios and goofy animal humor. It came out of Early Access this year and offers a deep and engaging package despite the small scale and straightforward ideas. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Starstruck: Hands of Time</em> feels like the sort of bonkers genre mashup we don’t really get anymore. A time-traveling rhythm game, there’s elements of <em>Katamari</em> and <em>Guitar Hero </em>with an original art style borrowing from 3D sculpture and 2D collage. It doesn’t completely deliver on its ambitions, but swings for the fences like anything can happen. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A twin-stick shooter meets <em>Zelda </em>dungeoneering sounds like putting peanut butter on pickles and tastes just as good. <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> is like playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past</em> as Star Fox. You explore a top-down map to unlock new paths and upgrades and take on bosses with punchy shooting that controls like a classic arcade game. It’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765">just damned brilliant</a></span>.” — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>I was turned onto Mask Quest by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em>’s Edwin Evans-Thirlwell</a></span>. It’s a precision platformer about controlling your breath while navigating a modern city and all of its contemporary socio-political hazards. It’s short, thoughtful, and brutal. “The cleverness of the game’s level design is as double-edged as the humor,” writes Evans-Thirlwell. ”It gracefully weaponizes and politicizes the casual sadism of any game that defines itself as a series of goals and punishments.” — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>What if<em> Hotline Miami </em>was more like <em>Silent Hill</em>? Enter <em>Conscript</em>, a WWI top-down horror stealth game about smashing enemy soldiers’ heads in while trying to escape the trenches. It’s slow, plodding, and at times tortuous. It’s all beautifully and hauntingly presented. It lures you into a sense of tedious exhaustion and then—BANG—you’re dead. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A cozy sandbox builder where you make shops and homes by the water, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing <em>Summerhouse</em></a></span> is like inhabiting a postcard from a long-lost friend. It’s reminiscent of what <em>Kingdom</em> did for tower defense strategy games, imposing 2D pixel art constraints to bring the virtues into sharper relief. It’s chill, adorable, and breathtaking. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Dungeons of Dreadrock</em> was a sleeper hit in 2022 that now frequently appears in “best of” lists, a fantastically smart puzzle game in which you descended 100 floors of a tower to save your brother from a grisly sacrifice. Its sequel repeats the formula, but this time from a second perspective, a character you likely forgot meeting in the first game, going through her own 100-story challenge. And the result is an even smarter set of excellent puzzles and lovely dialogue that nimbly sets up the third and final part of the trilogy. — John Walker </p></div><div><p>If <em>Minit </em>were a slide puzzle game, it would look like <em>Slider</em>. You move pieces of the world around to rearrange, rebuild, and progress through it. It can be incredibly simple and devastatingly hard at the same time. It’s free and no one has an excuse not to give it a try. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Master Key</em> is another riff on<em> Zelda</em>. This one is is as monochromatic and stripped down as it gets, focusing on the items you collect and the obstacles they help you to overcome. It shares DNA with modern indie gems like <em>Animal Well</em> and <em>Tunic</em>, though it’s more rough around the edges. Do yourself a favor and play it on easy. —Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Too many games are mawkish, and not enough games are honestly sad. <em>The Night Is Grey</em>, with its wonderfully solemn and beautiful story, defies this trend. This point-and-click adventure is a tangle of haunted pasts, and one that is self-aware enough to avoid the traditionally silly puzzles of the genre, even coldly chastising the player when one such traditional, silly solution is tried. It’s a game about a man trying to protect a small child, but it rebels against the tropes of that formula in a way that’ll gut-punch you hard. — John Walker </p></div><div><p><em>Dread Delusion</em> is a <em>Morrowind</em>-inspired low-poly RPG that finally hit 1.0 this year and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896">didn’t disappoint</a></span>. What it lacks in deep first-person combat, it makes up for with an incredible-looking world to explore and a mythical atmosphere suffused with whimsy and horror. The exploration, writing, and story deliver an experience unlike any other. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>The Crimson Diamond</em> looks and plays like something from 1988, an adventure game with gorgeous, vibrant EGA graphics and a text parser interface. Yes, that means you must actually type things like “look” and “open door,” a thought which may have some potential players rolling their eyes, but it’s actually great! The game deftly pulls you into its early-20th-century murder mystery with its plucky heroine and colorful cast of suspects. The text parser, meanwhile, lets you engage with those suspects and the environment in delightful and engaging ways that, despite being nods to games from nearly 40 years ago, feel fresh and invigorating, and make me more optimistic about the state of the adventure game genre today. I’ll allow myself a pun here and just end by saying that this game is a real gem. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>If you like reading random internet pages about made-up things and then leveraging your new expertise in creepy, intimate scenarios with complete strangers, <em>Home Safety Hotline</em> is the game for you. It’s a <em>Papers, Please</em>-like that combines soul crushing call center work with a beautiful Windows 97 aesthetic and a Cryptid-infused riff on <em>Night Trap</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p> There are plenty of city builders on Steam, but not many (if any) are all about creating bustling towns on the side of a giant mountain. <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em>, out in Early Access, asks you to develop and grow thriving cities using tiny cliffs as you and your crew climb up a mountain. The game is a bit tricky at times, but at least the view is lovely up there. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-52-release-date" rel="nofollow">November's Version 5.2</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-51-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous month's Version 5.1</a>, Version 5.3 will arrive on January 1st. That's right: New Year's Day itself. It'll continue the storyline of Natlan's Archon Quest, in which the Traveler is about to awaken their Pyro power and the six heroes of Natlan have united.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a HoYoverse game update without some new characters to enjoy, and Version 5.3 is bringing not one, but two 5-star characters for you to add to your roster.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.3-new-characters.jpg?itok=2NDpnDAb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.3-new-characters.jpg?itok=WJRn_3vL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.3 brings two new 5-star characters for your roster.</figcaption></figure><p>Your first new 5-star character is the Pyro claymore user Mavuika, who comes with two distinct fighting styles. She can either take enemies on with the aforementioned claymore or use her Flamestrider to crush enemies. Said Flamestrider can also be used to traverse the world.</p>

<p>The second 5-star character joining&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>in Version 5.3 is Citlali, also known as Granny Itztli. She's a Cryo-using catalyst wielder who can deploy shields and deal powerful area-of-effect damage. Both characters are joined by the intriguing-sounding multi-elemental Liyue fighter Lan Yan, who debuts in the second half of the update.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect reruns of existing characters in case you missed the chance to add them to your team. Characters returning as part of this update include Arlecchino, Clorinde, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-ganyu-guide-builds-skills" rel="nofollow">Ganyu</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-shenhe-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Shenhe</a>.</p>




<p>Plenty of other goodies are coming as part of Version 5.3 as well, including the return of the Lantern Rite event, the popular rhythm minigame becoming a permanent fixture, and optimizations to the character level up screen to make it a little easier to understand and parse.</p>

<p>As per usual, HoYoverse is also giving away some&nbsp;<em>Genshin&nbsp;</em>goodies for those who are looking to build their roster. Here are this update's codes!</p>

            <p>Two men on the board of directors for Epic Games have stepped down from their positions after the US Department of Justice investigated the board under antitrust laws. The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic's board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you're not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they're already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company. Naughty Tencent! Naughty Epic! And, yes, naughty Riot Games!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The DoJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint">announced the resignations in a press release</a>, saying they're the result of an investigation into potential antitrust violations. The gist is: since Tencent are massive and own Riot Games outright, they aren't allowed to have boardroom sway over Epic Games, which technically remains their competitor in the video games industry. It'd be like letting a big suitwearer at Pepsi go to all the important meetings at Coca-cola. This is all law under the Clayton Act, which "prohibits directors and officers from serving simultaneously on the boards of competitors, subject to limited exceptions."</p>
<p>The two directors who've stepped down are Ben Feder and David Wallerstein, according to an <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/tencent-relinquishes-epic-games-board-seats-on-antitrust-concern?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=TENW&amp;utm_campaign=00000193-dd05-d3f6-a1d7-dd27d5ec0004">email Bloomberg got</a> from Epic Games confirming the resignations. Ben Feder's job title at Tencent for years was the President of International Partnerships, and he was CEO of Take-Two Interactive before that, a big Tencent publisher. Wallerstein, meanwhile, was Senior Executive Vice President at Tencent until January this year, and is currently employed as a "senior advisor". Neither of them should have been on the board at Epic - at least that's what is implied by the DoJ's investigations. And they have now stepped down, it seems, to avoid Tencent and Epic any further heat.</p>
<p>"No company or individual has admitted to liability in connection with this investigation," say the DoJ with characteristic legal nous. They also add that Tencent has agreed to amend its shareholder agreement with Epic so that it can't appoint directors to the Epic board in future. No more boardroom naughtiness, corpoboys and corpogirls! </p><p>Antitrust laws exist to prevent huge companies from establishing monopolies and becoming even more powerful than they often already are. In video games, we've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judge-rules-part-of-antitrust-suit-against-valve-can-continue">Valve hit with an antitrust lawsuit</a> in the past. And Microsoft was scrutinised with similar concerns by both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/us-ftc-considering-antitrust-lawsuit-against-microsoft-over-activision-blizzard-deal-sources-claim">the United States</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-eu-are-slapping-microsoft-with-an-antitrust-warning-over-their-activision-blizzard-buyout">the European Union</a> when it made its (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">ultimately successful</a>) move to buy Activision Blizzard.
