            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647481/haste-broken-worlds-game-review-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> takes the relaxing loop of sliding down and leaping off hills from iOS classic <em>Tiny Wings</em> and turns it into a thrilling, high-speed, and 3D roguelike.</p><p>In <em>Haste</em>, you play as Zoe, a girl who typically delivers letters but has found herself mysteriously transported to the new worlds you run through. When I say run, I mean it: Zoe <em>cannons</em> through the game.</p><p>Levels are filled with rolling hills, and your goal is to leap off the upslopes and land on the downslopes. The better your landings, the more you’ll increase your speed and build a boost meter that can be used for things like a burst forward or a grappling hook.</p><p>You’re incentivized to keep your speed up. The faster you complete a level, the higher grade you’ll get; higher grades give you better bonuses of things like “sparks,” which you can use to buy items.</p><p>Throughout the vibrant, procedurally generated levels, you’ll also have to avoid obstacles like rocks, giant <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarlacc">Sarlacc-like pits</a>, and machines that shoot lasers and bullets at you. If you crash into an object, you’ll lose health and slow down. If you’re too slow, a crackling, damaging energy will sneak up behind you. If you run out of health, you’ll lose a life. Lose all your lives, and your run will end. </p><p>There are some familiar roguelike mechanics in <em>Haste</em>, like a currency you can spend between runs to permanently improve things like your health and boost meters. During runs, you’ll also pick each stage on a map. <em>Haste</em> has a great map feature that lets you pick some or all of your route in advance so that you can play a series of levels without interruption. It really helps with the momentum.</p><p>When things are going well, it’s easy to reach an amazing flow state where you’re leaping from hills at breakneck speed, timing your landings and boosts, dodging obstacles in your path, and racing to the end of every level as fast as you can.</p><p>But at the end of each zone (technically a “shard”), there’s a large boss — like a giant flying snake — and they were often total buzzkills. The boss levels force you to run through more open-ended zones instead of just blasting forward, and the game just isn’t as fun and feels tougher in the open environments. Thankfully, you can change the game’s difficulty level.</p><p>The game’s storytelling messes up the flow, too. You’ll meet a bunch of characters, and while their personalities are fun and their character portraits are illustrated well, they often show up in lengthy, forced conversations between levels. For a game called <em>Haste</em>, there are a lot of long chats!</p><p>Those quibbles only detracted a little from how much I enjoyed <em>Haste</em>. At its best, <em>Haste</em> keeps you on the edge of your seat as you leap up and down from hills and careen through worlds. But when the game changes pace, it can be frustrating. I just want to go fast. </p><p><sub>Haste: Broken Worlds</sub><em><sub> is now available on PC.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/651376/lucas-pope-papers-please-gdc-2025-pioneer-award<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Lucas Pope, the solo creator of games like <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em>, received the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250219539980/en/2025-Game-Developers-Choice-Awards-Honors-Iconic-WriterDirector-Sam-Lake-With-Lifetime-Achievement-Award-and-Innovative-Designer-Lucas-Pope-With-Pioneer-Award">Pioneer Award</a> from the annual Game Developers Choice Awards this year. It’s a major achievement that puts him in a league with industry giants like Gabe Newell, Yu Suzuki, and Roberta Williams.</p><p>“Now that I’m an official pioneer, I have some requests,” he said in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kEXe913VjSs?feature=shared&amp;t=10801">brief acceptance speech</a>. “World peace, obviously. But for this crowd, I’d be happy if you kept making the kinds of unique off-beat, experimental, creative, and especially personal games that I love.”</p><p>It was similar to something Pope had said to me earlier — especially the personal part. I had asked him what advice he might have for developers just starting out. “Make something personal, make it small, release on [Itch.io]. Try to find the people who like the same things you do and then make the things you enjoy.”</p><div><p>“I want this kind of game. I like looking at documents.”</p></div><p>Games, for him, have always been about “making something that I want to play,” Pope said. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/14/4329676/papers-please-a-game-about-an-immigration-inspector"><em>Papers, Please</em></a>, where you have to make tough decisions while working as an immigration inspector in a fictional country, “it was, ‘I want this kind of game. I like looking at documents.’ Nobody else really likes that, was my thinking. And then I made it and I found out, actually, lots of people like the same things I do.”</p><p>That experience gave him the confidence to follow a similar path for his next game. “I’m just going to try that again. I’m going to make a game that doesn’t exist, that I wish I had and that I could play, and I’ll make that. And just based on faith, I’m going to hope that other people also like it,” he said. “If there’s something that you’re passionate about, then make a game about it.”</p><p>That game turned out to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17993710/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review-lucas-pope-pc-mac"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a>, where you’re an insurance inspector investigating deaths and mysteries on the namesake ship. Pope’s latest title is <a href="https://play.date/games/mars-after-midnight/"><em>Mars After Midnight</em></a>, a game for the Playdate about screening aliens at a fictional Martian support center.</p><p>It’s much sillier than <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Obra Dinn</em>; one scenario in <em>Mars</em> asks you to only admit aliens that fart. In <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/mars-after-midnight/devlog/261758/mars-after-midnight">a blog post</a> about the game, Pope described it as “something my kids might like,” and he told me that while the kids know about <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Obra Dinn</em>, they’re too young to play them because they’re M-rated. “That’s kind of why I wanted to make <em>Mars</em>. I wanted a game where they could just full-on play it and enjoy it.”</p><p>Pope said they played <em>Mars</em> “dozens of times” and offered suggestions for some of the sessions in the game. As kids, they don’t have a lot of preconceived notions, he said, so while some of their ideas might have been “a little ridiculous,” he could see “the core of a really cool thing that I could munge it a little bit and get it in there.” He added, “I think about games a certain way, but the kids have no framing like that. So having kids does help me see how they play games.”</p><p>As for what Pope wants to explore next? “When I could reflect on <em>Obra Dinn</em> and <em>Papers, Please</em>, I kind of realized [that] maybe I should be going back to 2D,” he said, noting that <em>Mars</em> is “more or less” a 2D game, too. From a production and creativity standpoint, “it’s nice to work in 2D,” he said. “But as far as actual topics and mechanics and things like that, I’m working on a few things. Nothing that is ready for announcement, unfortunately.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whilst the developer stopped short of confirming a firm release date - "summer" (Q3) is the closest we have right now - it did reveal the shooter would also be coming to Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store, too.</p>
<p>To celebrate, here's a brand new cinematic trailer that debuted at the Galaxies Showcase:</p>

<p>Ready or Not sees you visit Los Sueños, where a surge of crime across the greater Los Sueños metropolitan area has severely depleted resources, threatening to "overwhelm the department's ability to maintain order". In response to the growing threats facing residents, LSPD is mobilising its SWAT teams to respond to high-threat scenarios, including active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and high-risk hostage situations.</p>
<p>Ready or Not features "immersive tactical gameplay, full flexibility of approach, and authentic equipment that SWAT teams utilise in the field". You can expect 20 single-player or online co-op missions to play with up to four pals, as well as two new missions as part of the Stories from Los Sueños free DLC update.</p>
<p>You'll also get two DLCs that introduce six additional levels, and, in Dark Waters DLC, the UH-60 support helicopter. There are also "dozens of options to customise a player’s entire SWAT team" including armour, weapons, and apparel.</p>
<p>PC players will have access to the new missions in a free update day-and-date with console launch.</p>
<p>Pre-orderers will also secure the M32A1 grenade launcher, MK-V pistol, 590M shotgun, with players who already have the game on PC also getting the freebies. The game will cost £45 ($50 / €50) whether you buy the base game or the Day One Edition, which includes the pre-order items. There's also a £60 ($70 / €70) Deluxe Edition that includes the base game with three DLC packs - Home Invasion, Dark Waters, and an unannounced one - plus the pre-order goodies also bundled in.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after comments suggested it would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access on 17th December, but in a statement on Twitter shortly afterwards, Void Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>. Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna".</p>

		<p>Earlier this week, EA announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-coming-to-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">Star Wars Zero Company</a> which is in development with BitReactor and Respawn on board. The initial reveal just told us that we would get more news this weekend, and that moment has arrived with the game’s first trailer along with the first details. What it confirms is that Star Wars Zero Company will be a turn based tactics game, looking a bit like XCOM, set during the final stages of The Clone Wars.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story follows Hawks, a former Republic Officer, and his group known as Zero Company. All of the Zero Company members are essentially mercenaries for hire from across the galaxy, with each of them having their own skills. You have a droid that will be to able to hack systems, a Jedi that has Force abilities, a Mandalorian armed with all the gadgets, a Clone Trooper, and what looks like some kind of assassin. They are not the best of friends and will have their own differences to work out between themselves. We get a brief look of gameplay in the reveal trailer and that shows the turn based tactical element of Star Wars Zero Company, from positioning your characters to using their abilities in the most efficient way to take out enemies. When not in a fight, Hawks and Zero Company will set up a base of operations to gather intelligence from across the galaxy using informants who will point them to targets.</p>
<p>“Our vision for Star WarsZero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay,” said Greg Foertsch, CEO and Creative Director at Bit Reactor. “It’s our aim to deliver a game with an original&nbsp;<i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i>story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.”</p>
<p>“At Lucasfilm Games, we’re huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time,” said Douglas Reilly, GM &amp; VP, Lucasfilm Games. “The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we’re confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to&nbsp;Star Wars.”</p>

<p>Star Wars Zero Company is set to released in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC. The game is available to wishlist now.</p>

This new tale&nbsp;sees Kay Vess and Nix team up with pirate Hondo Ohnaka (who fans may remember from the <em>Clone Wars</em> animated show) to plunder the riches of the Khepi Tomb.</p>

<p>However, they’ll have to take on Stinger Tash and her Rokana Raiders. Kay also meets the Miyuki Trade League, who tasks Kay with smuggling goods in exchange for new rewards for the <em>Trailblazer</em>. To access the DLC, players will need to have completed the main story campaign. Check out the trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c27kWaF7umo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>A Pirate’s Bay will be automatically available to Season Pass owners and can be purchased standalone. Ubisoft has not listed the à la carte price for the DLC, but the previous story expansion, Wild Card, cost $14.99, so we imagine this is similarly priced. Additionally, a title update arriving alongside A Pirate’s Bay will give all players free cosmetic items inspired by the Disney Plus series <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em>. You can find these items in the delivery crate inside the <em>Trailblazer</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, a free three-hour demo of the game is now available. We also learned that the Switch 2 version of Star Wars Outlaws launches on September 4.&nbsp;</p>

Pre-orders were initially scheduled for April 9 before Nintendo <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">delayed this</a> due to the changing economic environment caused by the United States' tariffs.

            <p>EA has finally given us our first look at its upcoming Star Wars strategy game, Star Wars: Zero Company.</p>
<p>The single-player turn-based tactics game by Bit Reactor and Respawn was confirmed back in 2022. It's described as a "gritty and authentic original story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars".</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>

<p>You play as Hawks, a customisable former Republic officer, and will command an elite squad of "cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars". As an unconventional outfit of professionals for hire hailing from across the galaxy, Zero Company must set aside their differences to overcome nearly impossible odds and take on an emerging threat that will consume the galaxy if left unchecked.</p>
<p>The campaign includes tactical operations and investigations "across the galaxy", whilst between missions, you will develop a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of Zero Company’s adversaries. You'll be able to create and customise your squad of recruited operators while "getting to know a cast of newly authored Star Wars characters".</p>
<p>"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," said Greg Foertsch, CEO and creative director at Bit Reactor.</p>
<p>"It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p>
<p>As yet there's no release date, but EA advises it's shooting for a 2026 release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, Star Wars: Zero Company is a collaboration between EA's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> and developer Bit Reactor, a studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-veterans-form-new-studio-bit-reactor-to-focus-on-turn-based-strategy">founded in 2022 by veterans of XCOM and Civilization developer Firaxis Games</a>. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-three-new-star-wars-games-in-development-at-respawn">one of three new Star Wars titles announced by EA at the time</a>, the others being a follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, which released in 2023 - and a Star Wars first-person shooter which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">has since been cancelled</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/bit-reactors-tactical-star-wars-game-star-wars-zero-company-will-be-revealed-this-saturday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to fans earlier this week, the upcoming turn-based tactics game STAR WARS Zero Company was revealed today during the Star Wars Celebration Japan event.</p>
<p>This is the game that Bit Reactor has been working on alongside Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-2-officially-announced-alongside-two-new-star-wars-projects-from-respawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> alongside Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in early 2022. Bit Reactor was founded by former XCOM veterans led by Greg Foerstch, so it's no surprise that the game follows that design inspiration. Foerstch, CEO and Creative Director of the Maryland-based developer, said in a statement:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Our vision for STAR WARS Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay. It’s our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.</em></p>
<p>Douglas Reilly, GM &amp; VP at Lucasfilm Games, added:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>At Lucasfilm Games, we’re huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time. The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we’re confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to Star Wars.</em></p>
<p>In this game, players will step into the shoes of Hawks, a former Republic officer who must lead an elite squad of cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars. An unconventional team of hired guns from across the galaxy, the Zero Company must put aside their differences to overcome nearly impossible odds and take on an emerging threat that might consume the galaxy if left unchecked.</p>
<p>The campaign of STAR WARS Zero Company will task players with performing tactical operations and investigations across the galaxy. Between missions, they will establish a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of their enemies. Just as you'd expect in an XCOM-like title, there will be the freedom to create and customize your own squad of recruited operatives while meeting a cast of newly created Star Wars characters.</p>
<p>The main character's appearance and combat class can be fully customized, while recruited operatives can be personalized in appearance, load-outs, and abilities from a range of original Star Wars character classes and species, including Clone Troopers, Astromechs, and even a Jedi. In the field, the team will form bonds with each other to unlock powerful combat synergies that can turn the tide of battle. The developers promise high-stakes encounters that will require proper strategy to be overcome.</p>

<p>STAR WARS Zero Company is set to launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Wishlisting is already available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2075800/STAR_WARS_Zero_Company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

		<p>I hope you’re all well stocked up in your fridges and cupboards with enough hot cross buns, chocolate eggs and all the other essentials for the long weekend. It’s always a touch confusing trying to figure out if Easter will mean that everything’s completely shutting down or just on Sunday hours… so why risk it? At least today is a regular day where you can grab any extra bits and bobs. After all, using as much of the free time as possible to play games is hard work and you need some snacks!</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-zero-company/" data-ref-id="5000-672878">Star Wars: Zero Company</a> will feature a varied roster of characters as part of the main squad, including a Mandalorian, Jedi Padawan, and an astromech droid--but for the main protagonist of Hawks, players will be free to customize that operative. Speaking to GameSpot, Bit Reactor creative director Greg Foertsch revealed that players will have a selection of options to help fine-tune the look of Hawks, ranging from gender and voice through to their species in the Star Wars galaxy.</p><p>"You can live through that character however you want," Foertsch said. "If you want to change the species, you can. If you want to change their voice, you can."</p><p>The driving theme behind Hawks will be their origin story as a former Republic officer and how they're forced to assemble a motley crew to take on a dangerous adversary while the Clone Wars rage on in the background. While Hawks has been designed to have just enough of a personality for players to imprint themselves on, Zero Company's roster of "authored characters" will all have their own distinct backstories and personalities that players will discover as they progress through the game. One of these allies is Tell, a Jedi Padawan on a quest to finish her fallen master's final mission, and there'll also be some friction between the rest of the crew due to natural rivalries and animosity.</p><p>Interestingly, players will be able to strengthen the bonds between these operatives, resulting in powerful synergy skills that can help turn the tide of battle. "With the authored characters, I think something that the team at Bit Reactor has done a really great job of is sort of weaving in the different perspectives that you would expect them to have on the galaxy and the Clone Wars, with this specific story and this adversary that your company is going up against," LucasFilm Games creative executive Kelsey Sharpe added.</p><p>"It's like a little bit of intrigue--the more you know about Star Wars--but also if you don't know Star Wars, just from watching that trailer you kind of see how they bounce off of each other and you go, 'Oh, this isn't the fun times gang that I thought they were,' right?"</p><p>For more on Star Wars: Zero Company, you can check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-reveal-trailer-teases-stealthy-tactics-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away/1100-6530939/" data-ref-id="1100-6530939">reveal trailer from Star Wars Celebration Japan</a> and read up on how the developers behind it are looking to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-will-be-an-approachable-tactics-game-but-hardcore-fans-will-be-catered-to/1100-6530935/" data-ref-id="1100-6530935">create an approachable entry in the tactics genre</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After being teased earlier this week, Star Wars: Zero Company was officially revealed at Star Wars Celebration Japan on Saturday. The cinematic trailer for the game introduced the primary cast of Zero Company: a group of covert specialists who players will control in this turn-based tactics game. Developed by Bit Reactor in collaboration with Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games, Star Wars: Zero Company will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcxnRaZ6slU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Set during the twilight of the Clone Wars, players will step into the shoes of former Republic officer Hawks, who leads a motley crew of specialists behind enemy lines. Some of the characters here include a Clonetrooper, a Jedi Knight, and a Mandalorian, all of whom are original characters created for the game. Bit Reactor says that players will embark on a campaign of tactical operations and investigations in Zero Company, and between missions, they can develop a base of operations and gather intelligence through their network of informants.</p><p dir="ltr">Customization appears to be a big part of the game, as not only can the appearance and combat class of the protagonist Hawks be altered, but recruited operatives can also be personalized from a wide range of original Star Wars character classes and species. For the Zero Company cast whom Hawks commands, Bit Reactor refers to these allies as "Authored Characters" who players can interact and forge strong bonds with. Doing this will in turn unlock combat synergies that can turn the tide of battle.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay-design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," Bit Reactor creative director Greg Foertsch said in a press statement.

On April 14, EA confirmed the game’s title, <em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>, and promised to show more during a panel at Star Wars Celebration in Japan. And that’s exactly what happened. I love it when a plan comes together.</p><p><em>Star Wars Zero Company</em> is launching in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Here’s the first official announcement and gameplay trailer from Star Wars Celebration 2025.</p><p>According to the devs at Respawn and Bit Reactor, <em>Zero Company</em> features an original story set during the Clone Wars. Lucasfilm says this era is a perfect time for <em>Zero Company</em> because this is a rare time in the universe where both sides of the war were equally massive and powerful. </p><p>In a trailer we see what appears to be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-collapse-of-viscerals-ambitious-star-wars-game-1819916152&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-collapse-of-viscerals-ambitious-star-wars-game-1819916152">ragtag</a></span> group of soldiers and heroes, complete with a Jedi, smuggler, clone trooper, droid, and Mandalorian warrior.

They are a disgraced former Republic officer. Players can change Hawks’ name, gender, and species. </p><p>The group Hawks leads is an elite but messy merc group that is willing to get their hands dirty. Bit Reactor wants players to experience a cinematic and easy-to-hop into strategy game that can appeal to all sorts of fans. If you want the game to be harder, you can play with permadeath and limited saves. </p><figure id="" data-id="d43dea372f170d3b9933b59fa525330c" data-recommend-id="image://d43dea372f170d3b9933b59fa525330c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d43dea372f170d3b9933b59fa525330c" data-recommend-id="image://d43dea372f170d3b9933b59fa525330c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Zero Company </em>will feature a mix of custom characters and original characters created by Bit Reactor for the game.

Another character is an<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Umbaran&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Umbaran" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Umbaran sniper</a></span> who doesn’t like the Republic, but is willing to work alongside the group to beat back a “shadowy” enemy. The Jedi of the group is a Padawan. She is wanting to finish her fallen master’s mission. You’ll also be able to run a full squad of Astromech droids. Not all of these characters will get along, but Bit Reactor says that as they work together more they’ll become better at working together. </p><p>Between missions players will return to “The Den” a grimy HQ that is set in a location previously seen in <em>Rogue One.</em> In this HQ players can also customize characters and recruit new soldiers for <em>Zero Company. </em>Also in the HQ is a big holomap that players use to track battles and start new missions. Lucasfilm claims that the map in <em>Zero Company</em> is the biggest map see in a <em>Star Wars</em> video game. Vandor from <em>Solo </em>and Anaxes from <em>Bad Batch</em> are set to appear in the game. </p><p>Here are some screenshots from the event:</p><figure id="" data-id="c9af6834ae63b5f4859296c9c7dd45cc" data-recommend-id="image://c9af6834ae63b5f4859296c9c7dd45cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c9af6834ae63b5f4859296c9c7dd45cc" data-recommend-id="image://c9af6834ae63b5f4859296c9c7dd45cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="496fd416805860151c7755a011f3a59b" data-recommend-id="image://496fd416805860151c7755a011f3a59b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="496fd416805860151c7755a011f3a59b" data-recommend-id="image://496fd416805860151c7755a011f3a59b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="9eec91ba0f7e98ff86b1fac7b6c5a071" data-recommend-id="image://9eec91ba0f7e98ff86b1fac7b6c5a071" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9eec91ba0f7e98ff86b1fac7b6c5a071" data-recommend-id="image://9eec91ba0f7e98ff86b1fac7b6c5a071" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="58459d23a23e0117e174d1daf0513e3a" data-recommend-id="image://58459d23a23e0117e174d1daf0513e3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="58459d23a23e0117e174d1daf0513e3a" data-recommend-id="image://58459d23a23e0117e174d1daf0513e3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan have reunited once again, and the internet can’t get enough! Their newest project, “Sinners,” is a genre-fluid horror-thriller that blends together themes of religion, freedom, music, mysticism, and vampires— but with that unmistakable Coogler-edge. </p><p>In the film, Jordan stars as identical twin brothers who returns home in the South to start a new business. But their hopes at making it big in the small town gets derailed when evil forces drop in and threaten to ruin their dreams and the dreams for the community. It’s a true experience of a film from start to finish and early chatter from folks online  are already heralding it as both Coogler and Jordan’s best work to date.</p><p>In fact, the movie has taken over so much that famous folks like Snoop Dogg and Gabrielle Union can’t help but add their two cents. So in honor of the movie and all the discourse taking place, we’ve rounded up some of the best, funniest, and most fired-up reactions to “Sinners” that perfectly capture the moment—and the budding movement— it’s sparking.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Friday, April 18</em></p></div></div><div><p>As one of the first people to see the film, legendary director Spike Lee gave a massive cosign to Coogler’s latest project. He described it in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DG6zwiNyK6s/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG6zwiNyK6s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an Instagram post</a></span> as “the greatest experience of watching a film in years.”</p><p>“His Magnificent Artistry As A Storyteller Iz On A Annudder” Level. And Y’now Brother MICHAEL B. JORDAN Did His ‘THANG,THANG’ ,Da Performances, Cinematography,Production Design,Costume Design,Original Score,Songs,Visual Effects Are DOPE And What Else Ya Want?” Lee wrote in part.</p><p>He later added that Coogler “tapped into our ancestors” with this project. Talk about an accolade!</p></div><div><p>NBA superstar LeBron James and his wife Savannah were also among some the first people to watch “Sinners” before its opening weekend.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/KingJames/status/1912894260703080608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1912894260703080608%7Ctwgr%5Ea6586979726ed02ec89c2fb2dd0bce5fc812d8f0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1912894260703080608&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/KingJames/status/1912894260703080608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1912894260703080608%7Ctwgr%5Ea6586979726ed02ec89c2fb2dd0bce5fc812d8f0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1912894260703080608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post to Instagram and X,</a></span> James wrote:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>My brothers Ryan Coogler and Michael B.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Greater Than Games is shutting down. The tabletop publisher is reducing its staff and suspending all of its ongoing projects in response to the global economic volatility introduced by the US trade tariffs.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.greaterthangames.com/blogs/news/greater-than-games-team-reduced-in-response-to-tariff-crisis" rel="nofollow">official post</a>, Greater Than Games announced that it would be scaling down its production of tabletop board games. The post is just three paragraphs, but is direct and succinct. Staff will be reduced and all new projects the studio was working on have been suspended. The reason for this scaling back is the trade crisis happening internationally caused by the US' trade tariffs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greater-than-games-sentinels-of-the-multiverse-box-art.jpg?itok=cVWXenpO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greater-than-games-sentinels-of-the-multiverse-box-art.jpg?itok=3roHNeUn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This closure is sad, but expected. As the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Manufacturers Association</a> alluded to in their official statement opposing the tariffs, since the vast majority of board game development happens overseas, a lot of smaller tabletop studios may need to scale back production or shut down all together. Not every tabletop studio, even major ones like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hasbro</a>, can justify a 145% price increase (at the time of writing).</p>

<p>Greater Than Games' post continues by stating their web store will remain operational. They will continue to sell product they have while supplies last. As for any pre-orders or fulfilled crowdfunding projects, they will be making an announcement addressing those projects at a later date.</p>

<p>Lastly, the post confirms that Greater Than Games' parent company, Flat River Group, will continue to support retail and distribution partners both through communication and fulfillment. Considering Flat River Group helps fulfill multiple studios in the tabletop industry, this is some peace of mine for ardent consumers.</p>

<p>Greater Than Games is most well known for <em>Sentinels of the Multiverse</em>, a comic book superhero co-op card game. This award-winning card game debuted in 2011 and has spawned countless expansions, a Definitive Edition rerelease, a series of comics, and an official TTRPG adaptation.</p>
